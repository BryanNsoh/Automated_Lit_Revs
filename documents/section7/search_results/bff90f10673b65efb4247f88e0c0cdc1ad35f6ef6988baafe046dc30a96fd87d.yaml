    in India 1. Introduction Modern day farming demands increased production of food
    to accommodate the large global population. Towards this goal, new technologies
    and solutions (Chen et al., 2015, Misra et al., 2015, Goumopoulos et al., 2014,
    Amaral et al., 2014, Ngo et al., 2014, Ullah et al., 2014, Misra et al., 2014,
    Qu et al., 2014, Misra et al., 2013, Riquelme et al., 2009, Garcia-Sanchez et
    al., 2011, Camilli et al., 2007) are being applied in this domain to provide an
    optimal alternative to gather and process information (Behzadan et al., 2014,
    Dhurandher et al., 2014) to enhance productivity. Moreover, the alarming climate
    change and scarcity of water (Postel, 1999, Bouwer, 2000, Saleth and Dinar, 2000,
    Jury and, 2007, Falloon and Betts, 2010, Mueller et al., 2012) demand new and
    improved methods for modern agricultural fields. Consequently, the need for automation
    and intelligent decision making is becoming more important to accomplish this
    mission (ur Rehman et al., 2014, Suprem et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2006, Hart
    and Martinez, 2006). In this regard, technologies such as ubiquitous computing
    (Burrell et al., 2004), wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks (Diallo et al., 2015,
    Srbinovska et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2013, Karim et al., 2013, Zhang et al.,
    2013, Krishna et al., 2012, Zhang and Zhang, 2012, Misra et al., 2011, Mirabella
    and Brischetto, 2011, Lloret et al., 2011, Garcia et al., 2010, Bri et al., 2009,
    Lloret et al., 2009, Lin et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2006), Radio Frequency Identifier
    (RFID) (Ruiz-Garcia and Lunadei, 2011), cloud computing (Ojha et al., 2014, Misra
    et al., 2014, Cho et al., 2012), Internet of Things (IoT) (Atzori et al., 2010,
    Gubbi et al., 2013), satellite monitoring (Moghaddam et al., 2010), remote sensing
    (Bastiaanssen et al., 2000, Morais et al., 2008, Ye et al., 2013), context-aware
    computing (Moghaddam et al., 2010) are becoming increasingly popular. 1.1. Motivation
    Among all these technologies, the agriculture domain is mostly explored concerning
    the application of WSNs in improving the traditional methods of farming (ur Rehman
    et al., 2014, Zhao et al., 2013, Wang et al., 2006, Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz
    et al., 2002b, Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004, Yick et al., 2008, Ruiz-Garcia et
    al., 2009). The Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) technology has enabled
    the creation of small and cheap sensors. The ubiquitous nature of operation, together
    with self-organized small sized nodes, scalable and cost-effective technology,
    enables the WSNs as a potential tool towards the goal of automation in agriculture.
    In this regard, precision agriculture (Chen et al., 2015, Cambra et al., 2015,
    Barcelo-Ordinas et al., 2013, Baseca et al., 2013, Díaz et al., 2011, López et
    al., 2011, Park et al., 2011, Matese et al., 2009), automated irrigation scheduling
    (Lichtenberg et al., 2015, Reche et al., 2015, Greenwood et al., 2010, Gutiérrez
    et al., 2014, Moghaddam et al., 2010), optimization of plant growth (Hwang et
    al., 2010), farmland monitoring (Corke et al., 2010, Voulodimos et al., 2010),
    greenhouse gases monitoring (Malaver et al., 2015, Yang et al., 2013, Mao et al.,
    2012), agricultural production process management (Díaz et al., 2011, Dong et
    al., 2013), and security in crops (Garcia-Sanchez et al., 2011), are a few potential
    applications. However, WSNs have few limitations (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Yick
    et al., 2008) such as low battery power, limited computation capability and small
    memory of the sensor nodes. These limitations invite challenges in the design
    of WSN applications in agriculture. In agriculture, most of the WSN-based applications
    are targeted for various applications. For example, WSNs for environmental condition
    monitoring with information of soil nutrients is applied for predicting crop health
    and production quality over time. Irrigation scheduling is predicted with WSNs
    by monitoring the soil moisture and weather conditions. Being scalable, the performance
    of an existing WSN-based application can be improved to monitor more parameters
    by only including additional sensor nodes to the existing architecture. The issues
    present in such applications are the determination of optimal deployment strategy,
    measurement interval, energy-efficient medium access, and routing protocols. For
    example, a sparse deployment of nodes with a long data collection interval is
    helpful for enhancing the lifetime of a network. However, challenges may emerge
    from the choice of the deployment region. As an example, if the field area is
    separated by obstructions then it will lead to attenuation of signal, thereby
    affecting the inter-node communication. In the Indian scenario, the WSN-based
    farming solutions need to be of very low cost to be affordable by end users. However,
    with the increasing population, the demand of food-grain is also rising. Recent
    reports warns that the growth in food grain production is less than the growth
    in population (Shanwad et al., 2004). Also, India is one of the largest exporters
    of food grains, and thus, researchers (Shanwad et al., 2004, Mondal and Basu,
    2009) demand to boost production by incorporating advanced technologies. Consequently,
    new and modern technologies are being considered in many agricultural applications
    to achieve the target (Mondal et al., 2004). The current state of development
    in the Indian scenario comprises of technologies such as WSNs, General Packet
    Radio Service (GPRS), Global Positioning System (GPS), remote sensing, and Geographical
    Information System (GIS). 1.2. Contributions In this paper, we surveyed the variants
    of WSNs and their potential for the advancement of various agricultural application
    development. We highlight the main agricultural and farming applications, and
    discuss the applicability of WSNs towards improved performance and productivity.
    We also classify the network architecture, node architecture, and communication
    technology standards used in agricultural applications. The real-world wireless
    sensor nodes and various sensors such as soil, environment, pH, and plant-health
    are also listed in this paper. In Section 5, we study and review the existing
    WSN deployments both in the global as well as the Indian scenarios. In summary,
    the contributions of this paper are listed as follows. • We study the current
    state-of-the-art in WSNs and their applicability in agricultural and farming applications.
    • The existing WSNs are analyzed with respect to communication and networking
    technologies, standards, and hardware. • We analyze the prospects and problems
    of the existing agricultural applications with detailed case studies for global
    as well as the Indian scenarios. • Finally, we present the futuristic applications
    highlighting the factors for improvements for the existing scenarios. 1.3. Paper
    organization The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents
    the basics of WSNs, its requirements, potentials and different possible application
    in the agriculture domain. Design of a wireless sensor network for agricultural
    application is discussed in Section 3. The technologies and standards used in
    agricultural applications are analyzed in Section 4. We further discuss about
    the currently existing state-of-the-art and real-world applications in Section
    5, and analyze the prospects and problems of the existing solutions. In Section
    6, we provide few future direction of work pointing out the factors for improvement.
    Finally, the paper concludes in Section 7. 2. Wireless sensor networks and its
    potential for agricultural applications In this section, we discuss two widely
    used variants of WSNs—Terrestrial Wireless Sensor Networks (TWSN) and Wireless
    Underground Sensor Networks (WUSN), specifically used in agricultural applications.
    2.1. Terrestrial wireless sensor networks WSNs are a network of battery-powered
    sensors inter-connected through wireless medium and are typically deployed to
    serve a specific application purpose (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz et al.,
    2002b, Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004). In TWSNs, the nodes are deployed above the
    ground surface. The advancements in MEMS technology has enabled the creation of
    smart, small sized, although low cost sensors. These powerful sensors empower
    a sensor node or mote to accurately collect the surrounding data. Based on the
    sensed information, these nodes then network among themselves to perform the application
    requirements. For example, consider a precision agriculture environment where
    WSNs are deployed throughout the field to automate the irrigation system. All
    these sensors determine the moisture content of the soil, and further, collaboratively
    decide the time and duration of irrigation scheduling on that field. Then, using
    the same network, the decision is conveyed to the sensor node attached to a water
    pump. Gutiérrez et al. (2014) proposed one such automated irrigation system using
    a WSN and GPRS module. Fig. 1 depicts a typical wireless sensor network deployed
    on field for agricultural applications. The field consists of sensor nodes powered
    with application specific on-board sensors. The nodes in the on-field sensor network
    communicate among themselves using radio-frequency (RF) links of industrial, scientific
    and medical (ISM) radio bands (such as 902–928 MHz and 2.4–2.5 GHz). Typically,
    a gateway node is also deployed along with the sensor nodes to enable a connection
    between the sensor network and the outer world. Thus, the gateway node is powered
    with both RF and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) or GPRS. A remote
    user can monitor the state of the field, and control the on-field sensors and
    actuator devices. For example, a user can switch on/off a pump/valve when the
    water level applied to the field reaches some predefined threshold value. Users
    carrying mobile phone can also remotely monitor and control the on-field sensors.
    The mobile user is connected via GPRS or even through Short Message Service (SMS).
    Periodic information update from the sensors, and on-demand system control for
    both type of users can also be designed. Download : Download high-res image (240KB)

    Another variant of the WSNs is its underground counterpart—Wireless Underground
    Sensor Networks (WUSNs) (Akyildiz and Stuntebeck, 2006, Vuran and Akyildiz, 2008).
    In this version, the wireless sensors are planted inside soil. In this setting,
    higher frequencies suffer severe attenuation, and comparatively lower frequencies
    are able to penetrate through the soil (Silva and Vuran, 2010, Yu et al., 2013).
    Thus, communication radius gets limited and the network requires higher number
    of nodes to cover a large area. The application of wired sensors increases the
    network coverage by requiring relatively smaller number of sensors. However, in
    this design, the sensors and the wires may be vulnerable to farming activities.
    A typical agricultural application based on underground sensor networks is shown
    in Fig. 2. Unlike the TWSN-based applications shown in Fig. 1, in this figure,
    the sensor nodes are buried inside soil. One gateway node is also deployed to
    transmit the information collected by the underground sensor nodes to the surface
    sink placed over the ground. Thereafter, the information can be transmitted over
    the Internet to store in remote databases, and can be used for notifying a cell
    phone carrying user. However, due to comparatively shorter communication distance,
    more number of nodes are required to be deployed for use in WUSNs. Download :

    2.3. Differences between TWSNs and WUSNs We highlight the specific differences
    between the TWSNs and WUSNs in Table 1. Table 1. Differences between terrestrial
    and underground WSNs. Feature TWSNs WUSNs Deployment Placed over ground Buried
    under-ground Depth Anywhere over ground Topsoil (0–30 cm) and subsoil (>30 cm)a
    Communication range ≈100 m ≈0.1–10 m Communication frequency Higher (868/915 MHz,
    2.4 GHz) Lower (433 MHz, 8–300 kHz) Antenna size Smaller Larger Energy consumption
    Lower Higher Cost Lower Higher a References Martinez et al., 2004, Vuran and Silva,
    2009 reported a glacier monitoring network where underground communications over
    30 m distance were possible. Further, using higher transmission power, 80 m distance
    under ice were also covered. 2.4. Usefulness of WSNs In the following, we highlight
    the salient features of WSNs that have enabled themselves as a potential tool
    for automation in the agricultural domain. (i) Intelligent decision making capability:
    WSNs are multi-hop in nature (Akyildiz et al., 2002a, Akyildiz et al., 2002b,
    Akyildiz and Kasimoglu, 2004). In a large area, this feature enhances the energy-efficiency
    of the overall network, and hence, the network lifetime increases. Using this
    feature, multiple sensor nodes collaborate among themselves, and collectively
    take the final decision (Kulkarni et al., 2011, Bhattacharjee et al., 2012, Wu
    et al., 2012, Yao et al., 2013). (ii) Dynamic topology configuration: To conserve
    the in-node battery power, a sensor node keeps itself in the ‘sleep mode’ most
    of the time. Using topology management techniques (Ren and Meng, 2009, Chu and
    Sethu, 2012, Li et al., 2013), the sensor nodes can collaboratively take these
    decisions. To maximize the network lifetime, the network topology is configured
    such that the minimum number of nodes remain in the active mode. (iii) Fault-tolerance:
    One common challenge in deploying the WSNs is that the sensor nodes are fault-prone
    (Younis et al., 2014). Under such circumstances, unplanned deployment of nodes
    may lead to network partitioning, and in turn, the overall performance of the
    network is affected. However, in countermeasure, the sensor nodes can ‘self-organize’
    by dynamically configuring the network topology (Misra et al., 2011). (iv) Context-awareness:
    Based on the sensed information about the physical and environmental parameters,
    the sensor nodes gain knowledge about the surrounding context. The decisions that
    the sensor nodes take thereafter are context-aware (Vijay et al., 2011). (v) Scalability:
    Generally, the WSN protocols are designed to be implemented in any network irrespective
    of its size and node count. This feature undoubtedly widens the potential of WSNs
    for numerous applications. (vi) Node heterogeneity: WSNs are often assumed to
    be comprised of homogeneous sensor attached devices (Misra et al., 2015, Li and
    Hou, 2005, Ren and Meng, 2009). However, in many realistic scenarios, the devices
    are heterogeneous in respect of processing and computation power, memory, sensing
    capability, transceiver unit, and movement capability. (vii) Tolerance against
    communication failures in harsh environmental conditions: Due to the wide range
    of applications in open agricultural environments, WSNs suffer the effects of
    harsh environmental conditions (Misra et al., 2014). The WSN protocol stack includes
    techniques to withstand the effect of communication failures in the network arising
    due to environmental effects. (viii) Autonomous operating mode: An important feature
    of WSNs is their autonomous operating mode (Misra and Jain, 2011) and adaptiveness
    (Nicopolitidis et al., 2011). In agricultural applications, this feature certainly
    plays an important role, and enables an easy as well as advanced mode of operation.
    (ix) Information security: The WSNs carry raw information about on-field parameters.
    To ensure the security of sensed information, WSNs provides access control mechanisms
    (Misra and Vaish, 2011) and anomaly detection (Karapistoli et al., 2013) to restrict
    unauthenticated users. 2.5. Potential applications We list the possible agricultural
    and farming applications which can be implemented using WSNs. • Irrigation management
    system: Modern day agriculture requires an improved irrigation management system
    to optimize the water usage in farming (Adamala et al., 2014, Greenwood et al.,
    2010). The alarming reduction of ground water level is another motivation for
    the requirement of an advanced system. In this context, micro-irrigation techniques
    are cost-effective and water-usage efficient (Raina et al., 1998, Westarp et al.,
    2004). However, micro-irrigation efficiency can be further improved based on the
    environmental and soil information. In this regard, WSNs are applied as the coordinating
    technology (Lichtenberg et al., 2015, Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Lorite et al., 2013,
    Moghaddam et al., 2010). • Farming systems monitoring: Currently, various improved
    systems and devices are used in farming. In this regard, an improved system to
    manage these devices eases the overall operation, and enable automation in faming
    (Kim et al., 2014). Also, such remote monitoring systems help towards enabling
    improved management in large agricultural fields. Further, with the input of additional
    information such as satellite images and weather forecasts, the system performance
    can be improved. • Pest and disease control: Controlled usage of pesticides and
    fertilizers helps increasing the crop quality as well as minimizing the farming
    cost. However, for controlling the usage of pesticides, we need to monitor the
    probability and occurrence of pests in crops. To predict this, we also need the
    surrounding climate information (Matese et al., 2009, Bhave et al., 2013) such
    as temperature, humidity, and wind speed. A WSN can autonomously monitor and predict
    these events over a field of interest (Bhargava et al., 2014). • Controlled use
    of fertilizers: Plant growth and crop quality directly depend on the use of fertilizers.
    However, optimal supply of fertilizers to proper places in fields is a challenging
    task. The use of fertilizers for farming may be controlled by monitoring the variation
    in soil nutritions such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K), and pH.
    Consequently, soil nutrition balance may also be achieved, and hence, crop production
    quality is also maintained. Gonçalves et al. (2015) studied the effectiveness
    of mobile nodes to improve agricultural productivity in a smart system with Precision
    Sprays. • Cattle movement monitoring: A herd of cattle grazing a field can be
    monitored using WSN technology or Radio Frequency Identifier (RFID) (Voulodimos
    et al., 2010, Kwong et al., 2012). Thus, real-time monitoring of any cattle is
    also achieved. This technology can be implemented further to monitor whether any
    cattle is moving near the vegetation fields or not. • Ground water quality monitoring:
    The increased use of fertilizers and pesticides lead to decrease in the quality
    of ground water. Placing sensor nodes empowered with wireless communication help
    in monitoring the water quality (Lin et al., 2008, Zia et al., 2013). • Greenhouse
    gases monitoring: Greenhouse gases and agriculture are closely related to each
    other. Greenhouse gases are responsible for increasing the climate temperature,
    and thus, has direct impact on agriculture. On the other hand, greenhouse gas
    emission comes from various agricultural sources. Malaver et al. (2015) presents
    the development of a system of solar powered Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and
    WSN to monitor greenhouse gases – CH4 and CO2. • Asset tracking: Wireless technology
    enabled farming equipments attract the possibility of remote tracking (Misra and
    Singh, 2012) of these assets. A farmer can track the position of the farming vehicles
    and irrigation systems from his home. • Remote control and diagnosis: With the
    advent of internet of things, remote control and diagnosis of farm equipments
    such as pumps, lights, heaters, valves in machinery are also possible (Fukatsu
    et al., 2011, Coates et al., 2013). 3. Design of a wireless sensor network for
    agricultural applications 3.1. Network architecture for agriculture applications
    In this section, we discuss the network architecture considered in various agricultural
    applications. We classify the architectures in various categories and highlight
    the potential agricultural applications suitable for each one. Fig. 3 provides
    a visual depiction of the architectures classified with respect to different parameters.

    Fig. 3. Classification of network architectures with respect to different parameters.
    Based on the movement of the networked devices and nodes, we classify the existing
    architectures in the following categories: • Stationary architecture: In the stationary
    architecture, the sensor nodes are deployed at a fixed position, and during the
    application duration, they do not change their position. Typically, applications
    such as irrigation management system, ground water quality monitoring, and controlling
    the use of fertilizers require stationary architectures. In such applications
    with TWSNs, the data logger (data collector) sensor nodes are typically placed
    over the field. However, in WUSNs, the data collector sensor nodes are placed
    under-ground. Also, as shown in Fig. 2, aggregator nodes may be placed under-ground
    to collect all the data of the underground sensors and communicate with the outside
    TWSNs. • Mobile architecture: Mobile architectures comprise of devices which change
    their position with time. An example of applications based on such architecture
    will be an autonomous network of tractors and cell phone carrying farmers serving
    the purpose of ubiquitous farming operations. • Hybrid architecture: In the hybrid
    architecture, both stationary and mobile nodes are present. For example, this
    type of architecture is applicable to farming applications consisting of stationary
    field sensors, mobile farming equipments, cell phones carrying users, and moving
    cattle. Based on the types of sensor nodes and associated devices, the existing
    architecture used in agriculture are classified as follows: • Homogeneous architecture:
    As the name suggests, homogeneous architecture comprises of sensor equipped devices
    of similar potential. This type of framework is typically used in applications
    based on the unplanned deployments. In such circumstances, the network is deployed
    mainly for in situ monitoring of the desired agricultural parameters. However,
    this type of architecture lacks variety in terms of communication hardware. Consequently,
    the schemes and communication protocols are designed keeping this limitation in
    mind. One example application of this type of architecture is agricultural data
    collection application on the use of pesticides and changing quantity of soil
    nutrients. • Heterogeneous architecture: In this type of architecture, various
    types of sensor nodes, and devices are present. These devices vary in terms of
    computation power, memory, sensing capability, and transceiver units. For example,
    in any irrigation management application, the on-field sensor nodes communicate
    their sensed information to a master or sink node, which again transfer the information
    to remote user. In this case, the sink node is capable of communicating in multiple
    modes—RF and GSM. Another possible application may be the farming systems monitoring
    and agricultural asset tracking. In this application, multiple heterogeneous devices
    are included with on-field sensors. The application model shown in Fig. 1 depicts
    a heterogeneous architecture. In Fig. 1, the field sensor and gateway nodes are
    of different configurations. The architectures are classified into various categories
    based on the hierarchy. • Single-tier architecture: This type of architecture
    is most common among the agricultural applications, specifically small-scale ones.
    In this type of architecture, the on-field devices and sensor nodes directly communicate
    their data to a sink node placed near the application area. This type of architecture
    is also referred to as the single clustered architecture. • Multi-tier architecture:
    In a multi-tier architecture, there are multiple levels in the overall application
    hierarchy. The on-field sensor nodes remain in the lower level of hierarchy, and
    form the basic clusters. Thereafter, the next levels of hierarchy include multiple
    clusters to reach the gateway nodes. Typically, multi-tier architectures consist
    of heterogeneous nodes. Fig. 4 shows a multi-tier architecture with three levels
    of gateways. The basic unit of the network is formed by a cluster comprised of
    sensor nodes and a cluster head, referred to as the 3rd tier gateway in the figure.
    These gateways again form a cluster with the 2nd tier gateways as the cluster
    head, and thus, the hierarchy is followed iteratively until the remote sink is
    reached. Download : Download high-res image (271KB) Download : Download full-size

    of sensor nodes 3.2.1. Embedded multi-chip sensor nodes The components of a typical
    multi-chip sensor node are shown in Fig. 5(a). Typically, a sensor node consists
    of an application-specific sensor array with a transceiver unit for communication.
    A processor or micro-controller unit is used as the “brain” of the node. Optionally,
    a sensor board includes memory units to store data. Depending on the application
    demand, the architecture of the sensor nodes varies to meet the demands. For example,
    the processing power and on-board memory size are increased to meet the requirements
    of more intense or intelligent processing. Download : Download high-res image

    technology is System-in-Package (SiP), which is defined as any combination of
    multiple chips including passive components (such as resistors and capacitors)
    mounted together keeping provision to attach external components later. SiP reduces
    the product cost with optimized size and performance. Thus, the SiP technology
    has potential for applications in agricultural scenarios. SiP based agricultural
    systems can be applied in different applications simply by attaching different
    sensors with the main package. In the following, we discuss the associated factors
    in the selection of the components of a sensor node as per the requirement of
    agricultural applications. • Processor: The computation power of the sensor node
    solely depends on the choice of the processing unit. A micro-controller provides
    few advantages such as low cost, flexibility to communicate with other nodes,
    ease of programming, and low power consumption over the traditional processors.
    Mostly, these micro-controllers work on 3.5–5 V. However, power consumption is
    one of the most important factors in sensor nodes. Considering this fact, micro-controllers
    are preferred over general purpose processors. • Transceiver: Transmission and
    reception are the two major reasons of energy consumption in sensor nodes. In
    agricultural applications, the network planner chooses the deployment to ensure
    optimal power consumption of the sensor nodes. • Memory: The sensor nodes have
    two types of on-board memory—memory associated with processor and external memory.
    Depending on the application requirement, sensor nodes need to store historical
    data for intelligent decision making. In this regard, flash memories are used
    for additional storage. • Power: It is also an important factor for selecting
    the sensor nodes, as the battery power of the sensor nodes is limited. In many
    agricultural applications, the nodes possess alternate energy sources such as
    solar power. However, solar power is available during the day time only, and at
    other times, the nodes rely on battery power. Also, frequent change of battery
    increases the cost of maintenance. Thus, we need energy-efficient algorithms such
    that the energy consumption of the sensor nodes are reduced. • Cost: One very
    important selection factor of the sensor nodes is the total hardware cost. A low
    cost application design is always preferred for any application level, and consequently,
    it is the most important issue in terms of applications targeting the low and
    middle income country (LMIC) markets. 3.2.2. System on Chip (SoC) sensor nodes
    The System-on-Chip (SoC) architecture, on the other hand, follows more application
    specific design targeting minimization of the power requirements and design cost.
    SoC provides an integration of multiple programmable processor cores, co-processors,
    hardware accelerators, memory units, input/output units, and custom blocks. Fig.
    5(b) shows the components of a typical SoC based sensor node. The envisioned applications
    for SoC is mainly in designing Network on Chips (NoCs) (Koch et al., 2006), systems
    for multimedia and streaming applications (Karim et al., 2003) which are computationally
    intensive. Currently, in agricultural applications, the use of SoCs are very rare.
    However, the advent of SoC has a lot of potential for the agriculture and farming
    domain. Firstly, the use of SoCs based sensor nodes instead of current day embedded
    multi-chip sensor nodes will increase the computation power, and decrease the
    energy-consumption. Also, the size of the nodes will be less and thereby, portability
    of the overall system increases. Compared to multiple silicon dies in SiP, SoC
    is single die based, and thus, SoCs result in lesser size, but, higher cost. Table
    2 briefly lists the differences between the embedded multi-chip nodes and SoCs.

    we discuss the details of the wireless communication technologies, and the standards
    used in various agricultural applications. Also, we study the different wireless
    sensor nodes available in the market for use in these applications. 4.1. Wireless
    communication • ZigBee: (ZigBee Specifications,, Baronti et al., 2007, Guo et
    al., 2012); technology defines the network and application layer protocols based
    on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2006)
    physical and MAC layer definitions required for designing a wireless personal
    area network (WPAN) using low power radio-enabled devices. Being energy-efficient,
    low cost, and reliable, the ZigBee technology is preferred for WSN-based applications
    in the agricultural and farming domains. ZigBee also supports short-distance (10–20
    m) data communication over multi-tier, decentralized, ad-hoc and mesh networks.
    The ZigBee-enabled devices have a low-duty cycle, and thus, are suitable for agricultural
    applications such as irrigation management, pesticide and fertilizer control,
    water quality management, where periodic information update is required. However,
    ZigBee applications yield low data rates of only 20–40 kbps and 250 kbps at 868/915
    MHz and 2.4 GHz frequencies of ISM band, respectively. Typically, this standard
    requires low specification hardware (such as microprocessor with 50–60 kb memory)
    and includes security encryption techniques. • WiFi: WiFi is a wireless local
    area network (WLAN) standard for information exchange or connecting to the Internet
    wirelessly based on the IEEE 802.11 standards family (IEEE 802.11, 802.11a/b/g/n)
    (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2005, IEEE Standard for Information
    technology, 2012a). Currently, it is the most widely used wireless technology
    found in devices ranging from smart phones and tablets to desktops and laptops.
    WiFi provides a decent communication range in the order of 20 m (indoor) to 100
    m (outdoor) with data transmission rate in the order of 2–54 Mbps at 2.4 GHz frequency
    of ISM band. In agricultural applications, WiFi broadens the use of heterogeneous
    architectures connecting multiple type of devices over an ad-hoc network. • Bluetooth:
    Bluetooth (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2012b, Bluetooth Technology
    Special Interest Group,), which is based on the IEEE 802.15.1 standard, is a low
    power, low cost wireless technology used for communication between portable devices
    and desktops over a short range (8–10 m). The Bluetooth standard defines a personal
    area network (PAN) communication using the 2.4 GHz frequency of the ISM band.
    The data rate achieved in various versions of the Bluetooth ranges from 1 to 24
    Mbps. The advantages of this technology are its ubiquitous nature, and therefore,
    it is suitable for use in multi-tier agricultural applications. The ultra low
    power, low cost version of this standard is named as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE)
    (Xhafa and Ho, 2013, Xhafa and Ho, 2015, Linde and Tucker, 2013), which was initially
    introduced by Nokia in 2006 as Wibree (Nokia, 2006). However, in 2010, BLE was
    merged with main Bluetooth standard version 4.0. BLE also uses the 2.4 GHz ISM
    frequency band with adaptive frequency hopping to reduce interference. Also, BLE
    includes 24 bit CRC and AES 128 bit encryption technique on all packets to guarantee
    robustness and authentication. BLE topology supports one-to-one as well as one-to-many
    connections between devices. • GPRS/3G/4G: GPRS (General Packet Radio Service)
    is a packet data service for GSM based cellular phones. A data rate of 50–100
    kbps is achieved in the 2G systems. However, in GPRS, throughput and delay are
    variable, and they depend on the number of other users sharing the same resource.
    Although the biggest advantage that GPRS brings is in relieving the range limitation
    of wireless devices. Any two devices can communicate provided they both are in
    the GSM service area. However, it is better suited for the periodic monitoring
    applications than to the real-time tracking-type applications. The advanced version
    of GPRS is Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution (EDGE), which offers increased
    data rate with no hardware/software changes in the GSM core networks. 3G (Goodman
    and Myers, 2005) and 4G (Parkvall et al., 2008) are the third and fourth generations
    of mobile communication technology. The corresponding data transfer rate achieved
    in these technologies are 200 kbps and 100 Mbps to 1 Gbps in 3G and 4G, respectively.
    • WiMAX: WiMAX is the acronym for Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access,
    a wireless communication standard referring to the inter-operable implementations
    of the IEEE 802.16 standards (IEEE Standard for Local and metropolitan area networks,
    2011) family. WiMAX is targeted to achieve 0.4–1 Gbps data rate on fixed stations,
    and the maximum transmission range using this technology is 50 km. The Mobile
    WiMAX (IEEE 802.16e standard) provides data rates in the order of 50–100 Mbps.
    Also, WiMAX is stated to be energy-efficient over the pre-4G Long-Term Evaluation
    (LTE) and Evolved High-Speed Packet Access (HSPA+) (Deruyck et al., 2010, Louta
    et al., 2014). The long range support together with high speed communication features
    place WiMAX as the best suitable technology for agricultural applications involving
    asset monitoring such as farming system monitoring, crop-area border monitoring,
    and real-time diagnostics such as remote controlling of water pumps, lights, gates,
    remote diagnosis of farming systems. In Table 3, we compare the different communication
    technologies with respect to various parameters. We also mention the suitable
    agricultural applications of each technology. Table 3. Comparison of different
    communication technologies. Parameter ZigBee WiFi Bluetooth GPRS/3G/4G WiMAX Standard

    sensor platforms for use in the agricultural domain (ur Rehman et al., 2014).
    In Table 4, we analyze the existing wireless sensor nodes by classifying them
    according to different features and parameters. Table 4. Comparison of the existing

    the various application specific sensors which empower the wireless sensing platforms.
    For better classification, we divide these sensors in three main categories—soil,
    environment, and plant related. 4.3.1. Soil related In Table 5, we compare the
    sensors along with different soil-related measurement parameters—suitable for
    different potential agricultural applications. Table 5. Comparison of different

    soil and plant sensors in various agricultural applications. Such kind of heterogeneous
    placement ensures intelligent and improved decision making. Table 6 lists the
    sensors specific to the measurement of environmental parameters. Table 6. Comparison

    Plant related The sensors deployed or attached to a plant are also an integral
    part of modern farming applications. The potential applications include controlled
    use of fertilizer, crop quality monitoring, pest control, and cattle movement
    monitoring. The plant related agricultural sensors are listed in Table 7. Table

    real-world applications In Section 5.1, we discuss the different categories of
    agricultural applications in detail, and also, bring on the real-world counterpart
    of the same application deployment as a case study. These applications are designed
    with both the TWSNs and the WUSNs. Also, we mention the developments in the Indian
    scenarios in Section 5.2. Although, the number of such developments is very small
    compared to the global scenario. In Section 5.3, we analyze the challenges, problems,
    and prospects of the existing solutions both in the global as well as the Indian
    scenarios. 5.1. Global scenario 5.1.1. Irrigation management The recent years
    have witnessed an upsurge in the deployment of WSNs, specifically in the irrigation
    management applications (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Kim et al., 2011, Kim et al.,
    2009, Kim et al., 2008, Moghaddam et al., 2010, Erdem et al., 2010, Kim and Evans,
    2009, Pierce and Elliott, 2008, Vellidis et al., 2008, Nemali and Iersel, 2006).
    This is mainly because of the importance of water in crop production (Postel,
    1999, Bouwer, 2000, Saleth and Dinar, 2000, Jury and, 2007, Falloon and Betts,
    2010, Mueller et al., 2012). In the following, we survey two such deployments
    as case studies. Case Study—San Jose del Cabo, Baja California Sur (BCS), Mexico:
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) described the development and deployment of an automated
    irrigation system comprising of a distributed WSN, a gateway, and remote server.
    The project was dedicated to implement a WSN system capable of reducing water
    use. The WSN consists of soil moisture and temperature sensors buried in ground
    for taking measurement in different depths. The gateway node has on-board facilities
    supporting both ZigBee (IEEE Standard for Information technology, 2006, Baronti
    et al., 2007, Guo et al., 2012) and GPRS communications. It is also empowered
    with intelligent decision making such as automated irrigation activation based
    on soil moisture and temperature values exceeding a certain predefined threshold
    value. The remote server is used for storing all the information, and displaying
    the information in a graphical user interface (GUI). The advantage of this application
    design is its real-time data analysis feature. The system components are explained
    in the following: • Wireless Sensor Units (WSUs): Each WSU, deployed on-field,
    has four different type of components—application specific sensors, processing
    unit, radio transceiver, and battery power. Table 8 lists the details of each
    of the components (sensors and actuator devices) used in reference (Gutiérrez
    et al., 2014). For energy saving, the micro-controller often remains in the sleep
    mode. A solar panel is attached with each of the WSUs to recharge their batteries.

    • Wireless Information Unit (WIU): The WIU acts as the master node, and collects
    information from the WSUs using the ZigBee technology. All the information received
    about soil moisture and temperature are compared with a predefined threshold values,
    and consequently, the pumps are activated for an estimated period. The received
    information and irrigation related data are saved in the attached solid state
    memory, and are transmitted to the remote server via GPRS using the Hypertext
    Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The pumps are driven by two electronic relays of 40-A,
    12 V DC. The WIU can be commanded to changed the irrigation scheduling from the
    remote server, and is also equipped with a button to perform manual irrigation.
    Four different irrigation actions (IAs) are considered—manual irrigation, predefined
    irrigation, and automated irrigation with soil moisture of at least one sensor
    dropping below threshold, and automated irrigation with soil temperature of at
    least one sensor exceeding past the threshold. • Remote web server: The server
    shows a specific GUI, which visualizes the data from each WSU, total water consumption,
    and IA type. The web application also enables the user with direct programming
    facility of the scheduled irrigation schemes, and changing the threshold values
    based on the crop type and season. Case Study—Smart Sensor Web: The Smart Sensor
    Web (SSW) system proposed by Moghaddam et al. (2010) introduces a new technology
    for smart sensor web system measuring the surface-to-depth soil moisture profile
    of on-field sensors. The University of Michigan Matthaei Botanical Gardens in
    Ann Arbor, Michigan was chosen as the deployment region of the on-field sensors.
    The in situ sensors were deployed to model the spatio-temporal variations in soil
    moisture serving the future goal of enabling satellite observation of soil moisture.
    To minimize the overall cost and energy conservation, the authors plan to sparsely
    sample the sensor data. The Sensor Web, is guided by the intelligence of a control
    system envisioned to determine an optimal sensor selection strategy to decide
    sensor configurations over time, and an estimation strategy based on the information
    of 3-dimensional soil moisture values. The problem of finding an optimal strategy
    and estimating a parameter are modelled using Partially Observed Markov Decision
    Process (POMDP) (Lovejoy, 1991). In a real deployment, multiple actuator nodes
    are placed with multiple sensors placed at different depths. One central coordinator
    node is deployed to schedule the data transmission events of the actuators. Upon
    receiving the readings from the in situ actuators, the central coordinator estimates
    the spatial variation of soil moisture. Then, the coordinator decides the time
    schedule of future measurements. In this manner, the coordinator node leverages
    the spatio-temporal correlation of soil moisture, and optimally estimates with
    reduced number of measurements. The system description is presented in the following.
    • Ripple 1 system: The on-field sensor nodes, deployed at fixed locations, are
    equipped with 3–5 soil moisture probes. Communication between the nodes is done
    using the ZigBee technology built on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard. The nodes are
    classified into three categories—coordinator, router, and end devices. The specific
    node level parameters and sensors are listed in Table 9. The sensor nodes are
    powered with on-board batteries, and solar panels are also installed to recharge
    them. The coordinate node is attached to the base station computer. Table 9. Deployment

    The 3G network card is installed on the base station. The server saves all the
    information, and any home/mobile user is able to visualize the information in
    real-time, thereby integrating the whole system from the in situ sensors to the
    remote user. Case Study—Alfalfa Crop Irrigation Cut-off System: Saha et al. (2011)
    presented a automatic irrigation cut-off system targeted for eliminating tail
    water drainage in alfalfa crop. The work is based on Yolo silt loam soil on the
    UC Davis campus, California, USA, where alfalfa is the largest water consuming
    crop. Earlier, the flood-irrigation method was used for this crop. However, the
    water runoff reduces the efficiency of this method. Motivated by this problem,
    Saha et al. designed a wireless sensor based system which provides the irrigation
    information from the tail-end of the field. The realization of the system is done
    by applying a water advance model to the field deployment of wetting-front sensors
    couple with cellular communication. The irrigator farmer receives a SMS notifying
    the time to shutdown the irrigation system. Fig. 6 depicts the application scenario
    showing the deployment. In the deployment area, 4 out of 48 alfalfa checks are
    selected for the experiment. Each check is of dimensions 220 m × 15 m with a slope
    of 0.01%. Wetting-front sensing system was placed at the tail-end of the field.

    in alfalfa crop (Saha et al., 2011). The system is very useful for a large-scale
    field with vast area for irrigation. Case Study—AMI Turf Irrigation System (Aqua
    Management): This turf irrigation controller system designed by Aqua Management,
    Inc. is targeted for the turf irrigation industry to solve the problem of providing
    efficient water management solutions at an affordable price. It is a cloud-based
    control system, which considers various on-field parameters such as Evapotranspiration
    (ET), weather condition, water flow and leak. The application control can be accessed
    from any computer, tablet, or smartphone. The features of this system are cataloged
    in Table 10. The automated decision making framework relies on the following components
    – local weather value, local ET values from public/private systems, and soil moisture
    sensors. Alternatively, the AMI data logger (AMI LoggerTM) can also be used to
    automate irrigation. The AMI Q collects all data from the on-field sensors and
    flow meters, and upload the information to the cloud. Table 10. Features: AMI

    Dynamic adjustments ET and real-time weather based Flow management Available Fault
    detection Can detect leak Alert notification Automatic Reaction to faults due
    to leak and weather related events Automatic shut down Overall, irrigation management
    is based on the actual volume of water, rather than time. Based on the weather
    condition, irrigation can be stopped or started. The water management facility
    includes reporting of various analytics such as water budgeting on a daily, weekly,
    monthly, or annual basis. 5.1.2. Vineyard monitoring Applying pervasive and mobile
    computing technologies in vineyard monitoring to increase the quality of production
    and reduce the production cost and the effect of crop related diseases. We review
    one of the existing works (Burrell et al., 2004) as a case study. Case Study—Vineyard
    Production Monitoring (Díaz et al., 2011): Díaz et al. (2011) presented a design
    of a precision agricultural system for vineyard production monitoring. The deployment
    of WSNs help in estimate the variability in agricultural parameters throughout
    the field. Initially, in the first phase, the authors divide the subject terrain
    into few different zones (zone A, B, C) based on geographic, weather, and soil
    maps. In the network planning phase, the most suitable architecture is chosen
    based on the application requirement. The subject area dimension was 600 m × 450
    m, and different sensors were placed in different zones. For example, the authors
    assumed that zone C has temperature, humidity, soil moisture, luminosity, and
    pH level sensors deployed. In zones A and B, the environmental temperature, humidity
    and temperature, and luminosity sensors were deployed, respectively. The sensor
    nodes are assumed to have an transmission range of 75–100 m. The nodes in different
    zones form a virtual tree structure among themselves, and the sensed information
    reaches the gateway following a multi-hop path. The detailed deployment parameters
    are presented in Table 11. Table 11. Deployment parameters: Díaz et al. (2011).

    in the design—sensor, actuator, redundant nodes, and a gateway. The sensors can
    only collect data samples, and information is routed to gateway. The actuator
    nodes have provision for driving irrigation systems. The actuators can also respond
    to the given commands about scheduling irrigation. The redundant nodes, as the
    name suggests, help in information routing, and imitate the functionalities of
    faulty nodes. The gateway acts as the bridge between the in situ network and the
    base station. Information routing is done to select the best neighbor node. The
    routing scheme can also be executed in an energy conserving manner, and in such
    a condition, the diagonally placed nodes are not selected for the next hop. 5.1.3.
    Precision farming Precision farming is targeted to generate greater productivity
    with reduced costs. Wireless ad-hoc and sensor networks are utilized in precision
    farming to gather field data which can then be analyzed to find the best farming
    conditions. Case Study—Video Sensing in Precision Agriculture (Cambra et al.,
    2015): Cambra et al. proposed video sensing for controlling fertilizer use in
    agricultural field. Their work is motivated by the objective of maintaining energy-efficiency
    with reduction of fertilizers in productions as defined Common Agricultural Policy
    (CAP) 2014/2020.1 In this work, the AR drones are utilized to capture the video
    of the field. Based on the video input, a system identifies and geopositions the
    weeds present in the field. Finally, the fertilizer sprayer system is actuated
    based on the processed localized information of weeds in fields. In Fig. 7, we
    depict the system overview showing the interaction between the AR drones, the
    central system, and the fertilizer sprays. The AR drones maps the field area in
    2D/3D drag and drop waypoint maps. Here, the monitored field area was 17 m by
    15 m. These drones form ad-hoc network among themselves and the central system.
    In this work, Optimized Link State Routing Protocol (OLSR) is applied to route
    the information from the field drones to the central system in real-time. Also,
    the drones and other devices are attached with on-board GPS, which enables updating
    the flight map and calculating the distance between the devices. Download : Download

    frames received from the flying drones are processed and geo-referenced in the
    central system. OpenCV2 based platform is used to recognize the weeds in the field.
    In the image processing framework, the authors consider Multilayer Perceptron
    learning algorithm (Bradski and Kaehler, 2008) with the green and brown color
    lines which are seen in maize crops. Finally, the locations of the weeds in the
    field are transmitted to the fertilizer sprayers, which precisely apply fertilizers
    to the weeds. Thus, using this framework, the overall production efficiency enhances
    while keeping the fertilizer use at lower levels. 5.2. Indian scenario 5.2.1.
    Water management Case Study—Project COMMON-Sense Net (Project Common Sense Net
    2.0,, Panchard et al., 2007): The COMMON-Sense Net project was a collaboration
    project with partners EPFL, Zurich (http://www.epfl.ch/) and the Centre for Electronic
    Design and Technology (CEDT) at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) (http://www.cedt.iisc.ernet.in/).
    The goal of this project was to develop emerging technologies suitable for developing
    countries. The region of interest was chosen at Chennakeshavapura (CKPura) in
    the Tumkur district, Karnataka, India. To focus on the specific problems of the
    chosen region, the targeted goal was to predict and mitigate the effect of adverse
    environmental changes (Panchard, 2008). The actual deployment consists of 9 on-field
    and 3 backward nodes measuring soil moisture at two different depths of 150 cm
    and 30 cm. These nodes transmit their data to the base station every 15 min. The
    base station then transmits the data to the remote server over a GPRS link. In
    addition to soil moisture, environmental data such as ambient temperature and
    relative humidity, were also collected. The design of a water management system
    for deficit irrigation includes the following (Panchard et al., 2006, Prabhakar
    et al., 2007): • Calibration: First, the soil moisture probes are calibrated using
    the standard gravimetric method (Reynolds, 1970, Schmugge et al., 1980, Dobriyal
    et al., 2012, Lekshmi et al., 2014). In the next normal mode, calibration is continued
    using a feedback loop based on the difference in measured and predicted values.
    • Alert: Nodes are programmed to issue an alert whenever soil moisture reaches
    a certain value. The sensed data and historical climate data, together, help in
    predicting the change of rain in future. • Soil moisture prediction: Real-time
    prediction of soil moisture is done using a learning method over the predicted
    and measured data. • Water requirements assessment: The system is also able to
    estimate the amount of water needed for irrigation at that specific conditions.
    The design parameters related to the COMMON-Sense Net project are listed in Table

    at IIT Kharagpur, India: Recently, IIT Kharapur started working on development
    of low-cost irrigation management system targeted for India. The lab-scale deployment
    of sensor network was carried out inside IIT Kharagpur campus, a place in the
    Kangsabati basin. In this project, four Ko Pro wireless sensor nodes were deployed
    over an area of 1440 m2. Fig. 8 shows the real deployment in the lab-scale facility.
    Each on-field node embeds four EC-5 soil moisture sensors. In addition to the
    on-field nodes, another gateway node was placed in the vicinity of the field to
    receive all the on-field soil moisture data at an interval of 15 min. The gateway
    node is programmed to run Crossbow’s XServe network management operations, and
    provides web services for remote viewing of data and network health. The gateway
    node also estimates the irrigation requirement of the field, and sends a SMS to
    the farmer informing this. The system has provision to control the number and
    recipient of SMS. Download : Download high-res image (765KB) Download : Download

    nodes in IIT Kharagpur lab facility. The different procedural components are described
    below. • Calibration: The soil moisture sensors are first calibrated using the
    standard gravimetric method. • Irrigation requirements assessment: The on-field
    system calculates the amount of water needed for irrigation at that specific conditions.
    This estimation also depends on the duration between the last SMS update and current
    time. • Update to farmer: Nodes are programmed to send SMS to the farmers with
    preprogrammed time and recipient phone number. The design parameters are listed

    Case Study—Vineyards Precision Farming: One of the widely cultivated crops in
    India is the grapes. Precision farming is applied in this field to reduce the
    production cost and reach a high turnover. Also, the use of precision farming
    is justified by the economic value of grapes. Precision farming in vineyards has
    to deal with three main issues—optimal water use, disease prediction, and controlled
    use of pesticides. In this regard, the soil and environment related parameters
    such as soil moisture, ambient temperature, leaf wetness, relative humidity are
    most important parameters for measurement. Soil moisture is the controlling factor
    for the crop production, size and quality of grapes. The quality of grapes and
    the wine produced from them depend on their size. The area of deployment, i.e.,
    the Sula vineyards, Nashik, India, is limited in terms of water resources. Another
    problem in grapes is the use of pesticides to control diseases such as Downey
    mildew, Powdery mildew, Anthracnose (NRCG, 2007). Consequently, the overall cost
    increases, and the crop quality degrades due to the use of harmful chemicals.
    However, there is another way to reduce the use of pesticides—by predicting the
    disease. For this purpose, it is needed to integrate the measurement of leaf surface
    wetness and duration with the existing system of sensors. Motivated by the above
    issues, Shah et al. (2009) designed a precision agriculture framework in the Sula
    vineyards at Nashik, Maharashtra, India. Initially, the lab-based small-scale
    setup was tested in a greenhouse at IIT Bombay, India with dimensions of 6 m   9
    m. On the other hand, the large-scale deployment at the Sula vineyards consists
    of wireless sensor nodes equipped with soil moisture, ambient temperature, relative
    humidity, and leaf wetness sensors. Table 14 lists the various system parameters
    considered in this project. Based on the on-field sensor data, the Evapotranspiration
    (ET) and Infection Index were computed. Table 14. Deployment parameters: Sula

    5.2.3. Crop disease risk evaluation Crop diseases are the root causes of production
    and revenue losses. The prediction of crop disease, and taking countermeasures
    to help farmers ensure sustained revenue generation. Case Study—Sula vineyards
    (Das et al., 2009): Das et al. (2009) studied the forecasting of grapevine Downy
    Mildew disease (Francesca et al., 2006, Caffarra et al., 2012), one of the most
    common and important fungal diseases in grapes (Madden and Hughes, 1995, Rossi
    et al., 2010), by deploying a WSN powered with various agro-meteorological sensors.
    The Downy Mildew disease in grapes is caused by the Plasmapora Viticola virus,
    which is a weather-related disease. The prediction of such a disease benefits
    the grapevine industry tremendously—increased revenue with quality enriched food
    and beverage products. The deployed motes are equipped with ambient temperature,
    relative humidity, and leaf wetness duration (LWD) sensors. Two different existing
    models, i.e., the Logistic and Beta models, are adopted in the work (Das et al.,
    2009). The study was performed for over five months at the Sula Vineyards, Nashik,
    Maharashtra, India. Following the collected data, the “Infection Index” was computed
    in real-time using both the Logistic and Beta models. Case Study—AgriSense (Tripathy
    et al., 2013a, Tripathy et al., 2013b): The AgriSense distributed system comprises
    of wireless sensor nodes with environmental and soil-specific sensors – ambient
    temperature, relative humidity, leaf wetness, and soil moisture. The actual test-bed
    was chosen as one semi-arid tropic region located at the Agriculture Research
    Institute (ARI) of the ANGR Agricultural University, Hyderabad. The target mission
    was to predict the Bud Necrosis Virus (BNV) disease of groundnut crop. Experiments
    were executed using different settings of protected and weather-based protection
    plots with different dates of sowing treatments on three different replicas. The
    on-field deployment comprises of five MICAz motes with 25 m communication range,
    transmitting at an interval of 15 min. These nodes communicate among themselves
    using the ZigBee (IEEE 802.15.4) protocol at the 2.4 GHz RF ISM band. One gateway
    node sends the collected data to a remote server using GPRS communication. The
    remote server converts the raw sensor data to a usable format and saves it in
    its database for displaying through the graphical user interface (GUI). Based
    on the data of soil and environmental parameters, various data mining models such
    as Expectation Maximization (EM), and Gaussian Naive Bayes (NB) classifier were
    used to predict the pest/disease dynamics. The schematic view of the real-time
    decision support system (DSS) is illustrated in Fig. 9. Download : Download high-res

    real-time decision support system (DSS) used in AgriSense (Tripathy et al., 2013a,

    The existing solutions invent smarter applications for solving multiple challenges
    existing in the agricultural domain. We discuss the prospects of these application
    in the following. However, there remains scope to further improve the solutions.
    We list few points to improve the existing innovations. • Cost-effective solutions
    for LMICs are required: The existing research and development efforts are targeted
    at the reduction of hardware and software costs, while maximizing the system output.
    The overall system cost increases due to the use of foreign imported devices to
    build the systems. However, for applications in LMICs, we need to reduce the system
    cost further. Thus, the challenge exist in bringing down the cost further. • Scalability
    of the deployments need to be tested: For LMICs, we need planned and scaled-up
    deployment of such agricultural systems. In this way, the average system cost
    can be reduced down keeping the performance intact. Also, with increased scalability,
    we need to have design. For a large scale deployment, hierarchical architecture
    would perform better than the flat single-tier network architecture, as discussed
    in Section 3.1. For example, in Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Moghaddam et al., 2010,
    the on-field WSN deployment in a specific area mostly follows the two-tier hierarchical
    network architecture with WSUs as end devices and WIUs as the gateway. This type
    of network architecture can be scaled up by replicating to multiple fields. In
    this setting, to increase the number of WSUs over a large deployment area, we
    have to place multiple WIU to provide connectivity to all the WSUs. • Fault tolerance:
    Fault tolerance is a necessary feature of wireless sensor networks for achieving
    precision agriculture. Different types of faults (Baljak et al., 2012) that may
    occur in a WSN based precision agriculture system are – node failure due to depleted
    battery or any other reason, sensor hardware faults generating erroneous value,
    faulty sensor calibration, communication failure. In the existing literature,
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) presented an irrigation management system which is fault
    tolerant to nodes (WSUs) and communication failure. In case of any fault, the
    system follows the default irrigation schedule. To reduce the chances of node
    failure due to energy depletion, (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Díaz et al., 2011, Shah
    et al., 2009) have used solar powered nodes. Also, the topology management and
    data aggregation schemes should be fault tolerant in a large scale deployment.
    • Energy management and energy harvesting: Energy management is an important issue
    in any WSN-based system. System components and algorithms should be designed keeping
    this issue in mind. Alternatively, the potential energy harvesting solutions such
    as solar power (Everlast Simjee and Chou, 2008), wind power (AmbiMax Park and
    Chou, 2006), biomass, and vibration should also be considered while designing
    WSN based precision agriculture systems. Among the existing works, solar powered
    WSNs (Gutiérrez et al., 2014, Díaz et al., 2011, Shah et al., 2009) are already
    in use. Therefore, the future works have scope of working on these non-conventional
    resource based WSNs. • Simplification of the existing solutions are needed: The
    end-user of most of the targeted agricultural applications are the farmers. Thus,
    the designed platforms and solutions are envisioned to be simplified in terms
    of usability. In this regard, the human–computer interaction issues such as accessibility
    and usability are required to be taken care of. • The present works may further
    be improved for different climatic conditions, crop and soil types: Most of the
    existing developments does not takes care of the real-time climate parameters.
    However, to enable precision, integration of the environmental parameters are
    necessary. 6. Future work direction There are many potential applications of WSNs
    in the agriculture and farming area. The current state-of-the-art includes most
    works on irrigation management, vineyard production monitoring, and crop disease
    prediction. 6.1. Factors for improvement The factors associated with WSNs that
    need further attention in the future are listed as follows. • Cost: A low cost
    solution is always desirable for increasing the scope and outreach of the applications.
    • Autonomous operation: The future solutions should include the provision for
    autonomous operations surviving for long time. • Intelligence: An inherent intelligence,
    which will enable the futuristic solutions to react dynamically to multiple challenges
    – from conserving energy to real-time response. • Portability: For easy of application,
    portability of the system is essential. Recent advances in embedded systems, such
    as System in package (SiP) and System on Chip (SoC) technologies will help in
    this regard. • Low maintenance: It is essential to design a system which require
    minimum maintenance effort. This will certainly minimize the average cost in the
    long run. • Energy-efficiency: To ensure extended lifetime with autonomous operation,
    the solutions need to be more energy-efficient by incorporating intelligent algorithms.
    • Robust architecture: A robust and fault-tolerant architecture for the emerging
    applications is required to ensure sustained operation. • Ease of operation: Typically,
    the end users of these applications are non-technical persons. Therefore, these
    applications need to be simple and easy to use. • Interoperability: Interoperability
    between different components and different communication technologies will enhance
    the overall functionality of the system. In addition to the global challenges,
    there are specific problems in Indian scenarios with respect to the agricultural
    WSN systems. We list few India specific challenges in the following. • Cost: The
    high cost of the sensors and associated systems is the major deterrent for these
    applications in the LMICs. • Variable climate & soil: The most challenging part
    in designing a WSN-based system for agriculture for India is the different temperature
    and soil types throughout the country. The application parameters are required
    to be tuned such as to function properly at different locations. • Segmented land
    structure: Unlike the USA, India has partitioned farming land, a specific challenge
    which demands suitable deployment architecture for WSN-based agricultural applications
    like irrigation management. • Average farmer requirement: In India, the average
    land holding per farmer is also lower than global scenario. Due to this, smaller
    and personalized systems are in demand. • Overall plan: An overall planning, considering
    the segmented land structure and farmer requirement, is required for attaining
    success in bringing automation in agriculture and farming domain. 6.2. Futuristic
    applications In recent times, with the advent of the new technical concepts such
    as sensor-cloud technology, big-data analytics, Internet of Things (IoT), new
    applications are envisioned. We briefly describe such concepts, and enlist a few
    potential futuristic applications in the following. • Sensor-cloud computing:
    sensor-cloud computing refers to the on-field WSN applications empowered with
    cloud computing (Ojha et al., 2014, Alamri et al., 2013, Zhu et al., 2014). This
    integrated framework benefits the WSNs with improved processing power and storage
    capacity. Furthermore, sensor-cloud improves the data management and access control
    while increasing the resource utilization. Few potential application for the agricultural
    domain are, – A cloud-enabled storage of spatial variation of soil and environmental
    profile with respect to different seasons is need to be developed. – Crop health
    monitoring and yield prediction using mobile sensor-cloud services. – Designing
    a sensor-cloud controlled smart irrigation system for large fields. – To design
    a sensor-cloud operated environment control system for off-season production of
    vegetables and flowers in greenhouse farming. • Big-data analytics: Big-data analytics
    techniques are applied to find meaningful insight from large volume of data with
    various data types (Kim et al., 2014, Nabrzyski et al., 2014). Big-data analytics
    based techniques are helpful for finding hidden correlations, unknown patterns,
    business trends, customer preferences, detecting crimes and disasters, etc. We
    list few big-data application for the agricultural domain as, – Building crop
    growth and disease management models based on farm data. – Designing a web-enabled
    analytics service for the farmers to provide improved information on agriculture.
    – Easy farming equipment control system for large-scale agriculture field. – Decision
    support service to improve crop productivity with optimal cost considering a large-scale
    contextual agricultural and climatic information. – Optimal policy determination
    based on data analytics for government and industries. • Internet of things: IoT
    extends the ubiquitous computing concepts with heterogeneous smart devices or
    ‘things’ integrated with interoperable communication technologies (Atzori et al.,
    2010, Gubbi et al., 2013, Morais et al., 2008, Ye et al., 2013, Al-Fuqaha et al.,
    2015). The IoT paradigm defines ‘things’ which are capable of identifying, communicating
    and interacting with their surrounding. Empowered by these pillars, IoT provides
    flexible control mechanism for on-field parameters in real-time. Due to this,
    IoT is a potential solution for various agricultural applications. Few potential
    IoT-based agricultural applications are, – Cost-effective agricultural supply
    chain management using RFID tags. – Remote monitoring of animal movement in open
    pastures. – Automated pest counting and remote reporting in farms. – Remote control
    and scheduling of pesticide sprays at an user-defined rate and time. – Leak detection
    and remote water flow control in large-scale agricultural field water supply.
    7. Conclusion The inclusion of WSNs is envisioned to be useful for advancing the
    agricultural and farming industries by introducing new dimensions. In this survey,
    we present a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art in WSN deployment for
    advanced agricultural applications. First, we introduced the variants of WSNs—the
    terrestrial WSNs and underground WSNs. Then, we highlighted various applications
    of WSNs, and their potential to solve various farming problems. The consecutive
    sections of this paper presented the network and node architectures of WSNs, the
    associated factors, and classification according to different applications. We
    review the various available wireless sensor nodes, and the different communication
    techniques followed by these nodes. Then, using case studies, we discussed the
    existing WSN deployments for different farming applications, globally and in India.
    Finally, we presented the prospects and problems associated with the existing
    applications. Finally, we listed several directions for future research with associated
    factors for improvement. The survey of the existing works directs us in concluding
    few remarks. The current state-of-the-art offers WSN-based solutions for irrigation
    management, crop disease prediction, vineyard precision farming mostly. Simplified,
    low cost, and scalable systems are in demand, specifically for the LMICs. At the
    same time, with the advent of modern technologies, there exist a lot of scope
    for innovating new and efficient systems. Specifically, low cost solution with
    features like autonomous operation, low maintenance is in demand. Overall, futuristic
    pre-planning is required for the success of these applications specifically to
    overcome the problems in global as well as LMICs. Acknowledgement This work is

    \ 3 August 2017\nAbstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) can be used in agriculture\
    \ to provide farmers with a\nlarge amount of information. Precision agriculture\
    \ (PA) is a management strategy that employs\ninformation technology to improve\
    \ quality and production. Utilizing wireless sensor technologies\nand management\
    \ tools can lead to a highly effective, green agriculture. Based on PA management,\n\
    the same routine to a crop regardless of site environments can be avoided. From\
    \ several perspectives,\nﬁeld management can improve PA, including the provision\
    \ of adequate nutrients for crops and the\nwastage of pesticides for the effective\
    \ control of weeds, pests, and diseases. This review outlines the\nrecent applications\
    \ of WSNs in agriculture research as well as classiﬁes and compares various wireless\n\
    communication protocols, the taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques for\nWSNs that can be used in agricultural monitoring systems, and\
    \ comparison between early research\nworks on agriculture-based WSNs. The challenges\
    \ and limitations of WSNs in the agricultural domain\nare explored, and several\
    \ power reduction and agricultural management techniques for long-term\nmonitoring\
    \ are highlighted. These approaches may also increase the number of opportunities\
    \ for\nprocessing Internet of Things (IoT) data.\nKeywords: energy-efﬁcient; energy\
    \ harvesting; precision agriculture; wireless communication\ntechnology; WSN\n\
    1. Introduction\nWireless sensor network (WSN) technologies have rapidly developed\
    \ over the years. Ecological\nphenomena in a vast area can be monitored using\
    \ pervasive devices called motes or sensor nodes.\nBattery-powered WSNs comprise\
    \ several sensors, processors, and radio frequency (RF) modules.\nThe sensor nodes\
    \ or motes can communicate wirelessly through a communication link and forward\n\
    their data to a base station or coordinator node by communicating with a gateway.\
    \ The communication\namong sensor nodes depends on the merging of diverse sensors\
    \ from simple (i.e., humidity, pressure,\nand temperature) to complex (i.e., localization,\
    \ tracking, micro-radars, and images), thereby allowing\nWSNs to monitor a wide\
    \ range of surroundings to obtain precise information from the ﬁeld [1].\nAccordingly,\
    \ the sensing, storage, processing, and communication capabilities of sensor nodes\
    \ have\ncontinuously increased [2].\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781; doi:10.3390/s17081781\n\
    www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n2 of 45\nWSNs have been\
    \ used in different applications, such as military, agriculture, sports, medicine,\
    \ and\nindustry. Agriculture can be considered as one of the most favorable facilities\
    \ for WSNs to improve\nfood crop yields and minimize the burden of farmers [3].\
    \ Several projects have been introduced in\nthe precision agriculture (PA) literature.\
    \ PA aims to prevent the application of the same management\nroutine to a crop\
    \ regardless of site circumstances and to improve ﬁeld management from several\n\
    perspectives. For instance, PA can minimize the wastage of pesticides for the\
    \ effective control of weeds,\npests, and diseases as well as guarantee that crops\
    \ receive an adequate amount of nutrients, thereby\nleading to a highly effective,\
    \ green agriculture. Speciﬁcally, PA is a management strategy that employs\ninformation\
    \ technology to improve agricultural quality and production. PA differs for traditional\n\
    farming in the sense that this process accurately identiﬁes variations and relates\
    \ the spatial data to\nmanagement activities. PA involves ﬁve stages, namely,\
    \ (i) data collection, (ii) diagnosis, (iii) data\nanalysis, (iv) precision ﬁeld\
    \ operation, and (v) evaluation [4].\nWSNs are used as cost-effective processes\
    \ to increase agricultural yield. Accordingly, WSNs have\nbeen used in different\
    \ agricultural applications, such as for monitoring climate and using soil nutrient\n\
    data to forecast the health of crops and the quality of agricultural products.\
    \ Irrigation planning can\nbe predicted using WSNs by observing weather conditions\
    \ (such as temperature and humidity) and\nsoil moisture. Other sensor nodes can\
    \ be added to the existing WSN to improve the parameters of the\nagricultural\
    \ monitoring system and to make the network scalable. However, some challenges\
    \ have\nhindered the agricultural application of WSNs, such as determining optimum\
    \ deployment schemes,\nmeasurement periods, routing protocols, energy efﬁciency,\
    \ cost, communication range, scalability, and\nfault tolerance [5]. For example,\
    \ the scattered deployment of sensor nodes with a long data-gathering\nperiod\
    \ can help extend the network lifetime. However, some factors may challenge the\
    \ selection of the\ndistribution region. When the agricultural ﬁeld faces many\
    \ obstacles, the communication link may\nbe weakened or lost as a result of signal\
    \ attenuation. The sensor nodes in WSNs are supplied from\nthe battery, thereby\
    \ preventing connections to the main supply in the deployment location. Reducing\n\
    power depletion and prolonging battery life are imperative for WSNs considering\
    \ their limited battery\npower. Although the application of WSNs has increased\
    \ constantly over the years, the manufacturing\nof batteries has not developed\
    \ at the same rate [6]. Therefore, WSNs are mainly limited by their\nbatteries\
    \ [7]. Among the aforementioned challenges, this paper focuses on energy management\
    \ and\nhighlights energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting techniques that can be\
    \ used in agriculture.\nTo fulﬁll PA requirements, such as addressing the problems\
    \ resulting from the long distance\nbetween farms and base stations, a mobile\
    \ data connection service can be established by connecting\nunmanned aerial vehicles\
    \ or drones with the base station [4]. Such connection allows the sensor nodes\n\
    to relay their data to the base station within the wide area of the farm ﬁeld.\
    \ However, this solution is\nlimited by the quality of service of WSNs.\nThe main\
    \ contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n(i)\nThe potential of\
    \ using wireless communications protocols or technologies in agriculture was\n\
    investigated, and the technology with the best power consumption and communication\
    \ distance\nwas identiﬁed.\n(ii)\nThe taxonomy of energy-efﬁcient and energy harvesting\
    \ techniques was examined to address the\npower consumption problems in agriculture\
    \ and to identify those methods that are most suitable\nfor solving these problems.\n\
    (iii)\nThe existing solutions, applicability, and limitations of applying WSNs\
    \ in agriculture were\nreviewed and compared.\n(iv)\nRecent studies using WSN\
    \ in PA applications based on Internet of Things (IoT) were surveyed\nand compared\
    \ in terms of type of sensors and actuators, IoT end devices, IoT platforms, and\
    \ IoT\napplication layer.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n3 of 45\n2. Wireless Communication\
    \ Technologies for Agriculture\nThis section presents the different wireless protocols\
    \ and standards that are used in agriculture.\nThese wireless technologies are\
    \ also compared to identify the most convenient technology in terms of\npower\
    \ consumption and communication range, where the two metrics are posed challenges\
    \ in current\nsolution of agriculture application [5,8]. IoT is a revolution for\
    \ the future realm where everything\nthat can utilize a connection will be connected.\
    \ Cellular technologies are grown and developed to\nplay a crucial role in the\
    \ IoT realm [9]. Narrowband-IoT (NB-IoT) is a new IoT system constructed\nfrom\
    \ current Long Term Evolution (LTE) functionalities. Subsequently, NB-IoT is possible\
    \ to share the\nspectrum of LTE without coexistence problems and to utilize the\
    \ same pieces of equipment, as well\nas it is possible to connect seamlessly into\
    \ the LTE main network. This permits all network facilities\nsuch as security,\
    \ tracking, policy, charging, and authentication to be totally supported [10].\
    \ The design\ngoals of NB-IoT cover high coverage area, extended battery life\
    \ (i.e., 10 years), high network size\n(52,000 devices/channel/cell), and low-cost\
    \ devices [10,11]. However, in the near future, NB-IoT\ntechnologies, such as\
    \ Long Range radio (LoRa) will take place in agricultural applications due to\
    \ low\npower consumption and preferably used when the agricultural information\
    \ are to be transmitted over\nlong distances.\n2.1. ZigBee Wireless Protocol\n\
    ZigBee wireless protocol is considered one of the best candidate technologies\
    \ for the agriculture\nand farming domains. Given its low duty cycle, ZigBee is\
    \ considered appropriate for PA applications,\nsuch as irrigation supervision\
    \ [12], water quality management, and fertilizer and pesticide control,\nall of\
    \ which require a cyclic information update. Based on this technology, the sensor\
    \ nodes in the\nagricultural ﬁeld can communicate with the router or coordinator\
    \ node over a long range (i.e., 100 m)\nwhen XBee Series 2 is used. ZigBee can\
    \ also reduce the communication distance by up to 30 m for\nindoor conditions\
    \ (i.e., greenhouses) [13]. The number of deployed sensor and router nodes will\
    \ be\nincreased to cover the entire ﬁeld area under surveillance. Some studies\
    \ have employed Zigbee for PA.\nFor instance, ZigBee was used to investigate the\
    \ effect of signal strength on node spacing, base station\nantenna height, and\
    \ leaf density [14]. In [14], three experiments were conducted in palm orchards\
    \ in\nto evaluate a signal propagation model based on the received signal strength\
    \ indicator (RSSI) of the\nZigBee wireless protocol. Through their experiments,\
    \ the authors concluded that the wireless channel\npropagation model must be determined\
    \ before deploying the sensor nodes in palm orchards to obtain\nrobust signal\
    \ strength characteristics. A path loss model in a mango greenhouse was investigated\n\
    based on the ZigBee wireless protocol [15].\nA cattle-localization-system-based\
    \ ZigBee WSN was also applied in a grazing ﬁeld [16]. Instead of\nrequiring additional\
    \ hardware, ZigBee relies on link quality indication (LQI) to measure distance.\
    \ The\nZigBee protocol achieves cattle localization at a low power consumption\
    \ and minimum cost. The key\nparameters of greenhouse climate (i.e., humidity,\
    \ temperature, CO2, and solar radiation) are considered\nin [17] to ensure the\
    \ comfortable growth of plants with 22% energy savings and 33% water usage.\n\
    ZigBee and Global System for Mobile communication/General Packet Radio Service\
    \ (GSM/GPRS)\ntechnologies were used to monitor and control the climate condition\
    \ of greenhouses [17]. The ZigBee\nwireless protocol has also been used to monitor\
    \ animal behavior (e.g., walking, grazing, lying down,\nand standing) [18]. ZigBee\
    \ was also adopted in [18] to overcome the high power consumption and\nunreliability\
    \ issues in mobile ad hoc WSNs.\nA WSN-based greenhouse that uses ZigBee star\
    \ topology is merged with artiﬁcial intelligence\n(i.e., fuzzy logic controller)\
    \ in [19]. The ZigBee wireless protocol is adopted to preserve energy by\nswitching\
    \ between active and sleep states. Thus, power consumption can be minimized, and\
    \ the\nbattery lifetime of sensor nodes can be extended. ZigBee is currently applied\
    \ in smart beehives [20],\norange orchards [21], dairy healthcare monitoring of\
    \ cows in pastures and barns [22], automation in\nirrigation [23], greenhouse\
    \ monitoring systems [24,25], and livestock monitoring [26]. As a universal\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n4 of 45\nstandard for WSNs, the ZigBee protocol was used\
    \ in several agricultural applications because of its\nlow power consumption,\
    \ low cost, self-forming characteristics, and suitable communication range.\n\
    2.2. Bluetooth (BT) Wireless Protocol\nThe BT standard has been utilized to establish\
    \ a communication link between movable and\nportable devices, such as laptops,\
    \ over a short distance of up to 10 m. Given its pervasive nature\nand availability\
    \ in most mobile devices, BT has been employed to satisfy multi-level agricultural\n\
    requirements [5].\nWeather information, soil moisture, sprinkler position, and\
    \ temperature are\nmonitored remotely using Global Positioning System (GPS) and\
    \ BT technologies. The proposed\nsystem in [27] was developed for irrigation application\
    \ to increase ﬁeld productivity and conserve\nwater. The irrigation application\
    \ proposed in [28] collects ﬁeld information in real time via the BT\nwireless\
    \ communication protocol. Several software and hardware were developed in [29]\
    \ to monitor\nthe relative humidity and temperature in greenhouses based on BT.\
    \ The BT module was employed in\nintegrated control method [30] to control the\
    \ irrigation system in greenhouses based on soil and weather\ninformation, and\
    \ this technology improved the leaf number, height, dry weight, and fresh weight\n\
    of red and romaine lettuce in greenhouses. Result of estimation for water usage\
    \ and electricity also\nimproved by 90% based on integrated control method using\
    \ BT technology relative to the traditional\nmethod (i.e., timer control strategy).\
    \ Given its low energy consumption, wide availability, and ease of\nuse for farmers,\
    \ smartphone-based BT has been employed in different agricultural applications\
    \ [31–35],\nsuch as controlling irrigation systems, monitoring soil and weather\
    \ conditions, and controlling the use\nof fertilizers and pesticides.\n2.3. WiFi\
    \ Wireless Protocol\nWiFi is currently the most extensively utilized wireless\
    \ technology available in portable devices,\nincluding tablets, smartphones, laptops,\
    \ and desktops. WiFi has a suitable communication distance of\nabout 20 m and\
    \ 100 m in indoor and outdoor environments, respectively. In PA applications,\
    \ WiFi\nextends diverse architectures by connecting several types of devices via\
    \ an ad hoc network. WiFi and\n3G wireless technologies were employed in [36]\
    \ to estimate the agricultural applications of mobile\nphones. Remote access and\
    \ short message services have also been used for controlling and monitoring\n\
    protected crops. In [37], agricultural data, such as soil temperature, soil moisture,\
    \ weather temperature\nand humidity, sunlight intensity, and CO2, were stored\
    \ in a gateway before they were transmitted\nto the server computer over a WiFi\
    \ network. A Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11g)-based smart WSN is proposed\nfor agricultural\
    \ monitoring in [38]. The proposed system consists of three nodes: sensor, router,\
    \ and\nserver. The climate conditions of the greenhouse or agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ such as humidity, temperature,\nair pressure, light, water level, and soil moisture,\
    \ are monitored. The said work attempts to lower cost,\nminimize wiring connections,\
    \ and enhance the mobility and ﬂexibility of the sensing points in WSN.\nHowever,\
    \ the energy consumption of the proposed system is extremely high at 42.17 J/h.\n\
    Given that WiFi requires much power [5], long communication time, and huge data\
    \ payload [26].\nWiFi technology is not preferable for agricultural applications\
    \ in spite of the fact that a Wi-Fi server\nprevents data losses by adopting data\
    \ redundancy techniques. In addition, WiFi cannot be employed\nfor multi-hope\
    \ applications and inﬂuenced by number of users and the signal intensity; thereby,\n\
    it is inappropriate for agriculture WSNs. Moreover, the WiFi nodes listen all\
    \ the time, so power\nconsumption will increase [39].\n2.4. GPRS/3G/4G Technology\n\
    General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a packet data service for GSM-based cellular\
    \ phones.\nGPRS frequently experiences variable delays and throughputs, and such\
    \ technology depends on the\nvolume of consumers that share the same communication\
    \ channels and resources. Gutiérrez et al. [40]\nused the GPRS module and WSN\
    \ to develop an automatic crop irrigation system based on the\ninformation collected\
    \ by temperature and soil moisture sensors installed at the root zone of plants,\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n5 of 45\nand considered this system a cost-effective and\
    \ practical solution for improving water quality in\nPA. A drip irrigation process\
    \ was evaluated in [41] by measuring soil moisture. A prototype system\nwas also\
    \ developed based on a data management server and a WSN-GPRS gateway. WSN-GPRS\n\
    gateway acts as a bridge between WSN and GPRS where the data from the WSN are\
    \ transferred to a\ndata management center. Navarro-Hellín et al. [42] equipped\
    \ various wireless nodes with GPRS to\nmeasure and transmit soil, plant, and atmosphere\
    \ information. The wireless nodes have unlimited\nautonomy because of their independent\
    \ nature and use of solar energy. Different sensors may transmit\ninformation\
    \ to a remote location via a GPRS network for further analysis by using tablets,\
    \ mobile\nphones, or computers. All agriculture sensors are interfaced to the\
    \ sensor board to obtain agricultural\ninformation. Such information is transmitted\
    \ to the remote server for further analysis through the\nGPRS-board, which depends\
    \ on a GSM/GPRS mobile network.\n2.5. Long Range Radio (LoRa) Protocol\nLoRa is\
    \ introduced by the LoRa Alliance as a protocol stack for low power and wide area\
    \ Internet\nof Things (IoT) communication technologies that are associated with\
    \ indoor transmission [43]. The\nbasic network architecture of a LoRaWAN consists\
    \ of LoRa end devices, LoRa gateways, and a LoRa\nnetwork server. The LoRa end\
    \ device communicates with gateways that employ LoRa with LoRaWAN.\nLoRa gateways\
    \ pass raw LoRaWAN packets from the end devices to a LoRa network server with\n\
    a high throughput based on the backhaul interface, which is typically 3G or Ethernet.\
    \ Accordingly,\nLoRa gateways act as a bidirectional communication or protocol\
    \ adapter with the LoRa network\nserver. In this case, the LoRa network server\
    \ takes charge of decoding the data packets transmitted by\nthe LoRa devices and\
    \ creating the frames that would be directed back to the devices. LoRa offers\
    \ a\nbidirectional solution that matches machine-to-machine (M2M) WiFi or cellular\
    \ technologies. LoRa\npresents a cost-effective method for linking batteries or\
    \ mobile devices to the network or to end devices.\nThe LoRa wireless protocol\
    \ was used in [44] to monitor bee colonies in rural areas and to ensure a\ncommunication\
    \ between the bee node and the local server that is located in a remote location.\
    \ The\nsoil moisture and temperature, air temperature and humidity, and light\
    \ intensity inside greenhouses\nwere also monitored using different sensors, microcontrollers,\
    \ and the LoRa wireless protocol [8]. The\nLoRa gateway collects data from LoRa\
    \ nodes to construct the topology of a star network, and may\ncommunicate with\
    \ a cloud server over a long communication range and with high scalability.\n\
    LoRa was recently utilized in several agriculture research projects developed\
    \ by the Libelium\nCompany (Zaragoza, Spain) [45], such as improving kiwi production\
    \ based on a smart irrigation system\n(Italy), monitoring of green areas by using\
    \ a smart garden system (Spain), improving fertilization\nmethods of corn yields\
    \ (Italy), improving production of banana yields (Colombia), increasing\ntobacco\
    \ crops by controlling the climate condition (Italy), saving water through a smart\
    \ irrigation\nsystem (Barcelona), monitoring of vineyard crops (Spain), and monitoring\
    \ of diseases that affect\nvineyards (Switzerland).\n2.6. SigFox Protocol\nSigFox\
    \ is an ultra-narrowband wireless cellular network [43] with low data rate applications,\n\
    thereby making this technology appropriate for IoT and machine-type communications\
    \ systems.\nSigFox has been used in different applications, including telephone,\
    \ security, mobile, broadband, and\ntelevision. The SigFox network was used in\
    \ [46,47] to construct a geolocation system that localizes\nanimals in mountain\
    \ pastures throughout the summer. A system was proposed in [46] to help farmers\n\
    locate their cattle and enhance their production. The importance of power consumption\
    \ analyses was\nhighlighted in [47], especially when the cattle are located in\
    \ high mountainous areas.\n2.7. Performance Comparison of Wireless Communication\
    \ Protocols\nTable 1 compares the aforementioned wireless communication protocols\
    \ or technologies relative\nto different parameters, including power consumption,\
    \ communication range, data rate, cost, system\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n6 of 45\n\
    complexity, and other parameters. The challenges in agricultural applications\
    \ may be developed from\nthe selection of the deployment range. For instance,\
    \ the transmitted signal by the sensor node is\nattenuated when the agriculture\
    \ ﬁeld is separated by obstacles. Power consumption is considered as\nanother\
    \ limitation in the WSN design in agricultural applications [5]. The ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol was\ndesigned to run with a suitable communication range and low power\
    \ consumption. LoRa and SigFox\nare considered to work with low power consumption\
    \ and long radio range. Accordingly, the power\nconsumption and communication\
    \ distance of the above technologies have been assessed as follows.\nZigbee and\
    \ Bluetooth low energy (BLE) are designed for battery-powered devices.\nThese\n\
    technologies conserve power through low duty cycling and enter sleep mode to extend\
    \ the battery\nlifetime. Classic BT, WiFi, GPRS, LoRa, and SigFox have a higher\
    \ power consumption than ZigBee.\nAlthough ZigBee has a shorter communication\
    \ range than LoRa, SigFox, and GPRS, this range may be\nextended with a router\
    \ node to overcome the node deployment limitations in agricultural applications.\n\
    BLE outperforms ZigBee in terms of power consumption, but this wireless protocol\
    \ is limited in\nagricultural applications because of its short communication\
    \ distance of 10 m, as reported in [48].\nZigBee also has a higher network elasticity\
    \ than BT, thereby permitting various topologies. Given the\nlarge number of nodes\
    \ (more than 65,000) in the ZigBee network, the ZigBee technology can be used\n\
    to cover a wide agricultural. Accordingly, the ZigBee wireless protocol has been\
    \ adopted in many\nagriculture studies [5,49–53]. One of these studies [5] prefers\
    \ to utilize ZigBee in farming domains and\nagricultural applications owing to\
    \ its energy-efﬁcient, reliable, and low-cost wireless protocol.\nThe LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol covers a large communication area with low power consumption.\nTherefore,\
    \ it can be suitably deployed in vast agricultural ﬁelds. The network size of\
    \ the LoRa protocol\nis limited by its duty cycle, where a 1% duty cycle can lead\
    \ to a maximum communication time of 36 s\nper hour for each end device [54].\
    \ In addition, LoRa gateways have a limited message capacity of less\nthan 100\
    \ messages per minute because of the unplanned deployment of LoRa gateways in\
    \ urban areas,\nthereby interfering with low power wireless area networks, such\
    \ as SigFox. Therefore, increasing the\nnumber of gateways can challenge the infrastructure\
    \ of the LoRa network [54]. Moreover, the LoRa\ntechnology is complex and has\
    \ sizable hardware implementations [55].\nSigFox has an extremely low data rate\
    \ (100 bps) and slow transmission time (10 s for 10 bytes)\ncompared with ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa [56]. SigFox supports star topology supervised by a centralized sever\n\
    that manages connectivity between devices and the base stations, whereas the LoRa\
    \ supports wide\narea network based on star-to-star topology creating a bridge\
    \ of LoRa gateways. Given that data rate\nand transmission time are both critical\
    \ issue in any communication system, SigFox cannot be widely\nused for agricultural\
    \ applications. Moreover, this technology does not support the collision avoidance\n\
    scheme, thereby affecting the network because several M2M devices may be operated\
    \ in the same\narea. Moreover, SigFox has a limited reliability because of its\
    \ one-way communication (without an\nacknowledgment signal) and low received power.\
    \ However, both the LoRa and SigFox infrastructures\nare still in progress. Ali\
    \ et al. further discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].\nFrom the above\
    \ discussion and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1\nand\
    \ as will be shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been\
    \ identiﬁed\nas the most suitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications\
    \ because of their low power\nconsumption, communication range (acceptable for\
    \ ZigBee and long for LoRa), small size, easy\nnetwork implementation, simplicity,\
    \ low latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size.\nSensors 2017, 17,\
    \ 1781\n7 of 45\n \ninfrastructures are still in progress. Ali et al. further\
    \ discuss the limitations of these protocols [56].  \nFrom the above discussion\
    \ and the comparison results presented in Table 1 and Figure 1 and as \nwill be\
    \ shown in Tables 2–8 the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols have been identified\
    \ as the most \nsuitable wireless protocols for agricultural applications because\
    \ of their low power consumption, \ncommunication range (acceptable for ZigBee\
    \ and long for LoRa), small size, easy network \nimplementation, simplicity, low\
    \ latency (for ZigBee), scalability, and network size. \n \nFigure 1. Different\
    \ wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and communication \ndistance.\
    \ \nFigure 1. Different wireless technologies in terms of power consumption and\
    \ communication distance.\nPA using sensors, actuator, processor, wireless transceiver,\
    \ and other information technologies,\npotentially permits manufacturers to computerize\
    \ site-speciﬁc management for automated agriculture.\nIn terms of precision, the\
    \ considered wireless protocols for agricultural applications have improved\n\
    the agriculture domain. Precision irrigation is frequently regarded as optimizing\
    \ irrigation accuracy\ndue to its ability to control the optimum amount of water\
    \ and irrigation time. The water savings\nof 90% (based on ZigBee), 33% (based\
    \ on ZigBee), 50% (based on Bluetooth), and 90% (based on\nBluetooth) were achieved\
    \ for precision irrigation systems relative to traditional irrigation systems\
    \ in\nresearch [17,28,30,40], respectively. Animal behavior, such as laying down,\
    \ standing, grazing, walking,\nand other modes, was monitored in [18] using ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. The authors found that\nlaying down and grazing could be\
    \ improved by 83.5% compared with the ﬁndings from similar\nstudies. In another\
    \ study that has adopted a proposed algorithm that depended on the ZigBee wireless\n\
    protocol [20], an accuracy rate of 95.4% was expected for the proposed algorithm\
    \ to monitor the\nhoney bee and the agricultural and environmental aspects. In\
    \ [23], the automation of the irrigation\nsystem based on ZigBee saved the system\
    \ cost between 1.24% and 6.72% relative to the entire cost\nof the water user\
    \ associations, with energy savings of 2.05 to 8.21% and water savings of 0.71\
    \ to\n6.46%. The proposed model in [35] utilized a smartphone platform (based\
    \ on Bluetooth and GSM\ntechnologies) and permitted three types of irrigation\
    \ systems. The efﬁciency factors were improved\nby 90% for subsurface drip type\
    \ and 85% and 75% for high- and low-pressure overhead sprinkler\ntypes, respectively,\
    \ to compute for drift and evaporation before the water droplets approached the\n\
    soil. 3G technology was adopted by Libelium based on Waspmote wireless sensor\
    \ devices to monitor\nthe vineyards in Northwest Spain [57]. Phytosanitary treatments,\
    \ such as fungicides and fertilizers,\nwere minimized by 20% and growing yields\
    \ were enhanced by 15% based on PA. In [8], LoRa wireless\nprotocol was considered\
    \ to monitor the agriculture environments with 90% power efﬁciency. The cost\n\
    of pumping and water for precision irrigation system in green areas was reduced\
    \ by 30% based on\nSigFox wireless protocol [58].\nThe preceding survey for different\
    \ agricultural applications revealed that PA can be achieved\nin terms of water\
    \ savings, animal behavior, accuracy, power efﬁciency, and reducing system cost\n\
    for various wireless protocols. Consequently, agriculture can be improved based\
    \ on agricultural\nautomation systems compared with traditional agriculture systems.\n\

    \ may operate at different energy states. Therefore, the lifespan of a sensor\
    \ node is the\ntime consumed to exhaust its batteries under a sustainable operation\
    \ threshold.\nNumerous scholars have developed power reduction techniques to provide\
    \ sensor nodes an\ninﬁnite lifespan. This section reviews several power reduction\
    \ techniques of WSNs that can be used in\nagricultural applications. The purposes,\
    \ wireless protocols, ﬁndings, advantages, and limitations of\neach technique\
    \ are also discussed.\n3.1.1. Sleep/Wake Strategy\nWireless transceivers consume\
    \ a signiﬁcant amount of power relative to processors. The energy\nof the wireless\
    \ nodes is mostly dissipated during the reception and transmission processes.\
    \ The radio\nof sensor nodes can enter sleep mode via the sleep/wake strategy\
    \ to reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of WSNs. No data communication\
    \ occurs during the sleep mode. The sensor\nnodes wake up to collect and transmit\
    \ data within a certain period and then return to sleep mode\nto conserve energy.\
    \ In agricultural applications, the sleep/wake strategy is implemented via (i)\
    \ duty\ncycling, (ii) medium-access control (MAC) protocols, and (iii) topology\
    \ control.\nDuty cycle is proposed in several studies to lower the power consumption\
    \ for different agricultural\napplications based on WSN. Zhang et al. [69] proposed\
    \ a WSN-based system to monitor soil moisture\nand analyzed the temporal and spatial\
    \ variability of soil moisture for variable irrigation. To reduce the\npower consumption\
    \ of the soil sensor nodes, the soil moisture sensors were always in sleep mode\
    \ and\nactivated only when data were to be collected. Million et al. [70] designed\
    \ a WSN for PA in Malawi\nand called it WiPAM. This system was intended to automate\
    \ irrigation and implement an irrigation\nmanagement system (IMS). The authors\
    \ investigated soil moisture variability. The sensor nodes\nwere homogeneous,\
    \ and each was composed of a ZigBee end device (ZED) and a ZigBee coordinator\n\
    (ZC). In the star topology, three sensors nodes were conﬁgured as ZED (in ﬁeld-nodes)\
    \ and one as a\ngateway node. Another node was conﬁgured as ZC for aggregating\
    \ data and actuating the irrigation\nvalves. The power source to sustain the operation\
    \ of the network was solar power. This approach\nwas complemented by an energy-efﬁcient\
    \ management approach. In other words, sensor nodes went\nto sleep when idle and\
    \ woke up to transmit data when required. The irrigation valves opened or\nclosed\
    \ depending on the values stored in the coordinator node. Ouadjaout et al. [71]\
    \ presented an\nenergy-efﬁcient WSN for soil moisture monitoring in an irrigation\
    \ system. The new platform, DZ50,\nconsists of an RFM12b transceiver and an ATmega328P\
    \ microcontroller. This platform consumes very\nlow power, and much energy can\
    \ be saved in sleep mode, in which the transceiver goes inactive (sleep\nmode)\
    \ for long periods. Comparison showed that the performance of DZ50 is better than\
    \ that of\nTelosB and MicaZ. Speciﬁcally, the battery lifetime of DZ50 is seven\
    \ times that of TelosB and MicaZ\nbased on a 10 s sampling period. Monitoring\
    \ of environmental conditions, such as wind direction,\nwind speed, humidity,\
    \ temperature, conductivity, rain level, pH, and water level, in crop ﬁelds was\n\
    presented in [72]. A solar cell was used to power several sensor nodes deployed\
    \ at a distance of 500 m\nto 5 km. WSNs based on IEEE 802.15.4 (C1120 transceiver)\
    \ and GPRS/3G were adopted to transmit the\nrural environments to the base station.\
    \ Energy was saved through low duty cycling (3.3%) for the RF\ntransceiver; the\
    \ saved energy is equivalent to 30 s of wake up time every 15 min. In addition,\
    \ a 2-watt\nsolar cell was used to supply power to the overall system, whose total\
    \ average power consumption\nwas 207 mW.\nMAC protocols were also proposed in\
    \ previous research on agriculture WSNs [39,73–76].\nSudha et al. [39] proposed\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient TDMA-based algorithm for wireless sensor\ncommunications\
    \ in an automatic irrigation system. Their experiment involved a header node that\n\
    collected data directly from all the nodes in the ﬁeld and passed these data to\
    \ the base station (BS).\nThis network arrangement was a star single-hop topology.\
    \ These techniques attain power savings\nof 10% with a high communication distance\
    \ of 1 km between the sensor node and the base station.\nHowever, when this distance\
    \ increases, the power consumption also increases. López et al. [75]\nproposed\
    \ a WSN for monitoring horticultural yields, which are disseminated among small\
    \ plots\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n11 of 45\nscattered at a communication distance\
    \ of 10 km. The air temperature and soil moisture are collected\nduring a 10-week\
    \ period. The authors adopted the MAC protocol and star topology to conserve the\n\
    power consumption of the sensor nodes that used the IEEE 802.15.4 standard based\
    \ on the CC2420\ntransceiver. The lifetimes of the soil moisture and air temperature\
    \ sensor nodes are 1024 days and\n222 days, respectively, utilizing a battery\
    \ that delivers 2700 mAh.\nThe topology protocol scheme can be used in agricultural\
    \ monitoring WSNs to modify the network\ntopology according to the application\
    \ requirements, thereby reducing the number of active nodes in\na network. Some\
    \ nodes in the network can enter sleep mode to prolong the network lifetime when\n\
    they are not sensing the same area of interest. Aneeth and Jayabarathi [77] implemented\
    \ Ad hoc\nOn-Demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocols\
    \ over a different\ntopology of ZigBee WSN (i.e., cluster topology, random topology,\
    \ star topology with gateway based\non two cases; inside and outside) in simulation\
    \ environments by using the OPNET software (Riverbed,\nSan Francisco, CA, USA).\
    \ Twenty soil moisture sensor nodes and one gateway node were distributed\nin\
    \ a farmland with a dimension of 100 × 100 m2. Each node sends information about\
    \ the soil moisture\nto the gateway node through the ZigBee wireless protocol.\
    \ The gateway node passes the information to\nthe controlling system to control\
    \ the irrigation valve system. Their study showed that the star topology\nusing\
    \ DSR protocol reduces the power consumption of the WSN because it has less routing\
    \ overhead\ncompared with AODV protocol. Table 2 shows the comparison of power\
    \ reduction technique based on\nsleep/wake schemes for previous research in agricultural\
    \ applications.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n12 of 45\nTable 2. Sleep/wake schemes\

    \ power is mostly dissipated in the RF components of WSNs than\nin data processing\
    \ units, such as microcontrollers and microprocessors [80]. A number of scholars\n\
    have applied various radio optimization schemes or techniques, including (i) transmission\
    \ power\ncontrol (TPC), (ii) modulation scheme, and (iii) cognitive radio, to\
    \ reduce the power consumption\nof the RF components of agriculture sensor nodes.\
    \ In the TPC scheme, the sensor nodes modify the\ntransmitted power to save energy,\
    \ stimulate avoiding interference, and establish a communication\nlink [81]. TPC\
    \ can be used in the agricultural ﬁeld [82,83], where the RF transmitted power\
    \ of the\nsensor nodes can be modiﬁed to reduce their power consumption based\
    \ on the measured distance\nbetween the sink node and the sensor nodes. Sahota\
    \ et al. [82] have investigated the application of\nTPC in reducing the power\
    \ consumption of the sensor nodes in precision agriculture-based WSNs.\nSeveral\
    \ power levels and different receiver sensitivity levels are considered to perform\
    \ the said process.\nThe network layers and MAC protocol in a WSN (based on CC1110)\
    \ for the agriculture domain are\nadopted to further lower the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Results show that the power\nsaving that employs multiple\
    \ modes of transmitted power can be improved by approximately 10%\nrelative to\
    \ the traditional mode. By contrast, Kamarudin et al. [83] prolonged the lifetime\
    \ of the sensor\nnode by more than 8.5% by modifying the transmitted power of\
    \ the CC2420 communication device.\nA cognitive radio is an intelligent wireless\
    \ communication network [84] in which the wireless\ncommunication channel in the\
    \ spectrum band can be selected efﬁciently [85]. The transmission metrics\n(e.g.,\
    \ transmitted power, carrier frequency, and modulation scheme) can be adjusted\
    \ accordingly.\nA cognitive radio requires more energy than conventional devices\
    \ do because it includes sophisticated\nand complex functions [86]. Therefore,\
    \ an energy-efﬁcient cognitive radio network poses challenges,\nespecially with\
    \ regard to the use of battery energy. In wireless communication, the electromagnetic\n\
    spectrum is fully occupied, with several bands being partially used or unused.\
    \ This situation supports\nthe utilization of a cognitive radio, in which spectrum\
    \ holes can be utilized.\nSabri et al. [19] fused fuzzy logic control (FLC) with\
    \ a ZigBee wireless sensor actor network\n(WSAN), which can sense the surroundings\
    \ and respond in ideal performance without interference\nfrom agricultural crops.\
    \ FLC assists the specialists in managing complex systems more compared with\n\
    traditional control methods, which are ineffective in terms of ﬂexibility, energy,\
    \ productivity, and labor\ninterference. Two signiﬁcant greenhouse environment\
    \ parameters (i.e., humidity and temperature)\nare monitored during daytime and\
    \ nighttime. The results show that the intelligent technique-based\nFLC can signiﬁcantly\
    \ improve the WSAN lifespan. Therefore, the WSAN can work for 14 years with a\n\
    210 mAh battery power based on the FLC merged with WSAN.\nThe power consumption\
    \ of networks can be directly affected by the modulation scheme [87]. The\nmodulation\
    \ parameters can be adjusted to their optimal values to preserve the minimum power\n\
    consumption of radio modules. Anane et al. [88] investigated the Frequency-shift\
    \ keying (FSK) and\nMinimum-shift keying (MSK) modulation strategies to minimize\
    \ the total power consumption of\nthe sensor node required to transmit given data\
    \ packets. Through their extensive study, the authors\nconcluded that MSK outperforms\
    \ FSK in terms of power consumption. However, several modulation\nschemes cannot\
    \ be used in the ZigBee wireless protocol that operates at 2.4 GHz because this\
    \ protocol\nsupports a single modulation scheme. Speciﬁcally, the ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol works with offset\nquadrature phase-shift keying (OQPSK) [89]. Table\

    \ Data Mitigation\nData mitigation presents another power consumption solution\
    \ for agriculture WSNs to reduce the\namount of data transmitted from source nodes\
    \ to destination nodes. Data mitigation can be achieved\nvia (i) data gathering,\
    \ (ii) data comparison, (iii) data rate, and (iv) data-driven techniques.\nData\
    \ gathering can extend the lifetime of sensor nodes in WSNs by minimizing redundant\
    \ data\ntransmission. In different applications of agriculture WSNs including\
    \ environment observation, the\nsensed data of the neighboring nodes may spatially\
    \ be associated. In this case, data combination\npresents an important method\
    \ for reducing the amount of redundant data, reducing the number\nof transmissions,\
    \ and minimizing the power consumption of the nodes in the network [90]. Data\n\
    gathering also reduces latency by minimizing data trafﬁc and improving the delay\
    \ between the sink\nand sensor nodes; after reducing the number of communications,\
    \ this approach can improve the\nexploitation of bandwidth [91]. Data merging\
    \ can be accomplished along a route starting from sensor\nnodes to sink nodes.\
    \ The nodes in a route can rebroadcast only the maximum, minimum, or average\n\
    amount of received data. The design of an energy-efﬁcient WSN-based data-gathering\
    \ scheme poses a\nsigniﬁcant challenge because this scheme must ensure a trade-off\
    \ among power consumption, latency,\nsecurity, data accuracy, and fault tolerance.\n\
    Gathering data in agricultural applications, including humidity, weather, temperature,\
    \ and soil\nmoisture, can minimize the power consumption of environment sensor\
    \ nodes by spatially correlating\nthe ﬁeld and redundant data of the sensor nodes\
    \ when the temperature does not change signiﬁcantly [1],\nespecially during nighttime.\
    \ For example, if the microcontroller of the temperature sensor node\nmeasures\
    \ the same temperature value for extended hours, then the sensor node sends the\
    \ temperature\nvalue every four hours to reduce power consumption. Merging the\
    \ temperature and humidity\nsensors into a single sensor may also reduce the power\
    \ consumption, size, and system complexity.\nAzaza et al. [17] integrated climate\
    \ condition parameters (i.e., temperature, CO2, humidity, and\nilluminance sensors)\
    \ inside a greenhouse and observed a comfortable growth of plants while saving\n\
    water resources and energy. The greenhouse was equipped with environment control\
    \ devices, such as\nventilation system, fogging system for humidiﬁcation, and\
    \ electrical heaters. A smart system based on\nfuzzy logic control correlated\
    \ humidity and temperature measurements is implemented to improve\nthe fogging\
    \ system operation. In that way, the power consumption of the fogging system can\
    \ be\nsigniﬁcantly reduced. In addition, the system was improved by a wireless\
    \ data observing platform\n(STM 32/F4 microcontroller and Virtex V FPGA board)\
    \ for logging and data routing, which provides\ndata access in real time. The\
    \ suggested control system based on fuzzy logic control was experimentally\nimplemented\
    \ and validated. The results revealed that the total energy and water usage decreased\
    \ by\n22% and 33%, respectively.\nMusaazi et al. [92] introduced a data caching\
    \ algorithm (DCAL) that optimizes the sleep/wake up\nperiods of ZigBee WSNs to\
    \ achieve low energy consumption and latency in PA application. In WSNs,\ndata\
    \ are collected from the source nodes and routed to the sink node; from the sink\
    \ node, the data\nare sent to the Internet. Reducing the transmission of duplicated\
    \ sensed data reduces the power\nconsumption. Energy conservation is paramount\
    \ during the communication phase to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. The\
    \ main method utilized to conserve energy involves switching off the nodes’\n\
    transceiver when they are not transmitting nor receiving packets. Additionally,\
    \ the data-gathering\nmethod for agriculture WSNs has been investigated in [93].\
    \ The proposed system includes ZigBee\nwireless sensor nodes, customized farming\
    \ personal digital assistants (PDAs), and a host PC. Each\nsensor node contains\
    \ four sensors to identify ﬁve agricultural ﬁeld parameters: soil temperature,\
    \ soil\nmoisture, environmental humidity, soil electrical conductivity, and environmental\
    \ temperature. The\nPDA combines the ZigBee coordinator node, GPRS module, and\
    \ GPS module. The ZigBee WSN\ngathers farming data and obtains GPS information\
    \ for each sensor node. It then passes the data to the\nhost PC through GPRS.\
    \ The experimental results show that the battery power of the sensor nodes can\n\
    be saved based on the data-gathering scheme.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n16 of 45\n\
    Data compression is a useful method for deploying sensor nodes with restricted\
    \ energy resources.\nInformation encoding can be performed in sensor nodes, whereas\
    \ information decoding can be\nperformed in sink nodes. Using compression techniques\
    \ to reduce the size of information that the\nsink nodes transmit over wireless\
    \ channels may also reduce the power consumption and extend the\nbattery life\
    \ of the sensor nodes. One study has applied data compression approaches to reduce\
    \ the\npower consumption for auto-irrigation system which based on CC1000 RF module\
    \ [41]. Based on this\nmethod, the battery of the sensor node can be extended\
    \ to 359 days.\nThe data-driven power reduction technique aims to reduce the amount\
    \ of sampled data by\nconserving the sensing accuracy to an appropriate level\
    \ for a speciﬁed application [94]. Thereby,\nthe amount of data to be transmitted\
    \ to the sink nodes can be minimized. Therefore, this technique\ncan reduce the\
    \ power consumption of agriculture WSNs and extend their battery life. A data-driven\n\
    algorithm is considered by Lerdsuwan and Phunchongharn [95] to solve the energy\
    \ consumption\nproblem of the sensor node in PA with low complexity and maintain\
    \ the transmission rate. Their\nexperiment reveals that their proposed algorithm\
    \ has higher energy efﬁciency than the ESPIN and\nSPIN algorithms in [96,97] by\
    \ 36.84% and 81.53%, respectively.\nThe data rate of RF transceivers can be adjusted\
    \ in the physical layer of a wireless protocol to\nreduce the power consumption\
    \ of the sensor node. Davis et al. [98] investigated the low battery\ncondition\
    \ of a sensor node to attain prolonged battery life for separate wireless sensor\
    \ nodes that\ncan preserve sampling suitability and reliability in communicating\
    \ accurate data. Different sensors,\nsuch as those for soil moisture, sap ﬂow,\
    \ and soil water, were examined to study the effect of sensing\ndebility due to\
    \ low battery voltage. The comparison of the data sampling rate of these sensors\
    \ shows\nthat sap ﬂow measurement is the best option for agricultural WSN. This\
    \ ﬁnding is attributed to the\nlow error obtained when the sampling interval increased\
    \ to 15 min while maintaining measurement\naccuracy. Table 4 shows the comparison\

    \ power reduction scheme for agriculture WSNs to minimize\nthe path between sensor\
    \ nodes and sink node, thereby the power consumption of the WSN is reduced.\n\
    Routing protocol can be performed via (i) sink mobility, (ii) multi-path routing,\
    \ (iii) cluster architecture,\nand (iv) routing metric.\nSink mobility was adopted\
    \ in previous research [99,100]. Mathur et al. [99] proposed a novel\nmechanism\
    \ that adopts unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) to gather data from forest regions\
    \ instead\nof classical sensing from nodes deployed in WSN. The proposed method\
    \ enables the UAV to collect\ndata from WSN in harsh terrain and transmit it to\
    \ the base station situated far from the sensing area.\nTherefore, the multi-hop\
    \ transmission between cluster heads can be completely avoided, and the\ncommunication\
    \ range can be extended.\nMulti-path routing has also been suggested by other\
    \ scholars for agriculture WSNs [67,68,101].\nRecently, Nikolidakis et al. [67]\
    \ proposed an agricultural ﬁeld weather monitoring system based on\nthe ZigBee\
    \ wireless protocol. An advance energy-efﬁcient routing protocol was implemented\
    \ for WSN\nto automate irrigation management. The transmitter could modify its\
    \ power based on the distance\nbetween the sensor node and base station to save\
    \ energy. The results revealed that network lifetime\nincreased to 1825 min. Hedley\
    \ et al. [101] developed a WSN soil moisture mapping and monitoring\nmethod to\
    \ provide information for irrigation scheduling. To conserve power, the sensor\
    \ nodes relayed\ndata to the BS every 15 min through the greatest energy-efﬁcient\
    \ route.\nCluster head method is considered by Ndzi et al. [102] to extend the\
    \ ZigBee WSN lifetime for\nagricultural application.\nIn addition, the quality\
    \ of the crop yields is improved and their cost\nis minimized. The research presented\
    \ WSN coverage measurements in a mixed crop farmland.\nAn adaptive energy consumption\
    \ model for each sensor node was proposed and used to compute the\nenergy consumption\
    \ in the network. A deployment model with a cluster head and two antennas was\n\
    also proposed and simulated to alleviate short network lifetime due to the vegetation\
    \ attenuation of\nsignals. This network deployment model extended the lifetime\
    \ of the network by a factor of more than\n20 compared with a deployment where\
    \ cluster heads are not used. Nikolidakis et al. [103] proposed\na new routing\
    \ protocol for WSN that can reduce the power consumption of sensor nodes through\n\
    balanced clustering. This protocol was called “equalized cluster head election\
    \ routing protocol”\n(ECHERP). ECHERP was implemented in Java language for 500\
    \ homogeneous nodes distributed in a\n100 × 100 m2 land. The simulation results\
    \ showed that the proposed protocol outperforms existing\nprotocols in terms of\
    \ power consumption. A potential application of this protocol is PA.\nAnother\
    \ type of routing protocol is called routing metric. Chen et al. [104] used two\
    \ routing\nmetrics, namely, remained energy and expected transmission count, to\
    \ compute the optimal routing\npath to the sink node that ensures low power consumption.\
    \ “A scalable context-aware objective\nfunction (SCAOF)” is proposed by combining\
    \ robustness-aware, energy-aware, resource-aware, and\nreliability-aware contexts\
    \ that render to the compound routing metrics scheme. The experiment is\nconducted\
    \ in a garden based on a testbed, which includes a uIPv6 protocol stack and contiki\
    \ OS. The\nobtained results prove that SCAOF can convey the desired advantages\
    \ on network lifespan prolonging,\nas well as high efﬁciency and reliability in\
    \ different hardware testbeds and simulation scenarios.\nTable 5 shows the comparison\

    \ the power saving or battery lifetime,\ncommunication distance, and limitations\
    \ of WSNs in different agricultural applications in the work of\nseveral scholars\
    \ (Tables 2–6). The tables show that most previous studies used ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol\nfor different agricultural applications. The use of ZigBee supports\
    \ our assumption that this wireless\nprotocol is suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems as discussed in Section 2. A combination of two\nor more power reduction\
    \ schemes was also highlighted by several scholars [106–108] to further lower\n\
    the power consumption of the WSN. Table 6 shows the comparison of power reduction\

    \ Techniques\nA major limitation of sensor nodes is their limited battery capacity.\
    \ Several energy-efﬁcient\nschemes have been introduced in previous research to\
    \ solve the power consumption problem of sensor\nnodes. An alternative method\
    \ that has been utilized to address the problem of limited node lifespan is\n\
    the use of energy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been developed\
    \ to allow sensor\nnodes to harvest different types of energy, such as solar,\
    \ wireless power transfer (WPT), mechanical\nvibration, kinetic, and wind energy,\
    \ from different environments [110] (Figure 2). Compared with\ntraditional sensor\
    \ nodes, rechargeable sensor nodes can work continuously for a long lifetime.\
    \ Ambient\nenergy can be converted to electrical energy and used directly to supply\
    \ the sensor nodes or can be\nstored and used later on. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to prolong the\nlifetime of sensor nodes. Energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques for previous research works employed in\nprecision agriculture are\
    \ shown in Table 7. The said table lists the categories of energy-harvesting\n\
    techniques, types of wireless protocols, and output energy/power of energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques.\nIn addition, the form of agricultural applications, and limitations\
    \ of each article are also highlighted.\nEnergy-harvesting mechanisms can be implemented\
    \ with batteries for the sensor nodes. For\nexample, a sensor node using solar\
    \ energy to charge its batteries can work extensively during daytime\nwhen adequate\
    \ sunlight is available. Meanwhile, the sensor node can use its batteries through\
    \ power\nreduction techniques, such as sleep mode (i.e., duty cycle), at night\
    \ when sunlight is unavailable to save\nenergy. In addition, the sensor node can\
    \ enter restricted sleep periods (i.e., low duty cycle) and reduce\ntransmission\
    \ power when its batteries possess low residual energy [111]. Furthermore, adopting\
    \ a\nmaximum power point tracking system is a reliable battery charging technique\
    \ for long-term operation.\nThe charge–discharge cycle of the battery is minimized\
    \ [112].\n3.2.1. Solar Energy\nSolar energy based on photovoltaic system and methods\
    \ can be used in agricultural applications\nbased on WSNs [113]. Therefore, solar\
    \ cells provide a good solution [114] to ensure the survivability\nof the agriculture\
    \ monitoring system. Solar cell energy has been used by several studies to provide\n\
    long-term energy to sensor nodes in agriculture applications.\nGutiérrez et al.\
    \ [40] developed an irrigation system based on the ZigBee wireless protocol. The\n\
    system was developed to improve water usage for agricultural crops. Temperature\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors in WSN were placed in the root of the plants to send\
    \ sensor information to a web application\nvia a gateway. The proposed algorithm\
    \ controls the water quantity based on threshold values of soil\nmoisture and\
    \ temperature that are programmed in a microcontroller-based gateway. The WSN\
    \ is\npowered by solar cell panels and rechargeable batteries. Water savings of\
    \ up to 90% were achieved\nrelative to the conventional irrigation method. Considering\
    \ that the system is cost effective and\nautonomous, it can be utilized in geographically\
    \ isolated regions where water sources are limited.\nZou et al. [68] improved\
    \ the battery lifetime of a WSN based on harvested energy (i.e., solar cell)\n\
    utilizing shadow detection. With this strategy, sensor nodes can accordingly modify\
    \ their scheduling\nto optimize their power production and remaining battery levels.\
    \ Furthermore, data transmission is\noptimized through routing and clustering\
    \ mechanisms. A Bayesian network was employed to provide\nwarning reports of bottlenecks\
    \ along the path. The system was deployed in real time based on the\nTexas Instruments\
    \ CC2530 platform that includes the ZigBee wireless protocol. The battery (lithium\n\
    type with a storage capacity of 2500 mAh) of the sensor node was charged from\
    \ the solar cell panel\nwhen the harvested power was adequate. The experimental\
    \ results showed that these techniques\nallow network activities to occur in a\
    \ continuous and effective manner.\nIn [115], a micro-irrigation system that relies\
    \ on a small solar-powered cell was developed. The\nenergy input, energy output,\
    \ greenhouse gas productions, and solar cell installation for rural areas\nwere\
    \ investigated with the proposed co-located system. The researchers compared their\
    \ system\nwith another commonly used method (i.e., aloe vera cultivation) in terms\
    \ of life cycle. The life cycle\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n23 of 45\nevaluation\
    \ showed that the proposed system is economical for several rural areas and may\
    \ provide\nopportunities for agriculture electriﬁcation and motivate economic\
    \ growth.\nRoblin [116] presented an irrigation system relying on a solar cell\
    \ for rural areas where sunlight is\noften available. The irrigation system includes\
    \ pumps working on a solar cell instead of an electricity\ngrid and/or a diesel\
    \ generator. The study showed that the irrigation system based on a solar cell\
    \ is\nbetter than systems that depend on other energy resources because the electricity\
    \ grid is unavailable at\nall times, and the operating cost of diesel pumps is\
    \ high and relies mainly on the diesel price. Although\nthe solar-powered system\
    \ was relatively expensive, it became a free source of energy after installation\n\
    in the rural area and proved to be a worthwhile investment in the long term. A\
    \ similar irrigation\nsystem was proposed in [117]. The system adopts photovoltaic\
    \ panels to power a water pump that\nconverts the continuous drift of water into\
    \ a drop drift to achieve increased water usage efﬁciency.\nKwon et al. [118]\
    \ suggested a novel prediction technique for energy harvesting with a solar\n\
    cell within three hours. Moreover, the packet transmissions of the sensor nodes\
    \ can be controlled\ndepending on the estimated energy. Packet transmissions and\
    \ energy harvesting are integrated to\nimprove the WSN performance. The integration\
    \ of these schemes enhances the prediction accuracy\nand improves the WSN throughput\
    \ and power consumption. The throughput of the sensor node can\nbe increased by\
    \ shortening the packet transmission period. By contrast, when the packet transmission\n\
    period increases, the power consumption of the sensor node decreases. The experimental\
    \ results show\nthat the proposed packet transmission scheme is superior to the\
    \ others in terms of data throughput\nand deadline miss rate. The proposed energy-harvesting\
    \ method is also predicted more precisely than\nothers by 6.92%.\nA study [119]\
    \ used a solar cell to provide energy to a WSN deployed in a greenhouse. The\n\
    humidity and temperature of the greenhouse were controlled through a management\
    \ and monitoring\nsystem, which was based on a low-power MSP430 (Texas Instruments,\
    \ Dallas, TX, USA) microcontroller\nand an ultra-low-power nRF24L01 transceiver\
    \ (Nordic Semiconductor, Oslo, Norway). The power\nconsumption of the WSN was\
    \ minimized as much as possible. In another study, a WSN-based ZigBee\n(CC2420\
    \ module) wireless transceiver and microcontroller (low-power ATmega128L) supplied\
    \ by\nthe solar cell as a battery charger were considered to monitor the humidity,\
    \ temperature, rain level,\nand leaf wetness of vineyards [120]. The WSN covered\
    \ 30 m between ZigBee units with a low power\nconsumption (35 and 38 mW in transmission\
    \ and reception modes, respectively).\n3.2.2. Wireless Power Transfer\nRecent\
    \ developments in wireless power transfer (WPT) are expected to increase the lifetime\n\
    of WSNs signiﬁcantly and make them continuously operational, given that WPT techniques\
    \ can\nbe utilized to transmit electromagnetic energy between transmitter and\
    \ receiver devices without\nany contact between the two. WPT is expected to overcome\
    \ the constraint of the supply of WSNs.\nConsequently, some researchers highlighted\
    \ the utilization of mobile node that can deliver power\nto deployed sensor nodes\
    \ such as [121,122].\nWPT technology poses a challenge to the energy\ncooperation\
    \ between neighboring nodes in WSNs. Therefore, in the future, sensor nodes could\n\
    harvest energy from the environment and transfer this energy to other nodes in\
    \ the network; in this\nmanner, a self-sustaining network can be achieved [123].\
    \ Accordingly, recent research has investigated\nmulti-hop energy transfer [124,125],\
    \ which paved the way for new energy cooperative schemes and\nWPT charging protocols.\n\
    WPT can be classiﬁed into three main subcategories:\n(i) electromagnetic (EM)\
    \ radiation,\n(ii) magnetic resonator coupling, and (iii) inductive coupling,\
    \ as shown in Figure 2. Wireless charging\nin WSNs can be performed via EM radiation\
    \ and magnetic resonant coupling. EM signals suffer from\nattenuation over distance,\
    \ and active radiation may pose a threat to the human body. Meanwhile,\nmagnetic\
    \ resonant coupling can address the power requirements of agriculture based on\
    \ WSNs because\nof its efﬁciency within a distance of several meters. Many studies\
    \ used WPT to charge sensor nodes\nfor different applications and ﬁelds. WPT-based\
    \ inductive coupling [121] has been used to charge\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n24\
    \ of 45\nthe battery of sensor nodes scattered in agriculture ﬁelds. The energy\
    \ is transferred from the source\ncoil (mounted on a UAV) to the receiver coil\
    \ (attached with sensor nodes). A 2.4 W transfer power\nis transferred to charge\
    \ a single sensor node. The results addressed a number of limitations and\nchallenges\
    \ related to the charging of sensor nodes via a UAV. In addition, the results\
    \ revealed that\nthe battery lifetime of the deployed sensors can be signiﬁcantly\
    \ extended through the UAV. A similar\napproach was adopted by Chen et al. [122]\
    \ to charge a WSN in an agricultural ﬁeld through the\nharvesting of electromagnetic\
    \ radiation.\n3.2.3. Air Flow Energy\nHarnessing wind energy is another energy-harvesting\
    \ technique that can be utilized to provide\npower to sensor nodes in agricultural\
    \ applications. An adaptive routing protocol, wind energy\nharvesting, and sleep\
    \ scheduling were considered in [126] to minimize the power consumption of the\n\
    ZigBee transceiver and extend the lifetime of the WSN.\n3.2.4. Vibration Energy\n\
    Vibration energy based on piezoelectric can be used to charge the battery of sensor\
    \ nodes to prolong\ntheir lifetime. Müller et al. [127] have been analyzed various\
    \ WSN protocols based on ZigBee (CC2420\nand CC2500) and CC1100 with respect to\
    \ their applicability in the agricultural setting. Furthermore,\na fully synchronous\
    \ protocol with a time-slot architecture for a WSN has been proposed for agricultural\n\
    machinery to achieve real-time capability, low latency, and deterministic behavior.\
    \ The objective of\ntheir application was to monitor the back door position and\
    \ ﬁlling level of a forage wagon using a\nZigBee (CC2420) RF transceiver. Clock\
    \ synchronization among all nodes is implemented to ensure\nstrict power on/sleep\
    \ times of each sensor node. Meanwhile, an energy-harvesting unit based on a\n\
    piezoelectric material has been designed; the unit provides an average power of\
    \ 200 µW to sensor\nnodes. In this case, the sensor node can transmit a data payload\
    \ of nine bytes in 40 ms.\n3.2.5. Water Flow Energy\nMulti-energy sources (water,\
    \ wind, and solar) platform is designed for precision agricultural\napplications\
    \ by Morais et al. [128]. The authors explored water ﬂow, wind speed and solar\
    \ radiation\nfeasible energy sources to encounter the requirements of ZigBee router\
    \ node in WSN. Thus, several\npowered solutions for WSN is presented. Design considerations\
    \ regarding water ﬂow energy, the water\nﬂow in the pipes of crops irrigation\
    \ system are employed to generate the energy for ZigBee router node.\nThis idea\
    \ can be applied in different agricultural applications such as greenhouses, aquaculture,\
    \ and\nhydroponic systems, where the water recirculation in pipes is continuous.\
    \ Like to bulky hydroelectric\ngeneration utilities, a water ﬂow in the pipes,\
    \ derived from the main water source, can be employed\nto run a turbine joined\
    \ to a small direct current (DC) generator. The experimental results revealed\n\
    that the three energy sources combined together can generate an energy of 58 mAh,\
    \ more than the\nrequirement of the ZigBee router node (39 mAh).\n3.2.6. Microbial\
    \ Fuel Cell Energy\nAnother type of energy harvesting technique is called microbial\
    \ fuel cell. This technique is extracted\nfrom energy neutral system. Sartori\
    \ and Brunelli [129] proposed microbial fuel cell to supply the\nunderground freshwater\
    \ system that used for monitoring the water level in the phreatic zone, artesian\n\
    wells, and tanks. The proposed system comprises a low-cost phreatimeter sensor,\
    \ a low-power\nmicrocontroller (i.e., MSP430FR5739), and a low-power LoRa wireless\
    \ protocol. However, the amount\nof microbial fuel cell energy extraction of 296\
    \ µW is not enough to supply LoRa wireless protocol and\nmicrocontroller directly\
    \ when they are in active mode. Therefore, a DC-to-DC boost is employed to\nraise\
    \ the small input voltages of 130 mV to 4.5 V.\nEvidently, most agricultural applications\
    \ prefer to use solar cells as battery chargers of WSNs\nbecause these cells are\
    \ easy to install, work efﬁciently when sunlight is available, and supply more\n\
    Sensors 2017, 17, 1781\n25 of 45\nenergy compared with other energy-harvesting\
    \ techniques as shown in Table 7. In addition, the table\nshows most of the previous\
    \ scholars adopted ZigBee wireless protocol. Clearly, employing ZigBee\nsupports\
    \ our study that this wireless protocol is more suitable for agricultural monitoring\
    \ systems.\nSolar panels can supply 100 mW/cm2, whereas radio frequency, thermal,\
    \ vibration, wind, microbial\nfuel cell, magnetic resonant coupling WPT, and water\
    \ ﬂow can supply 0.001, 0.06, 0.8, 1.0, 0.296, 14, and\n19 mWs, respectively [128–131].\
    \ For example, as shown in Figure 3 (Part A), if the power consumption\nof the\
    \ WSN components presented in [120] is 35 mW for ZigBee (Chipcon CC2420), 0.27\
    \ mW for\nthe temperature sensor, 3 mW for the humidity sensor, 0.27 mW for the\
    \ rain gauge sensor, 5 mW\nfor the leaf wetness sensor, and 24 mW for the ATmega128L\
    \ microcontroller [132], a single solar cell\n(2 × 2 cm2) panel can adequate supply\
    \ this WSN. However, when the power consumption of the WSN\nincreases, the dimension\
    \ of the solar cell panel also needs to be increased.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n\

    \ the visibility of a group of systems, technologies, platforms, and design \n\
    principles for joining things, depending on the physical surroundings, through\
    \ the use of the Internet. \nPA is an application that can employ the benefits\
    \ of IoT to increase production efficiency, improve \nthe quality of yields, reduce\
    \ the negative ecological impact, prevent the prevalence of plant-eating \npests\
    \ or plant diseases, alert farmers about farm fires [141], and increase the profitability\
    \ of several \nagricultural production schemes. Agriculture involves farming,\
    \ planting, and animal rearing, and it \nhas grown under the scope of IoT recently\
    \ [5]. Tracking of animals, monitoring of farms, and \nirrigation processes are\
    \ the main domains of IoT for cultivation [142]. Furthermore, feeding, rearing,\
    \ \nmedication, and vaccination are essential applications of IoT in the agricultural\
    \ domain [143]. \nConsequently, several IoT modular architectures have been proposed\
    \ and implemented by scholars \nfor PA monitoring (as presented in Table 8). Real-time\
    \ ecological information can be remotely \ngathered from the agricultural surroundings\
    \ based on different sensors, which transmit the \ninformation to be processed\
    \ to determine problems, take required actions using actuators, or store \ndata.\
    \ \nSensors in WSN can be employed to gather information about environmental and\
    \ physical \nfeatures, whereas actuators are used to respond to the feedback to\
    \ control or to perform an action \nover the conditions (Figure 3, Part B). The\
    \ use of sensors in agricultural applications poses a number \nof requirements,\
    \ including gathering of soil, weather, and crop information; surveillance of\
    \ \nagricultural areas, water and fertilizer requirements of diverse pieces of\
    \ rough land, several crops on \na single piece of acreage, different requirements\
    \ of crops for unlike soil and weather circumstances, \nand eliminating of interactive\
    \ solutions and relying on proactive solutions. All these requirements \nare applied\
    \ and processed in parallel. Therefore, different sensors and actuators must be\
    \ used to \nhandle this information and respond to different conditions. Processed\
    \ information can be utilized \nto make a decision instead of raw data of the\
    \ sensor [132]. This information can be transmuted to the \ncloud computing via\
    \ gateway for data processing and data storage, as shown in Figure 3 (Part C).\

    \ soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and \nwind direction and speed sensors\
    \ to monitor the agricultural environments. “Adafruit Pro Trinket” \nplatform\
    \ was selected for the data processing, and nRF wireless protocol was used as\
    \ a transceiver \nto transfer sensor data to the gateway (i.e., Intel Edison to\
    \ reduce the power consumption). The \ngateway was in charge of collected information\

    \ The gateway\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n29 of 45\nwas in charge of collected information\
    \ from different sensors and passed the information to the cloud\nserver. The\
    \ proposed system resulted in improved crop quality and minimized negative ecological\n\
    effect. In [145], the usage of water in smart irrigation systems was controlled\
    \ based on developed IoT\nplatforms. A cloud agriculture ﬁeld-monitoring scheme\
    \ was designed and implemented to enable\nthe farmer to monitor the soil condition.\
    \ Soil moisture and weather temperature were monitored to\nautomate the irrigation\
    \ system in farm while minimizing water consumption, which led to reduced\ncost\
    \ and maintained environmental beneﬁts. The proposed water irrigation system included\
    \ three\nmain parts: a WSN and actuator, a cloud platform, and user application.\
    \ The WSN and actuator part\nconsisted of sensor nodes for collecting the soil\
    \ moisture and weather temperature, an actuator node\nto control the irrigation\
    \ process, and a sink node that could pass all farm information to the cloud\n\
    platform. All sensor, sink, and actuator nodes adopted low-power ZigBee wireless\
    \ protocol.\nWSN and 3G network-based agriculture IoT was considered in [146]\
    \ to monitor the air\ntemperature, air humidity, and soil moisture. The entire\
    \ system consisted of sensor nodes, actuators\nsink nodes, server, gateway, and\
    \ the mobile phone device of the farmer. The collected information by\nthe sensor\
    \ nodes was sent to the server via gateway and Internet network. The gateway connected\
    \ the\nWSN with the Internet to relay the command control among the sensor nodes,\
    \ the phone of the farmer,\nthe actuators, and the server. However, in this system,\
    \ the data transmission over the 3G network\nmust ensure real-time communications\
    \ to support the agricultural WSN.\nIoT-based agriculture applications changed\
    \ classical agricultural surveillance approaches by\nspeedily providing quantitative\
    \ data with signiﬁcant temporal and spatial resolution. Several IoT\nplatforms\
    \ have recently been available in the market. For instance, in agricultural applications,\n\
    SmartFarmNet [147] platforms can be used to provide more than 30 packages for\
    \ good commercial\nproducts, such as Libelium [45], and experimental, such as\
    \ Motes [148] and Arduino [149] sensor\nplatforms. Other examples of agricultural\
    \ applications based on IoT are provided in Table 8. The table\npresents a comparative\

    \ of PA domain such as sensors, microcontrollers, and wireless technologies\n\
    are highlighted and classiﬁed in Table 9. For better clariﬁcation, the sensors\
    \ are classiﬁed into three\nmain categories leaf wetness/plant, soil moisture,\
    \ and environment sensors [5,132]. These sensors can\nbe utilized in several potential\
    \ agriculture applications. In Table 9, the microcontroller/processor and\nwireless\
    \ protocols are also highlighted. Among the microcontrollers, the majority of\
    \ agriculture sensor\nnodes adopting ATmega128L because this microcontroller supports\
    \ data aggregation, decision making,\nstorage capability, ﬂash memory, low complexity,\
    \ and energy management through multi-levels of\npower down modes [132]. ZigBee\
    \ and LoRa wireless protocols/technologies are widely used in several\nagricultural\
    \ applications, as discussed previously in Section 2.\nIn precision agriculture,\
    \ to obtain high-quality products, the environmental parameters should be\ncontrolled\
    \ to provide optimal values. For example, the temperature rate that has a positive\
    \ effect on the\ngrowth of the pepper ﬁeld is between 20 and 25 ◦C. The temperature\
    \ in rainy, sunny, and nightly days\nshould be kept between 20 and 22 ◦C, between\
    \ 25 and 28 ◦C, and between 18 and 20 ◦C, respectively\nand the minimum value\
    \ should be not lower than 16–17 ◦C. Air humidity for pepper vegetables should\n\
    be kept between 60% and 70%. The high-temperature value combines with low humidity\
    \ value may\nbe caused a negative inﬂuence on the growth of the pepper. The maximum\
    \ humidity value in pepper\ngreenhouse should be not above 70%. Soil pH (i.e.,\
    \ soil acidity) is another factor that directly effects\non the pepper crops,\
    \ where it can measure the quantity of calcium in the soil. The soil for pepper\n\
    crops can be acid or alkaline depending on the weather conditions. It should be\
    \ acid for wet climate\nand alkaline for a dry climate. Soil with pH levels above\
    \ 7.0 is considered alkaline, while soil with\npH levels below 7.0 has acid nature.\
    \ Soil pH values must be controlled according to the type of the\nagricultural\
    \ yield. For pepper crop, the best values for pH gauge are between 6.5 and 5.5.\
    \ Therefore,\nthe humidity, temperature, and soil pH should be constantly supervised\
    \ in order to identify the right\ntime for draining and watering the agricultural\
    \ crops.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n33 of 45\nTable 9. Types of sensors, microcontrollers,\

    \ Limitations\nThe development of WSNs prompted new research trends in the agricultural\
    \ domain. Micro\nelectromechanical system (MEMS) technologies allow for the manufacture\
    \ of cheap and small sensors.\nThe pervasive nature of the process, together with\
    \ tiny, self-regulating sensor nodes, cost-effective\nequipment, and scalability,\
    \ indicate that WSNs can be used for agriculture automation [5]. However,\nregarding\
    \ the distribution of WSNs to observe different agricultural climates, a number\
    \ of open\nchallenges and limitations remain. Several of these challenges and\
    \ limitations in existing agricultural\napplications based on WSNs are listed\
    \ below together with suggestions on how to address them.\n(1)\nPower consumption\
    \ and battery life:\nA WSN consists of three main components:\nsensors,\nmicrocontrollers,\
    \ and RF transceivers. Given that the battery of a sensor node provides limited\n\
    energy, ensuring that the components of the sensor node consume minimum power\
    \ is crucial.\nIn particular, reducing the power consumption of the RF transceiver,\
    \ which consumes more power\nthan the other components in a sensor node, would\
    \ alleviate this problem [67,127]. Moreover,\nthis issue can be addressed in two\
    \ steps. The ﬁrst is to propose an intelligent energy-efﬁcient\nalgorithm. The\
    \ second step can be performed by utilizing available energy-harvesting techniques,\n\
    such as solar cells, vibration, and WPT.\n(2)\nCommunication range: WSNs suffer\
    \ from the effect of harsh ecological conditions because of the\nwide range of\
    \ open agricultural surroundings [5]. The WSN protocol contains mechanisms to\n\
    resist the effect of data transmission failures in the network, which increase\
    \ due to ecological\neffects. In agricultural applications, most wireless sensor\
    \ technologies support a relatively short\ncommunication range. Therefore, many\
    \ sensor and router nodes need to be diffused in a WSN.\nIn the point-to-point\
    \ Zigbee network, the communication distance can reach 100 m in outdoor\nenvironments.\
    \ The ZigBee communication range can be extended by adopting multi-tire, ad-hoc,\n\
    decentralized, and mesh network topologies. Drones or UAV also can be used as\
    \ a mobile router\nnode to extend the communication range within a farm ﬁeld.\
    \ A drone could pass the collected\ndata from the sensor nodes to the master node\
    \ through multi-hop. However, using drones entails\nother challenges and limitations.\n\
    (3)\nPropagation losses:\nIn agricultural applications, WSNs must be able to work\
    \ in diverse\nsurroundings, such as ground, bare land, orchards, greenhouses,\
    \ farms, and complex topography;\nthey must also be able to operate in all climate\
    \ conditions. All these conditions inﬂuence the\nperformance of radio propagation.\
    \ Whether the topography is simple or complicated, the\ncommunication possibility\
    \ between the points in a WSN still suffers from serious challenges.\nThe signal\
    \ transmitted from the sensor nodes in agricultural applications need to pass\
    \ through a\nheavy crop canopy to arrive to at the receiver nodes, which cannot\
    \ ensure a sufﬁcient clearance\narea and will cause signal propagation absorption,\
    \ reﬂection, attenuation, and scattering. In\nthis case, the link quality is degraded,\
    \ especially when the signal spreads through dense crops.\nTherefore, when deploying\
    \ WSNs, communication link quality and temporal and spatial variables\nmust be\
    \ guaranteed. The communication performance of WSNs is related to the working\n\
    surroundings. Therefore, due to the limited resources and power budget of WSNs,\
    \ an accurate\nwireless channel path loss model must be adopted to reﬂect the\
    \ propagation features. This model\nis expected to demonstrate correct optimization\
    \ and network evaluation performance throughout\nthe deployment design process\
    \ to develop the energy efﬁciency of the nodes [15], improve the\ntarget detection\
    \ and localization applications [16], decrease the number of retransmission, and\n\
    ensure Quality of Service (QoS) of the network [175].\n(4)\nRouting: Different\
    \ problems can emerge due to packet collision and limited bandwidth, which\nare\
    \ introduced by channel propagation, and so on. Therefore, when a WSN is deployed\
    \ in a wide\narea in farm ﬁelds, multi-hop is required. Kim et al. [3] developed\
    \ an independent mobile robot\nplatform based on a mobility task for surveillance\
    \ to overcome channel interference.\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n35 of 45\n(5)\nLocalization\
    \ and tracking: Tracking and localization of a herd of cattle are considered smart\
    \ farm\napplications based on WSNs. For example, a WSN can be employed to track\
    \ and localize of dairy\ncows to enable herd management. ZigBee wireless protocol\
    \ is used to monitor animal locations\nand behaviors, such as walking and standing,\
    \ lying down, and grazing [16,18]. In this context,\nseveral considerations, such\
    \ as radio interference, animal situation, and mobility, changes in\nWSN topology,\
    \ penetration depth of the signal through the animal body, height of the collar,\
    \ and\naccess point antennas, need to be taken into account [176]. These considerations\
    \ pose challenges\nin the localization and tracking of the animals.\n(6)\nReliability:\
    \ Agricultural monitoring systems based on different environmental sensors can\
    \ also\nbe used to monitor pollution aside from climate conditions. Important\
    \ information on climate\nconditions is reported to related agencies and farmers\
    \ from a remote location for advance\ninvestigations. Dangerous information needs\
    \ to be dealt with immediately in an emergency,\nwhich means that data transmission\
    \ in WSNs should demonstrate high reliability [3].\n(7)\nScalability: In agricultural\
    \ applications, the construction of WSN-based fault-tolerant and\nrobust hierarchical\
    \ architectures requires large-scale deployment relative to single-level network\n\
    architectures.\nA hierarchical architecture can be scaled up for developing applications\
    \ by\nduplicating to several ﬁelds. In this context, to increase the number of\
    \ WSNs over a vast area,\nmultiple wireless router nodes are placed in an agricultural\
    \ ﬁeld to guarantee sustained operation.\n(8)\nCost: The total hardware and software\
    \ costs of sensor nodes are important. The design of sensor\nnodes for any agricultural\
    \ application level must involve a low cost while demonstrating a robust\nperformance;\
    \ moreover, the design needs to be available for use by poor country markets [5].\n\
    This challenge can be overcome by reducing software and hardware costs further.\n\
    (9)\nReal time: Most crops are vulnerable to climate conditions, such as humidity,\
    \ intensity of\nillumination, and temperature. This vulnerability is a burden\
    \ to farmers who monitor changes\nin climate conditions hourly and/or daily because\
    \ doing so is labor-intensive. Moreover, in\ngreenhouses, a ﬁre can occur and\
    \ lead to severe agricultural disasters. This evidence suggests\nthat the monitoring\
    \ of the ecological conditions of agricultural WSNs needs to be in real time.\n\
    Real-time monitoring will enhance yield production and plant growth and avoid\
    \ dangerous\ndisasters in farms [3].\n(10) Storage and recording of data: Large\
    \ amounts of data are recorded from agriculture observing\nsystems because several\
    \ WSNs in agricultural applications contain several sensors for crop\ngrowth analysis\
    \ and harvesting estimation. This condition requires the base station to monitor\n\
    changes in farm ﬁelds by analyzing patterns. The base station must thus be supported\
    \ by a high\nstorage capacity.\n(11) Security: Security and protection are important\
    \ issues in agricultural products. Protection\nfrom insects or attacks of rodents\
    \ in grain stores or ﬁelds is essential. Such a challenge must\nbe considered\
    \ to maintain the security level of agriculture. Protection and security can be\n\
    achieved based on real-time analysis and processing of agricultural information\
    \ without human\nintrusion [159].\n(12) Delay tolerance: Critical delay poses\
    \ a challenge to agricultural applications. Some agricultural\napplications can\
    \ be considered as time sensitive, such as those used in farm ﬁre detection,\n\
    detection of exposure of crops to pests, cow heat event detection during milking,\
    \ and exposure of\ncattle to heat for a certain period. Such information must\
    \ be transmitted as fast as possible if the\ncritical issue is to be handled.\
    \ In such a case, a tradeoff between energy consumption and data\ntimelines is\
    \ necessary. By contrast, some agricultural applications are delay tolerant (i.e.,\
    \ time\ninsensitive), such as protein content, milk fat [177], gathering data\
    \ from soil and grass monitoring.\nWith delay tolerant approach, the short range\
    \ low power wireless protocols can be used [178].\nWhere the information of the\
    \ agricultural ﬁeld can be collected and transferred to the master\nnode or to\
    \ a cloud computing node using “messengers” e.g., a mobile node (mobile robot\
    \ or\nSensors 2017, 17, 1781\n36 of 45\nUAV). Consequently, the cost [179] and\
    \ the complexity of the agriculture WSN will be reduced\nand the lifetime will\
    \ be increased.\n(13) Fault tolerance: Fault tolerance is a crucial feature of\
    \ WSNs for succeeding PA. Several faults may\noccur in PA based on the WSN system,\
    \ which are (i) communication failure, (ii) faulty sensor\nsetting, (iii) sensor\
    \ component faults producing incorrect value, and (iv) node failure because of\n\
    exhausted battery or any other cause. Gutiérrez et al. [40] introduced communication\
    \ failure and\nnode fault tolerance for an irrigation system. If any fault occurs,\
    \ the irrigation system tracks the\ndefault irrigation program. The node energy\
    \ depletion failure was minimized in [1,40,180] by\nadopting solar-cell-powered\
    \ nodes. Data aggregation and topology control schemes are probable\nto be fault\
    \ tolerant for deploying sensor nodes in a vast area.\n(14) Data management: The\
    \ data management in agriculture poses a challenge because the large\namount of\
    \ data that can be collected from several sensors spread in agricultural ﬁeld,\
    \ especially\nwhen the agricultural data are intended to be connected to the cloud.\
    \ Determination of the\n(i) data analysis method, (ii) data collection schemes,\
    \ (iii) sensor types, (iv) semantic sensor\nnetworking, (v) big data, and (vi)\
    \ complex event processing enables the designer to manage\nthese crucial aspects.\
    \ The integration of IoT and software-deﬁned network also introduces a\npromising\
    \ and new methodology in deployment, monitoring, and design of network services\n\
    and resources [181].\n(15) Heterogeneous sensors: Integration of wired and wireless\
    \ heterogeneous sensors into information\nplatforms to perform interoperability\
    \ pose challenges in PA. Chen et al. [152] proposed “web\nservice-enabled cyber-physical\
    \ infrastructure” to solve this issue. The proposed system was able\nto integrate,\
    \ process, acquire, and distribute surveillance data from different physical sensors\n\
    spread in the PA system over the Internet. The infrastructure was executed to\
    \ serve as an\narchitecture middleware between PA clients and heterogeneous sensors.\n\
    6. Conclusions\nA review of WSN-based agricultural applications was presented.\
    \ A comparison was conducted\namong different wireless technologies or protocols,\
    \ such as WiFi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPRS/3G/4G,\nLoRa, and SigFox. The comparison\
    \ results revealed that the ZigBee and LoRa wireless protocols are\nmore convenient\
    \ for agricultural applications than the others because of its low power consumption\n\
    and suitable communication range for ZigBee and long for LoRa. A classiﬁcation\
    \ of energy-efﬁcient\ntechniques or algorithms and energy-harvesting techniques\
    \ was also provided. Based on the presented\ntaxonomy, we show that signiﬁcant\
    \ types of energy-efﬁcient and energy-harvesting techniques\ncan be used in the\
    \ agriculture domain. Previous research was also investigated and compared\nto\
    \ explore the current problems in agricultural applications based on WSNs and\
    \ obtain optimum\nsolutions for maintaining system performance. Challenges and\
    \ limitations were introduced for\ndesign considerations in the future. The state-of-the-art\
    \ approaches of IoT in agricultural applications\nwere reviewed and compared to\
    \ explore various sensors, actuators, devices, IoT platforms, and\napplication\
    \ layers.\nAcknowledgments: The authors would like to thank Al-Raﬁdain University\

    development is proposed. • Methodological guidelines for proper design of iSapiens
    applications are shown. • The design and implementation of a real Smart City prototype
    in Cosenza, Italy, is presented. Abstract A Smart City is a cyber–physical system

    An infrastructure for Smart City has to be geographically and functionally extensible,
    as it requires both to grow up with the physical environment and to meet the increasing
    in needs and demands of city users/inhabitants. In this paper, we propose iSapiens,
    an IoT-based platform for the development of general cyber–physical systems suitable
    for the design and implementation of smart city services and applications. As
    distinguishing features, the iSapiens platform implements the edge computing paradigm
    through both the exploitation of the agent metaphor and a distributed network
    of computing nodes directly scattered in the urban environment. The platform promotes
    the dynamic deployment of new computing nodes as well as software agents for addressing
    geographical and functional extensibility. iSapiens provides a set of abstractions
    suitable to hide the heterogeneity of the physical sensing/actuator devices embedded
    in the system, and to support the development of complex applications. The paper
    also furnishes a set of methodological guidelines exploitable for the design and
    implementation of smart city applications by properly using iSapiens. As a significant
    case study, the design and implementation of a real Smart Street in the city of
    Cosenza (Italy) are shown, which provides decentralized urban intelligence services
    to citizens. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Smart CityCyber–physical

    A Smart City is an urban environment made smart by using ICT technologies, so
    as to improve the quality of life of the inhabitants and the efficiency of the
    city infrastructures, and provide enhanced services to citizens [1]. A lot of
    applications are compliant with the smart city vision and comprehend structural
    health of buildings, waste management, air quality and noise monitoring, traffic
    congestion management, city energy consumption optimization, smart parking, smart
    lighting, automation and salubrity of public buildings, urban drainage systems,
    emergency detection and so forth [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7]. The realization
    of Smart City is a hot topic in the current research landscape [8], [9], and many
    city administrations are interested in solutions for enhancing their cities with
    smart services. The European Union is also supporting a big amount of projects
    on Smart Cities1 and several cities around the world are boosting politics to
    exploit smart technologies. Valuable examples in this direction are the cities
    of Amsterdam,2 San Francisco,3 Barcelona,4 and Copenhagen5 that are creating versatile
    ecosystems for comprehensive Smart Cities realization. Smart Cities development
    introduces several challenges, which are shared with the Internet of Things, Cyber–Physical
    Systems, and Smart Environments [10], [11], [12], [13]. Such challenges include
    issues like the integration of heterogeneous systems and technologies, scalability,
    fault tolerance, system maintenance [14], geographical and functional extensibility.
    In particular, geographical extensibility refers to the problem of the dynamic
    extension of existing Smart City services to areas not previously covered, or
    to new urban areas (e.g., related to the city growth), while functional extensibility
    refers to the problem of adding new services to the set of the existing ones.
    Despite the big interest around Smart Cities, the currently adopted solutions
    lack in design and development guidelines, approaches for the integration of heterogeneous
    services and infrastructures, as well as ICT solutions allowing a holistic Smart
    City development. Furthermore, even though urban environments are naturally distributed,
    most of the actual Smart City implementations relies on centralized approaches,
    where a big amount of data flow in a common data center that processes them and
    provides services to the citizens, or schedules actuations on physical infrastructures
    [8]. Finally, many realized services are developed as independent monolithic blocks,
    and the interaction among them is not considered.2 In this paper it is argued
    that benefits arise from the exploitation of the edge (fog) computing paradigm
    [15], [16], [17]. The edge computing paradigm has the aim to push the computation
    on acquired data away from the core of data centers to the outer edges of a network,
    close to the data sources. Side benefits of such computing paradigm include: (i)
    a faster reactivity to events which can be managed where they occur, (ii) a better
    exploitation of communication bandwidth, as data are locally processed and only
    the aggregated required information are propagated across the system, (iii) an
    increase of reliability and scalability, since the paradigm fosters the use of
    distributed algorithms. The contributions of the paper are manifold. Firstly,
    the iSapiens platform is proposed [18] as an agent-based [19], [20], [21] distributed
    platform for the management of a network of computing nodes spread over a city
    area. In iSapiens, the computation is executed both on the edge of the network,
    by the agents residing in each computational node, and in the Cloud for computation
    demanding tasks. The iSapiens platform is able to manage physical devices (i.e.,
    sensors, actuators, or even complex objects) connected to its network nodes so
    as to hide their heterogeneity and specific communication protocols. As a second
    contribution, a set of design guidelines are provided which favors the realization
    of scalable and dynamically-extensible Smart City services. Moreover, the paper
    discusses about the advantages in using iSapiens, which provides important benefits
    such as extensibility, distributed computing, fault tolerance, heterogeneity management,
    and support for hardware/software maintenance. As a final contribution, the paper
    shows the realization of a Smart City prototype in the city of Cosenza (Italy),
    which provides decentralized urban intelligence services to citizens. The developed
    Smart City highlights how the proposed platform and guidelines can be applied
    for an effective Smart City prototyping. Geographical and functional extensibility
    issues are also taken into account within the case study. The rest of the paper
    is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses some related works in the context
    of Smart City; Section 3 describes the iSapiens platform and provides the methodological
    guidelines for the design of smart city services. Such Section also discusses
    about the benefits of the iSapiens platform coupled with the provided design guidelines;
    Section 4 shows the design and the realization of the Cosenza Smart Street. Finally,
    conclusions are drawn and the directions of ongoing work are portrayed. 2. Related
    work Cyber–Physical Systems and Smart Environments have been widely studied in
    literature so far [12], [22]. The most important goal of such systems is the improvement
    of the user experience in traditional environments under different points of view.
    In the context of urban environments, there is a growing number of Smart Cities
    whose final aim is to make an optimized use of the public resources, together
    with increasing the quality of the offered services still reducing the operational
    costs that the public administrations should sustain [8]. Such systems help citizens
    in a clever usage of their own cities. Smart Cities are usually considered as
    part of the so called Urban Internet of Things [23], which is the part of the
    Internet of Things that has been designed to support the Smart City realization
    and maintenance. Smart Cities and Smart City infrastructures have actually been
    already formalized [1], [24]. Anyway, real Smart City implementations are still
    not really comprehensive. The European Union is supporting a big amount of projects
    on the Smart Cities and several cities are encouraging politics to integrate smart
    technologies into the city to make it more eco-friendly and energy-efficient.
    Very good examples in this direction are the cities of Amsterdam, San Francisco,
    Barcelona, and Copenhagen that are creating ecosystems for the realization of
    comprehensive smart cities. Though the above presented cases are very positive
    examples, they all are represented by a plethora of applications that are not
    coordinated by a single platform which can allow the integration of the knowledge
    gathered from all the deployed sensors/systems. Several works in literature propose
    the integration of systems to produce whole smart cities. The paper in [25] presents
    the Oulu Smart City.6 Its first aim is to provide Oulu citizens with Wi-Fi connection
    and, through the tracking of the people in the city, to monitor pedestrian and
    vehicular flows. Even though the Oulu smart city presents a good design, it should
    be improved by the addition of services based on other sensing/actuation capabilities
    across the streets. In [26] authors have presented a framework for the implementation
    of information services to monitor public areas and infrastructures. In particular,
    they have shown a testbed on a subway scenario with the objective of (i) demonstrating
    that their system can flexibly help in the detection of anomalous events and (ii)
    simplifying communications in case of emergency. They realized a multi-technology
    architecture that collects data from various devices to infer high level knowledge
    (for emergency reason). The proposed framework is valuable, but practical examples
    are not satisfying and its re-use in different smart city scenarios has to be
    analyzed. In [9] authors integrate sensor nodes with the street lights around
    Cambridge to have powered nodes which sample multiple environmental sensors. They
    present a platform to reprogram and collect data through such sensor nodes. Anyway,
    authors do not talk about high level analysis of the gathered data. They only
    implement their case study for collection purposes. Several platforms for the
    realization of Smart Cities have been already implemented. Authors of [8] propose
    a general reference framework for the design of an urban IoT. It is based on a
    centralized architecture which exposes a set of web services. A real case study
    involving such framework has been implemented in Padova (Italy) where nodes have
    been deployed to monitor temperature, humidity, light, and benzene concentration
    in the air. Although this is a valuable example of both Smart City platform and
    case study, the proposed centralized architecture can present an extensibility
    problem for big cities. In [27] the SmartSantander project is presented, which
    is part of the Future Internet Research and Experimentation initiative of the
    European Commission. The project had the aim to implement a large scale network
    in the city of Santander to monitor environment pollution (air quality, noise
    levels and luminosity levels), outdoor parking, and automated irrigation systems.
    The architecture implemented presents three layers: IoT nodes, Gateways, and Server.
    Here the Server is the centralized data collector which offers services. Although
    the Smart City presents a very large case study, the centralized and not really
    structured architecture can provide some extensibility/maintenance problems. Moreover,
    here the data elaboration on the distributed nodes, with all the benefits that
    it can provide, is limited. The work in [28] introduces Sentilo, which is an open
    source IoT platform designed to manage sensors and actuators in the Smart Cities.
    Authors claim that Sentilo can be used for any city looking for openness and easy
    interoperability. Such platform uses Cloud Computing and Big Data tools to collect,
    store, and elaborate data from distributed sensors so providing Smart City extensibility.
    It has been sponsored by the Barcelona City Council and, after the deployment
    in Spain, its code has been released as open source. A drawback of such platform
    is the lack of computing on the edge of the platform to locally analyze the data
    from the city. Authors of [29] introduce an IoT middleware that has been implemented
    in the context of the EPIC (European Platform for Intelligent Cities) project.
    The proposed middleware has been designed to address in Smart Cities the issues
    regarding heterogeneity, interoperability, extensibility, and (re)configurability.
    Even though such middleware tackles important issues for Smart Cities, it does
    not consider (as many platforms in this area) the design of decentralized pre-processing
    components for computing and aggregating data on the edge. In [30], [31] a Smart
    City platform based on Big Data analysis to achieve extensibility is introduced.
    The proposed architecture provides three layers that have been implemented to
    (i) collect, analyze, and filter data; (ii) aggregate data to infer knowledge;
    (iii) provide users with an interface to gather elaborated data. Although very
    useful, such platform does not provide a low layer allowing the gathering of data
    from sensors distributed in a Smart City, so it needs to be built over another
    middleware that allows the sensors (actuators) management. Given the above analysis
    of the state of the art, it emerges the lack of a distributed platform and design
    guidelines for the comprehensive and systematic realization of reactive, fault
    tolerant, and extensible Smart City applications. To address such issues, this
    paper presents iSapiens as an agent-based platform providing useful features for
    designing and implementing distributed cyber–physical systems and smart environments.
    3. iSapiens: a platform for Smart Cities iSapiens is an agent-based platform providing
    useful features for designing and implementing distributed cyber–physical systems
    [3], [32], [33] and smart environments [18], [34], [35], [36], [37] whose functionalities
    are realized by exploiting edge computing [15], internet of things [10], [38]
    and out-of-the-edge computing services. Such systems are characterized by the
    combined exploitation of software components with heterogeneous physical devices
    and protocols, so as to furnish final users with high level services and/or to
    enhance the behaviors of a specific environment. In the following subsections
    a description of the iSapiens platform is provided together with an introduction
    to the issues related to the design of smart city applications. 3.1. The iSapiens
    platform The iSapiens platform (see Fig. 1) relies on two main abstractions: Virtual
    Objects (VOs) and Agents. VOs are used to abstract and manage physical objects,
    hiding the heterogeneity of devices and protocols, and complying with the Internet
    of Things vision. Services and enhanced behaviors are obtained by exploiting software
    agents which execute in computational nodes close to the physical devices they
    have to control, thus implementing edge computation and enabling online analytics.
    To offer final services, agents can also exploit out-of-the-edge services, both
    developed for a specific application or third party provided. Such services can
    include offline analytics, such as predictive analysis, machine learning, and
    data mining or services requiring a centralized view of the whole system. From
    an architectural point of view, the platform is mainly composed by an in-network
    computing layer and a virtualization layer. The former contains the Agent Server
    that provides the runtime support for the agents execution. The latter consists
    of the Virtual Object Containers which allow the management of VOs. The agent
    server and the virtual object container together constitute an iSapiens server.
    An iSapiens server is allocated for execution on a dedicated computational node.
    The iSapiens platform allows the realization of distributed applications consisting
    of a set of interacting agents running on a set of computational nodes. Such nodes
    are scattered in the environment which has to be controlled or enhanced. All the
    computing nodes are supplied with a set of devices, such as sensors, actuators
    or other more complex (smart) objects. The virtual object container of a given
    node hosts all the VOs abstracting the devices directly connected to the node.
    The agents running in a node can exploit all the functionalities offered by the
    local VOs. Each component, either a device, a VO, an agent, or a whole computing
    node can be dynamically removed from, added into or updated to a running system.
    This important feature fosters application scalability and extendibility. All
    together, the iSapiens servers, that are hosted in the computing nodes deployed
    in the network, constitute the distributed iSapiens middleware. The current implementation
    of iSapiens relies on the Java technology. iSapiens also allows the exploitation
    of an off-network computing layer that offers Cloud/Internet computing services
    which are required for the implementation of resource-demanding tasks (both in
    terms of computation and memory), and for the implementation of those tasks requiring
    a comprehensive view of the deployed system. Such layer comprehends three different
    kind of services: third-party provided services, custom developed services and
    agent-based services developed by using iSapiens agents. The third-party services
    and the custom services are not tied to the use of any specific technology. In
    the following, we further describe the main features of VOs and agents, and how
    they are deployed on computational nodes hosting iSapiens servers. Download :

    platform layers. 3.1.1. Virtual object features VOs are the key elements to provide
    the developers with an effective tool for managing devices heterogeneity and fostering
    hardware maintenance. In fact, VOs provide to agents a transparent access to the
    physical part due to a well-established and common interface exposed as API. A
    VO allows agents to directly connect to a device without taking care about proprietary
    drivers or addressing fine-grained technological issues. The goal is to decouple,
    from a sensing/actuation point of view, functionalities from the equipment offering
    them. A change in the physical devices (e.g., for maintenance) and in the adopted
    communication protocols will affect virtual objects only. The VOs are managed
    by the Virtual Object Container, which permits the dynamic deployment of new VOs,
    and exposes them to the agent layer. The VOs support both asynchronous and synchronous
    data reading. The asynchronous method relies on an implementation of the publish/subscribe
    pattern. Essentially, a VO exposes an abstract representation (i.e., machine readable-description)
    of the features and capabilities of physical objects spread in the environment.
    Features of the physical devices are exported into the iSapiens platform as virtual
    object functionalities related to both the sensing and actuation activities. For
    instance, the VO associated to a smart door will expose the isOpened functionality,
    through which an agent can check the current status of the door, and the lock
    functionality for locking the door if needed. 3.1.2. Agent services and features
    An Agent [21] is an autonomous entity which runs in an Agent Server and executes
    its own behavior interacting with other (local or remote) agents. An agent is
    able to exploit all the functionalities exposed by the VOs hosted in the same
    iSapiens server where the agent executes. An Agent Server provides services for
    the support of the agent life cycle and allows dynamic creation of agents at runtime.
    Communication among agents relies on the exchange of asynchronous messages. Messages
    can be timed or untimed. Timed messages are augmented with a time information
    specifying the absolute time in which the message has to be actually delivered
    to the recipient agent. The iSapiens platform provides acquaintance message s
    which are used for establishing direct acquaintance relationship among agents.
    An acquaintance message carries information about the identity and the role of
    a given agent. Such messages can be used to dynamically (re)configure the agents
    relations after faults or when new agents are introduced/removed into/from the
    system, e.g., due to maintenance and extensions. A distributed yellow pages service
    is also provided to dynamically discover agents in order to establish acquaintance
    relationships. An agent can register itself to the yellow pages by providing a
    set of roles and a set of properties (i.e., a set of couples). A registered agent
    can be discovered by other interested agents by querying the yellow pages. 3.1.3.
    Application deployment Given a running set of iSapiens servers, the deployment
    of an application is carried out by using a Deployer entity. Such entity can dynamically
    create new agents and VO on a target server. Moreover, it can establish acquaintance
    relationships among agents and/or send application-dependent configuration messages.
    The Deployer is an external process executing outside the iSapiens servers network.
    It can operate also on a running agent-based application in order, e.g., to introduce
    new functionalities in the system. 3.2. Exploiting the iSapiens platform: design
    guidelines This section describes a set of design guidelines aiming at supporting
    the development of applications by using the iSapiens platform. An important goal
    is to promote both the separation of concerns and the modularity. The proposed
    guidelines mainly rely on the exploitation of abstraction layers, and specific
    agent roles as depicted in Fig. 2. In each layer it is possible to focus on specific
    issues having a different level of abstraction. The layer-based approach is usable
    both in a top-down and bottom-up software development schema. A top-down approach
    is suggested when an application is developed from scratch, while a bottom-up
    approach is typically used when an application is built on top of some pre-existing
    components. A description of the introduced abstraction layers is reported below.

    Fig. 2. Design guidelines: abstraction layers vs. agent roles. Raw Data layer
    : it manages raw data directly related to physical quantities (e.g., distances,
    noise, temperature) both for sensing and actuation purposes. The managed data
    are not processed. Information layer : data coming from the previous layer can
    be filtered, structured and aggregated. This layer aims at organizing data in
    order to derive further information about the controlled system, or to produce
    synthetic data allowing a more convenient way to reason about the system. Knowledge
    layer : actuations to be performed, and/or environmental stimuli, are mapped onto
    more abstract concepts. The goal is to allow reasoning by using abstract concepts
    which are directly related to the specific domain (or context) of the application
    being developed. For instance, it is possible to introduce the concept of climatic
    health which depends on the value of the temperature and humidity actually existing
    in a given environment. Similarly, the concept of office security can be introduced
    in order to control a door office and make it alarmed after a certain hour. Wisdom
    layer : it permits to operate and reason at the highest abstraction level. Here,
    we have an holistic vision of all the concepts which are related to the developed
    application, and which govern the implemented system. The concepts previously
    introduced (or a subset of them) are orchestrated in order to pursue application
    goals. Gathered information and concepts can be complemented in order to augment
    system knowledge and to exploit such knowledge in order to operate upon the controlled
    system. For instance, if an application for managing safety at home is considered,
    information indicating that a person is found lying in the bathroom can be complemented
    in order to infer the concept afflicted by a malaise which can cause the concept
    of providing first aids to take place. Each layer is populated by agents having
    different roles. A role defines the responsibilities [39] an agent has in the
    system. The ellipses drawn in Fig. 2 associate the agent roles with the abstraction
    layers they are related to. Five agent roles were identified, and their description
    is provided in the following. Mirror agents : they are boundary entities turning
    VO functionalities into location-independent functionalities offered by agents,
    and must be co-located on the computational node hosting the VOs they have to
    interact. They do not introduce/modify new/existing VO functionalities thence
    they belong to the Raw data layer. Mirror agents mediate the use of the wrapped
    functionalities by enforcing, for instance, negotiation procedures and/or access
    policies useful for guaranteeing an exclusive use, or a time-based use, of the
    wrapped device. Boundary agents : they mediate the interactions between iSapiens
    agents and external service providers so as favoring system integration among
    iSapiens and third-party platforms. For instance, agents providing a weather-forecast
    functionality by using Internet-based services will have the Boundary role. Since
    external services can operate at different abstraction levels, boundary agents
    can belong to layers ranging from Raw data to Knowledge. Infrastructural agents
    : they offer general-purpose functionalities which are not tied to a specific
    application. For instance, these agents provide services managing information
    persistence (e.g., data storage in a DBMS) or services for the broadcast notification
    of events-of-interest. Infrastructural agents can belong to the abstraction levels
    ranging from Information to Knowledge. Operational agents : they offer functionalities
    tied to a specific application. Such functionalities can be achieved by composing
    and/or orchestrating functionalities offered by other agents. Operational agents
    can belong to the abstraction levels ranging from Information to Knowledge. In
    order to favor extensibility (both functional and geographical), fault tolerance
    and maintenance of the applications to develop, it is suggested the use of peer-to-peer/decentralized
    and bio-inspired algorithms, which are naturally fostered by the edge computing
    and agent paradigm. Service agents : they offer the final services exposed to
    the users according to the application goals. Such agents belong to the abstraction
    levels ranging from Knowledge to Wisdom. Usually, offered services are obtained
    by composition/coordination of the agents having other roles. 3.3. iSapiens for
    Smart City: features and benefits The features of the iSapiens platform (Section
    3.1), paired with the set of guidelines previously introduced (Section 3.2), produce
    some useful side-benefits, explotable for the realization of smart city applications,
    which are highlighted in the following. System maintenance is favored as VOs,
    agent roles, and abstraction layers introduce modularity and separation of concerns
    in the developed application. When a modification of a software function is needed,
    only the specific components dealing with such functionality are required to be
    selectively updated. VOs permits an easy hardware replacement as they maintain
    the same interface independently of the managed device. The supported dynamic
    deployment mechanism facilitates the actualization of the maintenance operations
    on the system. With respect to a node crash, fault tolerance is primarily fostered
    by the proper combination of the edge computing paradigm and use of P2P or Decentralized
    algorithms suggested for the implementation of the main operations of the system.
    Thus, a crash of a node does not impair the whole system execution. Heterogeneity
    and integration issues, either at device and system level, are tackled by the
    exploitation of VOs and Boundary Agents, as described in the previous sections.
    Functional extensibility is supported as it is possible to (i) composing pre-existing
    functionalities, (ii) exploiting in different ways the existing devices, and (iii)
    adding new devices for providing new services. This benefit arises as the platform
    permits to dynamically add/remove agents and VOs to/from the system. The geographical
    extensibility is achieved as the platform supports the dynamical addition of both
    computational nodes and related sensor/actuator devices on new areas of interest
    which have to be covered. As the newly added computational node is running, together
    with VOs, the new agents deployed on the node can join the rest of the community
    by exploiting the Yellow Pages service and the acquaintance messages. The exploitation
    of the edge computing paradigm makes the network of iSapiens nodes a distributed
    computational platform which is capable of furnishing a pervasive computational
    power which is exploitable for the realization of complex distributed smart-city
    services. More in particular, the edge computing supports online analytics, which
    consists in a continuous elaboration on the stream of data coming from sources.
    All of this promotes reactivity and efficiency in terms of bandwidth consumption.
    When the computation is resource demanding or it cannot be realized solely on
    the edge, an offline analysis can be carried out by exploiting the cloud computing.
    Table 1 provides a comprehensive view of the main features and benefits tied to
    the use of the iSapiens platform. Table 1. The iSapiens platform: Benefits vs
    features. 4. Design and implementation of the Smart Street Cosenza This section
    describes the design and implementation of a real case study which is realized
    by using the iSapiens platform. Such case study is the Smart Street that has been
    developed in the town of Cosenza (Italy). The purpose of the implemented smart
    street is to offer a set of services aiming at improving the quality-of-life of
    the citizens and favoring the interactions between the citizens themselves and
    the offered services. The realized Smart Street Cosenza (SSC), furthermore, offers
    an infrastructure which is scalable and extensible both to the whole town and
    with new functionalities. In the following, the location of the SSC is presented,
    along with a detailed description of the offered services, the architecture of
    the realized infrastructure (hardware/software), its evolution, and the Smart
    Street itself at work. 4.1. Location and functionalities of the Smart Street The
    Smart Street has been developed in Cosenza, which is a town of Calabria, Southern
    Italy. The town per se has a population of around 70,000, while its urban area
    counts over 268,000 inhabitants. SSC extends for about 2.5 km, and covers the
    following adjacent target areas (see Fig. 3): Corso Mazzini, the main business
    street of the town; a bus station, located in Via Delle Medaglie D’Oro; the square
    named Piazza Bilotti; the area around a mall, located in Piazza Giacomo Mancini;
    part of one of the main road of Cosenza, named Viale Giacomo Mancini. Corso Mazzini
    is a pedestrian street which hosts a set of shops, restaurants, cafés, banks,
    other commercial activities and an open air museum. The bus station is the main
    node of the town public transportation system and is mainly frequented in the
    working hours. Piazza Bilotti is currently under construction and will host a
    parking area. The area around the mall in Piazza Giacomo Mancini is highly frequented,
    and, together with the adjacent Viale Giacomo Mancini, is car accessible and is
    an high-traffic area. The mall itself hosts an underground parking area. Download

    The Smart Street target areas: (A) Bus Station, (B) Piazza Bilotti, (C) Corso
    Mazzini, (D) Viale Giacomo Mancini, (E) Piazza Giacomo Mancini. Due to the nature
    of the chosen locations, which are highly frequented by pedestrians, a set of
    services for making aware the citizens and the administrators about the status
    of the areas, in terms of pollutant gases, noise and climatic comfort are given.
    These kinds of services can be useful to the administrators for taking countermeasures
    so as to mitigate potential health risks and laws infringements,7 and to the citizens,
    which can use them to avoid unsafe situations, e.g., an elder person subject to
    heart related illness can avoid areas with a prohibitive climatic status. As the
    SSC is extensible by design (see Section 3.2), other services can be straightforward
    added. For instance, services for parking support in the areas around the mall
    and the bus station, efficient management of street lights, traffic control system,
    automation for green area management, public transportation information can be
    implemented. Moreover, all these services, once developed for a prototypal Smart
    Street using the iSapiens platform, can be easily deployed on other areas of the
    town. In addition, all the implemented services can be integrated, improved, or
    replaced. 4.2. Smart Street Cosenza design As stated in the previous section,
    the set of services designed to be part of SSC concerns climate, noise and pollution
    assessment so as to make aware of such environmental condition both citizens and
    town administrators. Environmental assessment requires the deployment of sensors
    which measure environmental, climate and pollutant quantities as indicated in
    Table 2. To achieve the stated goal, a set of Smart Street functionalities has
    been identified and a set of agents has been designed (see Table 3) to provide
    such functionalities. The designed agents are grouped according to the roles described
    in Section 3.2. Table 2. Main sensors used for the Smart Street Cosenza divided
    by category. Category Sensor type Climate Temperature, Atmospheric Pressure, Humidity
    Pollution CO, , , Concentration Other Noise, Luminosity A set of agents having
    the Mirror role is devoted to abstract the physical sensors so as to mirror the
    VOs as agents. A specific Mirror agent is designed for each kind of sensor identified
    in Table 2. The raw data exposed by the Mirror agents are sent to the group of
    the Measure Aggregation agents, having the Operational role. The Measure Aggregation
    agents make computation on the data coming from the Mirror agents and provide
    value-added data aggregation. There exists a specific instance of a Measure Aggregation
    agent for each Mirror agent. Given a specific sensor type (e.g., temperature,
    humidity), a Measure Aggregation agent provides all the capabilities of its associated
    Mirror agent plus the global average and the global standard deviation of the
    specific sensor type computed in real-time on the whole network. The two operations
    are computed by exploiting the gossip-based aggregation algorithm proposed in
    [40]. Table 3. Agents implementing the Smart Street Cosenza. Agent Role Agent
    Classes Empty Cell Mirror SensorTemperature, SensorPressure, SensorHumidity, SensorLuminosity,
    SensorNoise, SensorCO, SensorCO2, SensorNO2, SensorO3 Infrastructural Persistence,
    Notification Operational Measure Aggregation Service Environmental Wellness, Climatic
    Wellness, Anomaly Detection More in particular, the subset of Measure Aggregation
    agents, which are tied to the same sensor type, cooperates in the global average/standard
    deviation computation. When the gossip-based algorithm ends, all the cooperating
    agents become aware of the global computed result. In order to compute the average,
    each agent maintains its current measured value and its local average (initially
    set to the measured value). The algorithm consists in the continuous exchange
    of local averages among neighbor agents (i.e., the agents located in the same
    computing node or the node’s neighborhood). Each time an agent receives the average
    from one of its neighbors, it updates its local average (just applying the average
    operator). Value exchanges and local computations are continuously done for an
    enough number of step s set so as to ensure that each local average, computed
    by every involved agent, converges to the actual global average (the algorithm
    convergence is proved in [40]). Given the global mean, the global standard deviation
    is computed similarly, by evaluating the average of the squared deviation from
    the mean of the local measures. This gossip-based strategy has been chosen as
    it is fully scalable, decentralized, and fault tolerant. Besides the Mirror and
    the Operational agents, two kinds of Service agent, namely the Wellness and the
    Anomaly Detection agents, have been designed and developed. Each of them furnishes
    a specific service so as to meet the stated goals of the SSC and exploits the
    functionalities offered by the Mirror and the Operational agents. In particular,
    the Wellness agents provide high level information about the pollution and climatic
    status of the SSC in different areas. Climatic wellness is provided as comfort
    levels, computed through the exploitation of the Summer Simmer Index8 and the
    Humidex9 index, both involving temperature and humidity measurements. The categories
    of the found comfort level in a specific area range from “no discomfort” to “dangerous”.
    Environmental pollution wellness relies on the gases concentration sensors (see
    Table 2), and exploits the Air Quality Index.10 In this case, the categories range
    from “good” to “hazardous”. The Anomaly Detection agents are devoted instead to
    detect possible anomalies related to the environmental condition. There exists
    one Anomaly Detection agent for each noise sensor (i.e., related Mirror Agent)
    on the SSC. Two kinds of anomalies, namely area anomalies and historic anomalies,
    can be detected by the Anomaly Detection agents. At first, an Anomaly Detection
    agent notifies the occurrence of an area anomaly by exploiting the global average
    and standard deviation computed by the set of Measure Aggregation agents. The
    average and the standard deviation are exploited to fully characterize a Gamma
    Probabilistic Distribution, and an anomaly is detected when the value of the specific
    sensor associated to the Anomaly Detection agent is higher than the 99th percentile
    of the characterized Gamma function. In this case, the global average information
    combined with the local measures are exploited to discover if some areas of the
    SSC behave differently with respect to the whole. Secondly, each Anomaly Detection
    agent can detect historic anomalies as follows. A day is divided into 144 time
    slots, each of them corresponding to a 10 min time interval. For each time slot,
    the Anomaly Detection agent maintains a couple computed on all the sensor values
    so far read in the same time slot. When a new sensor value is read, it is compared
    with the 99th percentile of the Gamma distribution characterized by the couple
    of the corresponding time slot, and, if it is greater than such threshold, an
    event of interest is generated and notified. After that, the related couple is
    incrementally updated computing the exponential weighted moving average and variance
    (EWMA) according to [41]. The Infrastructural agents are devoted to provide functionalities
    that are potentially useful for all the agents above described. In particular,
    a set of off-network services are provided by a purposely-developed service provider,
    named Smart Street Server. The Smart Street Server is hosted in a data center
    located outside the edge computing node network (i.e., the nodes hosting the sensors).
    The server receives data from in-network agents (i.e., Infrastructural agents),
    and manages the persistence by using a local DBMS. The stored data are made available
    to the final users through a web application. Two kinds of Infrastructure agents
    have been designed, namely the Persistence and Notification agents. Both the kinds
    of agents forward the information they receive to the application server for storage
    on the DBMS. The data forwarded by the Notification agents are immediately made
    available for visualization to the connected clients. A comprehensive architectural
    view of the system is shown in Fig. 4. The figure highlights the interactions
    among agents, VOs, and the Smart Street Server. Communications among entities
    are graphically represented by thin links. The agents are grouped by type for
    the sake of readability, and the communications among the Measure Aggregation
    agents based on gossiping are highlighted through the tag. Download : Download

    view of the Smart Street Cosenza. 4.3. Operational steps for system deployment
    Fig. 4 highlights also how the components are dislocated on the computational
    nodes and the interactions occurring among them. The steps involved in the life
    of a generic component of the SSC, either hardware or software, are depicted in
    Fig. 5. Such steps are numbered from S1 to S4 and, for each of them, are also
    reported the iSapiens features used for their realization. Every component enters
    into the system through a deployment step (S1), and then it is initialized and
    becomes ready to work (S2). After that, the connections among interacting agents
    are established (S3) and, in the case of the gossip-based agents, a renewal of
    the acquaintance relationships (S4) is continuously carried out. In the initialization
    step, there is no specific iSapiens feature to exploit, but each component requires
    to be initialized through a specific configuration procedure. More in particular,
    the deployment of the agents and VOs over each computational node is obtained
    through the use of the dynamic deploying mechanism offered by the platform. The
    acquaintance relationships among the agents are established instead by using the
    Yellow Pages service and the acquaintance messages. With reference to Fig. 4,
    all the communication links among agents, that are not labeled with the tag, are
    established by sending proper acquaintance messages to the communicating agents.
    As an example, after the deployment and initialization of a new Wellness agent,
    a set of acquaintance messages are sent to it providing the knowledge of the Persistence
    agent, the Notification agent, and the relevant Measure Aggregation agents that
    the Wellness agent needs to know in order to behave properly. Instead, after the
    initialization of an agent involved in a gossip-based communication, the agent
    registers itself in the Yellow Pages and uses it to choose its neighborhood according
    to the gossip-based protocol. The neighborhood is renewed with a prefixed frequency
    (chosen during configuration) in step S4. This allows to implicitly handle the
    case in which Measure Aggregation agents dynamically enter or leave the system,
    as after a node crash or a new node joins the system. Each communication link
    without agents as endpoints is established during the component initialization
    as configuration info. From Fig. 4 emerges also that, by design, all the computing
    nodes are functionally equivalent, in the sense that there is no centralized functionality
    (with, obviously, the exception of the Smart Street Server). This last feature,
    together with the use of the gossip-based protocol, the acquaintance renewal policy
    and the dynamic deployment capability, makes the system able to meet fault-tolerance,
    scalability and extendibility requirements. Download : Download high-res image

    installation and execution. 4.4. Smart Street Cosenza implementation The realization
    of the SSC as it is today, has been done in an incremental way, both from a geographical
    and functional points of view, as successive incremental stages. The four incremental
    stages are described in Table 4, where, for each stage, the newly installed components,
    along with the interested city areas (as in Fig. 3) and a description of the performed
    actions (as in Fig. 5) is portrayed. In the table, the deployment of the Smart
    Street Server is not highlighted as it has been deployed and configured once,
    before the first stage. The SSC as it is in its current version, is constituted
    by a network of 15 computational nodes, interconnected through a dedicated Wi-Fi
    mesh network (IEEE 802.11n), directly deployed on the targeted areas (see Fig.
    6, Fig. 6(a)). Each computational node is constituted by a low cost Raspberry
    Pi 2 model B board,11 embedding a 900MHz quad-core ARM Cortex-A7 CPU and 1GB of
    RAM, and mounting an USB Wi-Fi dongle for networking purposes. Each Raspberry
    Pi is properly enveloped in an IP64 weather resistant case and main powered, using
    the power infrastructure of the town. From a software perspective, each computational
    node runs Raspbian, a Linux distribution developed for Raspberry Pi and based
    on Debian 7.0, the Oracle Java Runtime Environment version 8, and the iSapiens
    middleware. Table 4. Deployment stages descriptions of the Smart Street Cosenza.
    Deployment stage Installed components Involved areas Stage description and correlation
    with the operational steps #1 Climatic Monitor on an initial area - iSapiens nodes;-
    sensor nodes for climatic monitoring;- VOs for the deployed sensor nodes;- related
    Mirror, Notification and Persistence agents;- related Aggregation agents. - Piazza
    Giacomo Mancini- Viale Giacomo Mancini The iSapiens nodes were installed (S1)
    and configured (S2) on the covered area. The sensor nodes were installed (S1)
    and the related VOs were deployed (S1, S2) on the iSapiens nodes. Finally, the
    agents for climatic monitoring were deployed (S1) and configured (S2). Direct
    knowledge between agents is achieved by using acquaintances (S3). The Aggregation
    agents started to exploit the neighbor renewal policy (S4). #2 Area coverage extension
    - iSapiens nodes;- sensor nodes for climatic monitoring;- VOs for the newly deployed
    sensor nodes;- related Mirror, Notification and Persistence agents;- related Aggregation
    agents. - Corso Mazzini- Piazza Bilotti- Bus Station The iSapiens computational
    nodes were installed (S1) and configured (S2) on the new areas. The sensor nodes
    were installed (S1, S2) and the related VOs were deployed (S1, S2) on the newly
    iSapiens nodes, without affecting the already operating infrastructure. The agents
    for climatic monitor were deployed (S1) and configured (S2), acquaintances were
    given as in the previous step (S3). The gossip based renewal policy took into
    account the newly added Aggregation Agents (S4). #3 Environmental pollution monitoring
    addition - sensor nodes for environmental pollution monitoring;- VOs for the newly
    deployed sensor nodes;- related Mirror, Notification and Persistence agents;-
    related Aggregation agents. - Viale Giacomo Mancini- Corso Giacomo Mancini- Corso
    Mazzini- Piazza Bilotti- Bus Station New sensor nodes for environmental pollutant
    monitoring were installed on all the areas (S1, S2). The related VOs were deployed
    on the related iSapiens nodes (S1, S2), without affecting the already operating
    infrastructure. The agents for pollution monitoring were deployed (S1) and configured
    (S2) on the affected iSapiens nodes, acquaintances were given as in stage #1 (S3),
    neighbor renewal behavior started for the added Aggregation agents (S4). #4 Anomaly
    Detection and Climatic Wellness management. - Agents for climatic wellness and
    anomaly detection. - Piazza Giacomo Mancini - Viale Giacomo Mancini- Corso Mazzini-
    Piazza Bilotti- Bus Station The agents for realizing the climatic wellness management
    and anomaly detection were deployed (S1) and configured (S2), acquaintances were
    established among both the previously-available and the newly-added agents (S3).
    All of this without affecting the already running infrastructure. With respect
    to the climatic and pollution comfort services, two sets of sensor nodes are deployed
    on the involved streets. The first one (type A) is composed by nodes hosting sensors
    for measuring temperature, humidity, luminosity and noise level. The second one
    (type B) is composed by nodes hosting sensors for measuring atmospheric pressure
    and the concentration of pollutant gases such as carbon dioxide ( ), carbon monoxide
    (CO), nitrogen dioxide ( ) and ozone ( ). Each sensor node is managed by its nearest
    computational node, and linked with it through the same Wi-Fi network. All the
    sensor nodes are powered by batteries, which are recharged “on site” by using
    solar panels. Solar panels have been used so as to have no need to modify the
    electric delivery infrastructure of the town for the deployment of the sensor
    nodes. The nodes are Libelium Waspmote Plug&sense,12 which are sensor nodes compatible
    with the Arduino platform, enclosed in an IP64 box. The air pollutant sensors
    are protected by a shield, which mitigates the effects of wind and direct sunlight
    exposition on the precision of the measurements. About 70 sensor nodes have been
    already deployed on the Smart Street areas, as in Fig. 6b. Fig. 7 shows a set
    of them deployed on street lights and walls. The maps in Fig. 6(a), Fig. 6(b)
    show, respectively, the position of the deployed computational and sensor nodes,
    which are denser in the areas where people activities is mainly carried out. Each
    computational node controls a portion of the SSC. The Smart Street Server runs
    on a Linux based server, located at the ICAR-CNR institute, Rende, Italy. The
    same server hosts a JBoss application server, which runs the Smart Street web
    application, and an instance of the MySQL DBMS, which is used for storage purposes.
    The web application can provide information about both the current and historical
    statuses of the SSC. Two screenshots of the web interface are shown in Fig. 8,
    which depicts the map view, showing the global status of the smart street in a
    given time, and the chart view, showing an historical chart of the measures of
    a given sensor in a given time interval. The SSC is running since early 2016.

    detection In this section, a set of charts related to the behavior of the Wellness
    agents and the Anomaly Detection agents are provided, so as to prove the usefulness
    of the deployed SSC. Fig. 9, Fig. 9(a), Fig. 9(b) show the values, respectively,
    of the Humidex and the Simmer Summer Index as computed by the Climatic Wellness
    agent tied to the Sensor Node 040, located at the beginning of Corso Mazzini,
    on July, 7th 2016. It was a summer day, where, as shown in the charts, the comfort
    levels provided by both the indexes result to be very low in the afternoon, so
    the population in that time could be informed accordingly of avoiding the area.
    In fact, the Climatic Wellness agent notified (through the Notification agent)
    the Smart Street Server of the detected dangerous situation. In Fig. 10, Fig.
    10(a) are shown: (i) the global noise averages (averages on all the gathered noise
    sensor values at a given timestamp) computed in real-time by the Measure Aggregation
    agents, (ii) the 99th percentile of the Gamma function (characterized by the average
    and the standard deviation computed by the same Measure Aggregation agents), the
    max sensed noise value for each timestamp, and the area anomaly alerts generated
    by the Anomaly Detection agents as explained in Section 4.2. All the trend lines
    are related to the first week of June, 2016. Since the high values sensed, particular
    interest is given by the area anomalies detected in the evening of June, 3rd where
    the alerts have been generated by the Anomaly Detection agent related to the noise
    sensor at the node 013, located at the center of Corso Mazzini. The same agent
    has also detected, in the same evening, a set of historic anomalies (see Fig.
    10b). In this situation, the agent has notified the Smart Street Server with two
    different alerts, highlighting a situation of high-interest which has to be checked
    by the SSC administrators. As truth assessment, we verified that, in the evening
    of June, 3rd in the place near the sensor node 013 an election rally was taken.

    and historic anomaly detections of the Sensor013 on the June, 3rd 2016. 5. Conclusions
    and future work In this paper we proposed the iSapiens edge-based platform as
    an effective IoT tool for the implementation of distributed Smart City applications.
    Edge computing is implemented by using the agent metaphor natively supported by
    iSapiens. The platform is able to hide the heterogeneity of the involved physical
    devices and protocols. A set of design guidelines were also proposed. Such guidelines
    support an effective exploitation of the offered iSapiens features and allow to
    reach useful benefits in developing Smart City services such as system extensibility,
    fault tolerance, integration of systems, and system maintenance. The resultant
    approach, based on the exploitation of both the iSapiens platform and the proposed
    design guidelines, was validated by the design and the implementation of a real
    case study, namely the Smart Street Cosenza (SSC). The SSC, deployed in the town
    of Cosenza (Italy), has the goal of providing decentralized urban intelligence
    services to citizens. In particular, the working system is able to furnish services
    which are related to climatic and environmental wellness, and to the detection
    of anomalies that may occur in the covered city area. The incremental evolution
    of SSC was discussed, showing, in particular, how the functional and geographical
    extensibility were effectively supported. Finally, an excerpt of the collected
    data and an example of the data analysis carried out by the deployed agents were
    shown. Future work is geared at: extending the SSC by covering new urban areas
    and by adding new services. More in particular, as an example of in-network services,
    a service for urban drainage network optimization is currently under development
    [3], [42] and a traffic control system is planned to be designed. Other services
    under development regard the use of data stream mining algorithms for real-time
    analysis, previsioning and mining on the SSC data; including in iSapiens a library
    of ready-to-use, general-purpose Infrastructural and Operational agents which,
    relying on bio-inspired and peer-to-peer algorithms, simplify the implementation
    of custom applications; integrating iSapiens with the Social Internet of Things
    platform [43], [44], [45], in order to provide social capabilities to objects
    and smart devices exploitable in smart city applications; using the proposed approach
    for developing other smart cyber–physical systems, such as Smart Homes, Smart
    Offices, and Smart Factories. Acknowledgments The authors are grateful to Antonio

    Abstract Information about human social activities and relationships are exploited
    by an ever increasing number of proposed applications and protocols in several
    scenarios, given the consequent increase in the system performance. Examples are
    data transmission over delay tolerant networks, content recommendation in search
    engines, and advertisement of products and services. An emerging field where social
    networks are being exploited is the Internet of Things, where smart objects connect
    to the network to bring the real world into the virtual dimension. Objects capable
    to communicate on social network sites are able to enter into their owners’ social
    loop so as to automatically publish information of interest for selected communities
    of people and to perform some related automatic actions. In so doing, not only
    can objects be part of the human social networks but they can also build their
    own social network. As a consequence, interactions among them can be fostered
    towards the development of complex services for the direct benefit of people.
    Accordingly, objects mimic the human behavior towards a scalable and effective
    service discovery and composition as well as trustworthiness management. On the
    basis of the importance achieved by this trend in the last couple of years, in
    this paper we intend to review the adopted approaches towards the exploitation
    of social network concepts by the Internet of Things, the technologies behind
    these, and the potentialities. Previous article in issue Next article in issue
    Keywords Internet of ThingsSocial networksSmart objects 1. Introduction The number
    of objects that are currently accessing the Internet, side-by-side to human beings
    to advertise, search for, and accessing enhanced services is growing exponentially.
    Among them are sensors, actuators, wireless and mobile devices, or simply every-day-life
    objects enhanced with capabilities to interact with the external world through
    the Internet. This is a clear signal that the much-vaunted (and sometime abused)
    Internet of Things paradigm is already turned into a reality on which there is
    a strong convergence of the interests of researchers, users, and industries. As
    a main effect, we have today a new approach available to build enhanced applications
    and services involving the communications among objects on the Internet to the
    service of the human beings. Several studies have focused their attention to the
    definition of architectural models and solutions towards the use and the inter-connection
    of Web-enabled objects using open protocols and well-known architectural styles,
    REST and SOAP based Web services (such as, [1], [2]). As a consequence, the obvious
    evolutionary step of the IoT is the so called Web of Things (WoTs) that envisages
    new scenarios and applications where Internet enabled objects become active actors
    and peers in the Web. Sample services, applicable to Smart Cities or Smart Homes,
    are given below: • The car driver knows about the status of her car and of the
    roads on the path towards her destination. Such awareness is achieved by accessing,
    through her mobile phone (or through any communication technology in her car),
    web services that are fed by data collected from sensors scattered both in her
    car and in the areas of interest. • The domestic appliances may be accessed by
    the owner through web services from remote sites and some actions can be performed
    on them to prepare comfortable conditions for a better welcome home. • Eco-compatible
    houses may be equipped with controllers and sensors able to measure the local
    energy production and consumption and manageable through web services towards
    a reduction of the environmental impact. Besides the obvious advantages of the
    depicted sample scenarios, one cannot hide the doubts on the ability of the proposed
    solutions to effectively harness the full potential of the new paradigm without
    colliding with the limitations of the current Web service platforms in the presence
    of trillions of additional actors (objects, precisely). In our opinion, Web of
    Things is a paradigm which goes in the right direction but is not the solution
    to the cited issues. To foster resource visibility, service discovery, object
    reputation assessment, source crowding, and service composition in a Web populated
    by people and countless things there is the necessity to strongly push towards
    solutions that exploit concepts directly derived from the sole platforms that
    currently seem to be able to effectively allow peer-to-peer exchanges among huge
    numbers of actors, i.e., Social Networks. Even if several aspects of the social
    networking among humans cannot be directly applied to the objects’ world due to
    the specific distinctive characteristics (e. g., high heterogeneity and limited
    intelligence), such a need has brought to a substantial convergence of the “Internet
    of Things” and “Social Networks” domains. Interesting ideas have recently appeared
    in the IoT arena, which testify to the interests in Social Network oriented solutions
    for the Internet of Things. People at the User Experience Lab at Ericsson Research
    started from the idea that the complexity of network solutions that underlie the
    Internet of Things are hardly understood (and mentally accepted) by all users.
    Thus, it is wise to make this complexity completely transparent during the user-thing
    interactions. Differently, the concept of “friendship” and ‘social relations’
    are understood by virtually everyone, as they are intuitive concepts. As a consequence,
    they proposed a solution to both the practical scalability and understand-ability
    issues which is simply “dressing” a network of things as if it was a social network
    [3]. They have been the first to introduce the concept of “Social Web of Things”
    and also made some applications’ prototypes. Further studies and implementations
    of this concept have been carried out around the world. An example is given by
    the work in [4], where the authors propose a Social Web of Thing Framework based
    on the Restful Web Service and Social Networks, discuss the relevant key technologies
    and use cases, and introduce a case study named MagicHome. Furthermore, even a
    prototype of a scalable architecture for a large scale social Web of Things for
    smart objects and services, named Paraimpu, has been developed [5]. In line with
    this evolutionary path, but from a different perspective, the authors of [6],
    [7] introduce the concept of Social Internet of Things. In analogy with the social
    networks of human beings, they (i) define of a notion of social relationship among
    objects, (ii) design a reference architectural model implementing a social Internet
    of Things based on codified inter-object relationships, (iii) analyze the social
    network structure, which derives from the objects interactions based on the defined
    social relationships. The examples above make us realize that the time is ripe
    for a serious reflection on the possible ways of integrating objects into social
    networks, whether they are shared with those of their owners or they are independent
    and autonomous. Aim of the present paper is to analyze the potentials of a synergic
    use of Social Networks and Internet of Things concepts towards the deployment
    of effective service platforms able to face the future challenges of a future
    world of trillions of inter-connected objects. We will illustrate the main solutions
    that are appearing in the IoT arena to let things enter the so called “social
    loop” and compare their points of strength and their weaknesses by also highlighting
    their technological requirements and architectures. This paper is organized as
    follows. In Section 2 we present the technologies behind the Web of Things as
    one of the prevailing approaches towards the integration of the objects into the
    Internet. In Section 3, we describe how this paradigm can be extended by providing
    the things with the capabilities to take part to the human social activities on
    relevant social network websites. In Section 4 we describe a complementary approach
    that allows objects to build their own social networks, so that interactions among
    them can be fostered towards the development of complex services. In Section 5
    we present the ongoing projects that come out from the concepts described in the
    previous sections. Finally, in Section 6 we draw final conclusions. 2. Web of
    Things paradigm and technologies The ongoing evolution of the Internet of Things
    towards the Web of Things (WoTs), where Web-enabled smart objects connect and
    communicate with each other by using the Web, has raised several research issues
    ranging from the adoption of the right protocol and communication paradigms to
    the choice of the most suitable architectural styles. WoT was not born as a field
    in academic research but rather as the attempt to build an ecosystem from an heterogeneous
    variety of services and products, often not conceived in a way to interoperate.
    Several efforts have focused their attention to the definition of architectural
    models and solutions, towards the use and the interconnection of Web-enabled objects,
    which exploit open protocols and well-known architectural styles, such as Representational
    State Transfer (REST) and Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) based Web services.
    In [8], an architecture is defined for the development of composite applications,
    to interconnect physical devices, on top of the open and simple standards that
    made the success of the Web (REST, XML, HTTP, or Atom). The layered architecture
    is composed as follows: • Device accessibility layer: a layer that from the application
    point of view enables consistent access to all kinds of connected objects. • Find-ability
    layer: a layer that, given an ecosystem of billions of smart things, allows for
    finding their services. • Sharing layer: although device accessibility and find-ability
    can technically allow for sharing data too, this layer is specifically designed
    to manage a social circle authentication, based on accounting and authorization
    procedures. • Composition layer: a layer that enables users to create composite
    applications on top of smart things. The overall goal of this layered architecture
    is to facilitate the integration of smart things with existing services on the
    Web and to facilitate the creation of Web applications by using smart things.
    The layers above are not directly mapped onto the ISO OSI model, but are rather
    useful to understand the foundations of WoT as an ecosystem. The next subsections
    analyze the main aspects relevant to the design choices for architecting the WoT.
    These include: the architectural style (SOAP/REST), the degree of centralization,
    the device/thing degree of accessibility to the network, and the ways in which
    data, services and objects can be composed together. 2.1. SOA(P) vs. REST The
    choice between the SOAP and the REST software architecture styles deserves a deeper
    investigation. In [9] the authors go towards the definition of an architecture
    where devices are viewed as services, in order to integrate a wide range of physical
    devices into distributed IT enterprise systems adopting a Service-Oriented Architecture
    (SOA). In a similar way, the projects WS4D7 and SOCRADES [10] apply a SOA approach
    to the context of embedded networks. Moreover, existing standards for Web Services
    (WSs), focused on embedded devices, such as Device Profile for Web Services (DPWSs)
    [11], confirm a real consensus and effort towards a SOAP-based WoT. On the other
    side, some recent research works (i.e. [12], [13], [14]) adopt REST for IoT/WoT
    architectures. According to the experience documented in [13], the programmatic
    complexity of SOAP based services is not well-suited for the end-user to create
    ad hoc applications, while the authors of [14] state that, in many cases, the
    SOAP complexity becomes superfluous whereas RESTful services can support “a la
    Mash-up” integrations. In a RESTful architecture, the main resources, such as
    entities, collections, or anything else that is worth being represented in the
    application domain, are uniquely identified by its own URI. The reference methods
    - in this case, the HTTP verbs - are mapped onto application semantics in a very
    simple and straightforward way. Many new Internet companies (see the trends in
    Fig. 1) that face the market, often prefer to provide their services through a
    RESTful API rather than a solution based on SOAP. This suggests that, probably,
    REST is more immediate and less expensive for rapid prototyping. Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. REST API vs. SOAP API in Google trends. The main advantages
    of REST web services can be summarized as it follows: • Lightweight – not a lot
    of extra XML markup. • Human Readable Results – in some cases (i.e., a GET request
    of a resource representation), RESTful services can be directly invoked by typing
    the URL in a common web browser. • Easy to build – no toolkits required. SOAP
    also has some advantages mainly related to the formal definition of service interfaces:
    • Easy to consume – clients can be automatically generated on the basis of the
    exact specification provided in the WSDL document. • Rigid – type checking adheres
    to a programming contract and XML schemas are provided for data exchanged to filter
    unacceptable inputs/outputs. • Development tools and business process definition
    (e.g., BPEL language). Even if the locution “Web Service” was often associated
    to the SOAP stack, this is not the way the Web works. Whereas SOAP is aimed at
    the next phase of Internet development defining a set of brand new specifications,
    REST is more the realization that the existing principles and protocols of the
    Web are already there to create robust Web services. Summarizing, even if the
    strong type checking of SOAP based Web services is a plus, in the context of the
    IoT, the RESTful Web Services have some advantages over SOAP such as less overhead,
    less parsing complexity, statelessness, and tighter integration with existing
    HTTP. Moreover, the RESTful protocol called CoAP [15] is similar to HTTP but re-designed
    especially for devices with small footprint and constrained computing environments.
    According to the recent studies mentioned in this paper it seems that the use
    of standards like CoAP and EXI and web paradigms are the key factors for extending
    the Internet making the vision of the IoT become reality. 2.2. Device accessibilty
    It is useful to explore how things can be classified according to their computation
    and communication capabilities. The following list provides a coarse classification:
    • Virtual Things. Like web sites, e-mail boxes and social networks, just to mention
    some. These “objects” can be easily wrapped and then referenced in a HTTP addressing
    space like resources (REST) or like services (WSDL) or they already provide such
    abstractions and interfaces. • HTTP-enabled Smart Appliances. Like wireless printers,
    networked screens, and smartphones. These are already equipped with a network
    connection and a complete HTTP stack but usually do not provide a WS stack; thus,
    it is necessary to deploy a proxy or to install a minimal WS stack in the device,
    where possible. Usually, HTTP-enabled objects are not able to receive incoming
    requests from outside. In many cases, they are deployed under firewall restrictions
    and only can act as clients. One possibility is to deploy in the middle a relay
    like YALER [16], which enables secure Web access to embedded systems behind a
    firewall/NAT/network gateway. A simple HTTP handshake makes a Web service running
    on the hidden device accessible from any HTTP client. Another option is WebSocket,
    which provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.
    The WebSocket API is being standardized by the W3C, and the WebSocket protocol
    has been standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455. • Internet-enabled Things that
    are not equipped with a complete HTTP stack but can still communicate at the TCP/IP
    or UDP/IP level. For those objects it is straightforward to build a HTTP wrapper
    and a WS stack as a proxy. A viable protocol alternative to HTTP is CoAP [15].
    CoAP could be viewed as a compression or redesign of HTTP by taking power, memory,
    and computation constraints into account. Just like HTTP, which is designed as
    a transfer protocol for traditional web media content, CoAP is redesigned as a
    transfer protocol for devices to implement interoperations. • Network-enabled
    Things that cannot communicate over IP networks, but still can communicate with
    different protocols like ZigBee, Bluetooth or X10. For those objects a proxy can
    be deployed to present them in the HTTP addressing space, by also using WS technology
    standards. A viable solution to extend IP also to small devices that usually are
    not equipped with IP-stack is 6LoWPAN [17]. • Things not digitally enabled, bare
    physical objects. For these objects a digital counterpart must be built and published
    online. RFID or barcode sticks can be used to interface these objects with devices
    and networks. 2.3. Centralized vs. decentralized Decentralized architectures have
    a number of theoretical advantages, such as single-point-of-failure robustness
    and privacy/anonymity enforcing capability. When analyzing the Web, one discovers
    that (i) the degree of decentralization is quite low, (ii) the prominent topology
    is client–server, and (iii) even if P2P networks have gained popularity in some
    application areas, the idea to move computation at the boundaries of the Internet
    is more a niche than a main stream. The distinction between client–server and
    P2P architectures is no longer a technological distinction, but a matter of governance.
    The so-called “clouds” often adopt their own solutions of P2P load-balancing and
    fault tolerance, but the control is centralized in the hands of one provider.
    Cloud computing and Software-as-a-Service demonstrate that large IT companies
    are concentrating computation inside large globally distributed infrastructures;
    thus, transforming personal computing in a mere user interface to remote computing
    services. Also, in the new field of Internet-enabled objects, we foresee that
    P2P connections between objects are unlikely to occur unless hard real-time and
    multimedia communications are involved. A centralized online service can speak
    multiple protocols and data formats on top of HTTP and can act as a broker to
    let services meet in a logical space; it can be a proxy of data coming from sources
    and can be a relay of data to consumer services; moreover, it can make data format
    adaptation where required. In other words, it can operate at all the layers described
    above, from device accessibility to composition. In a centralized WoT tool the
    workload is put at the extreme. Some applications need to have samples on every
    second, and even only one thousand sensors connected to a central server would
    produce 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 = 86400000 events per day. The load is structured
    in many small HTTP POST messages with a keep-alive connection. The requirements
    for a cloud-based Web of Things architecture (see Fig. 2) can be summarized as
    it follows: • C10 K+[18] capable web servers (C10 K + stands for 10,000 or more
    HTTP connections handled simultaneously, i.e. non-blocking servers that do not
    map every connection to a system thread); • database engine able to be horizontally
    partitioned over a grid of machines in a transparent way (sharding); • event handling
    and data processing delegated to a pool of worker processes distributed among
    multiple processors and even different machines. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. The architecture of a WoT-cloud based service. In [19], a little
    but insightful benchmark between a non-blocking web server, like Nginx, versus
    a thread-based server, like Apache, is presented. The plots show (Fig. 3, Fig.
    4) how the throughput of Nginx are still high even with a large number of connections
    and with a very low memory usage. Nevertheless, the WoT system designer must consider
    that to fully gain an advantage from a non-blocking Web server, all the components
    in the backend must be designed to be non-blocking as well. Download : Download

    (threaded) web servers [19]. 2.4. Smart objects in service orchestrations A big
    issue in composing objects/services to form an application logic, is how to ensure
    that data coming from a data source can be properly read and processed by a recipient
    data sink. The intuitive, but not widely practicable solution, is to adopt a rigorous
    set of data schemas shared by all participants. In this way connections could
    be handled with no pains because every object that consumes data is able to receive
    and to decide what to do with the data. Unfortunately, having a common set of
    data types defined and shared for all interconnected objects is far to be realistic.
    Objects are built from different manufacturers for vertical applications, often
    inside walled gardens or with small capabilities to interoperate with external
    entities. A more realistic assumption is to consider objects able to produce data
    in a format among those commonly encapsulated into HTTP messages. So we can expect
    that a data source can push a string containing either numbers or alphanumeric
    values, or more structured data like JSON objects or XML instances. As an example,
    Paraimpu [20] implements the concept of mapping as a couple of expressions in
    the form of (cond, repl), where cond is a boolean expression while the repl expression
    is a valid instance of the data type expected by the sink (the actuator). This
    approach can be subsumed in the more general IF-THEN paradigm applied to events,
    data and actions in the IoT. The online service called IFTTT (IF This Than That),
    although initially conceived for social networks and not for physical mashups,
    is the immediate proof-of-concept of how this mechanism can work. Also other sensor
    data collectors like COSM (former Pachube) implements the concept of trigger (IF
    condition on datum THEN post datum on URL). A more versatile approach is to use
    business process definition to declare a more complex composition logic. In the
    case of SOAP-based WoT mashups, interactions can be described in two ways: executable
    processes and abstract processes. Both can be modeled by BPEL. Executable processes
    model the actual behavior of a participant as interactions, while abstract processes
    describe the observable behavior and/or process template. BPEL extends the WS-∗
    interaction model to enable business transactions. BPEL defines an interoperable
    composition model that enables the extension of automated process integration
    both within and between businesses. Pintus et al. [21] also propose a SOA framework
    where smart things are described by using the WSDL standard, while logical connections
    between smart things are modeled as web services orchestrations by using the BPEL
    language. The availability of an API to be consumed by clients, of course, opens
    also the possibility to write third-party programs or scripts in arbitrary programming
    languages and build applications as a result of the composition of data coming
    from source objects, processed and transformed into actions for other smart objects.
    3. Adding the social aspect to WoT To date, IoT has been conceived as a top-down
    technology that silently takes the control of objects in a machine-to-machine
    internetworking with large benefit for logistics, manufacturing, and business
    productivity. On the other hand, the point we stress here is that for IoT/WoT
    to acquire some socialization value, end-users should be enabled to be active
    and creative in the definition of new relationships where smart things become
    either an instrument or a toy to share or to play with collaboratively. In this
    respect, it is important to provide users with enabling platforms, based on known
    and understandable metaphors, to manage, control and personalize the composition
    between sensor data and actions in the real life. In order to enable a wide adoption
    of WoT in all sectors of the society, the WoT architecture and its protocols should
    motivate every citizens to contribute to a growing number of devices and smart
    objects in order to build new streams of information available to the community.
    We can identify at least two generic use cases. The first one is the participatory
    sensing and the second one is the “device in a circle”. Participatory sensing
    applications use data of mobile sensor nodes collected in collaboration with the
    device owner. With the right tools, community groups may participate in campaigns
    to collect data on highly-focused topics, such as traffic patterns, pollution-safe
    routes for school buses, without waiting for an institutional body or private
    agency to perform the detection. For example, the NoiseTube project [22], started
    in 2008 at the Sony Computer Science Lab in Paris and currently hosted by the
    BrusSense Team at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel, proposes a participative approach
    for monitoring noise pollution by involving the general public. For users to become
    active in the bottom-up construction of a participatory sensing scenario, aspects
    like trust, reputation, control of distributed devices and tracking of information
    flows must be appropriately adjusted to control what is happening with the information
    and devices contributed. The identities of users are not harvested and should
    be kept anonymous while on the other hands the management of reputation of the
    data produced must be deployed to allow the participatory sensing to become effective
    and discard malicious or irrelevant data. In the “device in the social circle”
    use case the social-ability is a key element to share and collaboratively use
    the smart things in the Web. Device accessibility layer and findability layer
    can technically allow sharing as well, but to manage physical objects in a social
    circle, features like authentication, accounting and authorization need to be
    properly designed and implemented. Integrating smart objects and main-stream social
    networks is another key aspect. Every WoT system who aims to become popular and
    adopted by users, should integrate and communicate with social media in some way.
    In some extent, existing social media are the precursor of the future social IoT
    because they have already faced a number of issues like privacy concerns, content
    moderation, insights visualization and so forth. The integration of Social media
    and Web of Things can occur in many ways: • User login/authentication: users can
    access a system by using existing credentials without building a brand new profile.
    Thanks to the Oauth protocol, the user is redirected to her/his preferred social
    tool to perform the login. This leads to the immediate benefit to have contacts/friends
    imported in the new system. In this way, it would be possible for a generic WoT
    site to connect its users with their Facebook or Twitter counterparts. • Social
    network as monitoring tool, for instance the IoT portal [23]: it allows users
    to quickly connect sensors and actuators to the system, and then create dashboard
    visualizations as Facebook applications. These applications allow users to share
    and monitor sensed data and control actuators in the real world. • Sensors/actuators:
    a social entity, such as user’s Facebook wall and the Twitter flow associated
    to an hashtag, can be considered a sensor or an actuator (or both) just like physical
    things in the implementation of virtual-to-physical mashups. For instance, the
    “device in the circle” could be a set of parking sensors and the social circle
    could be the list containing the customers’ contacts of a restaurant keeper. As
    an example, the restaurant manager can build a geographical selection of parking
    sensors in the neighborhood saving this selection as a datasource in her work
    space called “parkingSlots”. Then she can create a link between the selected datasource
    and her customer list using for instance his Facebook profile. In so doing, her
    customers will receive the number of free slots directly on their mobile or PC
    and decide to go there by car or by other means. As dual example, the “device
    in the circle” can be a device shared and controlled by means of social media,
    like for example, a multimedia installation, even on a large scale (e.g., night-time
    lighting of a skyscraper). The social circle may be the set of users of a certain
    social network that post messages to a certain topic (for example, a topic with
    a hash tag on twitter). Analytics based on text recognition (or even mood recognition)
    on tweets may trigger different actions on the installation (for example, the
    ignition with certain colors or with certain choreography). • The social dimension
    is useful for device/thing find-ability: the navigability of users’ profiles enables
    to discover objects shared by friends, but also to find new friends and new devices/things.
    4. Evolution of social Internet of Things 4.1. Objects that handle social relationships
    In the IoT, everything real becomes virtual, which means that each person and
    thing has a locatable, addressable, and readable counterpart on the Internet.
    These virtual entities can produce and consume services and collaborate toward
    a common goal. The car driver might know about the status of her car and of the
    roads towards her destination, thanks to the autonomous communications of the
    sensors and actuators in her car with those installed in other vehicles and along
    the road. The embedded system in a swimming pool could share its state with other
    virtual entities. All these scenarios are possible with an intense interaction
    between objects and related services, enabling the most powerful and fascinating
    applications. For instance, in [24] the authors introduce the idea of objects
    able to participate in conversations that were previously only available to humans.
    Those envisioned are objects aware of dynamic community structures, thus being
    able to develop a spontaneous networking infrastructure based on the information
    to be disseminated other than information on the objects themselves. Analogously,
    the research activities reported in [25] consider that, being things involved
    into the network together with people, social networks can be built based on the
    Internet of Things and are meaningful to investigate the relations and evolution
    of objects in IoT. Again, IoT and social network technologies and concepts are
    jointly exploited towards the development of tools that can make people’s lives
    easier. This time the idea is to use social networking elements in the Internet
    of Things to allow objects to autonomously establish social relationships. The
    driving motivation is that a social-oriented approach is expected to put forward
    the discovery, selection and composition of services and information provided
    by distributed objects and networks that have access to the physical world. The
    proposed social-oriented approach is characterized by the capabilities of the
    objects to autonomously establish social relationships of different kinds [24],
    [26], [7]. Within the resulting object social network, a key objective will be
    to publish information and services, find them, and discover novel resources to
    support the implementation of complex services and applications. This can be achieved
    in a trusty and efficient way by navigating a social network of “friend” objects,
    instead of relying on typical Internet discovery tools that cannot scale to billions
    of future devices. Indeed, social networking concepts have proven to be of great
    importance for handling the relationships among humans and, in the same way, these
    are expected to have a great impact on the management of services in the IoT.
    Specifically, in [7] the Social Internet of Things (SIoTs) has been proposed.
    According to this model, a set of forms of socialization among objects are foreseen
    as shown in Fig. 5. The parental object relationship is defined among similar
    objects, built in the same period by the same manufacturer (the role of family
    is played by the production batch). Moreover, objects can establish co-location
    object relationship and co-work object relationship, like humans do when they
    share personal (e.g., cohabitation) or public (e.g., work) experiences. A further
    type of relationship is defined for objects owned by the same user (mobile phones,
    game consoles, etc.), which is named ownership object relationship. The last relationship
    is established when objects come into contact, sporadically or continuously, for
    reasons purely related to relations among their owners (e.g., devices/sensors
    belonging to friends); it is named social object relationship. These relationships
    are created and updated on the basis of the objects features (such as: object
    type, computational power, mobility capabilities, brand) and activity (frequency
    in meeting the other objects, mainly). The parental and ownership relationships
    are determined by just the static characteristics of the object (or slowly varying
    characteristics): type, brand, ownership. The others are determined by the movement
    of the object and by the other nodes it encounters. The relationships’ management
    is implemented in the cloud, in the object gateways, and in the objects themselves,
    if capable of supporting the relevant logic. Clearly, the configuration of these
    functionalities is controlled by the object owner; accordingly, the resulting
    links are asymmetrical. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Sketch of
    the five types of relationships defined in the SIoT paradigm. To manage the resulting
    network and relationships, the foreseen SIoT architecture is made of four major
    components (among others). The Relationship management introduces into the SIoT
    the intelligence that allows objects to start, update, and terminate relationships.
    The selection of which friendship to accept is based on human control settings.
    Service discovery is finalized to find which objects can provide the required
    service in the same way humans seek for friendships and information. Indeed, to
    discover the service, the object queries its social relationship network. Service
    composition enables the interaction among objects. The service discovery exploits
    the object relationships to find the desired service, which is then activated
    by this component. Both a reactive and a proactive approach to service composition
    are envisaged. This component will also include the functionality of crowd information
    processing, to process the information obtained from different objects and obtain
    the most reliable answer to a query on the basis of different visions. Trustworthiness
    management is aimed at understanding how the information provided by other members
    has to be processed. 4.2. The SIoT architecture In [6], a possible SIoT architecture
    has been proposed, which follows the simple three-layer architectural model for
    IoT. In this model, the sensing layer is devoted to data acquisition and node
    collaboration in short-range and local networks. The network layer is aimed at
    transferring data across different networks. Finally, the application layer is
    where the IoT applications are deployed together with the middleware functionalities.
    The application layer is the key part in the SIoT, making this architectural proposal
    distinctive with respect to alternative solutions. It consists of three sub-layers,
    with the base sub-layer devoted to the database for the storage and management
    of the data and relevant descriptors, which record the social member profiles
    and their relationships, as well as the activities carried out by the objects
    in the real and virtual worlds. The component sub-layer works on top of the base
    sub-layer and implements the functionalities described in the previous subsection,
    i.e., relationship management, service discovery, service composition, trustworthiness
    management. The application layer is where the application are located, relying
    on the social-oriented behavior of the objects. With the intent to highlight the
    distinctive features of the SIoT architecture, in Fig. 6 we provide a mapping
    of the major SIoT components into the reference model provided in [27] by the
    IoT-A European research project, which represents a major effort in defining a
    reference architecture for the existing and future IoT solutions. In this figure,
    we show the five functional layers with the main functionalities in gray-colored
    boxes. In the upper layer are located the applications that are built on top of
    an implementation of the IoT-A architecture. This represents instances of the
    process execution and service orchestration, which indeed is used to combine different
    services (also provided by different system implementations) to implement complex
    services. The relevant APIs are also a key part of this layer. The virtual entity
    (VE) and information is the layer that maintains and organizes information related
    to physical entities, enabling search for services exposing resources associated
    to physical entities. Accordingly, it is intended to response to queries about
    a particular physical entity by providing with addresses of the service related
    to the physical entity. The lower layer, i.e., the IoT service and resource, links
    specific services to the related resources. It also notifies application software
    and services about events related to resources and corresponding physical entities.
    The Device connectivity and communication layer provides the set of methods and
    primitives for device connectivity and communication. Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Major functionalities of the SIoT system (in blue color) in the
    IoT-A reference architecture. In Fig. 6, we have highlighted the main features
    of the SIoT solution. At the second layer, the SIoT system may require the extension
    of the object descriptions to support the creation and management of the social-oriented
    behavior and relationships, such as: owner ID; object position, which can be changing
    over the time depending on the object mobility features; power supply status,
    that defines whether the object is either battery-powered (and the battery power
    level is provided), socket-connected (and whether is currently connected or not),
    or it harvests power from the environment; amount of traffic generated in terms
    of number of connections and overall bit-rate. The objects could also be grouped
    into different classes, depending on their main characteristics, such as mobility,
    computational and communication capabilities, interfaces, sensing capabilities,
    power supply. At the third layer, the major part of the SIoT functionalities needs
    to be introduced. These also call for the definition of specific ontologies and
    semantic engines. The ontologies are used to represent a semantic view of the
    social activities, which is extracted through appropriate semantic engines. The
    objective is to provide a machine interpretable environment for representing attributes
    and operations of the IoT devices. Many works have already been conducted in this
    area, which could be partially used in the SIoT scenario, e.g., Ontology Web Language
    for Services (OWL-S) model, which has already been used as the basis of a semantic
    service modeling framework for the IoT [28], [29]. Accordingly, services are used
    as an interface that represents the IoT resources (i.e., the physical world devices)
    and provide an access to the functions and capabilities of these resources. Ontologies
    to manage and control heterogeneous systems have also been investigated in [27].
    This highlights that an automatic discovery will be impossible without ontological
    classification and semantic annotation processes. In [30], the importance of the
    ontology has been analyzed from a social network perspective as a format to represent
    the object information which is relevant to end users. Other approaches for creating
    semantic service descriptions could be used as described in [31]. These include:
    Semantic Annotations for WSDL (SAWSDL), Unified Service Description Language (USDL),
    Web Service Modelling Language (WSML), Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO),
    and Semantic Annotations for Representational State Transfer SA-REST [32]. The
    relationship management module is the one responsible to establish, update, and
    terminate the relationships among the objects in their virtual representation.
    It also elaborates the social network to facilitate the discovery of the services
    by identifying different clusters of resource relationships. Possible approaches
    are to make use of similarity measures and multi-scale renormalization and synergetic
    – self organization techniques. These should be embodied into the SIoT learners
    and adaptors of virtual resources following the cognitive networks paradigm. Consequently,
    an object social graph is built with objects that are linked by edges representing
    the established relationships, each one weighted by its computed degrees. This
    module is also responsible for calculating several topological features of the
    resource social graph such as: between-ness, closeness, degree/eigenvector hubs
    and authorities centrality measures. This allows for determining the most “central”
    nodes/resources, which is a key activity because the identified “central” nodes/resources
    will be those that control the data flows in SIoT and influence the rest of nodes/resources.
    By doing so, the “central” nodes will be marked as landmarks, representative for
    their local neighborhood. The service discovery functionality is key in the third
    layer, since it is needed to find which objects can provide a service requested
    in the target application. This functionality should be implemented into the SIoT
    system by following the rules the humans adopt to seek for friendships and for
    any information in the social networking services. The discovery will be guided
    by the object social graph as described above. The trust management module is
    the one responsible to address the inherent risks in transactions with no prior
    experience with regard to the reputation of every other node. In doing this, it
    exploits the resource social graph to build a reputation-based trust mechanism
    for the IoT that can effectively deal with certain types of malicious behavior
    that intend to mislead other nodes [33]. In such a scenario, two possible models
    for the implementation of the Trustworthiness management can be followed. One
    is the subjective trustworthiness, derived from a social point of view, where
    each node computes the trustworthiness of its friends on the basis of its own
    experience and on the basis of its friends’ experiences. If two nodes are not
    friends, then the trustworthiness is calculated by word of mouth through a chain
    of friendships. The other is the objective trustworthiness, obtained from P2P
    scenarios, where the information about each node is distributed and stored by
    making use of a DHT (Distributed Hash Table) structure. This information is visible
    to every node but is only managed by special nodes that we call Pre-Trusted Objects
    (PTOs). Finally, the service composition component enables the interaction between
    services provided by different objects to achieve complex services and applications.
    Most of the time, the interaction is related to an object that wishes either to
    retrieve an information about the real world or to find a specific service provided
    by another object. In fact, the main potential we see in deploying SIoT is its
    capability to foster such an information retrieval. 5. On-going projects The projects
    listed here bring together the technological aspects, related to the functionality
    offered by the so-called smart objects, with the social aspects. Projects in this
    list mainly fall into one of the three scenarios emerged from the previous sections:
    participatory sensing, device-in-the-circle, and devices-that-socialize. The tools
    to compose and build personalized and social application that merges together
    data from different sources belong to a field in continuous evolution and such
    tools are often the basis for other projects: they are mainly cloud-based because
    the cloud is always there, up and running, it is reachable from everywhere, and
    a large amount of application complexity can be moved from the target devices
    to the cloud components. Among these tools are: Ninja Blocks [34], IFTTT [35]
    and Paraimpu [36]. Ninja Blocks is a project started in 2012 from the crowdfunding
    platform Kickstarter.com. Ninja Blocks are cloud-based devices that can sense
    their environment and can act by controlling lights, power sockets, and other
    actuators. The system provides a tool to compose actions and sensing with common
    social web sites like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram. Among the sensors there is
    also a camera. IFTTT is a San Francisco based startup whose service enables customers
    to create and share within minutes very simple applications that fit the “if this
    then that” rule. An example of application can be IF “someone tags me on Facebook
    picture” then “put the picture on my Dropbox”. IFTTT was initially conceived for
    Internet services and social media and only later, in June 2012, the service crossed
    over to the physical world by integrating with Belkin WeMo [37] devices allowing
    IFTTT rules to compose social media events with home automation. Paraimpu is a
    cloud-based research prototype from CRS4, which provides the functionality to
    manage smart Things and to compose them with services already on the Web to create
    personalized applications. Common DIY (Do It Yourself) boards like Arduino, can
    be easily integrated as the system automatically generates the code for these
    boards to produce/receive data. Paraimpu allows people to share smart things and
    devices in their social circle enabling social physical-virtual Web mash-ups.
    The availability of such tools is fostering the development of personalized and
    interesting installation. At the moment these are generated by a small niche of
    geeks and early adopters but, to some extent, pave the way for a future diffusion
    and adoption of smart things in everyday social life. Among the installations,
    here are reported three “device-in-the-circle” cases: • Jardimpu [38] (based on
    Arduino and Paraimpu) is an automated irrigation system based on the sensing of
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, light conditions, which is then used to
    control the level of water in some plant’s saucers (e.g. Dionaea Muscipula). This
    system is not an absolute novelty in the field of sensors-based garden irrigation,
    but it is one of the first examples of “social” gardening: people in the social
    circle can activate the drippers, can see plants in a live streaming, and can
    monitor their parameters. • TLight is a permanent installation created by the
    Quit group [39] and connected to the web thanks to Paraimpu, which allows everyone
    to change the color tones and the behavior of the lights placed on the top of
    the big glass tower of the T-Hotel in Cagliari. To interact with the lights, a
    twitter user can post a message on with hashtag:#thotel followed by any phrase
    containing one of the following words: red, blue, green, orange, yellow, white,
    cyan, purple, wave, different, couple, full, pulse e random. • Natural Fuse [40]
    is a social IoT game based on COSM [41]. Participants get a Natural Fuse unit
    which consists of a houseplant and a power socket. The amount of power available
    to the socket is limited by the capacity of the plant to offset the carbon footprint
    of the energy expended. If people cooperate on energy expenditure then the plants
    thrive (and everyone may use more energy). But if people do not cooperate, then
    the network starts to randomly kill plants. The electricity depends on the plants
    just as the plants depend on the electricity. The work carried on in the field
    of Social Web of Things by Ericsson also deserves a citation as “devices-that-socialize”
    use case. Researchers at Ericsson in fact are working on methods for connecting
    device into a social media platform for nodes that are not people. Recently they
    have presented at the Connected House exhibit, a social network interface that
    linked all of the different connected nodes in a home as well as trusted points
    in the public sphere. Another very popular project is Waze. Waze is a company
    based on Israel which developed a service called social-GPS. The service is aimed
    at avoid traffic, and it is based on a large community spread all over the world.
    It allows, through a smart phone equipped with GPS, to share real-time traffic
    information and help everyone to save time and fuel. Even if it does not make
    use of any exotic hardware but it totally relies on the smartphone functionalities,
    it is a perfect example of tool for participatory sensing. At the same time, it
    is also a case of “device-in-the-circle” because the connection with Facebook
    allows participants to see their friends on the map to coordinate arrival times
    to give or get rides or meet up with other participants. In the field of Smart
    Cities, the project CityScripts [42] is an experiment built on top of the SmartSantander
    [43] platform (with a base of 12,000 urban sensors deployed in the city of Santander).
    The CityScripts project is aimed at integrating and experimenting a Web of Things
    scenario in which sensors and actuators in the city have a digital counterpart
    and can be used by citizens to compose personal applications integrating sensor
    data with social networks and other online data sources. 6. Conclusions In this
    paper, we have reviewed the main approaches followed during the last years to
    make objects part of the human social loop and grant them a role within the human
    social network sites. This objective has been achieved by extending the paradigm
    of Web of Things to give things the capabilities to automatically post information
    on the social network sites and to be reached through these as well. A complementary
    approach is the one according to which objects have their own social network,
    which is independent from those of the humans but still controlled by them (albeit
    progressively less, as technologies progresses). The two approaches can be combined
    so that part of the information and actions of relevance for one social network
    type, that is the one where humans rule, can be exported/imported to/into the
    other one, where objects rule. Certainly, the objective of these approaches is
    to address the complexity in the management of the trillions of objects that will
    be connected to the network in a couple of years and to exploit their major potentialities.
    Through the presented survey of ongoing projects, we learned that the implementations
    deployed so far are limited in their potentialities. These only focus on specific
    applications and do not converge on an interoperable platform where social networking
    concepts are adopted as the major principles that drive the object interactions.

    \ Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are increasingly\
    \ making\nan impact in a wide range of domain-speciﬁc applications. In IoT-integrated\
    \ WSNs, nodes generally\nfunction with limited battery units and, hence, energy\
    \ efﬁciency is considered as the main design\nchallenge. For homogeneous WSNs,\
    \ several routing techniques based on clusters are available, but\nonly a few\
    \ of them are focused on energy-efﬁcient heterogeneous WSNs (HWSNs). However,\
    \ security\nprovisioning in end-to-end communication is the main design challenge\
    \ in HWSNs. This research\nwork presents an energy optimizing secure routing scheme\
    \ for IoT application in heterogeneous\nWSNs. In our proposed scheme, secure routing\
    \ is established for conﬁdential data of the IoT through\nsensor nodes with heterogeneous\
    \ energy using the multipath link routing protocol (MLRP). After\nestablishing\
    \ the secure routing, the energy and network lifetime is improved using the hybrid-based\n\
    TEEN (H-TEEN) protocol, which also has load balancing capacity. Furthermore, the\
    \ data storage\ncapacity is improved using the ubiquitous data storage protocol\
    \ (U-DSP). This routing protocol\nhas been implemented and compared with two other\
    \ existing routing protocols, and it shows an\nimprovement in performance parameters\
    \ such as throughput, energy efﬁciency, end-to-end delay,\nnetwork lifetime and\
    \ data storage capacity.\nKeywords: WSNs; IoT; heterogeneous WSN; multipath link\
    \ routing protocol (MLRP); hybrid-based\nTEEN; ubiquitous data storage protocol\
    \ (U-DSP)\n1. Introduction\nThe IoT and WSNs are becoming viable solutions that\
    \ are widely utilized in real-time\ndata collection and monitoring applications,\
    \ which include automated irrigation, target\nmonitoring, observing clinical records,\
    \ tracking landslides and predictions for forest ﬁre\nand disaster management.\
    \ A WSN consists of numerous effective sensor nodes (SNs) that\nmonitor climatic\
    \ disasters found in harsh or remote areas. Furthermore, the SNs examine\nthe\
    \ atmospheric factors such as pressure, temperature, humidity, sound and moisture\n\
    content representing intense symptoms. After an SN completes its sensing operation,\
    \ the\nEnergies 2022, 15, 4777. https://doi.org/10.3390/en15134777\nhttps://www.mdpi.com/journal/energies\n\
    Energies 2022, 15, 4777\n2 of 16\ninformation is gathered and transmitted to the\
    \ base station (BS). The sensor and data\ncommunication units of SNs consume more\
    \ energy and once the entire energy is exhausted,\nit expires or is unable to\
    \ process [1]. Hence, a node that is considered dead is unsuitable\nfor either\
    \ replacing with or recharging using an alternate power source. Hence, balancing\n\
    the power utilization of a SN is more essential. To overcome these challenges,\
    \ several\ndevelopers have used clustering approaches [2], which can scale up\
    \ the network lifetime\nand provide remarkable efﬁciency. Furthermore, it is supportive\
    \ in maintaining power\nas numerous reliable clusters are formed. These clusters,\
    \ based on the techniques used,\ncan either be considered temporary or permanent.\
    \ Moreover, clustering distributes the\nnodes that are placed jointly, which is\
    \ accomplished based on similarity metrics such as\nthe distance from the base\
    \ station (BS), radius of transmission and density of the cluster.\nAfter the\
    \ clusters are formed, a node from the cluster is chosen as the cluster head (CH)\n\
    whose responsibility is to organize the data gathered from cluster members (CM)\
    \ and\ntransmit those data to the BS. When a single node cluster is considered,\
    \ it mandatorily\ncommunicates with the sink rather than the BS, which ﬁnally\
    \ results in a reduction in\npower utilization. In WSNs, the serious threats,\
    \ along with the technical challenges, which\narise due to the nature of resource\
    \ constraints and its limited availability [3], have to be\nfocused on to ensure\
    \ revision and distribution. With WSNs in an open area, the sensors\nare more\
    \ vulnerable to the unfriendly environment that arises due to humidity, increased\n\
    temperature, pressure, snow, rain, dust and so on. These affect the functions\
    \ of the wireless\nsensor network, and hence a demand arises to introduce robust\
    \ and ﬂexible SNs. Moreover,\ngeneral and future challenges are constrained to\
    \ the limited resources, the limited ability\nof communication, fault tolerance,\
    \ stability, mobility, bandwidth, precision, reliability,\navailability, heterogeneity,\
    \ accountability, uncontrollable setup and denial of service (DoS).\nAbove all,\
    \ some speciﬁc challenges have turned the attention of the researchers towards\n\
    the utilization of power, network duration, throughput, security and routing protocols.\
    \ In\nWSNs, during communication, energy consumption is a highly prominent issue\
    \ that seeks\nattention. Energy efﬁciency has a greater impact on the entire performance\
    \ of the network\nand acts as a signiﬁcant function in the lifespan of a WSN [4].\
    \ The metrics that are essential\nwhile routing and estimating the cost function\
    \ (CF) in a WSN are total energy, energy\nconsumed and residual energy. Energy\
    \ is one of the most signiﬁcant aspects of the efﬁcient\nworking of wireless sensor\
    \ networks. The longevity of the network is totally dependent\nupon the optimum\
    \ use of the available energy; therefore, optimization is much needed for\nthe\
    \ efﬁcient utilization of energy. Routing protocol, considered as an important\
    \ factor, has\nto be selected carefully to route the data packets safely to the\
    \ destination with less overhead\nbecause of the resource constraints of SNs,\
    \ namely, their limited power and shorter range\nfor communication. Numerous efforts\
    \ have been made to bring out the best solutions for\nWSNs, yet extraordinary\
    \ works are required [5]. The beneﬁts of the IoT are as follows. An\nurban IoT\
    \ has many facilities that may bring a number of beneﬁts such as the management\n\
    and optimization of traditional public services, including transport and parking\
    \ facilities,\nlighting, the surveillance and maintenance of public areas, preservation\
    \ of cultural heritage,\ngarbage collection, public health care, i.e., hospitals,\
    \ and schools. Therefore, the availability\nof different types of data that will\
    \ store in the cloud or be collected by a data warehouse\nin the urban IoT should\
    \ increase the transparency and promote the actions of the local\ngovernment or\
    \ municipality towards the citizens, which can increase the awareness of\npeople\
    \ about the status of their city and their life style. Therefore, the application\
    \ of\nthe IoT paradigm to the smart city is attractive and expansive for local\
    \ government and\nadministrations; however, it take times to adopt IoT technology\
    \ in a wide manner.\nThis research is organized as follows: A detailed review\
    \ of the literature related to this\nresearch is described in Section 2. The design,\
    \ algorithms and functionality of the proposed\nprotocol are elaborated on in\
    \ Section 3. The simulation results of the proposed protocol are\npresented in\
    \ Section 4, which is followed by the conclusion in Section 5.\nEnergies 2022,\
    \ 15, 4777\n3 of 16\n2. Related Works\nMostly, in large scale networks such as\
    \ the IoT and SNs with restricted constraints, the\ndemanding factor is energy\
    \ conservation. Generally, in networks based on clusters [6], the\ncontrolling\
    \ entity is CH, whose signiﬁcant role is to gather data and transmit them. Further-\n\
    more, in large scale WSNs integrated with the IoT, the crucial part is to route\
    \ data securely\nas they involve constrained resources. Several existing approaches\
    \ do not provide reliable\nand secure data routing in the network as they lack\
    \ protection schema against threats [7].\nA low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy\
    \ (LEACH) protocol consists of multi-stages [8].\nThe LEACH protocol’s performance\
    \ was improved by applying a multi-hop basis for trans-\nmitting information [9].\
    \ The design elucidated the unstable consumption of energy as the\nclusters were\
    \ randomly created. Moreover, the multi-hop paths created were not optimized,\n\
    which resulted in route breaks. In a chain–chain-based routing protocol (CCBRP)\
    \ [10], the\nprinciples of LEACH as well as Power-Efﬁcient Gathering in Sensor\
    \ Information Systems\n(PEGASIS) were integrated, which resulted in scalable energy\
    \ conservation in SNs while\nforwarding data. This hybrid CCBRP protocol, which\
    \ was executed in two stages, reﬂected\nthe drawback of a higher energy consumption\
    \ in the nodes and the production of high\nlatency. Subsequently, as the scalability\
    \ is restricted, CCBRP was not suitable for larger\nnetworks. Kumar et al., proposed\
    \ a data collection as well as a load balancing scheme that\nwas designed to save\
    \ energy. The network performance was improved in this scheme as\nthe aggregating\
    \ data were sequenced by data forwarding [11]. A vigorous authentication\nprotocol\
    \ for energy efﬁciency was developed for an industrial IoT-based WSN, which pro-\n\
    vided scalable data security. In this method, mutual authentication was followed\
    \ between\nnodes, but the energy was consumed gratuitously, thereby compromising\
    \ the network\nlifetime [12]. Likewise, the Shamir secret sharing method comprised\
    \ two phases, namely,\nshare generation as well as reconstruction. The generated\
    \ secret was distributed among\nnodes and the secret key was reconstructed by\
    \ the usage of any nodes of the subset. The\ndata transmission using this method\
    \ consumed additional energy leading to routing over-\nheads [13]. If the ﬂow\
    \ entry exists, the forwarding is performed according to the ﬂow table,\nand if\
    \ not, the packet-in message is sent to the subset. After receiving the packet-in\
    \ message,\nthe subset will make a decision. An improved three-layer hybrid clustering\
    \ method (ETL-\nHCM) analysed and limited the control trafﬁc speciﬁcally while\
    \ selecting CH. This method\nachieved an 18% improvement in the lifetime of the\
    \ network as well as half of the nodes\nbeing alive compared with the hybrid hierarchical\
    \ clustering approach (HHCA). However,\nthis method was not suitable for selecting\
    \ the grid head (GH) [14]. To beat hateful attacks\nsuch as Sybil, wormholes and\
    \ a black hole, a novel protocol was introduced by Haseeb\net al. to ensure reliable\
    \ routing and data transmission [15]. The functioning of a combined\nGIN with\
    \ GEAR protocol resulted in being too complicated to achieve data security [16].\n\
    A voting-based hybrid ensemble classiﬁcation method was introduced for predicting\
    \ the\navailability of parking lots, wherein 96% of the accuracy and 89% of the\
    \ availability rate\nwas achieved [17]. An optimal network coding backpressure\
    \ routing (NCBPR) method was\ndeveloped for a large-scale IoT to divert the ﬂow\
    \ of data packets from highly congested\nnodes to low ones, thereby balancing\
    \ the load and optimizing the battery power [18]. The\nnodes in the network were\
    \ formed as clusters and the CHs were selected based on the\nbattery power. Moreover,\
    \ an efﬁcient data aggregation model was involved to improve the\nnetwork throughput,\
    \ wherein the redundant data packets were eliminated. An efﬁcient\nload balancing\
    \ optimization algorithm for the employment of energy effectual routing as\nwell\
    \ as a load balancing protocol were used to enhance the network lifetime [19,20].\
    \ The\nauthors in [21] explored the cluster-based backpressure routing algorithm\
    \ for IoTs, which\ndiscusses the energy and congestion issues in IoT environment.\
    \ A brief discussion is also\npresented related to the sustainable development\
    \ through the Internet of Things in [22,23].\nA novel framework was proposed to\
    \ handle environmental monitoring using wireless\nsensors connected with the internet,\
    \ wherein two distinctive SNs were involved. Moreover,\nclients observed the information\
    \ using the web application on the internet from anywhere.\nWhen the information\
    \ of the SN surpassed the speciﬁed range, a notiﬁcation was sent to the\nEnergies\
    \ 2022, 15, 4777\n4 of 16\nclients insisting on the environmental setup being\
    \ altered accordingly [24–26]. Energy is a\ncritical issue in WSNs and the IoT,\
    \ speciﬁcally when deployed in smart city applications\nand this was discussed\
    \ brieﬂy in [27–30].\nResearch Objectives\n1.\nTo establish secure routing for\

    \ transmitting data. Every process is\ndescribed in detail below.\nDetection of\
    \ neighbors and construction of topology: It is considered that every node\nholds\
    \ an ID{IDx}, certiﬁcate {CERTx}, public key {Kbs} and unique shared key {Kxbs}.\
    \ To\nidentify the neighbors, node broadcasts and receives NBR DET packet containing\
    \ its ID as\nwell as its CERT as in Equation (1).\nx → ∗ : NBR_DET|IDx|CERTx\n\
    (1)\nEnergies 2022, 15, 4777\n5 of 16\nThe node receiving the NBR_DET packet initially\
    \ authenticates the ID of the node by\nverifying CERTx. When authenticated, the\
    \ ID is added to the neighbor list by the receiver,\nor else the packet is dropped\
    \ such that the unauthenticated node does not participate in\nthis process of\
    \ detecting neighbors. Once broadcasting is complete, neighbor information\nis\
    \ forwarded to BS as in Equations (2) and (3).\nx → BS : NBR_INFO|IDx|CERTx|E(kxbs,\
    \ NBRx)|\n(2)\nMAC(kxbs, NBR_INFO|IDx|CERTx|E(kxbs, NBRx))\n(3)\nAn intermediate\
    \ node that is receiving the NBR_INFO packet performs few functions\nsuch as:\n\
    1.\nThe authentication of the SN is veriﬁed by its certiﬁcate.\n2.\nWhen the ID\
    \ of the node is authorized, the packet is again broadcasted by the receiver\n\
    node.\n3.\nWhen the receiver receives a similar packet having a similar ID again,\
    \ the packet is\nsimply dropped.\nHence, a table is maintained by every node termed\
    \ as a receiver packet table. Thus,\nthe network trafﬁc is reduced and node energy\
    \ is saved to some extent. Once the NBR\nINFO packet is reached at BS, BS veriﬁes\
    \ MAC for authenticity and integrity; then neighbor\ninformation is authenticated\
    \ using Kxbs between SN and BS. MAC, obtained from the data\nand by encrypting\
    \ Kxbs, is used such that the intruder cannot either alter or spoof neighbor\n\
    information.\n3.2. Distribution of Pairwise Key\nOnce the information about the\
    \ neighbor is obtained from the network nodes, BS\nanalyzes the exact network\
    \ topology and generates the neighbor matrix. Then the DFS\nalgorithm is applied\
    \ by which multiple paths are identiﬁed from BS to each source node.\nBeforehand,\
    \ for each neighbor pair, BS generates the secret key, a random number, termed\n\
    as pairwise key with the help of the hash function given by Equations (4)–(6).\n\
    kxy = h\n\0secret, IDx, IDy\n\x01\n(4)\nBS unicasts this key to the corresponding\
    \ node as\nBS → x : PAIR_KEY|seqno|IDbs|CERTbs|IDx\n\f\fIDy\n\f\fE(kxbs, kxy\n\

    \f\f\fE\n\x10\nKybs, Kxy\n\x11\n))\n(6)\nThe packet holds its type, sequence number,\
    \ the ID of BS, neighbor and destination,\ncertiﬁcate of BS, pairwise key and\
    \ MAC of entire data. Every intermediate node that\nreceives the packet performs\
    \ the following operations:\n(1)\nThe certiﬁcate of BS is veriﬁed with the public\
    \ key.\n(2)\nThe sequence number as well as the node pair is checked in the receiver\
    \ packet table.\nWhen no such value is found, sequence number, type of the packet\
    \ and node pair\nalong with packet rebroadcasting is stored or else dropped.\n\
    (3)\nWhen the ID of the destination is identical to its ID, the pairwise key is\
    \ encrypted,\nMAC is veriﬁed and the encrypted packet of neighbor with nonce as\
    \ well as its ID\nencrypted using a pairwise key is sent, which is given by Equation\

    \ decryption of PATH takes place and the data \nare verified by the MAC; then\
    \ acknowledgement (ACK) is sent to BS via the same path. \nFigure 2. Clustered\
    \ architecture. \nFigure 2. Clustered architecture.\nEvery node that receives\
    \ the packet performs the following: (1) ID of the next hop is\nchecked, if identical\
    \ to its own, routing path (PATH) is decrypted and next hop from PATH\nis identiﬁed\
    \ or else packet is dropped. (2) The sequence number is checked in the receiver\n\

    \ 2022, 15, 4777\n7 of 16\nreceiving the CH INT packet, decryption of PATH takes\
    \ place and the data are veriﬁed by\nthe MAC; then acknowledgement (ACK) is sent\
    \ to BS via the same path.\nWhen ACK is not received by BS within certain time\
    \ from CH, the path is recomputed\nand the CH INT packet is sent again. A few\
    \ criteria are involved in determining the routing\npath including the path having\
    \ residual energy and power consumed. A path is selected\nwith more residual energy\
    \ and small hops count. To form a cluster, a CH ADV packet is\nsent by CHs to\
    \ publicize their will.\nID and CERT are present in CH and the ADV packet, such\
    \ that the receiving node\nensures authentication. Nodes receiving several CH\
    \ and ADV select CH based on two\nfactors: (1) checking if the pairwise key is\
    \ present in the ID advertised and (2) signal strength\nof advertisement forwarded.\
    \ Once CH is selected, the will of the nodes is forwarded by CH\nJOIN packet with\
    \ ID as well as MAC with pairwise key and a nonce. Once entire CH JOIN\nis received,\
    \ information of the cluster members is sent to the BS by CH, and the TDMA\nschedule\
    \ is created based on the total nodes in the cluster and unicast to every member.\n\
    The packet has the following format by Equations (10)–(12).\nCH → ∗ : CH_ADV|IDch|CERTch\n\

    The data transmission phase comprises three subphases;\n(1)\nThe data sensed with\
    \ encrypted and authenticated format transmitted by the member\nnode to CH and\
    \ when not linked to any route, can sleep so that energy is saved.\n(2)\nThe received\
    \ data are aggregated and compressed by CH to generate a new signal,\nwhich is\
    \ then transmitted to BS through the route speciﬁed. (It is considered that node\n\
    j is subsequent hop in routing table.)\n(3)\nBase station uses an exclusively\
    \ shared key for decryption and authentication of the\ndata received.\nThese subphases\
    \ are observed with the form as given in Equations (13) and (14).\nx → CH : DATA|IDx|E(Kxch,\
    \ dx)\n(13)\nMAC(Kxch, DATA|IDx|E(Kxch, dx))\n(14)\nOnce the data are received,\
    \ they are aggregated by CH and then forwarded to BS by\nEquation (15).\nCH →\
    \ BS : AGGR_DATA|IDch|IDj\n\f\f\fE\n\x10\nKjch, seqno\n\x11\f\f\fE(Kchbs, dch)\n\
    \f\f\fMAC(Kchbs,AGGR_DATA|seqno|E(Kchbs, dch)\n(15)\nAGGR_DATA speciﬁes the type\
    \ of the packet, IDch and IDj denote the previous and\nnext hop in the path, respectively;\
    \ the packet reply is veriﬁed with the encrypted sequence\nnumber when AGGR_DATA\
    \ packet is received by any node with identical sequence\nnumber, then packet\
    \ is dropped. Dch represents encrypted data for BS and MAC, which\nsupports maintenance\
    \ of the packet integrity and authentication. The following operations\nare performed\
    \ by the node receiving this packet: (1) ID of the next hop is checked; when\n\
    similar to its ID, the sequence number is decrypted. (2) The packet sequence number\
    \ is\nveriﬁed in the receiver packet table, if not found, packet type and the\
    \ sequence number is\nentered or else left out. (3) The entry of the subsequent\
    \ hop is modiﬁed with the ID of the\nsubsequent hop nodes and that of the preceding\
    \ hops with its ID. (4) The sequence number\nis encrypted using the pairwise key\
    \ of subsequent hop as well as then forwarded again.\nIn this manner, data reach\
    \ the BS through the route speciﬁed and BS uses an exclusively\nshared key (Kchbs),\
    \ which evaluates the data efﬁciency.\nEnergies 2022, 15, 4777\n8 of 16\n3.5.\
    \ Incorporation of H-TEEN\nIn H-TEEN, after selecting the CHs, CHs forwards the\
    \ following parameters:\n1.\nAttributes (A): This physical set of parameters helps\
    \ the user to collect the data.\n2.\nThresholds: This is composed of hard and\
    \ soft thresholds denoted by HT and ST,\nrespectively. HT is the particular value\
    \ that triggers the node to broadcast the data.\nST is a little alteration in\
    \ the signiﬁcance that triggers the node to rebroadcast the\ninformation.\n3.\n\
    Schedule: It is scheduled by TDMA that allows the slot to each node.\n4.\nTimeCount\
    \ (TC): This is the utmost duration of the pair consecutive reports forwarded\n\
    by a node. This is the numerous length of the schedule that accounts for the practical\n\
    component. In a WSN, closer nodes form a cluster that senses analogous data and\n\
    forwards them concurrently, which leads to collisions. TDMA schedule is introduced\n\
    so that every cluster member is assigned a slot for transmission.\n3.6. U-DSP\n\
    In a storage system, businesses store data in the data server located remotely,\
    \ and\nhence data authenticity is assured. When, occasionally, unauthorized users\
    \ delete or modify\ndata, the server is compromised and/or randomly leads to Byzantine\
    \ failures. As this is the\ninitial process for recovering the storage errors\
    \ quickly, cloud storage systems introduce\na ﬂexible as well as effective distributed\
    \ approach with explicit dynamic data support\nfor distribution of ﬁles in a cloud\
    \ server. The homomorphic token is computed with the\nhelp of a universal hash\
    \ function and is integrated with veriﬁcation of erasure-coded data.\nMoreover,\
    \ servers that misbehave are also identiﬁed. At last, ﬁle retrieving and error\n\
    recovering procedures based on erasure-correcting code are deﬁned.\n4. Performance\
    \ Analysis and Discussion\nThe efﬁciency of the secure routing protocol with energy\
    \ optimization and data storage\nwas evaluated with several simulation experiments\
    \ with randomly varying topology. NS-\n2 version 2.34 was the simulation tool\
    \ used and considered a multi-hop network with\n1000 m × 1000 m size located in\
    \ a randomized grid with SNs from 50 to 200. The sink node\nwas at the centre\
    \ of the network. Trafﬁc was CBR of 600 packets/sec and packet size was\n316 bytes.\
    \ The heterogeneity of the network was proven in the simulation by testing the\n\
    environment with different sets of nodes. The simulation parameters are shown\
    \ in Table 1.\nTable 1. Simulation parameters.\nParameters\nValue\nNetwork size\n\

    \ delay, an important metric, is considered to deal with real-time trafﬁc and\n\
    transmit data packets within the stipulated time. End-to-end delay is the difference\
    \ in the\ntime taken between the source node transmitting data and the sink receiving\
    \ it. It is the\nsum of the delay in transmission, propagation, queuing and processing\
    \ at every hop.\nTable 2 shows a comparison of the end–end delay. Figure 3 depicts\
    \ the end–end delay\nfor the proposed MLRP-HTEEN-UDSP protocol and Figure 4 compares\
    \ it with the other\nEnergies 2022, 15, 4777\n9 of 16\nprotocols such as LEACH,\
    \ CCBRP and PEGASIS. It suggests that the proposed protocol\nperforms better than\
    \ other protocols. The delay is at a minimum since the hierarchical\narchitecture\
    \ of the CHs for all the times chooses the route that has fewer hops with good\n\

    applications incorporating IoT are helping to increase the productivity of the
    crops; however, these applications are also introduced some disadvantages, therefore
    the current researchers are working to defeat these challenges in the futuristic
    applications by deploying new technologies with no or minimum negative impact
    on the environment and human health; Green IoT (G-IoT) and green nanotechnology
    are appear. These technologies are not easy to be used by farmers. So, this research
    work aims to build a realtime, cost-effective Precision Agriculture Monitoring
    System with less power consumption, less Green House Gas (GHG) emissions, and
    a user-friendly interface to help the farmers monitor the parameter variations
    of their farm (weather, water, soil, pest detection, intrusion detection, fire
    detection) periodically from anywhere and at any time using their smart-phones.
    The proposed system will act as a decision support system helps farmers to take
    the appropriate actions based on the farm parameter''s variation; by sending an
    alert email to the farmer when it is required. Published in: 2018 2nd International

    I. Introduction Precision Agriculture (PA) as explained in [1], it is one of the
    promising technologies to increase the crop productivity without affecting the
    product quality. There are many technologies applied in the agricultural domain
    using (Internet of Things) IoT to increase the productivity and overcome the existing
    challenges, which are; first, increase food production is required to satisfy
    growing population and prevent from the starvation era. Second, the lack in the
    numbers of labours as a result of civilization adding an extra challenge into
    agriculture sector, so to overcome these challenges require deploying agriculture
    systems required neither time and efforts nor human intervention. Third, as a
    result of climate change and degradation of water resources lead deploying some
    technologies to help to manage the farm water resources precisely. Fourth, reduce
    chemicals impact on human health is also required, by spraying these chemicals
    regarding of (pesticide or fertilizer) based on the crop needs instead of scheduled
    traditional methods. Fifth, energy availability and price is still a great challenge
    in the agriculture sector. Sixth, have a green environment with minimum GHG emissions
    is also a great challenge. In addition to all that all the existing precision
    agriculture monitoring systems are very costly in compared to farmer''s profits,
    also the need for real-time systems to keep on monitoring all the farm parameters
    variations is also required; along with a user-friendly interface enable the farmers
    to monitor their farms from anywhere and at any time with less power consumption.
    Uses of IoT technologies in agriculture envision improving productivity and sustainability.

    \ attention all over the globe. It has \ntransformed the agricultural field and\
    \ allowed farmers to compete with \nmassive issues they face. The aim of this\
    \ paper is to review the various \nchallenges and opportunities associated with\
    \ the applications of internet of \nthings in agricultural sector. This research\
    \ makes use of secondary sources \nthat have been gathered from existing academic\
    \ literature such as journals, \nbooks, articles, magazines, internet, newsletter,\
    \ company publications and \nwhitepapers. Applications reviewed in this research\
    \ are about crop sensing, \nmapping and monitoring the croplands pattern, managing\
    \ and controlling \nwith the help of radio frequency identification and real-time\
    \ monitoring of \nenvironment. Some of the challenges that were taken into consideration\
    \ for \nreviewing the applications of internet of things are software complexity,\
    \ \nsecurity, lack of supporting infrastructure and technical skill requirement.\
    \ \nComplexity in the software has to be rectified in order to support the IoT\
    \ \nnetwork. Therefore software must be developed as user-friendly for \nimproving\
    \ the farming, production and quality of the crop. Security is the \nmajor threat\
    \ in the IoT applications. Security has to be enhanced through \nproper access\
    \ control, data confidentiality and user authentication. \nTechnical skill is\
    \ required for farming to enhance the organizational \nabilities and to perform\
    \ the farming functions, solving problems and more. \nProper supporting infrastructure\
    \ can be developed with proper internet \navailability and connectivity. Some\
    \ of the opportunities were taken for \nreviewing the applications of internet\
    \ of things are low power wireless \nsensor, better connectivity, operational\
    \ efficiency and remote management. \n \nKeywords: Internet of Things, Software\

    \ as the basis of life for the \nhuman beings as it is considered as the main\
    \ source of \nfood grains and other raw materials. It plays a potential \nrole\
    \ in the economic \ngrowth of \nthe country. \nEnhancement of agricultural sector\

    \ factors influencing the productivity in \neach stage like cultivation, harvesting\
    \ and storage of post \nharvesting. The Internet of Things (IoT) is referred as\
    \ the \nnetwork of network typically associated with large \nnumber of sensors\
    \ connected through information and \ncommunication infrastructure to provide\
    \ the value added \nservices. It is one of the hot concepts emerged since the\
    \ \n1960s. It is referred as one of the hard-core technologies \nof the IT industry\
    \ of the new generation (Cai, 2012). The \nultimate aim of this IoT is to create\
    \ the better world for \nhuman species, where the objects around us understand\
    \ \nthe comments and hence act accordingly without any \ninstructions explicitly.\
    \ IoT is highly on the rise and it has \nbeen observed to control areas and bring\
    \ them \ncompletely under its influence. It has the tendency to \nobtain powerful\
    \ computing tools via cloud computing. It \nis pointed as an intelligent technology\
    \ which includes \nsensing, identification and intelligence. It can be used in\
    \ \npattern identification areas like sensing, collection and \nprocessing of\
    \ the information and communication. \nControlling of all these operations has\
    \ attained through \nremote smart devices connected to the internet. Further \n\
    the whole operations will be performed by means of \ninterfacing sensors, Zigbee\
    \ modules or Wi-Fi, camera \nwith micro-controller and raspberry pi (Devi and\
    \ \nMeenakumari, 2013). In this effect, microcontrollers, \nmicroprocessors, actuators\
    \ and sensors are some of the \nphysical devices which directly communicate with\
    \ the \ninternet. They work by using the gateway of IoT. This \nentire infrastructure\
    \ is called as the infrastructure of IoT. \nThe smart farm embedded with the systems\
    \ of IoT is \ncalled as the connected farm as it could support the \ndevices in\
    \ a wide range from diverse device \nmanufacturers of agricultural field. In this\
    \ sense, the \nconnected farms can provide more services of intelligent \nagriculture\
    \ based on shared knowledge of the expert. At \nlast, the IoT impact has given\
    \ good results and it plays \nan efficient role to extend into latest technologies\
    \ like \ngrid and cloud computing in many different sectors. \nFinally, this paper\
    \ also aims to investigate some \nchallenges and opportunities associated with\
    \ the IoT \napplication in the agricultural field.  \nReview of Literature \n\
    Usage of IoT in Various Agricultural Applications \nSensing of crop (Water, Moisture\
    \ and Temperature) \nA study done by Bangera et al. (2016) examined the \nIoT\
    \ based smart village. In smart farming, the content of \nmoisture in the soil\
    \ acts as the major factor to determine \nthe growth of the plant. Soil moisture\
    \ sensor is resistive \nsensor used to change the soil resistance between two\
    \ \nprobes that depends on content of water. Apart from \nthese, temperature and\
    \ humidity is one of the main \nenvironmental parameters worked with the climatic\
    \ \nchange, topography, types of soil and vegetation   \n(Dursun and Ozden, 2011).\
    \ Crop planting time, tile ring \ngrowth and winter safety are some of the processes\
    \ \nwhich are closely related to the soil temperature. In this \nway, the temperature\
    \ sensor has given the specific idea \nabout the coolness and heat content variation\
    \ in the soil. \nSensor based automated irrigation system with IoT has \nbeen\
    \ analyzed by Kansara et al. (2015). The temperature \nand humidity sensor senses\
    \ the changes in temperature \nand humidity and it also has the tendency to give\
    \ an \ninterrupt signal to the micro-controller devices. A low \ncost internet\
    \ of things network for contamination \ndetection in drinking water systems using\
    \ raspberry pi \nwas analyzed by Anam and Devender (2015). The \ntemperature of\
    \ water can be measured by the water \nsensor when dipped into the water.  \n\
    Kumar and Ravi (2016) studied about the automation \nof irrigation system based\
    \ on Wi-Fi technology and IoT. \nThe soil moisture sensor and temperature sensor\
    \ has \nplayed an important role in developing an automation to \nsupply water\
    \ for irrigation system and home gardening \nin fields of farming. Cloud IoT based\
    \ system of \ngreenhouse monitoring has been investigated by   \nKeerthi and Kodandaramaiah\
    \ (2015). Temperature, light, \nrelative humidity and soil moisture sensor have\
    \ \nintegrated to demonstrate the greenhouse monitoring \nsystem. Crop sensing\
    \ has been done accurately by using \nthe IoT and this has further created the\
    \ positive impact \non the agricultural field.  \nManaging and Controlling (Use\
    \ of RFID) \nA study done by Kang et al. (2015) examined an \neffect of IoT based\
    \ electronic sow feeder on productivity \nof swine farms. Radio Frequency Identification\
    \ (RFID) \nis commercial technology in the system of IoT. This \ntechnology has\
    \ been applied in the raising industry by \nthe IoT based production management\
    \ systems. RFID \ntag has played a potential role to control the amount of \n\
    feed. Tongke (2013) focused the study on the smart \nagriculture based on cloud\
    \ computing and IoT. \nAccording to him, the RFID and IoT, has helped to build\
    \ \nplant factory and it also plays an important role to realize \nthe automatic\
    \ control production in the agricultural \nsector. In fact, the RFID, sensor and\
    \ GPS worked \ntogether for information sensing in the process of \nproduction.\
    \ Sarkar and Chanagala (2016) surveyed IoT \nbased digital agricultural monitoring\
    \ system with their \nimpact on optimal resource utilization. RFID has helped\
    \ \nto build the device for the process of sensing the \nparameter in the agriculture\
    \ and it further sends signal to \nthe internet in an effective manner. In this\
    \ effect, the IoT \nbased RFID has improved the quality of agriculture \nproducts\
    \ by managing and controlling the products. \nBarakat (2016) has pointed that\
    \ the RFID’s and GPS \npoints can be embedded in agricultural field and it can\
    \ \nbenefit from the collected information they provide. \nSarfraz Fayaz Khan\
    \ and Mohammed Yusoof Ismail / Journal of Computer Science 2018, 14 (2): 132.143\
    \ \nDOI: 10.3844/jcssp.2018.132.143 \n \n134 \nInformation collected through the\
    \ devices can then be \nproceeding and the final results are used to perform an\
    \ \nautomated task via Wi-Fi connection (Buckely, 2006).  \nAccording to Zhao\
    \ and Wang (2014), RFID tracing \napplication with IoT has helped to manage and\
    \ control \nthe information in the supply chain value of \nagricultural products.\
    \ IoT can make use of RFID \ntechnology for scanning EPC tags on the items and\
    \ \nhence it has achieved the automatic identification and \ninformation sharing\
    \ successfully. The authors also \npointed out the RFID as the most critical technologies\
    \ \nin the IoT. It can be also predicted that the RFID has \nused to achieve intelligent\
    \ identification, monitoring, \nremote control and positioning in the agricultural\
    \ \nproduction (Qin et al., 2015). \nMapping and Monitoring the Croplands Pattern\
    \ \nA study done by Jaishetty and Patil (2016) examined \nIoT sensor network based\
    \ approach for agricultural field \nmonitoring and control. The solution of remote\
    \ \nmonitoring has played a significant role to monitor in \nreal time through\
    \ some of the remote devices such as \ntablets and mobiles. Ultrasonic waves have\
    \ been used \nwith IoT to monitor the soil quality and levels of ground \nwater\
    \ in agricultural field. The optimal sensor methods \nof placement have used to\
    \ monitor the environmental \nchange and wireless sensor networks have played\
    \ a \npotential role to monitor the patterns of cropland Table 1. \nParameswaran\
    \ and Sivaprasath (2016) studied about \narduino based smart drip irrigation system\
    \ using IoT. \nCrop has continuously monitored by using PC host. LCD \nhas also\
    \ played an efficient role to improve the method \nof cultivation and hence it\
    \ leads to better productivity \neffectively. System hardware associated with\
    \ the IoT \ncreated the significant impact on monitoring and \ncontrolling system\
    \ of smart agriculture. Channe et al. \n(2015) pointed that the real time monitoring\
    \ properties of \nIoT has helped to maintain the health of soil intact by \napplying\
    \ the required fertilizer amount. In fact, the \nanalysis of soil moisture by\
    \ sensor also has helped to \napply water in necessary areas. Zigbee and GPS \n\
    technologies also pave way to monitor the cropland \npattern in an effective manner.\
    \  \nAutomatic intelligent equipment and remote control \nproduction devices played\
    \ an efficient role for farmers to \nmonitor the farmland information without\
    \ leaving home. \nIn this effect, the agricultural IoT has related to some of\
    \ \nthe field such as weather monitoring, automatic \ngreenhouse controlling,\
    \ intelligent control system of \nplanting \nindustry, \ntraceability \nof \n\
    food \nsafety, \nenvironmental monitoring etc (Wu et al., 2015). \nAccording to\
    \ Paventhan (2013) IoT also has aimed to \nextend internet to distributed devices\
    \ in large numbers \nby defining the communication protocols. \nReal-Time Monitoring\
    \ of Environment (Using \nWireless Technology) \nA study done by Pavana and Padma\
    \ (2016) designed \na low cost system for real time monitoring of water \nquality\
    \ parameters in IoT environment. The IoT has the \ncapability to revolutionize\
    \ the water industry as more of \nthe innovative technology has connected to web.\
    \ The \nwater quality monitoring through online mode has \nacquired \nmuch \n\
    attention \nworldwide. \nConverging \ntechnologies for smart environments and\
    \ integrated \necosystems of IoT has been investigated by Vermesan and \nFriess\
    \ (2013). Monitoring of soil moisture, vibrations, \ndensity of earth to detect\
    \ the dangerous spatterns in land \nconditions have been achieved by the wireless\
    \ \ntechnology of IoT. In addition to these, the monitoring \nof variations of\
    \ water level in dams, rivers and \nreservoirs are also analyzed using the IoT\
    \ in an \neffective manner. Wine quality enhancing, green \nhouses, half courses,\
    \ meteorological station network \nand compost are also achieved in agricultural\
    \ sector by \nusing the wireless technology of IoT. \nAdvantech (2015) pointed\
    \ out that the real-time \nremote monitoring and management has been achieved\
    \ \nby the IoT wireless technologies successfully. In real-\ntime monitoring system,\
    \ the information can be remotely \nchecked through mobile phones, computers etc.\
    \ In this \nsense, the distributed systems, nutrients etc. across the \ngreenhouses\
    \ can also be managed in an efficient way   \n(Li and Guo, 2014; Abdul Aziz et\
    \ al., 2009). It also has \nprovided different workers with different authority\
    \ level. \nGetting real-time information through e-mail alerts and \nSMS are also\
    \ achieved in the smart agriculture system. \nGreenhouse \nwireless \nnetwork\
    \ \nmonitoring \nand \nmanagement using internet of things has been analyzed \n\
    by Jagdale and Mali (2016). The authors pointed that the \nwireless network technology\
    \ has monitored the light \nintensity that was incident in the field greenhouse\
    \ area. \nIn fact, monitoring and controlling of green field \nenvironment has\
    \ played an important role in production \nof crops and this has further maximized\
    \ the activity of \nphotosynthesis. Better infield monitoring of cropland has\
    \ \nachieved only by means of IoT wireless technology \nwhen compared to other\
    \ technologies (Doknic, 2014).  \nChallenges of Applying IoT in Agriculture \n\
    Software Complexity \nA study done by Soumyalatha and Hegde (2015) \nexamined\
    \ the application, issues, challenges and \narchitecture of IoT. Scalability,\
    \ self-configuration, \ninteroperability, complexity of software, storage volume,\
    \ \ninterpretation of data, security and personal privacy, fault \ntolerance and\
    \ energy-optimized solutions are some of the \nchallenges associated with the\
    \ IoT (Perera et al., 2015; \nBorgohain et al., 2015; Whitmore et al., 2015; \n\
    Bandyopadhyay and Sen, 2011). In fact, the software \nSarfraz Fayaz Khan and Mohammed\
    \ Yusoof Ismail / Journal of Computer Science 2018, 14 (2): 132.143 \nDOI: 10.3844/jcssp.2018.132.143\
    \ \n \n135 \nsystems in smart objects work with minimal resources \nand the software\
    \ infrastructure is needed support the \nnetwork and hence it also required the\
    \ server to support \nnetworks smart objects on the back ground.  \nA study done\
    \ by Pande and Padwalkar (2014) \nexamined the internet of things. The software\
    \ complexity \nand data interpretation are referred as the main challenges \n\
    of IoT in agricultural sector. The systems of software in \nsmart objects should\
    \ have to function with minimal \nresources as in the conventional embedded systems\
    \ \n(Ashton, 2009). In fact, the fault tolerance also has \npossessed the great\
    \ challenges and it requires redundancy \non several levels depending on various\
    \ conditions. \nBalamurugan et al. (2016) studied about applying \nIoT to improve\
    \ food and farming technology. User-\nfriendly software has paved the way for\
    \ the big data for \nsmall farms with the creative usage. In particular, the \n\
    software, actuators, sensors and technologies of energy \nharvesting are directly\
    \ contributing to the IoT \ndevelopment  (Guang et al., 2011). Software complexity,\
    \ \nspatiality and dynamics are some of the factors which are \naffecting quality\
    \ and production of crop in higher level \n(Venkataramana and Padmavathamma, 2012).\
    \  \nA study done by Madakkam et al. (2015) examined \nthe Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT). Hardware, middleware and \npresentation of software of IoT have the capability\
    \ to \ncreate \nthe \nnegative \nimpact \non \nthe \nagriculture \n(Jayavardhana\
    \ et al., 2013). Patil et al (2012) has \noverviewed the internet of things and\
    \ cloud computing \nfor agriculture. Complexity, spatio-temporal variability \n\
    and diversity are some of the characteristics features \nrelated to agriculture\
    \ need to be considered in \ndeveloping the right kinds of services. In addition\
    \ to \nthese, the actuators, sensors, software and location \ntechnology (GPS),\
    \ wireless communication and RFID \ntechnology (Shao and Li, 2009) are some of\
    \ the \ntechnologies which have contributed to the development \nof IoT in many\
    \ sectors. In this sense, understanding and \noperating the software seems to\
    \ be more complex in \nsome of the sectors like agriculture.  \nSecurity \nThe\
    \ study done by Mehta and Patel (2016) examined \nIoT based smart agriculture\
    \ research opportunities and \nchallenges. The IoT has connected with more devices\
    \ \ntogether and it also has provided the decentralized \nenergy points for malware\
    \ creates a negative impact \non the smart agriculture. It also has become the\
    \ main \nchallenge of IoT in agricultural sector. Less expensive \ndevices which\
    \ are in compromised locales are more \nsubject to the process of tampering (Fangquan,\
    \    \n2012; Sun et al., 2008) In addition to these, more \nsoftware layers, APIs,\
    \ middleware integration and \nmachine to machine communication are some of the\
    \ \nterms which are creating the complexity and new risks \nof security in higher\
    \ level. \nWang and Liu (2014) focused some of the application \nof IoT in agricultural\
    \ means of production supply \nmanagement. The internet of things application\
    \ in the \nstage of agricultural product sale has reflected in the \nform of security,\
    \ statistics and validity monitoring.  \nWEF (2015) analyzed industrial internet\
    \ of things by \nunleashing the potential of connected products and \nservices.\
    \ Security and privacy of IoT has created both \nthe positive and negative impact\
    \ in agricultural sectors. \nThe securities are raising an increased vulnerability\
    \ to \nattacks, espionage and data breaches driven by increased \nsharing of data\
    \ and connectivity (Osborn and Charlie, \n2014; Elfrink, 2014; Shankland and Stephen,\
    \ 2014). \nFinally, it can be predicted that the security and \ninteroperability\
    \ are referred as the two biggest hurdles of \nimplementing the IoT in agricultural\
    \ sectors.  \nKumar and Patel (2014) have surveyed the internet of \nthings with\
    \ security and privacy issues. Front-end \nsensors and equipment, network and\
    \ back-end of IT \nsystems are referred as the security threats of IoT. Safety\
    \ \nmanagement of code resources and operator replacement \nare some of the terms\
    \ associated with the back end of IT \nsystems (Liu and Yang, 2011; Jiang and\
    \ ShiWei, 2010; \nZhou et al., 2012). In fact, the security of IoT system has\
    \ \nsome major standards such as access control, \nauthentication of user, data\
    \ confidentiality and \nanytime availability (Abomhara and Koein, 2014; \nZhao\
    \ and Ge, 2013). These are further associated with \nthe back-end of IT systems\
    \ also creates an impact on \nthe development of agriculture.  \nFernandes et\
    \ al. (2016) have evaluated the internet of \nthings with security challenges\
    \ and future scope. They \npointed that the confidentiality, integrity, availability\
    \ and \nauthentication are some of the factors which are linked \nwith the security\
    \ issues. Additionally, the common \nworms jumping, organized crime and cyber\
    \ terrorism are \nsome of the security threats associated with the IoT \nfurther\
    \ create an impact on agricultural field (Farooq et al,., \n2015; Roman et al.,\
    \ 2011a; 2013b). \nTechnical Skill Requirement \nChikaire et al. (2015) pointed\
    \ that the capacity \nbuilding is one of the essential key to survival of \nagricultural\
    \ extension. The technical skill requirement is \nneeded for farming and the lack\
    \ of operating skills \ncreates an impact on the overall performance in field\
    \ of \nagriculture. The capacity building has focused on \nenhancing the abilities\
    \ of an organization to perform the \nfunctions of farming, solve problems and\

    \ \n \n136 \nstages of skills demand for the operator in the farming. \nIn this\
    \ effect, the ability of education tends to be the \nprimary problem for the farmers\
    \ from adopting new \npractices and effective technologies.  \nMenon et al. (2012)\
    \ have assessed the technical \nmanpower requirements in agriculture sector in\
    \ India. The \ntechnical manpower has expected to be requiring in a high \nnumber.\
    \ This will continue to be insufficient during the \nhorizon with time. The authors\
    \ pointed that the technical \nmanpower in sector of agriculture has played a\
    \ vital role \nin achieving the self-sufficiency in the grain production of \n\
    food (FCCI, 2007; Kao and Lee, 1998). In fact, there is a \nshortage of technical\
    \ manpower in agriculture field at \nvarious levels especially related to IoT.\
    \  \nPodder and Kuntagod (2016) studied some smart \nservices with designing internet\
    \ of things solutions to \naspire the smart nations. Most of the growing \neconomies\
    \ lack the resources of finance, manpower, \nskills related to technology and\
    \ access to the latest \ntechnology \nnecessary \nfor \nstrengthening \nthe \n\
    infrastructure. Interoperability, ensuring security of \ndata and sourcing the\
    \ required skills are some of the \nfundamental issues rising in emerging economies.\
    \ \nRose et al. (2015) have overviewed the internet of \nthings with several challenges.\
    \ The scope of IoT \nchallenges has not been unique to industrialized \ncountries.\
    \ Infrastructure readiness, incentives of market \nand investments, technical\
    \ skill requirements and the \nresources of policy have been identified as some\
    \ of the \nchallenges linked with the IoT in many sectors. \nInteroperability\
    \ has created the significant influence on the \nIoT with the economic impact\
    \ beyond technical aspects. \nLack of Supporting Infrastructure \nBidua and Patel\
    \ (2015) studied about internet of \nthings and cloud computing for agriculture\
    \ in India. \nSmart grid, traffic systems etc. have been identified to \nhave\
    \ supporting infrastructure which is far from being \nready for internet of things\
    \ in agricultural field (Yan-e, \n2011; Channe et al., 2015; Bo and Wang, 2011).\
    \ In fact, \nthe IoT has offered the tremendous potential to innovate \nin the\
    \ field of agriculture. In India, internet availability \nand connectivity seems\
    \ to be the major challenge and \nadoption of IoT becomes difficult for farmers\
    \ due to lack \nof supporting infrastructure.  \nSharma et al. (2016) analyzed\
    \ the technical \nassessment of IoT for Indian agricultural sector. Smart \nmetering\
    \ and smart grid infrastructure of IoT are lacking \nin the agricultural field.\
    \ Furthermore, the infrastructure \nmodernization cost and maintenance seems to\
    \ be a great \nchallenge of IoT in farming (Lee et al., 2013).  \nPundir et al.\
    \ (2016) analyzed the future directions \nand challenges of internet of things.\
    \ Lack of information \ninfrastructure facilities of IoT in farming has created\
    \ the \nnegative impact in productivity. The rural farming areas \nare not advanced\
    \ in terms of overall infrastructures. In \nfact, the unanticipated resource of\
    \ development has \ndiminished the abilities of the individual to add new \nfunctionality\
    \ related to core.  \nRoshan and Ray (2016) analyzed some of the \nchallenges\
    \ and risk to implement IoT in smart homes \nwith respect to an Indian perspective.\
    \ Smart power grid, \nsmart drainage or system of sanitation, supply of smart\
    \ \nwater, are some of the supporting infrastructure which \nare far away from\
    \ being ready to use in Indian \nagricultural area (Jin et al., 2014; Datta et\
    \ al., 2014). In \nparticular, the centralized infrastructure of IoT to support\
    \ \nanalytics have required in the agriculture field to attain \nthe specific\
    \ tasks (Gubbi et al., 2013).  \nOpportunities Associated with the Application\
    \ of \nIoT in Agriculture \nLow Power Wireless Sensor \nA study done by Chen (2012)\
    \ examined the \nchallenges and opportunities of IoT. Low power wireless \nsensor\
    \ is one of the main opportunities associated with \nthe application of IoT. Low\
    \ power sensors are needed \nreplacement of battery over their lifetimes. The\
    \ design of \nlow power transmitter should be considered for low \npower sensor\
    \ node and hence it attains the greatest \nimpact in the agricultural sector.\
    \ Low power wireless \nless sensor networking of IoT has achieved high success\
    \ \nover other technologies (IEC, 2014; Sen, 2009). It has \nthe capability to\
    \ cover an area of only a small dozen \nmeters. In this sense, the low energy\
    \ consumption of \nsensors is act as the main key to support the independent \n\
    battery powered devices in a longer flow. This has \nhelped to reduce the cost\
    \ of maintenance simultaneously. \nAnusha and Shobha (2015) analyzed the design\
    \ and \nimplementation of wireless sensor network for precision \nagriculture.\
    \ Recently, low cost and low power wireless \nsensor technology seems to be well\
    \ suited to replace \nwires as the medium of communication in most of the \napplications\
    \ of agriculture (Gutierrez et al., 2014).   \nMore and Nighot (2016) has reviewed\
    \ the wireless \nsensor network for agriculture. The advancement of \nwireless\
    \ sensor networks and reduction of size has \nincreased the WSN application chances\
    \ in agricultural \nfield. The wireless sensor has consumed low cost and it \n\
    has the ability to withstand the resistance towards the \ncurrent successively\
    \ (Barath et al., 2016). The ability of \ndata gathering and remote sensing are\
    \ closely related to \nthe low power wireless sensor.  \nBetter Connectivity \n\
    Machine to machine is referred as the autonomous \nnetworking to connect large\
    \ populations with efficient \nusage of energy. Better connectivity of IoT devices\
    \ may \nSarfraz Fayaz Khan and Mohammed Yusoof Ismail / Journal of Computer Science\

    \ efficient outcome in agricultural sector. \nInternet connectivity seems to be\
    \ vital to the solutions of \nIoT. Wireless links have played an effective role\
    \ in \ncovering huge distances at reasonable costs (Miazi et al., \n2016). Better\
    \ internet connectivity has enabled to push \nthe data onto the cloud and it also\
    \ helps to visualize the \ndata using the mobile and other electronic devices.\
    \ IoT \nseems to be more popular and easy to use in almost \nevery field (Raigonda\
    \ et al., 2016; Domingo, 2012; \nZhang et al., 2013). GSMA (2015) has analyzed\
    \ the \nagricultural Machine to Machine (M2M) as a platform of \nexpansion. Better\
    \ connectivity of IoT has enhanced the \nsustainability of business in higher\
    \ level. Cellular M2M, \nshort-range (Wi-Fi, Zigbee and Ethernet), satellite and\
    \ \nfixed networks and power line are some types of M2M \nconnectivity significantly\
    \ linked with IoT. In some areas, \nthe lacks of distribution of channel and limited\
    \ \nconnectivity access have created an impact on the \nagriculture areas (OECD,\
    \ 2016). M2M connectivity \nservices have helped the farmers to improve the \n\
    efficiency of farming operations. High bandwidth fiber \nconnectivity also has\
    \ enabled the communication with \nlow latency which keeps the farming area more\
    \ active. \nOperational Efficiency \nOperational efficiency has achieved the application\
    \ \nof IoT and it can be called out by the enhanced usage of \nenergy with effective\
    \ infrastructure of IoT. The IoT \npower has tackled the issues of environment\
    \ which lies \nin its ability to gather data through analytics. It also \ndrives\
    \ the smarter decisions about operational efficiency, \nstrategy of business and\
    \ the allocation of resources. The \nIoT has the opportunity to capture data which\
    \ optimizes \noperational efficiency and reducing the impact of \nenvironment\
    \ in a higher level (Wind, 2016). According \nto Schimek (2016), the IoT implementation\
    \ has \nimproved the analytics, efficiency and predictive \nmaintenance. Sensor\
    \ and wireless technologies of IoT \nhas played a potential role to increase the\
    \ efficiency and \nhence it provides an accessible vehicle network to its \ncustomers.\
    \ Oracle (2015) pointed out that the agribusiness \nperformance has been improved\
    \ by using big data and \nIoT. The solutions of IoT and big data have improved\
    \ \nforecasting and efficiency of an operation. It also leads to \nimproved decision\
    \ making. Timely scheduling equipment \nmaintenance and minimizing the usage of\
    \ energy has \nenabled the greater operational efficiency in agricultural \nsectors.\
    \ In this effect, the operational efficiency of \ninformation and technology has\
    \ often difficult to prove. \nRomeo (2016) analyzed the current status and trends\
    \ \nenabling smart farming through the IoT. Low cost and \nhigh volume of sensor\
    \ paves a way to attain the high \noperation efficiency in the farming area. \
    \ \nRemote Management \nA study done by Yin (2017) examined the \nimplementation\
    \ of IoTs in agriculture industry in China. \nAlarm management, remote control\
    \ and expert system \nare closely connected with each other as it has helped to\
    \ \nattain the high production in the agriculture area. Real-\ntime surveillance\
    \ is referred as the main functions in the \nagricultural site. Remote monitoring\
    \ of the crop growth \nprocess is also achieved by the IoT wireless \ntechnologies.\
    \ Users can control anytime by the terminal \nof internet which can be introduced\
    \ to the field devices \nof agriculture with all kinds of remote control switch.\
    \ \nShi et al. (2016) pointed out that the IoT system has \nprovided the new way\
    \ to access the information of \nagriculture for the farm. In this sense, the\
    \ IoT has \nprovided a change for the remote monitoring the disease \nof plants\
    \ and insect pests in the agriculture field area.  \n \nTable 1. Challenges, Opportunities\

    \ as an opportunity in \nimplementing the applications of internet of things \n\
    with specific reference to agricultural sector \n \nFrom the above literature,\
    \ it is evident that software \ncomplexity, lack of supporting infrastructure,\
    \ security \nand technical skill requirement are some of challenges \nassociated\
    \ with internet of things applications with \nrespect to agricultural sector.\
    \ It was noticed that \ncomplexity of software, dynamics and spatiality affects\
    \ \nthe crop’s quality and production. However, it was also \nnoted that lack\
    \ of operating skills has created an impact \non the overall farming performance\
    \ thus technical skill is \nmainly needed for farming. Lack of supporting \ninfrastructure\
    \ has created the negative impact in farming \nproductivity. \nRemote \nmanagement,\
    \ \noperational \nefficiency, better connectivity and low power wireless \nsensor\
    \ are some of the opportunities associated with \ninternet of things applications\
    \ with special reference to \nagricultural sector. In terms of opportunities,\
    \ low energy \nconsumption of sensors support the independent battery \npowered\
    \ devices for longer time. Machine to machine \nconnectivity services assist the\
    \ farmers to enhance the \nefficiency of operating in terms of farming. Maintaining\
    \ \nthe timely scheduling equipment allowed greater \noperational efficiency especially\
    \ in agricultural sectors. \nRemote management has permitted the user to monitor\
    \ \nthe irrigation condition in the field. Applications of \ninternet of things\
    \ can be used in many areas related to \nagricultural field namely sensing of\
    \ crop, real-time \nmonitoring of environment, managing and controlling \n(use\
    \ of radio frequency identification) and mapping and \nmonitoring the croplands\
    \ pattern. Temperature sensor \nand soil moisture sensor plays a key role in introducing\
    \ \nan automation system in farming field that is sensing of \ncrop. Internet\
    \ of things based radio frequency identification \nhas enhanced the quality of\
    \ agricultural product by \nmanaging and controlling. Global positioning system\
    \ and \nZigbee technologies in the internet of things have paved the \nway for\
    \ monitoring the pattern of cropland. At the same \ntime, it was also clear from\
    \ the above literature that, with \nthe help of internet of things technologies,\
    \ real-time remote \nmonitoring and management can be achieved.  \nDiscussion\
    \ and Conclusion \nInternet of things in agricultural field has become one \n\
    of the most remarkable developing fields in machine-to-\nmachine space. In the\
    \ present scenario, conservationists, \nranchers and farmers require a method\
    \ to efficiently \nadopt and conserve resources. Better and efficient way to \n\
    perform \nthis \nby \nutilizing \nmachine \nto \nmachine \ncommunication and actionable\
    \ data which makes the \nongoing data collection very affordable and simple. \n\
    Internet of things had transformed the agricultural sector \nand enabled farmers\
    \ to compete with massive issues they \nface. This research collects data from\
    \ the second handed \nor secondary sources. Secondary data were gathered \nfrom\
    \ different existing academic literature from reputed \njournals, books, newsletters,\
    \ magazines, whitepapers and \nso on. The main purpose of this paper is to review\
    \ the \nvarious challenges and opportunities associated with the \napplications\
    \ of internet of things in agricultural sector. \nSome of the challenges were\
    \ taken into consideration for \nreviewing the applications of internet of things\
    \ are \nsoftware complexity, security, lack of supporting \ninfrastructure and\
    \ technical skill requirement. It is clear \nfrom the literature that, complexity\
    \ in the software has to \nbe rectified in order to support the IoT network. \n\
    Therefore software must be developed as user-friendly \nfor improving the farming,\
    \ production and quality of the \ncrop. Security is the major threat in the IoT\
    \ applications. \nSecurity has to be enhanced through proper access \ncontrol,\
    \ data confidentiality and user authentication. \nTechnical skill is required\
    \ for farming to enhance the \norganizational abilities and to perform the farming\
    \ \nfunctions, solving problems and more. Better supporting \ninfrastructure can\
    \ be developed with proper internet \navailability and connectivity. Some of the\
    \ opportunities \nwere taken for reviewing the applications of internet of \n\
    things \nare \nlow \npower \nwireless \nsensor, \nbetter \nconnectivity, \noperational\
    \ \nefficiency \nand \nremote \nmanagement. Low cost and low power wireless sensor\
    \ \ntechnology are appropriate one to replace wires as \ncommunication medium\
    \ in the agricultural sector. Better \ninternet connectivity services assisted\
    \ the farmers in \nenhancing the farming operations efficiency. Internet of \n\

    \ is central to the economy of the world, with sixty percent of the \npopulation\
    \ depending on it for survival. Farmers are adopting smart farming technics to\
    \ \nmake agricultural practices more efficient. Smart farming takes advantage\
    \ of Internet of \nThings (IoT) technologies for performing tasks such as moisture\
    \ sensing, weeding, \nkeeping vigilance, spraying, bird and animal scaring, smart\
    \ irrigation controls, the use of \nreal time field data for intelligent decision\
    \ making and smart warehouse management \nwhich includes theft detection and temperature\
    \ and humidity maintenance of the \nwarehouse. Smart devices such as watches,\
    \ computers or cellphones connected to the \ninternet can then be used to control\
    \ the smart farming system. Smart farming being at \nnascent stage, its privacy\
    \ and security needs to be researched and explored as its future \npartially dependent\
    \ on the resolution of the privacy and security issues associated. This \npaper\
    \ comprehensively reviews various security and privacy issues and challenges \n\
    associated with IoT deployments in smart farming. Following a structured approach,\
    \ a \nframework for smart farming security and privacy was developed in an attempt\
    \ to address \nchallenges experienced/expected. This framework can also be used\
    \ for future directions \nfor any IoT related privacy and security initiatives.\
    \ \n1 Introduction \nThe growth in global population is leading to increased food\
    \ requirement needs of the modern-day \ncivilization requires increased food production.\
    \ Unfortunately, traditional farming methods with low \nyields for fruit and crops\
    \ are still predominantly used. But wherever automation has been implemented,\
    \ \nyield improvement has been evident (Gondchawar & Kawitkar, 2016). This highlights\
    \ the need to \nintroduce modern technologies to the agriculture sector to achieve\
    \ better yields.  \n \nThe new technologies and solutions being implemented in\
    \ agriculture increase efficiency in methods \nfor gathering and processing data\
    \ while enhancing net productivity (Ray, 2017). On the other hand, the \nKalpa\
    \ Publications in Computing\nVolume 12, 2019, Pages 95–104\nProceedings of 4th\
    \ International Conference on the\nInternet, Cyber Security and Information Systems\
    \ 2019\nK. Njenga (ed.), ICICIS 2019 (Kalpa Publications in Computing, vol. 12),\
    \ pp. 95–104\nwater crisis and alarming climate change require new and improved\
    \ methods of farming. Automation \nand intelligent decision making technologies\
    \ are therefore also important in accomplishing this mission \n(Fan TongKe, 2013).\
    \ Amongst technologies that are making it possible are; IoT, remote sensing, \n\
    ubiquitous computing, cloud computing, Radio Frequency Identifier and wireless\
    \ and sensor networks \n(Ray, 2017).  \n \nHowever, this study only focuses on\
    \ IoT, which is “a collection of many interconnected objects, \nservices, humans,\
    \ and devices that can communicate, share data, and information to achieve a common\
    \ \ngoal in different areas and applications. IoT is fast tracked by the rapid\
    \ growth in nanotechnology which \nenables production of small and cheap sensors.\
    \ This has brought about great potential towards faster \ndecision making and\
    \ automation in the agriculture industry in the following smart farming techniques:\
    \ \n(automated irrigation scheduling (Reche, Sendra, Díaz, & Lloret, 2015), precision\
    \ agriculture (Barcelo-\nOrdinas, Chanet, Hou, & García-Vidal, 2013; Ray, 2017),\
    \ optimization of plant growth (Hwang, Shin, \n& Yoe, 2010), green-house monitoring\
    \ (Mao, Miao, He, Li, & Liu, 2012), farm land monitoring (Corke \net al., 2010),\
    \ and farming production process management (Dong, Vuran, & Irmak, 2013)). This\
    \ rapid \ndevelopment in the Internet of Things in agriculture has propelled the\
    \ phenomenon that is called Smart \nFarming (Sundmaeker, Verdouw, Wolfert, & Freire,\
    \ 2016).  \n \nAlthough smart farming promotes the increase of yields, reduces\
    \ operating costs, and increases \nagility, its unique architecture raises numerous\
    \ security and privacy concerns. The huge amounts of \ndata that are shared in\
    \ IoT-enabled environments can be harnessed by malicious applications that can\
    \ \nuse to the disadvantage of some aspect of smart farming. Thus, understanding\
    \ and minimization of these \nsecurity and privacy risks by the development of\
    \ efficient and effective cybersecurity solutions is \ncritical for the success\
    \ of smart farming initiatives. Since both IoT and smart farming are relatively\
    \ new \nphenomena, their knowledge concerning security and privacy implications\
    \ is not widespread as \nexpected. Some authors have labeled these technologies\
    \ as “technology hypes that may fail to \nmaterialize.” (Fenn & LeHong, 2011).\
    \  \n \nThis research paper provides insight into smart farming and goes on to\
    \ identify the most important \nsecurity and privacy challenges they expose farmers\
    \ to. Lastly, we introduce a framework to help \nmitigate the smart farming security\
    \ and privacy challenges exposed. We acknowledge both technical \nand human security\
    \ and privacy challenges, however, the paper mainly focuses on the human aspect\
    \ of \nprivacy and security in smart farming because it seems as though not enough\
    \ research has been done. \nIn line with that, this paper seeks to answer the\
    \ following research questions:  \n1. What are the privacy and security issues\
    \ in IoT?  \n2. How do humans affect the privacy and security of IoT initiatives?\
    \  \n3. How can the impact of human weakness in the privacy and security of IoT\
    \ be reduced?  \n \nThe remainder of this paper is structured as follows; firstly,\
    \ it will highlight the contribution of this \nstudy, it will then discuss a review\
    \ of related literature after which it will provide the brief methodology \nfor\
    \ the research followed by a description of the proposed framework. The last section\
    \ will conclude \nand provide recommendations for further research and actions.\
    \ \n2  Related Literature \nAgriculture has seen three revolutions already, from\
    \ plants animal domestication a few thousand \nyears ago, systematic crop rotational\
    \ methods of a few hundred years ago and the “green revolution” \nwhich came with\
    \ the use of fertilizers, pesticides, genetic modifications and introduction of\
    \ systematic \nbreeding a few decades ago (Walter, Finger, Huber, & Buchmann,\
    \ 2017). We suggest that agriculture \nIoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the\
    \ Human Firewall in Smart Farming\nGundu and Maronga\n96\nis undergoing a fourth\
    \ revolution triggered by the increasing population that in turn is increasing\
    \ the \ndemand of food. Ray (2017) warns that the growth rate in food production\
    \ is not at par with the food \nrequired by the growing population. The Food and\
    \ Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \n(How to Feed the World in 2050)\
    \ recently published a report showing a prediction of global food \nrequirements\
    \ reaching 3 billion tons by 2050 from 1.5 billion in 2015. This calls for an\
    \ exploration of \nnew and modern technologies that can be used in agricultural\
    \ applications to achieve the target. As a \nresult, this is accelerating the\
    \ incorporation of sensors and IoT into agriculture, giving birth to smart \n\
    farming. \n \n2.1 Internet of Things (IoT) \n \nIoT is rapidly gaining momentum\
    \ in modern wireless telecommunications. The basic IoT concept \nlays around connection\
    \ and use of a variety of technologies (such as Radio-Frequency IDentification\
    \ \n(RFID) tags, sensors, computers, actuators, smart watches, mobile phones,\
    \ etc.). These technologies \ninteract with each other through unique addressing\
    \ schemes to achieve common goals (Pecorella, \nPierucci, & Nizzi, 2018). The\
    \ integration of IoT with humans can take advantage of collaboration and \ntechnical\
    \ analytics to achieve real-time decision making (Angelini, Mugellini, Abou Khaled,\
    \ & \nCouture, 2018; Ray, 2017). IERC (‘IERC-European Research Cluster on the\
    \ Internet of Things’, 2014) \nwhich seems to have the most cited definition,\
    \ defines IoT as follows: “A dynamic global network \ninfrastructure with self-configuring\
    \ capabilities based on standard and interoperable communication \nprotocols where\
    \ physical and virtual ‘things’ have identities, physical attributes, and virtual\
    \ \npersonalities and use intelligent interfaces, and are seamlessly integrated\
    \ into the information network, \noften communicate data associate with users\
    \ and their environments.” \n \n2.2 Smart Farming \nSmart farming is the use of\
    \ modern technology to improve the amount and quality of agricultural \nproducts.\
    \ Walter et al (Walter et al., 2017) advocates that, apart from the use of intelligent\
    \ sensors, \nsmart farming  also encompasses the use of robotic vehicles (e.g.\
    \ for application of fertilizer, weeding \nand fruit harvesting). They also elaborate\
    \ that the drones with autonomous flight control, bundled with \npowerful hyperspectral\
    \ and high-resolution cameras are also being used to calculate biomass \ndevelopment\
    \ and fertilization status of crops, is another form of sophisticated smart farming.\
    \ Another \ncommon form of smart farming innovation is virtual fencing technologies\
    \ which assist cattle herd \nmanagement by the use of Global Positioning System\
    \ Sensors (GPS) sensors attached to the livestock \nand monitored on computer\
    \ or smart phones. This management can also be achieved by the use of real \n\
    time remote-sensing signals. Combined, these technical improvements discussed\
    \ constitute a technical \nrevolution that can generate positive changes in agricultural\
    \ practices. These trends for farming are not \nonly applicable to developed countries\
    \ but also to developing countries, especially where deployments \nin ICT (e.g.,\
    \ use of smart phones, access to the Internet) are being adopted at a rapid pace.\
    \ The rapid \ndecrease in price for IoT based sensors for smart farming solutions\
    \ is also opening a possibility for \nsmart faming initiatives in emerging economies\
    \ as the farmers can also afford them (Ray, 2017). \n \nSmart farming reduces\
    \ the ecological footprint of farming due to efficient site-specific application\
    \ \nof inputs, such as fertilizers and pesticides. This makes agriculture more\
    \ profitable for the farmer as \nresource inputs would have been decreased. It\
    \ also assists with mitigation of leaching problems as well \nas greenhouse gas\
    \ emissions (Mahmoud, Yousuf, Aloul, & Zualkernan, 2015) and increase reliability\
    \ \nof spatially explicit data which will ultimately reduce farming risks. Optimal,\
    \ yield projections, site-\nIoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the Human Firewall\
    \ in Smart Farming\nGundu and Maronga\n97\nspecific weather forecasts, and diseases\
    \ and disasters probability maps based on weather and climate \ndata will help\
    \ plan and optimize cultivation of crops (Walter et al., 2017). With the IoT,\
    \ it is possible \nto create a sensor network allowing for almost continuous monitoring\
    \ of the farm reducing the time \nneeded for surveillance.  \n \nIn principle,\
    \ optimization of farming activities due to smart farming should lead to better\
    \ product \nquality (e.g., watering an orchard when the moisture level has not\
    \ dropped too much, produces better \njuicier fruits or better-quality milk produced\
    \ by individualized feeding of cattle). Better quality products \nare not only\
    \ healthier but also generate more profits as they sell at higher prices.  \n\
    \ \nBecause there are numerous players in smart farming, this introduces a challenge\
    \ of accountability \nfor malpractice or mistakes that may lead to environmental\
    \ and/or economic consequences. For \nexample, it is difficult to establish the\
    \ source of the problem if a consumer gets sick from eating \nharvested fruits\
    \ that still had traces of fertilizer or pesticides because it was applied too\
    \ late. Should the \nblame be on the farmer, or the software vendor, or the network\
    \ provider, or the manufacturer of the \nsensor? As at the time of publishing\
    \ of this paper, there is no straightforward answer to address such an \nincident.\
    \  Another challenge is that smart farming can lead to serious disease outbreaks\
    \ if not monitored \nproperly. Efficient use of fungicide in a smart farming environment\
    \ may delay disease outbreaks which \nthen increases the risk of creating fungicide\
    \ resistant traits which is even more devastating. \n \nContrary to the view that\
    \ the automation in smart farming eliminates the need of human labor \ntherefore\
    \ increases the unemployment rate, this whole process will always require humans\
    \ however at \na much higher intelligent level. Machines will only conduct the\
    \ monotonous and tiring operational \nactivities (Walter et al., 2017). \n \n\
    2.3 Security and Privacy \nWe will discuss the security and privacy challenges\
    \ of smart farming as well as those of IoT in \ngeneral as they also filter into\
    \ smart farming. These challenges can be broadly divided into technological \n\
    challenges and human challenges (Gundu, Flowerday, & Renaud, 2019; Mahmoud et\
    \ al., 2015). The \ntechnological challenges in smart farming mainly arise due\
    \ to its heterogeneous and ubiquitous nature. \nIf magnified closer, these challenges\
    \ have to do with wireless technologies, scalability and energy.  The \nhuman\
    \ challenges are related to the awareness and knowledge of principles and functionalities\
    \ that \nshould be followed to achieve and maintain a secure smart farming environment.\
    \ These human \nchallenges evolve around the ability to ensure security by authentication,\
    \ confidentiality, end-to-end \nsecurity, integrity etc. (Mahmoud et al., 2015).\
    \ \n \nIn the recent years, there has been a lot of effort attempting to address\
    \ security and privacy issues \nsmart paradigms (Alaba, Othman, Hashem, & Alotaibi,\
    \ 2017; Cho, Cho, Shin, Park, & Lee, 2012; Corke \net al., 2010; Fagade & Tryfonas,\
    \ 2016; Granjal, Monteiro, & Sa Silva, 2015; Hwang et al., 2010; \nOleshchuk,\
    \ 2009; Pecorella et al., 2018; Zhou, Cao, Dong, & Vasilakos, 2017). Collectively,\
    \ the authors \ntouch on trust management, authentication, intrusion detection\
    \ systems, privacy issues, data security, \nnetwork security, access control systems,\
    \ fault tolerance and digital forensics. An IoT project requires \nsome form of\
    \ trust, privacy, and security model implementation. This model should address\
    \ data \nintegrity, confidentiality and end-to-end communication issues. To probe\
    \ into data misuse, the model \nshould also address access policies and encrypting\
    \ mechanisms to be used.  \n \nThe classic security goals of Confidentiality,\
    \ Integrity and Availability (CIA) of any cyber system \nalso apply to IoT. However,\
    \ IoT based smart systems have other restrictions and limitations. These are \n\
    IoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the Human Firewall in Smart Farming\nGundu\
    \ and Maronga\n98\nprimarily due to computational power limitations of the devices\
    \ and the heterogonous and ubiquitous \nnature of IoT. To address that, we suggest\
    \ authentication, lightweight solutions, heterogeneity, policies \nand key management\
    \ systems to be added to the traditional CIA triad, which will be discussed below.\
    \ \n \nSecurity and privacy issues that may arise due to weaknesses of the human\
    \ in smart farming are \ninterception, node capture attack, dos attack, man-in-the-middle\
    \ attack and data theft. Technological \nissues include compatibility, wireless\
    \ signal strength, storage capacity, power consumption, and \ncomputation capability.\
    \ In general, when designing IoT applications it is important to take the following\
    \ \ninto account: how will different users interact with the devices, how much\
    \ data will be revealed and \nwho will be managing the applications. Therefore,\
    \ users should have tools that control data to be \ndisclosed, by whom and when\
    \ (Mahmoud et al., 2015). \n \n \n3 Contribution \nThis paper contributes to the\
    \ body of knowledge as follows.  \n \nAnalysis of the advantages of smart farming.\
    \  \n \nAnalysis of privacy and security issues related to IoT and smart farming\
    \ deployments with \nrespect to the human aspect. \n \nDevelopment of a framework\
    \ that can be followed to reduce the effect of the human \nweakness in terms of\
    \ privacy and security of smart farming. \n \n \n4 Methodology \nIn order to address\
    \ the research questions outlined in the Introduction, we reviewed literature\
    \ from \nJanuary 2009 to January 2019. This review period was chosen due to the\
    \ fact that IoT and smart farming \nare recent phenomena, hence as a practical\
    \ consideration we did not expect to access older studies \nwithin articles prior\
    \ to 2009. Apart from inclusion by period of publication, we also used two other\
    \ \ninclusion criteria for the literature search. These encompassed whether it\
    \ was a full article publication \nand its relevance to the research questions.\
    \ Exclusion of previous literature was also based on two \ndifferent criteria:\
    \ either the articles were not published in English or the articles focused solely\
    \ on \ntechnological designs. The literature survey was undertaken using the following\
    \ systematic approach: \na search on two major bibliographical databases was carried\
    \ out, on Science Direct and Scopus. This \nsearch was conducted using a combinations\
    \ of keywords which were separated into two groups, the \nfirst addressing Smart\
    \ Farming (i.e. precision farming, agri-food, sensor-driven innovation, \ntechnologies\
    \ in farming, internet of things, IoT) and the second group focusing on cybersecurity\
    \ (i.e. \nhuman centered security, awareness campaigns, training). The choice\
    \ of the two databases was based \non their wide coverage of relevant literature\
    \ and their capability to suggest related articles or citations. \nA total of\
    \ 359 peer-reviewed articles were retrieved from the two databases. These were\
    \ filtered by \nscanning for relevance. This involved identifying sections of\
    \ the text that address the research questions. \nFollowed by screening, where,\
    \ the search function was used to locate the paragraphs containing the key \n\
    words. We then analyzed the text to identify links to our research questions.\
    \  \n \nIoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the Human Firewall in Smart Farming\n\
    Gundu and Maronga\n99\nWe used Zotero reference management software to manage\
    \ the articles and eventually, 21 articles \nwere considered as very relevant\
    \ and 93 as relatively relevant. The remainder of the articles were \nirrelevant\
    \ and excluded from this analysis because they did not speak to smart farming\
    \ or cybersecurity. \nThe number of relevant peer reviewed literature was very\
    \ low; however, this was not surprising as IoT \nand Smart Farming are relatively\
    \ new concepts. Their applications are rapidly evolvingpeer reviewed \narticles\
    \ are lagging behind as usually the case with most technologies. This led to the\
    \ decision to also \ninclude grey literature into the review. This comprised using\
    \ Google Scholar and LexisNexis search \nengine. Thus, we managed to obtain magazines,\
    \ reports, blogs, and other web-items. This resulted in \n213 magazine articles,\
    \ 4 reports, 119 blogs and 19 items on twitter. Each of the 119 blogs had their\
    \ title \nand sentences scanned for relevance and duplicated blogs were removed.\
    \ As a result, 21 blogs were \nselected for additional evaluation through further\
    \ reading. Eventually, 7 blogs were considered as \ncontaining relevant information\
    \ for our study. Each of the 213 magazine articles was similarly evaluated \n\
    and 9 articles were considered as containing relevant information. The analysis\
    \ and synthesis of the \nliterature led to the development of the framework presented\
    \ in the next section. \n5 Proposed Framework \nThis paper argues that for the\
    \ technological security measures put in place to be effective, the user \nof\
    \ the system should be aware of the security risks associated and how to behave\
    \ securely. Technology \nshould complement and supplement the human element not\
    \ the other way around. The \ntechnological/physical firewall can be deemed useless\
    \ if the ‘human firewall’ is not turned on, as it is \nthe human who controls\
    \ the technology. In summary, we suggest that the human element is at the Centre\
    \ \nof any security and privacy initiative. \n \nThe proposed privacy and security\
    \ framework for smart farming in figure 1 has constructs guided \nby how literature\
    \ seems to address the human and technological aspects of privacy and security\
    \ attempts \nto highlight that enhanced security and privacy can only be achieved\
    \ by considering both technological \nand human aspects. \n \n5.1 Technology Aspect\
    \ \nAppropriate technological infrastructure is essential in making smart farming\
    \ systems function. \nAlthough literature does not have much information on infrastructures\
    \ being used, the few mentioned \nare supplied by large venture capital vendors\
    \ such as AGCO, John Deere, KAA IoT, ThingsWorkx, \nBlue River Technologies, Thingsboard.io\
    \ and Monsanto. However, the demands of the fourth industrial \nEnhanced Smart\
    \ Farming Security & Privacy \nFigure 1: A privacy and security framework for\
    \ smart farming \nAwareness & Training \nHuman \nAspect \nTechnology \nAspect\
    \ \nVendor \nIoT Security and Privacy: Turning on the Human Firewall in Smart\
    \ Farming\nGundu and Maronga\n100\nrevolution particularly smart farming are now\
    \ attracting organizations that were previously not active \nin traditional agriculture.\
    \ For example, a Japanese technology firm (Fujitsu) now hosts cloud-based \nfarming\
    \ systems. In North America, there are several initiatives for example the facilitation\
    \ of data \nacquisition via an open-source hardware platform and software libraries\
    \ known as the ISOBlue project \nand the Open Ag Toolkit (OpenATK) (Ray, 2017)\
    \ In Europe, FIWARE was developed. It is for cloud \nhosting, data management,\
    \ provision of IoT services, cybersecurity and analysis of Big Data (Wolfert,\
    \ \nGe, Verdouw, & Bogaardt, 2017).  \n \nSince, devices (sensors, computers,\
    \ cellphones, routers, etc.) in smart farming are manufactured and \ndistributed\
    \ by different vendors, trust should be established between them and the farmers.\
    \ For this to \nhappen the devices they supply should be technically secure. This\
    \ leaves the aspect of the technological \naspect of privacy and security primarily\
    \ on the vendors. However, these vendors should train the \nfarmers on the use\
    \ of their devices and advise them on possible risks and how to use the devices\
    \ \nsecurely.  \n \n5.2 Human Aspect \nThe challenge for smart farming is to ensure\
    \ awareness of security and privacy to the farmers and \ntheir employees and also\
    \ to ensure that they are trained on how to implement safety in their daily \n\
    routines in a consistent manner. Technical security controls may only assist in\
    \ reducing the threat of \nmalicious people such as hackers, competitors or disgruntled\
    \ employees. However, the defense against \nnaïvetés and lacking understanding\
    \ necessary to safeguard the smart farming system may be achieved \nby vigorous\
    \ security awareness and training programs.  \n \nThe trusted human (employee)\
    \ typically has unregulated access to some part or else parts of the \nsmart farming\
    \ system. This makes it possible for a naive farmer or employee to breach security\
    \ and \nprivacy measures put in place from within the system’s perimeter defenses\
    \ without triggering the \nperimeter defenses alarm (Gundu, 2012). On the other\
    \ hand, outside attackers attempt to gain access \ninside a network either by\
    \ attacking the system directly or by exploiting the weaknesses of an employee.\
    \ \nThis research study focused on insiders only. The reason for this segregation\
    \ was that the insider threat \nis usually taken for granted and smart farming\
    \ often has limited measures in place to minimize the risk \nto which insiders\
    \ expose the farm as compared to that posed by outsiders with firewalls and physical\
    \ \nsecurity being used to guard against intruders. The hour it takes an employee\
    \ to view an awareness \npresentation may be the difference between a secure organization\
    \ and a multimillion Dollar breach of \nsecurity. \n \nWhat should be given great\
    \ attention is that most farmers and farm workers are not Information and \nCommunication\
    \ Technology (ICT) specialists. Hence, they might not be aware of the risks involved\
    \ in \na smart farming environment, and how those risks can be reduced. Farmers\
    \ and farm employees with \n‘little-to-no’ prior cyber security training or experience\
    \ may suddenly be responsible for hundreds of \nnetworked IoT devices generating\
    \ large amounts of data some which might be sensitive as part of their \njob The\
    \ weaknesses humans present can never be completely avoided, however, a properly\
    \ structured \ncybersecurity awareness campaign can lower the risk to tolerable\
    \ levels (Flowerday & Von Solms, \n2005; Gundu, 2017).   \n \nIn a smart farming\
    \ environment, everyone requires cybersecurity awareness training just as in the\
    \ \narmed forces, every soldier, regardless of their role, have to complete elementary\
    \ training. Hence, \ncybersecurity awareness among human users (farmers and farm\

    \ such as using default passwords that come with devices making it easy for hackers\
    \ to conduct \nattacks against the whole network (Mahmoud et al., 2015). \n6 Conclusions\
    \ and recommendations \nWith the global population prediction of 9.6 billion by\
    \ 2050, extreme weather condition challenges, \nclimate change, and resulting\
    \ environmental impact, there is great need to embrace IoT. Effective \nfarming\
    \ practices can address these issues. Currently, literature reports smart farming\
    \ applications are \ntaking place primarily in Europe and North America. However,\
    \ it reveals keen interest from Africa and \nAsia whose economies are primarily\
    \ based on agriculture.   \n \nEnsuring security and privacy is one of the biggest\
    \ challenges of smart farming governance to date. \nThis challenge might end up\
    \ inhibiting developments because farmers may be reluctant to share data as \n\
    they begin to fear that their data may end up in their competitors’ hands. Hence,\
    \ strong access controls \nmight be a starting point for vendors to build trust\
    \ with farmers. \n \nIn this paper a literature review on security and privacy\
    \ in smart farming was conducted. It was \nconcluded that IoT in smart farming\
    \ applications is still premature based on the limited peer reviewed \npublications.\
    \ However, it is evident that humans remain the weak link in smart farming security\
    \ and \nprivacy initiatives. Some farmers are lulled into a false sense of security\
    \ by IoT device vendors who \nvogue that technology is the total barrier to breaches.\
    \  Hence, this paper develops a framework to try to \nreduce the risk the human\
    \ exposes smart farming initiatives to. As we believe, it will be the most \n\
    effective way of switching on the human firewall that is making the human part\
    \ of the solution and not \nthe problem. The next step for this study is conduct\
    \ action research to test the effectiveness of the \nproposed model. Our main\
    \ recommendation for future research lies within analyzing whether Africa is \n\
    ready for smart farming in terms of security and privacy. \n \nReferences \n \n\

    \ Sep 05, 2022 \n \n \nIt is well known that the resources in agriculture are\
    \ considered the most \nimportant factors for success. Therefore, numerous researchers\
    \ are involved \nin the field of managing these resources, particularly water\
    \ and consumed \npower. Moreover, the security side of these resources is considered,\
    \ \nparticularly the cyber-attacks. In this project, an optimized resource \n\
    management method is proposed for allocating the available resources in \na smart\
    \ on-demand way. The proposed method is applied for dripped and \nsprinkler irrigation\
    \ systems for managing the available water and generated \npower. In addition,\
    \ an optimization method is utilized to obtain reliable \nsolutions for managing\
    \ the adopted resources. This method adopts a cyber \nsecurity algorithm for preventing\
    \ any possible attack. Wireless sensor \nnetwork (WSN) is used as a reading source,\
    \ in which the underlying area is \ncovered well, since using sensors in irrigation\
    \ systems is cost-effective that \nensures on-demand irrigation process to save\
    \ water and power resources. \nThis network is supported by the fault tolerance\

    \ \n \n \n1. \nINTRODUCTION \nCurrently, different techniques are used in irrigation\
    \ systems around the world as shown in Figure 1. \nMoreover, Table 1 illustrates\
    \ the benefits and limitations associated with these methods. Therefore, \ndeveloping\
    \ an optimal irrigation system is necessary to reduce cost, power, and water consumption\
    \ \ndepending on real physical information instead of predicted one [1]. Nowadays,\
    \ wireless sensor networks \n(WSN) have a significant role in many applications,\
    \ such as environmental monitoring, medical, agricultural, \nand others due to\
    \ their flexibility and ability of processing data in different environments with\
    \ easy \nprogramming [2]-[4]. The use of sensors in recent applications is not\
    \ limited to environmental sensing, \ncollecting data from the field, and sending\
    \ information to users depending on some situations [5], [6]. Power \nresources\
    \ in sensor nodes are batteries that have a limited lifetime and difficulty in\
    \ replacing or recharging \nthem. Thus, it is important to design an optimal power\
    \ consumption network to increase WSN life [7]-[10]. \nMoreover, irrigation in\
    \ agriculture consumes about 85% of the total consumed water in the world and\
    \ this \nwill increase rapidly with the increase in population, therefore it is\
    \ important to design an irrigation system \nwith optimized use of water resources\
    \ [11]-[13].  \nAt the other hand, security and cyber-security are important aspects\
    \ to be considered in developing \nsmart systems with WSN [14], [15], because\
    \ sensor nodes are used to collect specific and critical information \nto be sent\
    \ to an appropriate destination to take a decision. Therefore, the existence of\
    \ a malicious node in \n      \n  \n \n       ISSN: 1693-6930 \nTELKOMNIKA Telecommun\

    \ of irrigation system can lead to send a fault decision to the actuators resulting\
    \ in wasting water \nand harming crops [16]. Obviously, denial of service (DoS)\
    \ attacks are the most notable attacks in the field of \navailability that prohibit\
    \ clients from receiving the specific data with the right time [17]-[19]. In addition,\
    \ the \nuse of WSN for systems decision making requires the reliability, availability\
    \ and confidentiality which can be \nachieved using fault tolerance methods in\
    \ software engineering [20]. In this paper, an optimal, secured and \nreliable\
    \ smart irrigation system based on WSN is produced in the literature to manage\
    \ the resources in \nirrigation in optimal way. \n \n \n \n \nFigure 1. Agricultural\

    \ LITERATURE REVIEW \nIn order to cover the recent research work regarding the\
    \ subject of smart irrigation systems, a systematic \nliterature review protocol\
    \ is considered to produce this paper with different manuscripts. The preferred\
    \ reporting \nitems for systematic reviews (PRISMA) methodology is used in this\
    \ search , which is a framework developed \nto depict the flow of information\
    \ through the different phases of a systematic review [21]. Figure 2 explains\
    \ \nthe adopted resource and the PRISMA for this paper. This section can be classified\

    \ Smart irrigation system based on WSN \nAs mentioned earlier, depending on the\
    \ functionality of the reviewed papers, 30 articles proposed a smart \nirrigation\
    \ system based on WSN to monitor and control irrigation process. In [22], an internet\
    \ of things (IoT) \nbased smart agrotech system was proposed to improve farm production\
    \ using efficient monitoring and \nscheduling irrigation process. The collected\
    \ data from sensors (soil moisture, temperature, and humidity) \ncompared with\
    \ real data using comparative analysis and results showed an acceptable error\
    \ on the charge of \nlacking in coverage area. While in Liao et al. [23] developed\
    \ a smart drip irrigation system depending on \nreal-time soil moisture data in\
    \ a greenhouse tomato’s crop. A comparative study between the proposed system\
    \ \nand other irrigation systems was done with results approved that the giving\
    \ system is efficient to deal with food \nsecurity and water scarcity issues.\
    \ Abioye et al. [24] presented an efficient monitoring and data-driven \nmodelling\
    \ of the information influencing the irrigation of mustard leaf plant. At the\
    \ other hand, Torres et al. [25] \nsubmitted a multilevel data fusion architecture\
    \ to get an accurate sensor readings that lead to accurate decision \nmaking.\
    \ Three categories were involved in the proposed architecture: sensor data fusion,\
    \ event and decision \nmaking, and decision fusion based on multiple applications.\
    \ In [26], a smart agriculture system was developed \nwith an open source and\
    \ not expensive hardware components like built a WSN using Arduino and Raspberry\
    \ Pi \nto get a cost-effective system. The fuzzy logic control was used as a decision\
    \ method for the amount and \nduration of irrigation. An automated irrigation\
    \ system based on IoT was presented in [27]. This was done by \ndistributing different\
    \ sensors in the farm (soil moisture, temperature and humidity) and the reads\
    \ are entered \nto a machine learning algorithm. Sodhi and Saxena [1] proposed\
    \ a smart irrigation system based on \nmicrocontroller and used Bayesian analysis\
    \ hosted on IBM Waston platform to monitor the health of the crop, \nthe required\
    \ water to irrigation and every detected intrusion. The water pumps are activated\
    \ automatically when \nthe soil moisture level (measured by sensor nodes in WSN)\
    \ is less than a threshold value. Intelligent agent \nconcept was used in [28]\
    \ to design and implement a cyber-physical irrigation system. The physical data\
    \ \ncollected using WSN and a weather station while processing of these data is\
    \ done in a central station to \ndecide the irrigation status based on these data.\
    \ At last, a control signal is sent to the actuator system by the \nintelligent\
    \ agent to power on the solenoid valves for starting irrigation. Ali et al. [29]\
    \ and Tiglao et al. [30] \nconsidered the use of IoT and mesh WSN in designing\
    \ an irrigation system. Jaiswal and Ballal [31] proposed \nan automated drip irrigation\
    \ system using real-time fuzzy inference method and WSN implemented in \nLabVIEW.\
    \ In [32], a monitoring and control irrigation system was proposed based on multi\
    \ agent system. \nThe WSN gathered data from environment to evaluate the actual\
    \ need of water every five minutes and weather \nmap used to calculate the potential\
    \ evapotranspiration precisely. Karunanithy and Velusamy [33] presented an \n\
    automated drip irrigation with fertigation system based on WSN. The proposed system\
    \ utilizes soil moisture \ndata and evapotranspiration for prediction of required\

    \ \n136 \nThe irrigation system proposed in [34] used dynamic sensor data and\
    \ real time weather information and static data \nlike plant and soil type to\
    \ decide the irrigation process. artificial intelligent (AI) algorithms have been\
    \ used for \ntraining and testing data. Barkunan et al. [35] suggested an automated\
    \ irrigation system based on sensing rain fall \nin a farm. The information is\
    \ transmitted using global systems for mobile/general packet radio service GSM/GPRS\
    \ \ntechnology to the farmers at anytime and anywhere to check the status of the\
    \ farm. In [36], a developed real-time \nagriculture application was presented\
    \ using multi-layered architecture containing three technologies (internet of\
    \ \nthings, cloud computing and context awareness). In [37], a smart irrigation\
    \ system based on WSN and fuzzy \nlogic was suggested. A comparison was made between\
    \ a crop irrigated with traditional irrigation and with \nproposed system showed\
    \ that the proposed system used quantity of water equals to half the required\
    \ quantity \nusing traditional method. Nawandar and Satpute [38] proposed a smart\
    \ irrigation system with low-cost target \nusing IoT platform to collect data,\
    \ neural network to make decisions for scheduling irrigation depending on \nthe\
    \ collected data and the user viewed the data remotely using message queuing telemetry\
    \ transport (MQTT) \nand hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) protocols. This system\
    \ is intelligent, cost effective and portable. \nAt the other hand, the smart\
    \ drip irrigation system proposed in [39] used smartphone to capture soil \nimage.\
    \ Calculations were made on the image to know the level of wetness and send the\
    \ data to a microcontroller \nto take an irrigation decision depending on the\
    \ captured image in smartphone and sensors output. \nMuangprathub et al. [40]\
    \ proposed a control system to control environmental parameters that affect the\
    \ crop \nproduction. Three parts included in the control system: hardware component,\
    \ web application and mobile \napplication. In [41], a low cost smart irrigation\
    \ system based on IoT and weather was developed to control \nirrigation process\
    \ automatically depending on moisture level value. While in [42], agricultural\
    \ physical \nsystem (ACPS) with solar irrigation facility was proposed to manage\
    \ irrigation process remotely. \nPhotovoltaic energy was used as a power source\
    \ in the proposed system and client-server architecture used to \nensure communication\
    \ in two directions between the executional level in the field WSN and managerial\
    \ level \nin the cloud.  \nSelmani et al. [43] presented a solar photovoltaic\
    \ watering system (SPVWS) with multithreading \ndesign and virtual timers. Raspberry\
    \ pi was used due to its efficient performance with real time applications. \n\
    By multithreading programming used in the system, controlling the system and HTTP\
    \ server job working \nconcurrently to give remote control of the irrigation system\
    \ and online monitoring of data. The proposed \nsystem in [44] used IoT to automate\
    \ controlling and monitoring of irrigation process. Sensor devices \ncollected\
    \ environmental data from the field and regression algorithm used this data to\
    \ determine water \nrequirements in a day. Mohapatra and Lenka [45] proposed a\
    \ watering system with future prediction of soil \nmoisture content using neural\
    \ network. The expectation strategy utilized the collected data from sensors such\
    \ \nas soil and weather parameters. In [46], an irrigation management system based\
    \ on WSN was developed to \nautomate irrigation process. Sensors gathered data\
    \ from field and sent it to the controller for irrigation \ndecision and to the\
    \ server for monitoring purpose. Khelifa et al. [13] proposed an automated irrigation\
    \ system \nbased on WSN to gather data for irrigation process decision. A web\
    \ application in smartphones also used to \ngive notifications when the soil is\
    \ dry or the level of the water in the tank is low. The WSN connected with \n\
    the server using 4G-LTE technology due to its flexibility. In [47], a smart irrigation\
    \ system is proposed to \ncontrol and monitor irrigation process using WSN and\
    \ fuzzy logic as a decision tool. Sensor nodes collected \ndata from a field,\
    \ decision support system used this data to schedule irrigation using fuzzy logic\
    \ methods and \nactuators to execute commands. Abdullah et al. [48] presented\
    \ a simulation model to a smart irrigation \nsystem based on WSN. In the proposed\
    \ model, WSN used cluster topology to ensure a scalable network and \nincrease\
    \ sensors life time. The proposed system used fuzzy inference system to irrigation\
    \ control. Simulation \nresults showed that the system performance is accurate\
    \ with economical use of water and power. In [49] a wireless \nsensor/actuator\
    \ network (WSAN) with an adaptable decision support system was integrated to get\
    \ an automatic \nirrigation system. To analyze data, a machine learning process\
    \ had been used to get new knowledge. To ensure \nthat the developed system is\
    \ effective, the performance of the system was compared with classical \nagricultural\
    \ exercises.  \n \n2.2.  Optimization with smart irrigation system  \nThe systematic\
    \ literature review protocol includes seven research articles that deal with optimization\
    \ \nproblem in irrigation system based on WSN. In [50], a reliable low-cost information\
    \ gathering protocol \n(RLCIG) was proposed for irrigation system with WSN. Clustering\
    \ techniques were used for data aggregation \nwith optimized power to increase\
    \ network life. For balanced clustering, conditional spider optimization (CSO)\
    \ \nalgorithm was used, while for optimal path selection, the system proposed\
    \ using flower-bee search (FBS) \nalgorithm. The proposed method was tested using\
    \ simulation and the results show an improvement in transmission \nrange, cost\
    \ and system lifetime. Briones et al. [51] suggested a new multi-agent system\
    \ (MAS) to get an automated \nmonitoring and controlled irrigation system for\
    \ potato crops. MAS was developed using a cloud computing \nplatform which can\
    \ collect information from WSNs to define factors and determine irrigation requirements.\
    \ \nTELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput El Control \n \n \n \nReview on cyber-security\
    \ for optimized and smart irrigation systems (Wid Badee Abdulaziz) \n137 \nThis\
    \ smart system has the potential to keep resources and upgrade the efficiency\
    \ of crop production systems, \nspecially in rustic areas. The intelligent irrigation\
    \ system presented in [52] was developed to decrease water \nconsumption by combining\
    \ IoT, cloud computing, and optimization techniques. The used optimization model\
    \ \nminimizes the consumed water efficiently. The efficiency of the suggested\
    \ approach, which minimizes \nirrigation water use, was proven by a comparison\
    \ of the recommended optimization-based control model \nwith the flow-based control\
    \ model \nOcampo and Dadios [53], a multi-objective optimization method using\
    \ an intelligent irrigation \nsystem was introduced to reduce the energy cost\
    \ of operating two water pumps that maintain the water \nrequired for farm’s irrigation.\
    \ It was significant to obsereve that the genetic algorithm was used to get the\
    \ \noptimal solution. To achieve optimal water consumption, the authors of [54]\
    \ suggested integrating the \nautomated irrigation system with an accumulative\
    \ neural network (ANN). The suggested system was \nsimulated using the MATLAB\
    \ Toolbox of neural network with feed-forward backpropagation ANN model. \nIn\
    \ addition, in Maurya and Jain [55], suggested an approach for designing WSN-based\
    \ automated irrigation \nsystems. All sensor nodes collect data on an ongoing\
    \ basis. However, just data with a recurrent timer is sent \nto the base station\
    \ or data that exceeds the threshold. To reduce the node’s power consumption for\
    \ each \ntransmission, fuzzy logic was utilized to locate the entire cluster head\
    \ in the existing round. Comparisons \nwith other routing protocols have shown\
    \ that it effectively minimizes power consumption at each \ntransmission and extends\
    \ the life of the entire network. In [56], a WSN-based intelligent irrigation\
    \ system \nwith optimal consumed power using the Lagrange multiplier method was\
    \ suggested. The aim was to partition \npower optimally and efficiently, while\
    \ optimally minimizing power and watering, depending on the plant’s \nwatering\
    \ needs and watering time. \n \n2.3.  Cyber-security with smart irrigation system\
    \ \nAs the security is important aspect in the field of information systems including\
    \ irrigation, different \nresearchers tackled this issue. While in cyber-security\
    \ side, there is a smaller number of research work due to \nnew entrance of irrigation\
    \ field. In [57], a smart irrigation system was proposed with the assistance of\
    \ an \nandroid application. Variety of sensors, soil moisture, air humidity, and\
    \ air temperature were used to collect \nphysical information. Once the data reached\
    \ the server, a fuzzy logic control was used for take decisions \ndepending on\
    \ the required irrigation. The block chains were used to provide the required\
    \ reliability in the smart \nsystem by limiting the access and control of the\
    \ suggested system to only authorized devises. The system was \nefficient for\
    \ handling the irrigation process securely. Saleem et al. [16] proposed a data\
    \ encryption method to \nensure the accuracy of collected information by WSN to\
    \ get an effective irrigation decision. The encryption \nmechanism had been inspired\
    \ by blood brain barrier (BBB) system to ensure efficient data transmission in\
    \ \nWSNs. The system was simulated using network simulator two (NS2) and the results\
    \ approved the efficiency \nof the proposed encryption method in protecting data\
    \ communication from various attacks. \n \n2.4.  Fault tolerance with smart irrigation\
    \ system \nAs the irrigation systems are considered as important parts of feeding\
    \ security around the world, it is \nnecessary to ensure the reliability and availability\
    \ of them through using fault tolerance techniques. Some \nresearchers adopted\
    \ the presenting of solutions to this aspect in the literature. Ramli et al. [58]\
    \ suggested an \nadaptive technique to achieve reliability in a smart farm using\
    \ two network protocols: LoRaWAN and IEEE \n802.11ac in a smart monitoring system.\
    \ The sensor data has a small data size with low energy, so LoRaWAN \nprotocol\
    \ is suitable for transmitting it. Moreover, transmitting video data was done\
    \ using IEEE 802.11ac that \nhad a higher data rate. Using two network protocols\
    \ helped in getting a reliable monitoring system in \ncomparison of using a single\
    \ protocol technique. In [59], a novel approach for the recovery from \nsimultaneous\
    \ failures was proposed for a large-scale multi-channel WSNs called simultaneous\
    \ failure \nrecovery based on relay node relocation (SFR-RNR). As a case study,\
    \ the authors chose precision agriculture \napplication because it had thousands\
    \ of thousands of sensors. The proposed approach aim was to rebuilt the \nconnection\
    \ and the network coverage after failures.  \n \n \n3. \nPROSPECTIVE SOLUTION\
    \ METHODOLOGY  \nAs mentioned in the reviewed papers of [1]-[59], the problem\
    \ of managing the resources (water and \npower) in the irrigation systems has\
    \ been tackled in different directions that dealt with security, optimization,\
    \ \nWSN management, or fault tolerance individually. Therefore, there is a real\
    \ need for finding a solution \nmethodology for finding a comprehensive scheme\
    \ that manages the irrigation systems. This scheme aims to \npropose a smart irrigation\
    \ system (dripped and sprinkler) that adopts a developed optimization, cyber-security,\
    \ \nfault tolerance methods. This is to present a comprehensive irrigation system\
    \ that can manage the available \nresource of water and power to achieve the aspects\
    \ of reliability, availability and confidentially. A diagram in \nFigure 3 shows\
    \ the structure of the proposed project based on the results of the systematic\
    \ review. \n      \n  \n \n       ISSN: 1693-6930 \nTELKOMNIKA Telecommun Comput\

    1) \nDesigning and implementing of smart dripped and sprinkler irrigation system\
    \ based on clustered WSN. \nThe designed WSN is based on:  \n− Nodes of sensors\

    \  \n2) \nProducing an optimized method for managing the consumed water and power\
    \ to be reduced efficiently. \nThis method can take care from availability of\
    \ the proposed system. The possible optimization methods \nthat can be adopted\

    \ levels of hardware and \nsoftware that are considered for solving the mentioned\
    \ problems in managing power and water resources of \nirrigation systems. This\
    \ system can be briefly explained as: 1) sensor nodes and water bumps are connected\
    \ \nto a base-station to build a cluster in WSN. The base-station is responsible\
    \ of controlling irrigation process by \nsending power on and off commands to\
    \ water pumps with proper irrigation time depending on sensor’s \nreadings and\
    \ climatic conditions. Moreover, the base-station and related nodes as well as\

    \ tolerance and normal data transmission \nmethods; and 2) clusters of the WSN\
    \ are connected to the server throughout their base-stations with authentication\
    \ \nprotocols to monitor irrigation process as well as building data bases to\
    \ the proposed irrigation system. The server \napplies cyber-security, data saving\
    \ in the built database, fault tolerance, and normal data transmission. \n \n\

    The global agricultural sector is increasingly pressured to adopt sustainable
    practices and reduce its environmental impact. In this context, greenhouses play
    a crucial role in enabling year-round crop production, ensuring food security,
    and minimizing reliance on traditional open-field farming. However, the energy
    consumption associated with greenhouse operations poses a significant challenge
    to achieving sustainability goals. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on
    transitioning greenhouses towards near-zero energy consumption. Near-zero energy
    consumption in greenhouses refers to the ambitious objective of minimizing energy
    usage to the greatest extent possible while maintaining optimal growing conditions
    for crops. This goal encompasses reducing energy consumption for heating, cooling,
    lighting, and other operational needs, as well as exploring renewable energy sources
    to power greenhouse operations. This review article offers a comprehensive overview
    of greenhouse energy consumption, with the main goal of analyzing the present
    situation, identifying key challenges, exploring potential opportunities, and
    proposing future perspectives for decreasing energy usage in greenhouse environments.
    As the focus on sustainable agricultural practices grows, the need to reduce energy
    consumption in greenhouses becomes increasingly important. The review critically
    examines current technological models and strategies applied in smart greenhouse
    applications, as well as the monitoring of microclimatic conditions inside the
    greenhouse, encompassing factors such as temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, soil
    quality, and crop cultivation. Moreover, it aims to present existing literature
    that investigates the advancement of greenhouses toward achieving significant
    reductions in energy consumption. Keywords Smart Greenhouse; Optimization; Control;

    \ answered the question of how to use ICT sensor networks to increase crop \n\
    yields, while reducing agricultural inputs and the associated negative ecological\
    \ impacts. \nAccording to the model built for simulating a farm, if the average\
    \ farm uses ICT sensor \nnetworks to simultaneously monitor and control the amount\
    \ of irrigation water, fertilizer and \npesticides, the farm's crop yield can\
    \ increase by 16% and consumption of agricultural inputs \ncan be reduced by 20%,\
    \ 14% and 25%, respectively. The results of this study have important \nimplications\
    \ for improving the yield and productivity of farming, and for the sustainable\
    \ \ndevelopment of agriculture. The effects of the climatic zones in which the\
    \ farms are located on \nperformance of ICT sensor networks proved to be statistically\
    \ insignificant.  \n \n \n \nKeywords \nsustainable development; agriculture;\

    \ 51 \n \n 1 \n1. Introduction \nAs is advocated by the United Nations, efficiency\
    \ of the life cycle of production process \nis an important consideration for\
    \ sustainable development. This study aims to quantitatively \nassess the degree\
    \ to which Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sensor \nnetworks\
    \ can help increase crop yield in farmland and cut down on the consumption of\
    \ \nresources. Additionally, in agriculture, excessive application of nutrients\
    \ can be regarded as \npollution. Therefore, pollution prevention is an additional\
    \ consideration in sustainable \nagricultural development. An ICT sensor network\
    \ is an effective tool to monitor external \nconditions and collect data for making\
    \ decision for agricultural inputs allocation (i.e., watering, \nfertilizer application,\
    \ and pesticide application) for optimal outcome (i.e., crop yield).  \nIn this\
    \ study, a model to simulate the performance of farms that are equipped with ICT\
    \ \nsensor networks for controlling usage of agricultural inputs, with the data\
    \ collected from \npublications and from the service providers that focus on utilizing\
    \ ICT sensor networks in \nagriculture. With the model, an estimated value of\
    \ possible outcomes (crop yield, resource \ninputs) was calculated. \nThis study\
    \ answered a question that how to use existing technologies to increase crop \n\
    yields, while reducing agricultural inputs and the associated negative ecological\
    \ impacts. The \nresults of this study have important implications for improving\
    \ the yield and productivity of \nfarming, and for the sustainable development\
    \ of agriculture. The effects of the climatic zones in \nwhich the farms are located\
    \ on performance of ICT sensor networks are also analyzed, and the \ninfluence\
    \ of location variation proved to be insignificant.  \n \n \n \n2 \n2. Background\
    \ \n2.1 Problem statement \nA growing population and the corresponding needs for\
    \ food throughout the world have \nprompted farm owners to expand the scale of\
    \ planting. As farm size expands, it is no longer \nfeasible to rely on collecting\
    \ data manually for making decisions on agricultural activities \n(Brase, 2006).\
    \ Breakthroughs in areas of information technology, lower manufacturing and \n\
    usage cost, smaller size, and longer life span have made sensors ubiquitous items\
    \ for the public \n(Nack, 2019), and there has been a trend that ICT sensors technologies\
    \ are being widely applied \nin agriculture, controlling the usage of water, fertilizer,\
    \ and pesticide. Meanwhile, in many \nstudies that discussed wireless sensor networks\
    \ in farms, the effects of using this service were \nnot clearly mentioned. To\
    \ describe the performance of ICT usage on farms, two types of \ninformation (indicators)\
    \ should be provided: the percentage of agricultural resources that can be \n\
    saved, and the increase in crop yield that are realized by using wireless sensor\
    \ networks. Some \nof the articles listed both indicators, while some of them\
    \ only provided one or neither of these \nindicators. \nMany previous studies\
    \ on sensor networks in agriculture have focused mainly on the \ndeployment and\
    \ configuration of wireless sensor networks, and the collection of environmental\
    \ \ndata. Work by Sakthipriya(2014) is a typical example. In the study by Sakthipriya(2014),a\
    \ crop \nmanagement system has two types of functions, sensing and decision making.\
    \ The sensor \nnetwork can collect environmental parameters including temperature,\
    \ soil moisture and soil pH \nvalue. Based on these environmental parameters sent\
    \ to the backbone, decisions on whether the \nwater sprinkler should be turned\
    \ on to provide sufficient water to the field can be made. \nHowever, there has\
    \ been little quantitative analysis on the potential of wireless sensor \nnetworks\
    \ to enhance crop yield or improve efficiency of resource use. Most of the studies\
    \ claim \nthat the wireless sensor networks solution they discussed will improve\
    \ or boost the crop \nproduction. iFarm designed by Jiber et al. (2011) is a typical\
    \ example. This system provided \nirrigation management (monitoring and controlling\
    \ water usage), pest and disease detection, \ncrop yield prediction, and resource\
    \ optimization. Few studies provided the percentage or \nincremental gain in crop\
    \ production and saving on agricultural inputs. For example, Xiong et \nal.(2008)collected\
    \ a variety of environmental and animal-related data (e.g. breed, days in milk,\
    \ \n \n3 \nmilk time, milk quality, reproduction status, location), but further\
    \ utilization of the data in \npredicting animal activities or future production\
    \ was not carried out. \n2.2 Research objectives \nThe overall purpose of my study\
    \ is to evaluate how the farmland and crop would \nrespond, when wireless sensor\
    \ networks are deployed to monitor and control how much water, \nfertilizer, and\
    \ pesticide are used. I decided to carry out research based on the performance\
    \ data \ncollected from existing farms using this type of service. The goal of\
    \ my research is to determine \nthe quantitative relationships between use of\
    \ wireless sensor networks and performance \nindicators (change in crop yield\
    \ and agricultural resource usage on farms). The analysis is based \non existing\
    \ farms that have already been equipped with wireless sensor networks and that\
    \ have \ncollected performance indicator data.  \nTherefore, my major research\
    \ questions are: \n(1) To what degree can ICT sensor networks boost crop yield\
    \ by monitoring and \ncontrolling the usage of water, fertilizer, and pesticide?\
    \ \n(2) If ICT sensor networks could be deployed throughout a selected country\
    \ or area, \nhow could the annual yield of crops change?  \n \n \n \n4 \n3. Literature\
    \ review \nIn this literature review, concepts of sustainable development, an\
    \ introduction to ICT \nsensor network, and applications of ICT sensor networks\
    \ are discussed.  \n3.1 Sustainable Development and ICT sensor networks \n3.1.1\
    \ Overview of sustainable development \nThe United Nations in 1987 articulated\
    \ a need “to make development sustainable to \nensure that it meets the needs\
    \ of the present without compromising the ability of future \ngenerations to meet\
    \ their own needs” (World Commission on Environment and Development, \n1987).\
    \ This concept drew the attention of the public toward finding ways to avoid sacrificing\
    \ \nthe natural environment for economic growth. Over time, given the changing\
    \ needs of people \nwith respect to the environment, society and economy, the\
    \ practices and definition of \nsustainable development need to be up-to-date.\
    \  \nThe US Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency\
    \ defined \nsustainable agricultural development as “Agricultural sustainable\
    \ development refers to the \napplication of local intrinsic technology to achieve\
    \ the following objectives for a long time and \nstrive to form a comprehensive\
    \ production system for plant and livestock production.” (Hebei \nAcademy of Social\
    \ Sciences, 2017). These objectives include (1) to meet the needs of people's\
    \ \nfood and clothing; (2) to improve the quality of the environment and natural\
    \ resources on which \nagricultural production depends; and (3) to make the most\
    \ efficient use of non-renewable \nresources and materials available on farms,\
    \ and at the same time, comprehensive regulation of \nnatural resources management\
    \ methods is carried out if necessary; (4) maintaining the \neconomic vitality\
    \ of agricultural production entities; and (5) improving the overall quality of\
    \ \nlife of farmers and the whole society (Hebei Academy of Social Sciences, 2017).\
    \ \nA report from the United Nations claims that if the global population increases\
    \ to 9.6 \nbillion in the next 30 years, the equivalent of three planets would\
    \ be required to meet the \ndemands of humans given current lifestyles (United\
    \ Nations, 2016). Facing the challenge of \nfulfilling growing demands with limited\
    \ resource, it is essential to increase the efficiency of \nusing resources, so\
    \ the United Nations proposed a concept of Sustainable Consumption and \nProduction.\
    \ Based on the principle of higher efficiency with smaller input and more output,\
    \ this \n \n5 \nconcept improves the quality of life while reducing resource consumption\
    \ and environmental \ndegradation and pollution levels throughout the consumption\
    \ and production cycle, thereby \nenhancing the welfare benefits of economic activities\
    \ (United Nations Environment Programme, \n2010).  \nIn 2015, the General Assembly\
    \ adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals for the \nfollowing 15-year lifespan,\
    \ aiming to achieve sustainable development inclusively for everyone. \nAmong\
    \ the 17 goals, Sustainable Development Goal 12 (also known as SDG 12) is most\
    \ related \nto this study. SDG 12 was to build a more sustainable and production-efficient\
    \ world. Its major \ntargets include (1) promoting resource and energy efficiency,\
    \ and (2) promoting sustainable \ninfrastructures (United Nations, 2015). The\
    \ SDGs were intended to promote a new worldview \nand provide the beginnings of\
    \ a plan to end poverty without imposing significant costs on \nEarth’s life-support\
    \ systems. The goals may help create a fresh global narrative around a \ncommon\
    \ future to mobilise collective action and help develop a shared understanding\
    \ of \ninterconnected risks and solutions(Gaffney, 2014).  \n3.1.2 Agricultural\
    \ waste issues \nHigher production and smaller input are required for sustainable\
    \ development. To meet \nthe demand for food by a growing global population, an\
    \ expansion in agricultural production is \nneeded. As farm sizes expand, it is\
    \ no longer viable to rely on collecting data manually for \nmaking decisions\
    \ on agricultural activities (Brase, 2006). At the same time, various sensors\
    \ \nwhich have lower manufacturing and utilization costs, smaller size, and longer\
    \ life spans, have \nbecome ubiquitous items for the public (Nack, 2019).  \n\
    Another aspect of accomplishing United Nation’s SDG 12 is to reduce the solid\
    \ waste \nthat is generated from production processes, which could cut down on\
    \ the amount of raw \nmaterials that manufacturers have to obtain from nature\
    \ or artificially create (Bishop, \n2004).Relevant to this research is agriculture\
    \ waste, produced by agricultural activities. \nAgricultural waste is comprised\
    \ of animal waste (manure, animal carcasses), food processing \nwaste (only 20%\
    \ of maize is canned and 80% is waste), crop waste (corn stalks, sugarcane \n\
    bagasse, drops and culls from fruits and vegetables, pruning) and hazardous and\
    \ toxic \nagricultural waste (pesticides, insecticides and herbicides, etc.) (Ramírez-García\
    \ et al., 2019; \nObi et al., 2016). \n \n6 \nMost chemicals of agricultural waste\
    \ are water-soluble and can leach and enter water \nbodies and food, leading to\
    \ severe ecologic and human health impacts.  This can cause serious \nhealth disorders\
    \ in humans, including cancer, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, birth\
    \ \ndefects, and reproductive disorders. Pesticides can also kill non-target plants,\
    \ birds, and other \nwildlife, and have a significant negative impact on soil\
    \ quality and fertility (Ramírez-García, \nGohil, & Singh, 2019). \nFertilizer\
    \ contains massive amount of nutritive minerals including nitrogen, phosphorus,\
    \ \nand potassium which provides support for plants to grow faster and increase\
    \ yields. However, if \nthe application of fertilizer surpasses the crop/soil\
    \ system’s capacity to absorb the nutrients, the \nexcessive minerals will leak\
    \ into surface runoff, and eventually enter waterbodies such as lakes, \nrivers,\
    \ creeks, etc. (Karunanithi et al., 2016). When the excessive NPK minerals enter\
    \ the \nwaterbody, eutrophication occurs, with mass production of photosynthetic\
    \ microorganisms. \nWhen these photosynthetic microorganisms die, bacteria activity\
    \ decomposing this biomass can \ndeplete dissolved oxygen, causing other organisms\
    \ such as fish to die of hypoxia (Wetzel, \n2001). \nUnited States Environmental\
    \ Protection Agency recommended the following ways to \nmitigate the pollution\
    \ by excessive agricultural inputs: (1) applying nutrients in the right \namount,\
    \ at the right time of year, with the right method and with the right placement;\
    \ (2) \nEnsuring year-round ground cover to avoid soil erosion and nutrients loss\
    \ to the waterway; (3) \nPlanting field buffers. Planted buffers can help prevent\
    \ nutrient loss from fields by absorbing or \nfiltering out nutrients before they\
    \ reach a water body; (4) Installing fence along waterways to \nkeep animals off\
    \ the stream, river, etc. (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2019)\
    \ \n \nIn the context of this study, ICT sensor networks are deployed on farms\
    \ to collect \ninformation about the factors that would affect crop yield, such\
    \ as soil water content, fertilizer \nusage, and soil/atmospheric temperature\
    \ (Meeradevi & Mundada, 2015). Once information has \nbeen collected, it can be\
    \ processed in two different directions. The first is that information can \n\
    be sent directly to terminal clients and then converted into graphic deliverables\
    \ by visualization \nsoftware. With visualized content about the farm environment,\
    \ farm managers would know \nbetter about how the farm works, and what kind of\
    \ strategies they should take for better or more \n \n7 \nefficient crop production.\
    \ The second direction focuses on the idea of agricultural resource and \nwaste\
    \ control. The sensor network keeps contributing to making decision on the ground\
    \ \nregarding the proper amount of water, fertilizer and pesticide to be applied\
    \ on site. \n3.2 What is ICT sensor network? \nInformation and Communication Technology\
    \ is a varied cluster of digital tools and \nresources used to communicate, generate,\
    \ disseminate, store and perform information \nmanagement (Rahman et al., 2016).\
    \  \n3.2.1 Internet of Things \nIn this study, the main infrastructure used for\
    \ improving production is the sensor \nnetwork. The ICT sensor network is a subset\
    \ of the Internet of Things (IoT), referring to the \ninterconnection of smart\
    \ devices, ranging from appliances to tiny sensors (Stallings & Brown, \n2018).\
    \ An advantageous feature of the Internet of Things is that short-range mobile\
    \ transceivers \nare embedded in various gadgets and daily necessities, thereby\
    \ enabling new forms of \ncommunication between people and things, and between\
    \ things. The cloud systems today \nsupport the interconnection of billions of\
    \ industrial and personal objects. These objects can pass \ninformation collected\
    \ from distributed sensor nodes. Utilizing this low-latency information can \n\
    be used to effectively monitor the environment and make decisions for overall\
    \ management of \nlarge systems such as factories or cities. The farms involved\
    \ in this study are benefiting from \nthis technology. From the initial PC and\
    \ server to later professional operational technology and \npersonal electronic\
    \ communication equipment, sensor-based internet of things represents the \nlatest\
    \ products and trends of the Internet (Stallings & Brown, 2018). \nThe sensor\
    \ nodes are the most basic and underlying devices of an Internet of Things, \n\
    and at the same time they represent one of the core technologies of the wireless\
    \ sensor networks \nfor this study. A single sensor unit consists of five key\
    \ components, sensor, actuator, micro-\ncontroller, transceiver and radio-frequency\
    \ identification (Stallings & Brown, 2018), which will \nbe discussed in a following\
    \ subsection regarding sensor node structure. \nIn the context of a complete enterprise\
    \ network, an Internet of Things may have four \ndifferent layers. The bottom-up\
    \ order of these layers is the edge layer, the fog layer, the core \nlayer and\
    \ the cloud layer. The edge layer is mainly composed of sensors and switches,\
    \ which \n \n8 \ncan communicate information to each other when needed. At this\
    \ layer, there are a few \ngateways that connect sensors to communicate with higher-level\
    \ networks. After the data is \ncollected by the gateway, it is transmitted to\
    \ the fog layer. The amount of data this layer \nreceives from distributed sensor\
    \ networks on the ground is usually very large, so a significant \nfeature of\
    \ the fog layer is that it can be evaluated close to the edge layer. This can\
    \ effectively \nreduce the pressure on the entire network from transmitting a\
    \ large amount of data, whether it \nconsumes bandwidth or consumes other resources.\
    \ The main functions of the core layer above \nthe fog layer are to connect the\
    \ broadly distributed fog layer, and to open the interface to \nexternal servers.\
    \ The cloud layer on the top of the network, provides storage and processing \n\
    capabilities for large amounts of aggregated data sensor nodes from the edge (Stallings\
    \ & \nBrown, 2018). \n3.2.2 Network structure and architecture \nThe realm of\
    \ wireless networks can be divided into infrastructured and infrastructureless\
    \ \nnetworks. A typical infrastructured wireless network consists of a central\
    \ base station where all \nthe information transmitted from the ground is processed,\
    \ and nodes collect information at \nground level. A cellular wireless network\
    \ is the most common type of infrastructured network. \nDifferent from the infrastructured\
    \ network, an infrastructureless wireless network has \ndistributed, independent,\
    \ dynamic topology, low-power, task-oriented wireless nodes. With \nthese features,\
    \ a lot of decisions can be made at ground level, and as a result, some unnecessary\
    \ \ninformation for high-level decision-making will be removed from the information\
    \ package \nwhich will be sent to a central base station (Jangra, 2010). The wireless\
    \ sensor networks to be \ndiscussed in this study is a typical instance of an\
    \ infrastructureless network.  \n \nStallings and Brown (2018) summarized a sensor\
    \ network as a cluster of sensors \ntransmitting their data to one intermediate\
    \ entity that aggregates the data to be collected by a \nhigher-level entity.\
    \ There are five steps that a sensor network should take when a sensor node \n\
    has fetched data from an external environment: \n(1) Evaluation: evaluating data\
    \ for criteria as to whether it should be processed at a \nhigher level. \n(2)\
    \ Formatting: reformatting data for consistent higher-level processing. \n \n\
    9 \n(3) Expanding/decoding: handling cryptic data with additional context (such\
    \ as the \norigin). \n(4) Distillation/reduction: reducing and/or summarizing\
    \ data to minimize the impact \nof data and traffic on the network and higher-level\
    \ processing systems. \n(5) Assessment: determining whether data represent a threshold\
    \ or alert; this could \ninclude redirecting data to additional destinations.\
    \ \nAn advantage of the four-layered architecture of the Internet of Things networks,\
    \ is that \nthe size of data packets to be transmitted gradually shrinks as data\
    \ moves from ground level to \nthe higher levels (Stallings & Brown, 2018). \n\
    Another distinguishing characteristic of a sensor network is fog computing, which\
    \ is an \nopposite technical trend to cloud computing. Cloud computing refers\
    \ to the network that makes \nmassive and centralized storage, and processing\
    \ resources available to distributed users or \nclients. In fog computing, many\
    \ smart devices (e.g. sensors) are interconnected by fog network \nfacilities\
    \ that provide data processing function which is close to the sensors rather than\
    \ the \nhigher-level devices (Stallings et al., 2012). In terms of the efficiency,\
    \ the fog network between \nthe smart devices layer and the core network layer\
    \ enables lots of vital decisions to be made by \nthe smart devices on the edge.\
    \ That is to say, the time it takes for sensed data at ground/edge to \ntravel\
    \ to the higher-level cloud server can be saved by processing in the fog network.\
    \ The \narchitecture of the IoT equipped with a fog network relieves the burden\
    \ of computing in the \ncentral part of the IoT system, which in turn allows more\
    \ smart devices to be engaged in the \nnetwork. Owing to the rapid detection or\
    \ rapid measurements of sensors on edge, the risk of \ndisaster from a cascading\
    \ system failure would be decreased, and therefore the potential costs to \nmaintain\
    \ and repair the system would be saved (Cisco, 2015). Sliva’s research on WSNs\
    \ \nincludes a five-layered protocol, including a physical layer, a data link\
    \ layer, a network layer, a \ntransport layer and an application layer (Sliva,\
    \ 2008).Appendix Figure A1 is a common \narchitecture of ICT sensor network (Telecommunication\
    \ Standardization Sector of International \nTelecommunication Union, 2014). The\
    \ multi-layer feature of a sensor network is clearly \nillustrated in Appendix\
    \ Figure A1.  \n \n10 \n3.2.3 Sensor node structure \nNodes are a fundamental\
    \ part of a viable wireless sensor network. There are four major \ncomponents\
    \ in a node which are a power unit (e.g. battery sets), sensing unit, processing\
    \ and \nstorage unit and transceiver unit (for communication), with the major\
    \ structure of a node \ndepicted according to Sliva (2008)(Appendix Figure A2),\
    \ and a more detailed explanation (El-\nKader & El-Basion, 2013) (Appendix Figure\
    \ A3). In a fog network, these nodes have an \nadditional component, the microcontroller,\
    \ which is the intelligence for making basic decisions \nat ground level of a\
    \ whole network. \nTo ensure a sufficiently long network life, energy efficiency\
    \ in all parts of the network \nis critical. Therefore, data processing tasks\
    \ are often spread across the network: that is, nodes \nneed to cooperate to transmit\
    \ data to receivers (Galar & Kumar, 2017). \nIn real-world application of wireless\
    \ sensor networks in agriculture, one of the main \nconcerns and barriers is that\
    \ the farm owners or operators would worry about the costs of \nrunning the network\
    \ in fields, which includes the initial expense of setting up and configuring\
    \ \nhardware, the costs of maintenance and replacement, and of electricity for\
    \ devices in the long \nrun (Sliva, 2008; El-Kader & El-Basion, 2013). In order\
    \ to minimize the costs of nodes, more \ncircuits should be integrated into each\
    \ chip. Regarding the energy, less memory and less \npowerful processing units\
    \ in ground devices can be used to reduce cost (Sliva, 2008). This \nstrategy\
    \ makes sense, but at the same time it would increase the burden of computing\
    \ in a \ncentral base station, and in turn slow down the speed of processing data\
    \ and making decisions. \n3.2.4 Wireless standard used in ICT sensor networks\
    \ \nAt present, there are many standards and protocols for the wireless transmission\
    \ of \nsignals in wireless sensor networks. Among them, the following protocols\
    \ are the most \nfrequently used(Sohraby , Minoli, & Znati, 2007):  \n• IEEE 802.15.1\
    \ (also known as Bluetooth);  \nBluetooth is a standard for short range, low power,\
    \ and low-cost wireless \ncommunication that uses radio technology. Its short-range\
    \ wireless capability allows \nperipheral devices to communicate over a single\
    \ air-interface, replacing the cables that \n \n11 \nuse connectors with a multitude\
    \ of shapes, sizes and numbers of pins (McDermott-Wells, \n2004). \n• IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n\
    \ series of wireless LANs;  \nIEEE 802.11 and 802.11x refers to a family of specifications\
    \ developed by the IEEE for \nwireless local area network (WLAN) technology. 802.11\
    \ specifies an over-the-air \ninterface between a wireless client and a base station\
    \ or between two wireless clients \n(IEEE Standard Association, 2020). \n• IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4 (ZigBee);  \nZigBee is a specification for a suite of high-level communication\
    \ protocols using low-\npower digital radios based on IEEE 802.15.4. The technology\
    \ defined by the ZigBee \nspecification is intended to be simpler and less expensive\
    \ than the other consumer \nwireless personal area networks, such as Bluetooth.\
    \ A distinguishing feature of ZigBee \nis low cost, which allows this technology\
    \ to be widely used in the area of wireless \ncontrolling (Radmand, Talevski,\
    \ Petersen, & Carlsen, 2010). \n• MAN-scope IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX);  \nWiMAX standard\
    \ is a family of 802.16, that provides, multiple physical layer (PHY) \nand Media\
    \ Access Control (MAC) options (Nuaymi, 2007). \n• Radio-frequency identification\
    \ (RFID) tagging. \nThere are two general categories of RFID tagging, active and\
    \ passive, depending on \ntheir source of electrical power. Active RFID tags contain\
    \ their own power source, \nusually an on-board battery. Passive tags obtain power\
    \ from the signal of an external \nreader. This technique has been used widely\
    \ in the areas of supply chain management, \nsecurity, and movement tracking (Weinstein,\
    \ 2005). \nThese transmission protocols and their corresponding properties, including\
    \ transmission \nrange and speed, have been summarized in previous literature\
    \ (Sohraby et al., 2007; Ojha et al., \n \n12 \n2015). When configuring transmission\
    \ protocols for WSNs, the person who makes the decision \nshould select the appropriate\
    \ one based on energy availability, nodes characteristics, and \nperformance requirement\
    \ of this network. Appendix Figure A4 and Appendix Table A1 show \nthe differences\
    \ in data transmission rate, transmission range, and energy consumption of these\
    \ \navailable transmission protocols.  \nThe technologies described above enable\
    \ many sensors to be deployed in crop fields in \na non-destructive way, which\
    \ in turn helps increase the resolution when mapping soil, plant, \nand livestock\
    \ properties.  \n3.2.5 Energy efficiency matters \nThe energy consumed by an ICT\
    \ sensor network mainly has two aspects, the direct \ncurrent brought by the battery\
    \ used by the node, and the alternating current consumed by the \ndata center\
    \ or core layer of the network when processing data. A technology used to facilitate\
    \ \nsustainable development should be in line with its own idea of sustainable\
    \ development. \nTherefore, energy efficiency in ICT sensor networks should be\
    \ considered. Improving energy \nefficiency in the ICT solutions requires both\
    \ policy and technology guidelines (Cremer et al., \n2010). In terms of technologic\
    \ guidelines, these solutions start with where the ICT industry \nconsumes energy.\
    \ For example, server clusters, data centers, and base stations that are now \n\
    commonly used consume electric power for daily operations on the one hand, and\
    \ cooling \nhardware on the other(Fagas, Gammaitoni, Gallagher, & Paul, 2017).\
    \ For energy consumed to \nmaintain daily operations, the base station should\
    \ first ensure that there are no in-situ servers \nthat are powered on but not\
    \ working at all. The second step is to transform the traditional data \ncenters\
    \ into next generation hyperscale data centers. This upgraded data center has\
    \ 25% higher \nenergy efficiency than the traditional one. From 2016 to 2020,\
    \ a hyperscale data center is \npredicted to shrink the overall energy consumption\
    \ by 50%, with these small and less-efficient \ndata centers shut down (Jones,\
    \ 2018). \nTackling cooling down or maintaining system temperature is another\
    \ technical \nimprovement direction. Monitoring real-time operation conditions\
    \ including temperature and \nhumidity makes it possible to make dynamic actions\
    \ on the right timing to run a cooling system. \n \n13 \nThis practice can avoid\
    \ excessive cooling when the workload in the data center is not heavy \n(Shuja\
    \ et al., 2012). \nOptimizing computing procedure and network architecture is\
    \ another guideline for \nhigher efficiency. For example, streamlining the computing\
    \ process, scaling dynamic voltage \nand frequency for high-performance tasks,\
    \ and balancing the data pipeline are all feasible \noptions for architecture\
    \ (Fagas et al., 2017; Satran, 2018). However, implementing these \nmeasures to\
    \ improve the energy efficiency of ICT sensor networks will inevitably encounter\
    \ \nobstacles. As is mentioned above, guidelines for improving energy efficiency\
    \ in ICT industry \nimpact initially the businesses from an economic perspective,\
    \ and it will inevitably add \nfinancial burden to both business owners and their\
    \ clients/consumers. For instance, adding \ntaxes or extra fees to the price of\
    \ a product is never an easy task, because the stakeholders \nmight be reluctant\
    \ to accept this increase in cost. \nIn terms of deploying advanced cooling systems\
    \ for higher energy, this practice has two \nmajor obstacles for implementation.\
    \ The first one is the price that data centers have to pay for \nthis upgrade,\
    \ because cost-controlling is the very basis of running business in a robust manner.\
    \ \nAnother barrier is that some smart temperature controlling systems that are\
    \ integrated into data \ncenters involve deep customization for better compatibility.\
    \ Therefore, it will take time and \nefforts to set up such a system for a data\
    \ center. \nThe third guideline mentioned above may have technical difficulty\
    \ in implementing, \nthat is the transformation and upgrading of legacy architecture\
    \ and computing algorithms is a \nmentally work-intensive job, and it requires\
    \ massive assistance from external sources. If so, \nfurther collaboration between\
    \ internal and outsourced workers will cost time and effort for this \nintegration.\
    \ \n \n3.3 Applications of the Internet of Things \n \nInternet of Things has\
    \ been applied in various industries, including but not limited to \ngrid, transportation,\
    \ logistic and healthcare (Wu, 2010). This study mainly discusses the \napplication\
    \ of IoT in healthcare and finance. \n \n14 \n3.3.1 The Internet of Things in\
    \ Healthcare \nThe Internet of Things solutions for healthcare includes the following\
    \ aspects, \nequipment for patients, equipment designed for doctors' work, and\
    \ networks for hospital \nmanagement. \nInternet of Things for patients. IoT solutions\
    \ for monitoring the health or medical \nconditions of individuals are able to\
    \ collect parameters from patients, using the body-sensor \nnodes that are equipped\
    \ in wearable devices. These solutions play an important role in \nimproving the\
    \ quality of life and survival opportunities of critically ill patients and chronically\
    \ \nill patients. Fortino et al. (2014)designed a body sensor networks called\
    \ BodyCloud, which can \ngather real-time data regarding body temperature, blood\
    \ pressure, and electrocardiography, and \nconduct further processing on raw data,\
    \ data storage and analysis. Fanucci et al (2012)created a \nsystem to monitor\
    \ the vital signs of chronic heart failure patients. In this system, signs including\
    \ \nelectrocardiogram, SpO2, blood pressure, and weight are collected by non-invasive\
    \ sensor \nnodes. These data will be transmitted from sensor nodes to a home sensor\
    \ gateway for checking \nwhether the status of a patient who is prone to suffering\
    \ from heart failure is abnormal, \ncompared with the pre-set safety value range.\
    \ Once the detected values are beyond the \nthreshold, alerts will be sent from\
    \ home gateway and calls for instant supports, which allows \nearlier home interventions\
    \ thus reducing the number of hospitalizations. \nThe Internet of Things also\
    \ has significant impacts on the elderly who are living alone \nand their families\
    \ by continuously tracking their health. When someone's daily activities are \n\
    disturbed or changed, the alert mechanism will send signals to family members\
    \ and medical \npersonnel. For example, falls are a serious problem for the elderly,\
    \ so it is imperative to apply \nfalls detection in the daily life of the elderly.\
    \ There have been plenty of IoT-based fall detection \nand alerting solutions.\
    \ In Gutiérrez-Madroñal et al.’s (2019)solution of fall detection, once their\
    \ \nmotion sensors observe that the change in the acceleration of human motion\
    \ conforms to the \nfall pattern, these sensor nodes will determine a fall event,\
    \ and then an alert will be sent for help. \nThe combination of home monitoring\
    \ devices, such as wearables and fog computing, \ncan allow doctors to more effectively\
    \ track the patient's health. After the sensors installed on \nthe patient are\
    \ processed locally, the data necessary for the doctor's diagnosis will be uploaded\
    \ \nto the cloud. Doctors can track the patient's compliance with the treatment\
    \ plan or any need for \n \n15 \nimmediate medical attention. The Internet of\
    \ Things has made healthcare professionals more \nalert and able to proactively\
    \ contact patients. The data collected from IoT devices can help \ndoctors determine\
    \ the best treatment process for patients and achieve the expected results \n\
    (Alam et al., 2018). \nInternet of Things for hospitals. The National Health Service\
    \ in England declared the \npractices of using IoT in healthcare is effective\
    \ in tracking medical supplies and automating \nbasic data collection and patient\
    \ monitoring, so that the experienced healthcare workers can be \nset free from\
    \ repetitive tasks to focus on patients’ safety and services(Best, 2018). Hospitals\
    \ can \nuse IoT technology to track the use of medical equipment and consumables.\
    \ In most hospitals, \nequipment such as electrocardiographs and analgesic pumps\
    \ needs to be shared by patients. IoT \ncan not only provide insights for hospital\
    \ staff to plan resource allocation by sending the real-\ntime location of the\
    \ device, but also can be used to monitor the maintenance status of the device\
    \ \nand issue alerts when appropriate. For some medical consumables that are being\
    \ consumed at \nfast speed, low-cost RFID tags allow them to be marked, so it\
    \ is easy to count usage and then \ncharge the patient's account. At the same\
    \ time, tracking the usage of these medical consumables \ncan also help hospitals\
    \ manage inventory. For example, when the consumption of certain items \nis too\
    \ high or the rate of use is too fast, an alarm will be issued to remind the hospital\
    \ to \nreplenish inventory or reduce excessive consumption (Laplante & Laplante,\
    \ 2016). \nFor hospitals and some other healthcare providers, the significance\
    \ of using IoT is that \nafter collecting a massive amount of data from ground\
    \ devices, meaningful trends and \nconclusions can be drawn through centralized\
    \ sorting and analysis. These analytics deliverables \ncan be suggestions of medical\
    \ assistance or overall visualization of the condition of a patient \ngroup. Figure\
    \ 1is an illustration of the workflow of IoT solutions in healthcare (Mora et\
    \ al., \n2017; Mora, Gil, Terol, Azorín, & Szymanski, 2017) \n \n16 \n \nFigure\
    \ 1. Schema of IoT workflow (Mora et al., 2017) \n3.3.2 The Internet of Things\
    \ in Finance \n \nThe applications of IoT have transformed the way that the financial\
    \ sector works. \nKhanboubi et al. (2019)summarized the following trend in which\
    \ IoT solutions are changing \nfinancial services, mobile banking, crowd-based\
    \ financing, virtual money, high frequency \ntrading firms, cyber criminality,\
    \ big data and IT analytics. The applications of IoT in finance \ncan be classified\
    \ into two categories, one is financial services for individual users and corporate\
    \ \nusers, and the other is the measures used by banks and other financial institutions\
    \ to optimize \nand upgrade their own workflow. The most common of the first type\
    \ of application is the \nbanking service provided to users that can be accessed\
    \ at any time through a personal terminal. \nThese services include using the\
    \ user’s biological information to perform security \nauthentication of the banking\
    \ business or to replace the physical signature during the business \nprocess;\
    \ using the built-in near-field communication technologies (NFC) module of mobile\
    \ \nphone or wearable device to complete contactless payment; collecting funding\
    \ from a large \nnumber of individual to support a project financially via an\
    \ online platform (Khanboubi et al., \n2019). \nThere are some other IoT applications\
    \ in finance designed for business security and risk \nmanagement. For example,\
    \ Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is using IoT solutions for \nits financing\
    \ business risk management practices. RFID tags are deployed on collateral to\
    \ detect \nthe movement of objects. Any abnormal movement can trigger the alarm\
    \ system, a realization \n \n17 \nof the automatic collection of alarm information\
    \ and early warning of risk monitoring (InfoQ, \n2019). \n3.4 Concerns regarding\
    \ sensor nodes and the network \nAs discussed above, ICT sensor networks can indeed\
    \ play an effective role in detecting \nfarmland environment and controlling the\
    \ application of yield technology, but use of this \ntechnology in agriculture\
    \ is confronted with the limitations and challenges including, but not \nlimited\
    \ to, lifetime, energy and reliability. \n3.4.1 Energy consumption and Battery\
    \ life \nThe power unit is an essential part of an ICT sensor node (Sliva, 2008).\
    \ Rechargeable \nbatteries are usually used for power supply in a sensor node,\
    \ which have limited capacity and \npose a challenge to long-term deployment.\
    \ These batteries provide stable electricity to the other \nmodule in a sensor\
    \ node, so that each part of the node can work properly. To enhance energy \n\
    efficiency within a sensor node, the circuits and algorithm of the processing\
    \ and calculating \nmodule of a node have to be further optimized (Jawad, Nordin,\
    \ Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, \n2017). In wireless sensor networks, the lifetime\
    \ of a node is generally determined by its power \nunit, usually the life of batteries\
    \ used in the sensor nodes. To utilize the maximum of the battery \nlife, power\
    \ consumption of the nodes should be strictly controlled, which means that the\
    \ \nprogram and algorithms inside the nodes should be optimized and improved (Sliva,\
    \ 2008). The \ngood news is that the problem of limited node lifespan can be addressed,\
    \ with the use of \nenergy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been\
    \ developed to allow sensor nodes \nto harvest different types of energy, such\
    \ as solar, wireless power transfer, mechanical vibration, \nkinetic, and wind\
    \ energy, from different environments. Ambient energy can be converted into \n\
    electrical energy, and the electric energy can be used to charge the battery of\
    \ a sensor node, or \nit can be stored for later use. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to \nextend the life of sensor nodes (Jawad, Nordin,\
    \ Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017). \n3.4.2 Equilibrium among energy consumption,\
    \ transmission range and node performance \nIn the realm of wireless communication\
    \ protocols, ZigBee consumes much less power \nthan these traditional transmission\
    \ methods, including Wi-Fi and GPRS, but the latter has a \nwider transmission\
    \ range. Similar trade-offs occur from time to time. Zigbee and low-energy \n\
    \ \n18 \nBluetooth are designed for battery-powered devices. Low-energy Bluetooth\
    \ is superior to \nZigBee in terms of power consumption, but due to its short\
    \ communication distance of 10 \nmeters, the protocol is limited in agricultural\
    \ applications. The Long-Range Radio (LoRa) \nProtocol covers large communication\
    \ areas with low power consumption. Therefore, it can be \nappropriately deployed\
    \ in a wide agricultural field. However, for this protocol, limited \ncommunication\
    \ time per hour for each device and message capacity for communication, and its\
    \ \ndependency on gateway make this protocol no longer the best option for configuring\
    \ \nagricultural ICT sensor networks (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail,\
    \ 2017). \n3.4.3 Transmission loss \nWhen deployed for agricultural purposes,\
    \ WSN faces a more difficult environment than \nother uses, such as outdoor, orchards,\
    \ farms and other complex terrain. Signal transmission will \nbe disturbed by\
    \ obstacles. In agricultural applications, signals transmitted from sensor nodes\
    \ \nneed to reach the receiving node through a thick canopy. If a sufficient gap\
    \ cannot be ensured, \nthe signal will be absorbed, reflected, attenuated and\
    \ scattered during the propagation process \n(Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad,\
    \ & Ismail, 2017). \n3.4.4 Immediate and reliable \nThe starting point for the\
    \ establishment of WSN determines that one of its first tasks is \nto provide\
    \ farmers with low-latency environmental information. Most crops are easily affected\
    \ \nby the weather. If WSN fails to detect environmental changes in a timely manner,\
    \ or detects \ninformation but does not transmit it to relevant clients in a timely\
    \ manner, it may lead to serious \nagricultural disasters, such as large-scale\
    \ diseases and insect pests, floods, fires, etc. Regarding \nsome existing ICT\
    \ sensor networks deployed in farms, the way they work is still to wait until\
    \ \nsymptoms appear so that the disease can be detected. Such systems do not qualify\
    \ as early \nwarning systems in detecting disease and pests (Datir & Wagh, 2014).\
    \ \n3.4.5 Fault tolerance \nIn ICT sensor networks, it is normal for one of the\
    \ hundreds of thousands of nodes to \nfail. Common causes include power exhaustion,\
    \ communication failure, and sensor module \nfailure. At this time, the most important\
    \ thing is to design a set of topological structures with \nstrong fault tolerance,\
    \ to prevent the entire network from collapsing due to a failed node(Jawad, \n\
    \ \n19 \nNordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017). Apart from solving this problem\
    \ from the \nperspective of network topology, some further improvement on the\
    \ combination of nodes \narchitecture and the network can be done as well. Geeta\
    \ et al.(2013) suggested a possible way \nof improvement. A single sensor node\
    \ should have the capability to send early alert to its \nneighbour node when\
    \ its battery is low or when it gets external interference, offering the \nnetwork\
    \ with enough time to adjust a transmission route to avoid network collapse. Hang\
    \ et \nal.(2015)designed a three-tiered unmanned aerial vehicle sensor network\
    \ for capturing \ninformation from farmland. This architecture realizes the extension\
    \ of the life of sensor nodes \nby reducing the transmission tasks of sensor nodes\
    \ in WSN. It enhances the data collection \nefficiency and life of the entire\
    \ system by enhancing the function of relay nodes and power \nsupply, reducing\
    \ resource consumption caused by transmission node failures, and improving \n\
    the network communication quality provided by mobile nodes. \n3.4.6 Data management\
    \ \nAgricultural monitoring practices generate large amounts of data because multiple\
    \ \nWSNs in agricultural applications include multiple crop sensor growth analysis\
    \ and harvest \nestimates. This situation requires the base station to monitor\
    \ and change farmland through \nanalysis mode. Therefore, base stations must support\
    \ high levels of storage capacity (Jawad et \nal., 2017). \n3.5 Review of ICT\
    \ sensor networks in agriculture \nDigital farming is the practice of modern technologies\
    \ such as sensors, robotics, and \ndata analysis for shifting from tedious operations\
    \ to continuously automated processes \n(Shamshiri et al., 2018). The terms digital\
    \ farming and precision agriculture are often used to \ndescribe the same concept\
    \ in many current contexts, but they are not the same thing. The \nconcept of\
    \ precision agriculture (PA) has been proposed for ages. At the very beginning,\
    \ PA \nwas mainly focused on the matching of environmental factors such as insitu\
    \ climate, soil \nproperty, and crop species (Krishna, 2016). \nInnovation in\
    \ digital farming occurs where the crops interact with their external \nenvironment,\
    \ for example, the physical, biological, and chemical components (Es van & \n\
    Woodard, 2017). Therefore, inspiration for innovations could be derived from the\
    \ factors that \naffect crop productivity. Lazarcik (1963) developed a term output-input\
    \ ratio for measuring \n \n20 \nproductivity. This ratio is about the relationship\
    \ of agricultural output to all production inputs \nused to produce that output.\
    \ It measures average aggregate productivity of all inputs together \n(operating\
    \ expenses, depreciation, interest on capital and cost of labor). It indicates\
    \ that in order \nto increase the productivity in agriculture, measures aiming\
    \ for both higher output and smaller \ninput should be taken. \nThere have been\
    \ many achievements in using wireless sensor networks in farms to \nmonitor the\
    \ environmental factors that affect crop yield, including but not limited to soil\
    \ \nmoisture, temperature, pH value, soil microbes load. Kalaivani et al. (2011)surveyed\
    \ ZigBee-\nbased wireless sensor networks in agriculture, which covers the features\
    \ and some drawbacks \nof the application of ZigBee in agribusiness. This transmission\
    \ protocol has good capability of \ntransmitting data with few losses within its\
    \ complimentary range, with low power consumption, \nprice and deployment difficulty.\
    \ However, the transmission quality can be significantly \nimpaired as the distance\
    \ changes and vegetable canopy keeps growing. The reason is that there \nis a\
    \ significant gray zone which is a range of distance between transmitter and receiver\
    \ where \nthe transmission doesn't work, and if the route between transmitter\
    \ and receiver is physically \nblocked by plant canopy, the connection would be\
    \ disturbed and closed (Kalaivani , Allirani, & \nPriya, 2011). \nYadav et al.\
    \ (2012)described a method to use wireless sensor networks to ensure that \neveryone\
    \ has enough food in some developing areas. In this study, wireless sensor networks\
    \ \nwere used to monitor the life cycle of food from producing stage to sales\
    \ stage. This monitoring \nprocess includes establishing a database by mapping\
    \ agricultural production and food shortages, \nconstructing efficient ways of\
    \ communication during emergency, monitoring real-time \nagricultural conditions\
    \ and sending an alert if an indicator meets its threshold. \nOjha et al.(2015)reviewed\
    \ various applications of WSNs in an agricultural context. \nThey divided wireless\
    \ sensor networks into two types according to different scenarios, which \nare\
    \ Terrestrial WSNs and Underground WSNs. They also listed some potential applications\
    \ \nsuch as automated irrigation scheduling for saving water, maintaining an optimized\
    \ \nenvironment for higher plant growth, monitoring cattle activities and ground\
    \ water quality to \nensure the cattle are staying in an appropriate environment\
    \ and location, simulating greenhouse \ngas distribution, and agricultural production\
    \ processing monitoring. These applications indicate \n \n21 \nthe feasibility\
    \ of utilizing ICT sensor network technologies in farms to improve production\
    \ by \ncreating optimal environment for crops. \nZhao et al. (2010) designed a\
    \ greenhouse environment monitoring system using IoT \ntechnology. This system\
    \ can control the on-site environment in real time according to the needs \nof\
    \ plants for temperature and humidity. Also, it’s able to collect a large amount\
    \ of \nenvironmental data and send it to research institutions for further processing\
    \ and analysis. \nDholu and Ghodinde (2018)created a similar IoT-based system\
    \ which can sense necessary \nparameters from the environment and make the necessary\
    \ decisions to control an actuator for \nirrigation. \nThe application of the\
    \ Internet of Things in agriculture is not limited to reading \nenvironmental\
    \ parameters and then taking corresponding irrigation or fertilization measures.\
    \ \nThe information collected by smart devices in the Internet of Things can be\
    \ accurately analyzed \nto improve agricultural productivity. Elijah et al.(2018)classified\
    \ the analysis into the following \ncategories. \nPrediction. The huge quantity\
    \ of environmental data such as moisture and temperature \ncollected by sensor\
    \ nodes and other smart devices in an IoT network can be used to develop \npredictive\
    \ algorithms to notify when diseases, drought, flood or fire is about to happen.\
    \ \nInventory management. In terms of storing agriproducts, external moisture\
    \ and \ntemperature can influence the quality of products significantly. In this\
    \ scenario, sensor nodes \nare deployed in inventory to collect this information.\
    \ After the data analysis has been sent to the \ncloud and analysis has been conducted,\
    \ automatic command will be sent for adjusting the \ncondition of inventory. This\
    \ practice can reduce the negative influence of spoilage and pests on \nfood quality.\
    \ \nDecision making. Big data obtained from sensors provides learning opportunities\
    \ to \nimprove decision-making for changing environmental conditions. An ideal\
    \ outcome of this \nanalysis is automatic decision-making by IoT systems involving\
    \ few human interventions, \nwhich could set the workers free from repetitive\
    \ work. \nInsurance. Agricultural activities are vulnerable to natural disasters.\
    \ IoT devices \ndeployed in remote areas can notify farmers or insurance companies\
    \ when a hazard or disaster \n \n22 \nis detected, reminding them to settle claims.\
    \ When extreme weather or another condition is \ndetected, access to information\
    \ by an insurance company can allow the company to make \nautomatic direct payment\
    \ to policyholders, initiated by the IoT system (Elijah, Rahman, \nOrikumhi, Leow,\
    \ & Hindia, 2018). \nUtilizing ICT sensor networks for collecting data from farmland\
    \ assists the farmers to \nmatch cropping practices to climatic trends, to use\
    \ inputs and resources more sustainably and \nreduce environmental impact, and\
    \ to cope with productivity threats. Moreover, it can enable \npublic officials\
    \ to integrate the data across the country and to adjust policies to reflect the\
    \ data \ncollected, to predict food supplies, and to target social programs or\
    \ promote yield technologies \n(World Bank, 2017). \n3.6 How do crops interact\
    \ with the external environment? \n3.6.1 Environmental factors \nWater and temperature\
    \ \nUnfavorable water and thermal conditions could sharply reduce crop yields.\
    \ For \nexample, excessively high temperature proved to have negative effect on\
    \ the yield of maize \n(Carter et al., 2016) and at the same time low-temperature\
    \ stress may damage photosynthesis \n(Oquist, 1983).Excessive high or low temperature\
    \ would impede the activity of enzymes, and \naffect the efficiency of metabolism\
    \ of plants.  \nAgriculture is one of the major consumer industries in the world\
    \ (Cazadilla et al., 2010). \nTwo aspects related to water consumption should\
    \ be considered, the direct effects of water \ncontent on crop growth, and the\
    \ economic cost of using water. In agribusiness, the term water \nproductivity\
    \ (WP), defined as the amount of yield produced per unit volume of water (\U0001D458\
    \U0001D454/\U0001D45A3), \nis often used to assess the efficiency of water usage\
    \ (Patil et al., 2015). Therefore, higher yield \nwith smaller water input can\
    \ be regarded as success in improving the productivity of crops. \nRespiration\
    \ by soil microorganisms can increase with increasing irrigation under water stress,\
    \ \nbut excessive irrigation can suppress soil respiration under the condition\
    \ of flooding (Wang, \nZhao, & Ouyang, 2010). For the crops, changes in atmospheric\
    \ moisture can alter the way their \nstomata work, and in turn the process of\
    \ plant transpiration, energy balance and tissue \ntemperatures (Grantz, 1990).\
    \ In some cases, the combination of high temperature and high \n \n23 \nvapor\
    \ pressure deficits could result in crops wilting when the water that crops take\
    \ up from soil \ncannot make up for the evaporation loss into the air (Carter,\
    \ Melkonian, Riha, & Shaw, 2016).  \nSoil nutrients \nSoil nutrients can be divided\
    \ into three types according to the amount that plants need \nduring for growth:\
    \ primary nutrients, secondary nutrients and micro-nutrients (Moore & \nBradley,\
    \ 2018). Fertilizer can be considered as a supplement to the original deficiencies\
    \ in the \nsoil, and the amount of fertilizers added to the soil should be precisely\
    \ calculated and controlled. \nN, P, and K are the most limiting factors in crop\
    \ production (primary nutrients) (Warpe & \nPippal, 2016).However, excessive application\
    \ of N-P-K fertilizers would lead to degradation of \nboth soil and water quality,\
    \ and production of crops. For example, nitrate leaching from the \nirrigated\
    \ farmland may move to lakes and groundwater, and then result in eutrophication\
    \ in \nlakes and nitrogen pollution in groundwater (Ju et al., 2007; Savci, 2012).\
    \ This practice in \ncontrolling the volume and usage of fertilizer is coined\
    \ as fertilizer management, which takes \nenvironmental, agronomic and economic\
    \ effects into consideration (Matson, Naylor, & Ortiz-\nMonasterio, 1998). \n\
    Soil pH \nA major issue regarding soil pH in agribusiness is soil acidity, resulting\
    \ from diverse \ncauses. For example, the parent rock material may enter soil\
    \ or groundwater due to weathering \n(Xu, 2015). Another cause of acidification\
    \ emerging in recent decades is the excessive use of \nchemical fertilizers. Common\
    \ chemicals found in artificial fertilizers, including ammonium \nsulfate, ammonium\
    \ phosphate, potassium nitrate, and ammonium nitrate have proven to be able \n\
    to lead to increase in H+ concentration in farmland soil (Pierre, 1928). A direct\
    \ effect of higher \nconcentration of H+ on soil is that activities and metabolism\
    \ of the microbes in soil could be \naffected. Altered soil pH may create conditions\
    \ that are less optimal for microbes or plants. \nExtreme pH could even inactivate\
    \ them. Some researchers have demonstrated the correlation \nbetween the soil\
    \ enzyme activity and crop yield (Tautges, Sullivan, Reardon, & Burke, 2016).\
    \ \nThere is another indirect effect that H+ could have on the soil. Higher concentration\
    \ of H+ \ncould change the form in which aluminum (and other metals) exist in\
    \ soil, and can increase the \n \n24 \nsolubility of Al+3in soil pore water (Gazey\
    \ & Azam, 2018). Excessive aluminum can lead to \nthe death of aquatic organisms,\
    \ the wilting of terrestrial plants, the reduction of crop yields, and \nthe decline\
    \ of forests (Weng, Huang, Liu, & Sato, 2000). Research conducted by Abruña-\n\
    Rodríguezet al. (1982) showed that higher concentrations of H+ and Al+3, decreased\
    \ the yield \nof crops like yam and cassava relative to their maximum yield. \
    \ \nSoil microbes \n \nSoil microbes consist of the fungi and bacteria in soil.\
    \ Soil microbes maintain or alter \nthe microscopic soil physical and chemical\
    \ properties by their metabolic activities, including \nthe soil properties in\
    \ the plant rhizosphere, influencing the efficiency with which plants are able\
    \ \nto utilize the soil nutrients (Sessitsch & Mitter, 2015). There is increasing\
    \ evidence that \nbiotechnology using microbes or their metabolites can enhance\
    \ nutrient uptake and yield of \ncrops, control pests and reduce plant stress\
    \ responses (Trivedi, Schenk, Wallenstein, & Singh, \n2017). At the same time,\
    \ research conducted by Gu et al. (2009)showed that a combination N-\nP-K fertilizer\
    \ could increase soil microbial biomass, diversify bacterial communities, and\
    \ \nmaintain crop production.  \nSoil depth \nResearch conducted by Khakural et\
    \ al.(1996)shows that the fertility of deeper soil can \ncontribute much to crop\
    \ yield than the fertility of topsoil. Williams et al. (1999) found that \nunder\
    \ sub-optimal living conditions, the properties of topsoil are definitely important\
    \ for \npredicting crop yield, while the properties of subsoil are relatively\
    \ more important in limiting \ncrop yields under normal conditions (Williams,\
    \ Ahuja, Naney, Ross, & Barnes, 1987). \nFarmland slope \n \nFarmland in sloping\
    \ area tends to have a thinner layer of soil (Atherton, Morgan, \nShearer, Stombaugh,\
    \ & Ward, 1999). Steep slopes are more vulnerable to soil erosion, therefore \n\
    soil layer on the slope is usually thinner, and the soil water content and soil\
    \ fertility are also \nrelatively poor (Mohammadi, Jalali, Kooch, & Said-Pullicino,\
    \ 2016), although Yang et \nal.(1998)found that the slope of farmland can have\
    \ a positively significant relationship with \nyield of wheat. \n \n25 \n3.7 Cultural\
    \ factors \n \nCommon cultural practices in agriculture include irrigation patterns,\
    \ fertilizer \napplication, planting spacing and density, intensity of various\
    \ routine agricultural practices, and \nharvesting time. The mechanism by which\
    \ some of these practices is able to influence crop \nyield is by modifying the\
    \ availability of sunlight (Atherton, Morgan, Shearer, Stombaugh, & \nWard, 1999).\
    \ Pathiratna et al.(2004)conducted several experiments to study the effects of\
    \ \nfertilizer, spacing and shade on the growth and yield of Aerva lanata. Results\
    \ from these \nexperiments showed that crops treated with organic and inorganic\
    \ fertilizers could produce \nhigher dry matter yields. Crops established with\
    \ a closer spacing have lower yield and growth \nthan those with wider planting\
    \ spacing, if yield per area is not considered. Ashraf and Saeed \n(2006) compared\
    \ two different irrigation methods in an area with saline groundwater. The \n\
    result shows that root zone of the crops which are treated with alternative, reduced-frequency\
    \ \nfurrow irrigation has smaller accumulation of salt than that with regular\
    \ furrow irrigation \n(Ashraf & Saeed, 2006). The planting date of a crop is fundamental\
    \ information for the \nmodeling of planting activities. It can be calculated\
    \ based on historical weather information \n(Dobor et al., 2016). Research conducted\
    \ by Kucharik (2008) in the United States shows that \nthe planting date, especially\
    \ the timing of planting the seeds has a significant impact on yield of \nmaize.\
    \ \nApart from the factors above, Krebs (1984)mentioned that there are some major\
    \ ways \nthat crops yield can be improved, including (1) improved quality of crop\
    \ varieties, (2) improved \nresistance to diseases, (3) improved resistance to\
    \ insects, and (4) adaptation to climatic \ncondition. \nThese known factors provide\
    \ direction for researchers and farm operators to improve \ncrops yield and labor\
    \ productivity. Among these factors, soil properties that can be measured by \n\
    sensors include soil moisture, concentration of specific ions required for plant\
    \ growth, and soil \nelectrical conductivity. Lab test and insitu measurements\
    \ on these soil properties of their \ncorresponding sensors are well matched.\
    \ However, for a lot of soil nutrients and soil organic \nmatter, there are not\
    \ reliable sensors for measurement.  \n \n26 \n3.8 Integration of sensor networks\
    \ with other ICT products for boosting production in \nagriculture \nAgriculture\
    \ is an important sector for the continuous growth of developing countries, \n\
    especially large agricultural countries. More than 80% of those who live in remote\
    \ areas are \nengaged in agriculture. The World Bank provided a guideline to guarantee\
    \ the security of \nreliable and stable access to nutritious, affordable food,\
    \ with access resilient to climate change. \nAs the World Bank pointed out in\
    \ a report, increasing the output of the agriculture, forestry, \nanimal husbandry\
    \ and fishery industries requires: 1) utilizing insitu technologies to characterize\
    \ \nfield conditions, in order to provide the optimal resources for plant growth.\
    \ These farming \npractices, after optimization, would result in more sustainable\
    \ and profitable farming; 2) \neliminating yield losses through early warning\
    \ systems. This revolves around identifying the \ninfection, disease, and upcoming\
    \ bad weather. \nMost farmers have access to the means of production and yield\
    \ enhancing technologies \nthat can help them increase their crop yields, such\
    \ as fertilizers and pesticides. Meanwhile, \nsometimes they do not know how to\
    \ use these products in a proper way. Although these \nproducts are usually equipped\
    \ with instructions, different application scenarios always have \ndifferent applicable\
    \ standards, with no universal standard practice. In this case, ICT technology\
    \ \ncan fill the gap of farmers' knowledge. With the help of ICT farmers can use\
    \ the optimal \nsolution for consuming resources in agriculture(World Bank, 2017).\
    \ \nIn agricultural production, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are often used\
    \ in \nconjunction with ICT sensor networks. UAV is very suitable for spraying\
    \ pesticides and \nfertilizers due to its high speed and spraying efficiency (Costa\
    \ et al., 2012). However, as is \nmentioned in Faiçal et al.’s work(2014), the\
    \ working route of a UAV spraying pesticides or \nfertilizer is prone to being\
    \ disturbed by wind.The architecture and workflow of Costa’s \nUAV+sensor networks\
    \ monitoring system was similar to that of Faiçal et al.The UAV has to \ncommunicate\
    \ with sensor nodes on the ground periodically to make sure that it’s in the proper\
    \ \nlocation (Costa et al., 2012). \nZhang et al. (2015) designed a three-tiered\
    \ UAV farmland sensor network (TUFSN) for \ncapturing information. Figure 2is\
    \ an illustration of their network architecture. The data \ncollection layer on\
    \ the ground is where the distributed sensor network can monitor the external\
    \ \n \n27 \nenvironment and grab information. In this layer, a large number of\
    \ sensor nodes are deployed to \nstrengthen the monitoring of a target data collecting\
    \ area. Another feature of this layer is self-\norganization. Layered protocols\
    \ and distributed algorithms allow wireless sensor nodes to \nautonomously schedule\
    \ their work processes. When deployed to a specific area and activated, \nthe\
    \ corresponding network can be organized automatically. The relay transmission\
    \ layer \nconsists of a network established between the relay node and the UAV\
    \ mobile node. This layer \nhas the following characteristics: 1) simple structure:\
    \ direct communication between UAV and \nthe data collection layer; 2) more energy\
    \ available: the data collection layer is generally \npowered by solar energy\
    \ so that UAV can be powered by rechargeable batteries; 3) stable and \nreliable:\
    \ UAV communicates with the ground data collection layer in the air. The possibility\
    \ of \nbeing blocked by plants or houses in the middle is low, and the packet\
    \ loss rate will be reduced; \n4) Long communication distance: the communication\
    \ quality is good, and it can provide larger \npower antenna coverage. The mobile\
    \ convergence layer consists of a single or multiple UAVs \nand a network established\
    \ between data centres. UAV and data centres are directly connected \nby a cellular\
    \ data network. The mobile convergence layer network has a very long \ncommunication\
    \ distance, has error detection and packet loss retransmission functions, and\
    \ \nsupports real-time or delayed data transmission. Compared with the traditional\
    \ static WSN, in \nterms of economic efficiency, this architecture is more suitable\
    \ for scattered land, hills and \nmountains, and the ground wireless sensor network\
    \ has difficulty or is unable to form a \ncomplete network due to natural environment\
    \ constraints. They are divided into multiple \nindependent networks. The limitation\
    \ of this system is that flight missions are performed only \nwhen data are needed,\
    \ so the frequency of UAV flights determines the frequency of data \nupdates (Zhang\
    \ et al., 2015). \n \n28 \n \nFigure 2. Three-tiered UAV farmland sensor network\
    \ by Zhang et al. (2015) \nApart from the sensor networks studied in this article,\
    \ image-based techniques are \nanother major part of the ICT solutions applied\
    \ in agriculture. Remote sensing is a hit. In \ngeneral, remote sensing technology\
    \ refers to acquiring image information about an object in a \nnon-invasive way,\
    \ without actually coming into contact with it, from a physically high altitude\
    \ \nand a macro perspective (Horning, 2008). \nWhen applied to agriculture, the\
    \ major role of remote sensing technology is to collect \nraw data from farmland.\
    \ The methods of obtaining data and the form of data from mobile \nphones include\
    \ aerial images taken by airplane, helicopter, radio-controlled aircraft, and\
    \ \nunmanned aerial vehicles; satellite images captured by satellites in orbit;\
    \ surface GPS receivers \nand satellite linkage to obtain positioning information;\
    \ laser scanning, using a set of laser beams \nto measure accurate elevation,\
    \ i.e. the distance from an aircraft to features on the ground, \npruning the\
    \ disturbance of trees and buildings on the ground. This means that when measuring\
    \ \nthe elevation of sensing aircraft, ground elevation under tree canopy can\
    \ be measured (World \nBank, 2017).After data are collected by remote sensing\
    \ technology, the following analytic tools \nare used to provide a deeper understanding\
    \ of the farmland system being studied. With spatial \nmodeling, existing data\
    \ can be used to simulate the real-world farmland. Using data mining \ntechniques,\
    \ patterns of crops, such as their growth rate characteristics can be extracted\
    \ from the \ndata set. \n \n29 \nThe workflow of collecting and analysing image-based\
    \ data has been widely used in \nagriculture. Reinecke and Prinsloo(2017)designed\
    \ a system, using drones to capture aerial \nphotos of plant leaf. These data\
    \ were used to determine whether the crops were healthy. \nHonkavaara et al.(2013)used\
    \ drones to take aerial images at pre-set time intervals at the \nbeginning of\
    \ the crop growing season, during the season, and before harvest to check the\
    \ \ngrowth of the entire field and highlight growth stagnation caused by insufficient\
    \ irrigation or \nlow initial nitrogen content. Biossard et al. (2008)provided\
    \ a technique based on automatic \ninterpretation applied to images of rose leaves\
    \ scanned in situ. They propose a cognitive vision \nsystem that combines image\
    \ processing, learning, and knowledge-based technologies. The \nsystem is able\
    \ to detect and count white flies (Trialeurode Vaporariorum Westwood) at \nmaturity.\
    \ This technology provides early warning for pest management so that measures\
    \ can be \ntaken to reduce losses before the pests become severe.  \nApplication\
    \ of remote sensing technology is not limited to identifying bad weather, \nplant\
    \ disease and pests. On a smaller scale, this technology is widely used on individual\
    \ crops, \nsuch as for classification of vegetables, fruits, and livestock. Traditionally,\
    \ the classification \nwork is often finished by the human workers who are well\
    \ trained and experienced. However, \nthere are some disadvantages to relying\
    \ on the human workforce for classification. For example, \nthe classifying worker\
    \ may feel tired or lose concentration and then lower the accuracy of \nclassification.\
    \ Ideally, there should be a standard diagram for the workers to refer to when\
    \ \nclassifying, which will increase difficulty of work. Also, raters are prone\
    \ to various illusions \n(Barbedo, 2013). Therefore, image processing techniques\
    \ are needed for these tasks to relieve \nworkload.  \nGastelum-Barrios et al.(2011)reviewed\
    \ newly emergent non-invasive image processing \nmethods in determining the quality\
    \ of fruits during and after the harvesting period, and \nconcluded that it is\
    \ a high-efficiency and harmless solution to grade the fruits. Singh et al. \n\
    (2011)customized an automated classifier of four different bamboo species based\
    \ on shape \nfeatures of bamboo Culm sheath, using the central moment classifier.\
    \ Their classifier for \nbamboo shows considerable recognition accuracy, which\
    \ has great potential on saving labour of \nmanually recognizing bamboo species.\
    \ This outcome proved the possibility of putting this \ntechnology into commercial\
    \ use. Latha et al.(2014) implemented an image processing function \n \n30 \n\
    to detect weed areas. Once the function was equipped onto pesticide sprayers,\
    \ the automatic \nsprayers can target these blocks covered by weed. This not only\
    \ saves pesticides, but also \navoids generating agricultural waste, and additional\
    \ effects on the environment and other plants \ncaused by excessive use. \nPatil\
    \ (2011) designed a measuring method for leaf area based on image processing \n\
    techniques. A traditional graphic measuring method was used to verify the accuracy\
    \ of \nmeasuring leaf area using image processing. The new method proved to have\
    \ high precision \nand accuracy and take less processing time. This result provided\
    \ a theoretical basis for the \ndevelopment of an imagery leaf area meter that\
    \ meets the requirements of precision farming. \nXu et al. (2011)developed an\
    \ algorithm that can tell whether the plants are suffering \nfrom nutrient deficiency,\
    \ by recognizing the color and texture of the leaf. The accuracy of this \ndiagnostic\
    \ algorithm was above 82.5% and it was able to diagnose disease 6–10 days before\
    \ \nexperts could determine it. Arakeri et al. (2015)implemented a system which\
    \ provided early \nwarning to detect diseases on tomatoes. Tomatoes are very prone\
    \ to a disease called late blight, \nwhich happens when leaves get infected with\
    \ Phytophthora infestans fungus. Typical \nsymptoms of fungus infection include\
    \ irregularly shaped leaves and water-soaked lesions. This \nalert system was\
    \ able to recognize whether a leaf was ill or healthy, and whether the leaf had\
    \ \ncontracted the Phytophthora infestans fungus. The accuracy of analyzing the\
    \ late blight disease \nwas 84%. Chen et al. (2014)proposed an effective method\
    \ for judging the nutrient content of \ncrops. They extracted characteristic parameters\
    \ from years of images of healthy leaves and \nnutritionally deficient leaves.\
    \ They were able to determine from an image of a rice leaf whether \nthe plant\
    \ was deficient in N, P, and K based on the attributes of leaf sheath length,\
    \ leaf area / \nleaf length, leaf tip, leaf lightness, etc. The average identification\
    \ accuracy of this method for \nassessing N/P/K deficiencies was around 88%.In\
    \ 2019, Chen et al. optimized the algorithm of \nthis detection method, and the\
    \ average accuracy of recognition increased to 93.4%. \nApplication of image-based\
    \ technologies is not limited to crop assessment; it is \napplicable in animal\
    \ husbandry as well. Image processing systems have been widely used in \nmonitoring\
    \ livestock for many applications, including identification, tracking, behavior\
    \ analysis, \noccupancy rates, and activity calculations. Kashiha et al. (2014)designed\
    \ an image processing \nsystem for checking whether hens were staying inside the\
    \ chambers. This system could save \n \n31 \nmuch time on manually analysing videos\
    \ for monitoring hen chambers. Pradana et al. \n(2016)designed a method to accurately\
    \ estimate the weight of cattle, by visually measuring the \nbody length, chest\
    \ circumstance, height and width. Wongsriworaphon et al. (2012)conducted \nsimilar\
    \ research, but their focus was to recognize individual pigs based on their size\
    \ and weight. \nAppendix Table A2 from Gong (2010) compares the differences of\
    \ the node sensors \nfrom the perspective of price, reliability, performance and\
    \ power consumption. This table also \nlists some environmental parameters that\
    \ can be measured by available sensors, such as \ntemperature, carbon dioxide\
    \ concentration, and relative humidity. \n3.9 A case study illustrating use of\
    \ UAV and ICT sensor networks in sustainable agriculture \nThe system Faiçal et\
    \ al. (2014)designed for the linkage of unmanned aerial vehicles \n(UAV) and ICT\
    \ sensor networks for spraying pesticides is a typical application in agriculture,\
    \ \nand is described in detail in subsections below to illustrate the use. \n\
    3.9.1 Research background \n \nSpraying pesticides and fertilizers in farmland\
    \ is vital for crop yields. Aircrafts are \nbecoming more common and popular for\
    \ this task, mainly because of the speed and efficiency \nof aircraft spray operations.\
    \ However, certain factors may reduce yield and even cause damage. \nFor example,\
    \ the spraying process might miss some crop areas, repeat spraying in the same\
    \ \ncrop area, and apply pesticides to the outer edges of the farmland. This study\
    \ proposed an \narchitecture based on unmanned aerial vehicles that could be employed\
    \ to implement a control \nloop for agricultural applications with UAVs responsible\
    \ for spraying chemicals on crops. An \nalgorithm to adjust the UAV’s motion routes\
    \ when confronted with constantly changing wind \nwas also assessed in this work.\
    \ \n3.9.2 Methods and procedure \n \nIn this solution, an unmanned aerial vehicle\
    \ and several sensor nodes are deployed in \nthe farmland. The function of the\
    \ sensor mainly includes obtaining the current concentration of \nthe pesticide\
    \ chemical from the soil. Sensor nodes also communicate with the drone in the\
    \ air at \nany time to help the UAV verify its real-time position to avoid crossing\
    \ a boundary and \nspraying where it should not, or spraying an area repeatedly,\
    \ resulting in excessively high \n \n32 \nconcentrations of pesticides in a small\
    \ area causing damage to the crop. If the sensor detects \nexcess chemicals, the\
    \ drone in the air will be directed away from this area of excessive \nconcentration.\
    \ The role of the drone is relatively simple, it receives the concentration \n\
    information on the ground and judges whether it is necessary to spray. \nThe researchers\
    \ used the following steps to ensure that UAV sprayed pesticides where \nappropriate.\
    \ (1) The algorithm sends a message periodically to query sensor nodes scattered\
    \ \nthroughout the farmland. A sensor node located at a previous location of the\
    \ drone responds to \nthis message with information about the amount of pesticide.\
    \ (2) With this information, the \ndrone can calculate the difference in pesticide\
    \ concentration between each sensor node. (3) If \nthe difference is larger than\
    \ the predetermined threshold, the algorithm will re-plan the route, \notherwise\
    \ it will continue to advance in the predefined path and wait for the next round\
    \ of query. \nRegarding the robustness of this proposed algorithm for spraying\
    \ pesticides, the following \naspects were assessed. \nCalibration of UAV routes.\
    \ An unmanned aerial vehicle is influenced by wind when it is \nworking. A dataset\
    \ containing information about wind direction and intensity was used to \nreproduce\
    \ the constantly changing weather conditions, and check if the UAV was able to\
    \ \nhandle the changes. Also, considering the nature of the linkage of ICT sensor\
    \ network and \nUAV in this project, whether the number of message exchanges between\
    \ the two terminals \nwould improve performance was evaluated. \nMapping the pesticide\
    \ concentration. ICT sensor networks provide location information \nand information\
    \ on chemical concentrations to the UAV. However, in practice, crops may not \n\
    get the appropriate amount of pesticide. Possible reasons are the UAV may be flying\
    \ too fast, or \nthe pesticide spraying process may be disturbed by wind. Therefore,\
    \ given the information \nabout nodes location and their corresponding chemical\
    \ concentration, a complete map of \npesticide concentration distribution can\
    \ be drawn. A heat map is an illustration of pesticide \ndistribution, where green\
    \ represents higher concentrations, and red low concentrations (Figure \n3). For\
    \ the spraying system in this study, an ideal outcome is that each node of it\
    \ has the same \nor similar color. \n \n33 \n \nFigure 3. Map after the application\
    \ of the interpolation technique (Faiçal et al., 2014) \nPotential correlation\
    \ between UAV height and spray coverage. Researchers speculate \nthat drones need\
    \ to fly to a certain altitude when spraying to get the best spray effect. There\
    \ \nmay be a relationship between the spray angle / coverage and the height of\
    \ the drone, meaning \nthat the higher the UAV’s altitude, the larger the area\
    \ covered by the spray may be. \n3.9.3 Case study results \n \nFigure 4is a map\
    \ of pesticide concentrations after actual testing. Higher uniform the \ncolors\
    \ of this map represents higher stability and robustness of the algorithm, and\
    \ this feature \nlets the vehicle to be more resistant to wind disturbance. Most\
    \ areas of the farmland were \nsprayed with similar concentrations of pesticides,\
    \ leaving only several small clusters with \ninsufficient pesticide concentrations.\
    \ Researchers assessed the relationship between time \nrequired for communicating\
    \ with sensor nodes on the ground and height of the UAV, and the \ncorrelation\
    \ turned out to be insignificant. \n \nFigure 4. Map after the application of\
    \ the threshold value (Faiçal et al., 2014) \n3.9.4 Case study summary \nThis\
    \ project provided a practical example of the combination of ICT sensor networks\
    \ \nand some other ICT solutions, aiming to make agricultural activities to be\
    \ more precise. \nAccording to the result of assessing with simulation tools,\
    \ the algorithm designed for the \ncollaboration between UAV and ICT sensor networks\
    \ proved to work well. After further insitu \ntesting procedures, it would be\
    \ possible to utilize the system to improve sustainability in crop \nproduction\
    \ (Faiçal et al., 2014). \n \n \n34 \n4. Methodology \nThis study consists of\
    \ two parts designed to answer the research questions. The first part \nis to\
    \ simulate the performance (which is indicated by annual yield in this study)\
    \ of a farm where \nICT sensor networks are deployed. The second part is to conduct\
    \ a meta-analysis on the \noutcomes of existing studies and publications. \n4.1\
    \ Data sources \nData and information for this study were collected by two major\
    \ means, (1) published \nacademic papers that discussed the change in crop yield\
    \ of specific ICT sensor networks-based \nfarms; and (2) contacting the companies\
    \ who provide ICT sensor networks solutions for details \nof how the solutions\
    \ they provide work and performance data of their service. \n4.1.1 Samples overview\
    \ \n \nThis study examines how the annual crop yield would change, when ICT sensor\
    \ \nnetworks are deployed to control usage of water, fertilizer, and pesticide.\
    \ Therefore, the sample \nfarms in this study all use ICT sensor networks to control\
    \ one or more of these agricultural \nresource usages. Figure shows the distribution\
    \ of where the selected farms are located. The \ninvolved crop types in this study\
    \ include maize, grape, rice. \n \nFigure 5. Geographical distribution of the\
    \ farms involved \n \nYara Water Solution is a part of a Farm Management System\
    \ offered by Yara Inc.in \nNorway, which can enable the farmers to save irrigation\
    \ water. This solution provides a \ncontinuous and non-destructive way of measuring\
    \ plant status. It uses sensors to measure the \nNorth America, 36%\nEurope, 36%\n\
    Asia, 8%\nAustralia, 16%\nSouth America, 4%\n \n35 \nturgor pressure of the plants’\
    \ leaves to determine if plants are deficient in water, and then \nmakes a decision\
    \ on whether to irrigate. The service provider of Yara Water Solution claims \n\
    that with this solution, the irrigation water consumption would drop by 20% while\
    \ yield \nincreases by 15%. Also, this solution will help save maintenance work\
    \ and corresponding \nenergy consumed (Yara, 2018). \nAtfarm (2018) monitors the\
    \ growth of fields with images taken remotely from satellite. \nIt makes it possible\
    \ for users to compare with images from previous years and to benchmark the \n\
    development of crops. Its performance of saving resources and boosting crop yield\
    \ is similar to \nYara (Atfarm, 2018). \nAccenture has been providing digital-based\
    \ farm services to farm owners for years. \nThese services are helping to improve\
    \ financial performance and to boost yield. Accenture \nDigital Agriculture Services\
    \ can help both large and small farms use digital technology to \nimprove processes,\
    \ increase yields and increase profitability to meet growing global food \ndemand\
    \ and to reduce the overall environmental impact of agriculture. Digital Agriculture\
    \ \nService can help increase overall profitability by $55 to $110 per acre (Accenture,\
    \ 2017). \nThe Field Manager created by Xarvio digital farming solutions supports\
    \ the users to \nknow better about the farmland they are working. The Manager\
    \ can provide real-time \ninformation of water and nutrition and can generate\
    \ a map for better visualization. Spray Timer \nis a product of the Field Manager\
    \ scheme. As is stated on the official website, Spray Timer can \nsave the amount\
    \ of pesticide application by up to 30% (Xarvio Digital FArming Solutions, \n\
    2020). \nDSS4Ag is an expert system for precision farming research. This system\
    \ uses advanced \nartificial intelligence and computer science technology to make\
    \ spatially variable fertilizer use \nand economically optimal decisions for specific\
    \ locations. Field testing was conducted in a \nwheat farmland, and the result\
    \ showed a 39.7% cost saving using the DSS4Ag as compared to \nthose blocks managed\
    \ by the farm’s traditional uniform applications practices, with only a 3.3% \n\
    decrease in yield (Hoskinson, Hess, & Fink, 1999). \nWhiteley implemented a precision\
    \ farming technology to monitor and control pesticide \napplication. The research\
    \ found that the estimated saving on pesticide can be as much as 80% \nof the\
    \ original application (Whiteley, 2002). \n \n36 \nA closed-loop, distributed\
    \ control and data acquisition system for site-specific irrigation \nmanagement\
    \ was introduced and developed by Wang & Li (2013). The system is formed by a\
    \ \ngroup of stationary field sensing nodes deployed in a field and a group of\
    \ nodes, called P2K \nnodes. These nodes collected the data from the field and\
    \ the central pivot system and \ntransmitted them to a master controller through\
    \ a power-line carrier communication. The \nsystem performance was compared with\
    \ a conventional uniform irrigation treatment in a potato \nfield. Results showed\
    \ that, with essentially equal water consumption, the tuber yield under site-\n\
    specific irrigation management was significantly greater, by about 4%, than the\
    \ yield from \nuniform irrigation (Wang & Li, 2013). \nBongiovanni and Lowenberg-DeBoer\
    \ (2004)summarized the research carried out by \nWeisz et al.(1996)regarding the\
    \ performance of ICT sensor networks in controlling the amount \nof pesticide\
    \ applied in a commercial potato farmland. With the site-specific pest management\
    \ \nprogram, the input amount of pesticide in this experimental area dropped by\
    \ up to 40%. \nBausch and Delgado (2003)built an application to figure out if\
    \ it is feasible to use \nground-based sensing and the N Reflectance Index to\
    \ improve in-season N management of corn \nin a commercial sprinkler-irrigated\
    \ field. The results indicated that the application could reduce \nthe consumption\
    \ of nitrogen fertilizer by 47%. \nIn much of the literature that discusses ICT\
    \ sensor networks in farms, the effects of \nusing this service have not been\
    \ clearly described. To describe the performance of this type of \nfarm and the\
    \ benefits of wireless sensor networks, two indicators should be provided - the\
    \ \npercentage of agricultural resources that can be saved (e.g. water, fertilizer,\
    \ or pesticide), and \nthe effect on crop yield. Some of the articles reviewed\
    \ reported both indicators, while some of \nthem only provided one or neither\
    \ of these indicators.  \n4.2 Simulation \n \nIn this study, one of the aims was\
    \ to investigate the possible response to the equipment \nof ICT sensor networks\
    \ in farms for controlling the consumption of means of production in \nagriculture.\
    \ Before this predictive what-if analysis begins, the raw data collected from\
    \ \npublications and service providers have to be cleaned and formatted well according\
    \ to the \nmethodologies in the following paragraph.  \n \n37 \nThe collected\
    \ data are about the amount and percentage that usage of agricultural \nresources\
    \ including irrigation water, fertilizer and pesticide can be saved and reduced\
    \ by the \nwireless sensor networks solution in farm, and the amount and percentage\
    \ that crop yield can be \nimproved with the solutions. Apart from the numeric\
    \ data, location and crop type are recorded \nas well. These two attributes are\
    \ regarded as independent factors on sensor network \nperformance. \nThe first\
    \ step of data cleaning is to normalize all the raw data into the same value range,\
    \ \nand at the same time keeping the original relative deviation. In this case,\
    \ all the extents of \nchange in crop yield and resource usage are converted to\
    \ a value of percentage, which is the \n“final state” after ICT sensor networks\
    \ interfering with the crop production activities. These \nnormalized variables\
    \ include incremental changes in crop yield with ICT sensor networks, \npercentage\
    \ of saved resources, location, crop type, and information source. Table 1 is\
    \ an \nillustration of the details that will be analysed. \nTable 1. Illustration\

    \ Table 2, for some samples, one or more columns are missing. For this \nissue,\
    \ a R package called missForest is used for filling the missing values. This package\
    \ can \nhandle multivariate data consisting of continuous and categorical variables\
    \ simultaneously. This \nfeature matches the variable type of the dataset in this\
    \ study. Also, when applying this \nalgorithm, there is no need in setting tuning\
    \ parameters or making assumptions in data \ndistribution. The full potential\
    \ of missForest is deployed when the data include complex \ninteractions or non-linear\
    \ relations between variables of unequal scales and different types \n(Stekhoven\
    \ & Bühlmann, 2012).In other words, in contrast to the traditional way of using\
    \ \naverage or median values of missing data missForest uses a predictive algorithm\
    \ based on a \nrandom forest trained on the observed values to predict the missing\
    \ values. This will increase \nthe accuracy of estimated missing values. So far,\
    \ all the data used from here has been filled \n \n39 \nwith missing values with\
    \ missForest, and all variables have been normalized to the same value \nrange.\
    \ \nFor the modeling process, as is proposed in the methodology chapter, the first\
    \ step of \nmodeling was to preclude the statistical influence of locations on\
    \ the performance of ICT \nsensor networks. For this analysis, the General Linear\
    \ Model (GLM) Univariate procedure, \nwhich is based on the General Linear Model\
    \ procedure, was used for testing the significance of \nthe correlation of crop\
    \ production increasing and where the farms equipped with ICT sensor \nnetworks\
    \ are located. To assess the impact of location, general linear regression was\
    \ run with \nthe fixed factors being set as location. If the test statistic is\
    \ outside of the confidence intervals, \nthen the factor has a significant effect\
    \ on the response variable. In this study, the statistical \nsignificance of the\
    \ correlation between location and ICT sensor networks performance can be \nassessed\
    \ by this test. The statistical software used for this step was SPSS. In the GLM\
    \ \nregression setting in SPSS, the increased percentage of yield was set as the\
    \ dependent variable, \nand the percentage of water/fertilizer/pesticide saved\
    \ by ICT sensor network-based farms were \nset as covariates. This means that\
    \ the change in crop yield is the result of combined changes in \nusage of agricultural\
    \ input, controlled by ICT sensor networks.  \n \nThe following central issue\
    \ is to fit a function based on collected data. In this step, \nrandom forest\
    \ was used as the basis model for simulating how the farmland would respond with\
    \ \nICT sensor networks equipped on site. Random forest is a classifier consisting\
    \ of a collection of \ntree-structured classifiers {ℎ(\U0001D465, Θ\U0001D458\
    ),\U0001D458 = 1,… } where the {Θ\U0001D458} are independent identically \ndistributed\
    \ random vectors and each tree casts a unit vote for the most popular class at\
    \ input \U0001D465. \nWhen it comes to continuous numeric values instead of classification\
    \ questions, the random \nforest model works as well. Random forests for regression\
    \ are formed by growing trees \ndepending on a random vector Θ such that the tree\
    \ predictor ℎ(\U0001D465, Θ) takes on numerical values \nas opposed to class labels\
    \ (Breiman, 2001). This regressor fits classifying decision trees on \nvarious\
    \ sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy\
    \ and \ncontrol over-fitting (Pedregosa et al., 2011).  \nIn terms of implementation\
    \ of this simulation, a Python package called Scikit-learn was \nused. Scikit-learn\
    \ provides a functional implementation of the random forest regressor model, \n\
    RandomForestRegressor, which is written in Python. To optimize the accuracy of\
    \ modeling, \n \n40 \nparameters including, but not limited to, the number of\
    \ decision trees, maximum depth, \nminimum number of samples required to be at\
    \ a leaf node can be set to the model instance \n(scikit-learn, 2019). This implementation\
    \ has a class method score, which calculates the \ncoefficient of value (1 −\n\
    \U0001D462\n\U0001D463), where \U0001D462 is the residual sum of squares of the\
    \ difference between \nreal value and predicted value, and \U0001D463 is the total\
    \ sum of squares of the difference (Pedregosa et \nal., 2011). \nThis model can\
    \ be simplified to the form of \U0001D466 = \U0001D453(\U0001D4651,\U0001D465\
    2,\U0001D4653), where \U0001D466 stands for the \nincreased percentage of crop\
    \ yield, compared with the years during which ICT sensor networks \nare not used;\
    \ and \U0001D4651,\U0001D4652,\U0001D4653 represent the percentage of saving on\
    \ water, fertilizer and pesticide \nrespectively. The selected random forest Python\
    \ package provides several optional parameters, \nsuch as the number of trees\
    \ in the forest, criteria to measure the quality of splitting a tree, and \nminimum\
    \ number of samples required to be at a leaf node. I selected several parameters\
    \ that \nhave a significant impact on the random forest to fit the equation mentioned\
    \ above, and then \nfind a group of parameters that scored the highest among all\
    \ the parameter sets in an iterative \nway. After 500 experiments, it was found\
    \ that for the dataset in this study, the following \nparameter combinations had\
    \ the highest scores, with a score of 0.9946 (out of 1). This score \nindicates\
    \ that the current model fits the nature and distribution feature of dataset well.\
    \ \n{'bootstrap': True, 'criterion': 'mse', 'max_depth': None, 'max_features':\

    \ 0.0, 'n_estimators': 1, 'n_jobs': 1, 'oob_score': \nFalse, 'random_state': 50,'verbose':\
    \ 0, 'warm_start': False} \n \nGiven a model that has been fitted, predictive\
    \ analysis on the potential increase in crop \nyield with ICT sensor network deployed\
    \ for controlling external environment can be conducted. \nWith this predictive\
    \ model, as long as the percentages of the three resources saved are input, we\
    \ \ncan get a percentage of how the crop output will change in a farm using ICT\
    \ sensor networks. \n4.3 Meta-analysis \n \nMeta-analysis is a research method\
    \ that summarizes, integrates, and interprets selected \nsets of scholarly works\
    \ in the various disciplines (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001).Glass (1976)defined \n \n\
    41 \nthis research method as statistical analysis on a collection of research\
    \ results from individual \nstudies. It is the application of specific design\
    \ and statistical methods to the overall and \nsystematic qualitative and quantitative\
    \ analysis of previous research results. It is retrospective \nand observational,\
    \ it is improvement on the traditional review (Xia, 2005). \n \nResearch findings\
    \ which are applicable for this method must meet the following criteria: \n(1)\
    \ they must deal with the same constructs and relationships, (2) they must be\
    \ configured in \nsimilar statistical forms. To be specific, the involved studies\
    \ must focus on the same correlation \nor causality relationship in the research\
    \ scope. In meta-analysis, effect sizes are used to \nrepresent the outcome of\
    \ each study. The effect size indicates the critical quantitative \ninformation\
    \ from each study. It should represent either the direction or the magnitude of\
    \ \nquantitative research findings, or both(Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). \n4.3.1 Analysis\
    \ steps \n \nThe statistic tool used for the meta-analysis is an R package called\
    \ metafor. The \nfunction rma() in this package allows for fitting fixed- and\
    \ random/mixed-effects models with \nor without moderators via the usual mechanics\
    \ of the general linear (mixed-effects) model \n(Viechtbauer, 2010). \nThere are\
    \ two major models to use for meta-analysis, the fixed-effects model and the \n\
    random-effects model. The difference between these two models is that a random-effects\
    \ model \nallows the true effect to vary among studies. For further scalability\
    \ (Brockwell & Gordon, \n2001), the random-effects model is chosen for this study.Then,\
    \ the individual effect size \nforeach sample (i.e. finding) is calculated, using\
    \ the calculating tools provided by \nWilson(2001).The most common format of calculating\
    \ effect size is \U0001D451 = (\U0001D44B\U0001D452 − \U0001D44B\U0001D450)/\U0001D446\
    , where \n\U0001D44B\U0001D452 is the average value of an experimental group,\
    \ \U0001D44B\U0001D450 is average value of the control or reference \ngroup, and\
    \ \U0001D446 is the common standard deviation of both groups(Peng & Zheng, 1999).The\
    \ value \nof the overall effect size is positively related to the influence, which\
    \ means that higher effect \nsize indicates greater influences (Yuan, Sun, You,\
    \ Liu, & Li, 2018). \nIn this study, standard deviation from the involved studies\
    \ is collected for further \nanalysis. For these publications that did not provide\
    \ the statistical information, emails for \nenquiry were sent to the authors.\
    \  \n \n \n42 \n5. Results and Discussion \n5.1 Research question evaluation \n\
    Research question 1: To what degree can ICT sensor networks boost crop yield by\
    \ monitoring \nand controlling the usage of water, fertilizer, and pesticide?\
    \ \nAccording to the result for the test of between-subjects effects proposed\
    \ in Section 3.2, \nthe significance value for location (continent) term is 0.181\
    \ (p = 0.181), which is higher than \n0.05. Table 3 is the result of statistical\
    \ analysis from SPSS. Therefore, the correlation between \nincreased crop yield\
    \ and continent was not statistically significant. From a statistical point of\
    \ \nview, the influence of area on performance can be temporarily excluded in\
    \ this study. \nTable 3. Result of Test of between-subjects effects from SPSS\

    \ of irrigation water, fertilizer and pesticide are 80%, 86%, \nand 75% respectively,\
    \ compared with the conditions that these ICT solutions were not utilized \non\
    \ site. \nGiven the random forest model built above, a percentage to which the\
    \ ICT sensor \nnetworks can assist farms increase yield can be estimated. In this\
    \ case, with the \U0001D45D\U0001D45F\U0001D452\U0001D451\U0001D456\U0001D450\U0001D461\
    () \nfunction provided by RandomForestRegressor class in Scikit-learn, prediction\
    \ based on the \nmodel that was fitted, with parameters as the above three percentage\
    \ value set (80, 86, 75) can \nbe conducted. Output value of this prediction turned\
    \ out to be 116.26746667. This result \n \n43 \nindicates that, if the ICT sensor\
    \ network can be deployed and used in a crop farmland, with an \naverage percentage\
    \ of saving water, fertilizer and pesticide resources, the corresponding \nestimated\
    \ increase in crop yield is approximately 16%. \nAccording to the results of simulation,\
    \ the deployment of such ICT sensor networks on \nfarms can indeed reduce the\
    \ amount of agricultural resources (such as water and fertilizers) \nwhile increasing\
    \ crop yields. Such a decrease in input and an increase or change in output just\
    \ \nimprove the productivity of the farm, which is in line with the idea of sustainable\
    \ development \nin agriculture. In addition to increasing production, the more\
    \ important significance of this \napplication is to reduce the impact of human\
    \ agricultural production on the natural environment \nby controlling the amount\
    \ of chemical substances used. This protects animals and plants from \ntoxic chemicals\
    \ on the one hand, and protects human safety on the other. \nResearch question\
    \ 2: If ICT sensor networks could be deployed throughout a selected \ncountry/area,\
    \ how could the annual yield of crops change? \n \nFor this research question,\
    \ Canada is taken as an example for estimating the potential in \nincreasing crop\
    \ yield with ICT sensor networks. Except for 2015, in the past five years, \n\
    Canada's annual principal crop yield has remained at around 88.6 million metric\
    \ tonnes \n(Statistics Canada, 2020).At the same time, according to previous research\
    \ results, the \nconsumption of irrigation, fertilization and spraying of pesticides\
    \ on those farms using ICT can \nbe reduced to 80%, 86% and 75% respectively,\
    \ with boost of annual crop yield by 16%.  \nIf the result of this estimation\
    \ is extended to the entire scope of Canada, taking into \naccount the average\
    \ crop yield of Canada over the past five years, it can be concluded that if \n\
    this ICT sensor network that detects and controls water, fertilizer, and pesticides\
    \ can spread \nacross the farms in Canada, the annual crop yield in Canada (shown\
    \ in Figure 6)(Statistics \nCanada, 2019)may rise from 88 million tonnes to 98\
    \ million tonnes. Considering that Canada \nhas been exporting more than half\
    \ of the crops to the overseas demand side (Agriculture and \nAgri-Food Canada,\
    \ 2019), this potential growth in crop production will help alleviate the \ndemand\
    \ around the world. \n \n44 \n \nFigure 6. Estimated production of principal field\
    \ crops of Canada (Statistics Canada, 2019) \nAccordingly, with ICT sensor network,\
    \ the amount of resources saved for agricultural \nproduction cannot be overlooked.\
    \ In Canada, the annual total irrigation volume for crops was \n2.05 million cubic\
    \ metres in 2016, rising to 2.95 million cubic metres in 2018, a 43% increase\
    \ \n(Statistics Canada, 2019).Fertilizer consumption per hectare of arable land\
    \ in Canada was \nreported at 87.63 kg in 2016. With 41,224,000 hectares of arable\
    \ land in Canada, the annual \nfertilizer consumption is estimated as 36 million\
    \ tonnes in 2016, which has increased from 29 \nmillion tonnes in 2010, a 25%\
    \ increase (Index Mundi, 2020; World Bank, 2020). Only \nconsidering irrigation\
    \ and fertilizer use, ICT sensor networks are expected to help Canada save \n\
    irrigation water by 0.59 million tonnes, and fertilizer by 5.76 million tonnes,\
    \ with increases in \ncrop yield of 14 million tonnes. \nAs can be seen from the\
    \ results above, since the consumption of water, fertilizer and \npesticide can\
    \ be controlled by ICT sensor networks, deploying this solution across the country\
    \ \nin Canada is likely to have a huge positive influence on the crop yield and\
    \ the environment. \n5.2 Conclusion and Limitation \nAccording to Food and Agriculture\

    \ by 10% due to the primary and secondary \ndamage to farmland due to effects\
    \ of climate change. There are many reasons for the low yield, \nsuch as diseases\
    \ and insect pests, soil erosion, and improper farming. In addition, limited \n\
    research investment and transfer of scientific and technological practices have\
    \ also put \nunderdeveloped regions into inefficient agricultural production,\
    \ and the lack of technology \nleaves their agricultural industry vulnerable (World\
    \ Bank, 2017). \nThis study aimed to address the gap in knowledge from the few\
    \ quantitative analyses of \nthe performance of ICT sensor networks that reported\
    \ simultaneous monitoring of water, \nfertilizer and pesticide (or some subset\
    \ of these). In this study, the necessity and feasibility of \nutilizing ICT sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture have been clarified. \nThe analysis shows that as a\
    \ whole, ICT sensor networks can indeed effectively \nimprove the use of agricultural\
    \ resources, such as water, fertilizers and pesticides, and can also \nincrease\
    \ crop output by 16%. If this technology can be widely used in developing countries\
    \ or \nregions that rely heavily on agriculture as a source of income and livelihood,\
    \ then farmers and \nthe agricultural sector there can satisfy more of them with\
    \ limited resources in a sustainable \nway.  \nMeanwhile, the cost of deploying,\
    \ setting up and maintaining a network is often a \nstumbling block to prevent\
    \ farmers from adopting ICT sensor networks. In fact, there are \nalready some\
    \ low-cost solutions, such as a basic version of the network designed by Polo\
    \ et al. \n(2015).  The total cost can be controlled within $1,000, operating\
    \ in a farm of around 100 ha. \nRegarding the limitation of this study, the first\
    \ is that the small amount of data has \nlimited the development of this study.\
    \ Although the research on the combination of ICT and \nagriculture is not a new\
    \ topic, most of the literature that can be found now does not include \nquantitative\
    \ statements regarding the performance of their equipment. Therefore, it is not\
    \ easy \nto find a lot of information about the performance of ICT sensor networks\
    \ in agriculture. \nAttempts have been made to reach out to the authors and researchers\
    \ for more detailed \ninformation regarding the research questions, but very few\
    \ replies were received. \nAnother limitation of this study is that the original\
    \ meta-analysis was not completed. \nJudging from the publications I've been exposed\
    \ to regarding the application of the ICT sensor \nnetwork in agriculture, no\
    \ researcher provided information about the experimental group and \n \n46 \n\
    the control group in their articles, and the standard deviation used to calculate\
    \ meta-analysis is \neven more rare. Similarly, I wrote some emails to these researchers,\
    \ but unfortunately there are \nfew responders and insufficient data to support\
    \ this analysis. In the end, the focus of this \nresearch was on the simulation\
    \ of farmland equipped with ICT sensor network equipment. \n \n47 \n5.3 Future\
    \ recommendations \nThis study can be a very small part of future studies looking\
    \ to provide optimal \nallocation of agricultural resources in crop production.\
    \ The perspective of this research is \nrelatively macro. It is based on the existing\
    \ research conclusions of previous people. In the \nfuture, more micro experiments\
    \ can be conducted. For example, ICT sensor networks can be set \nup in situ to\
    \ control irrigation and fertilizer application on farmland, and eventually figure\
    \ out \nthe best external conditions for planting. To be specific, a piece of\
    \ farmland can be divided into \na grid, and ICT sensor networks will be deployed\
    \ for monitoring and controlling the amount of \nagricultural input. By comparing\
    \ crop yields under different conditions, find out the most \nsuitable external\
    \ environmental parameters for certain farmland and crops. \nIn the long run,\
    \ after collecting and analyzing many years of data, ICT can be used to \nmatch\
    \ the right environment with cultivars, to increase understanding of the interactions\
    \ \nbetween genotypes and the environment, and to adapt planting strategies to\
    \ constantly changing \nclimate. \n \n \n48 \nAppendices \nAppendix A: Tables\

    \ 51 \n \n 1 \n1. Introduction \nAs is advocated by the United Nations, efficiency\
    \ of the life cycle of production process \nis an important consideration for\
    \ sustainable development. This study aims to quantitatively \nassess the degree\
    \ to which Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) sensor \nnetworks\
    \ can help increase crop yield in farmland and cut down on the consumption of\
    \ \nresources. Additionally, in agriculture, excessive application of nutrients\
    \ can be regarded as \npollution. Therefore, pollution prevention is an additional\
    \ consideration in sustainable \nagricultural development. An ICT sensor network\
    \ is an effective tool to monitor external \nconditions and collect data for making\
    \ decision for agricultural inputs allocation (i.e., watering, \nfertilizer application,\
    \ and pesticide application) for optimal outcome (i.e., crop yield).  \nIn this\
    \ study, a model to simulate the performance of farms that are equipped with ICT\
    \ \nsensor networks for controlling usage of agricultural inputs, with the data\
    \ collected from \npublications and from the service providers that focus on utilizing\
    \ ICT sensor networks in \nagriculture. With the model, an estimated value of\
    \ possible outcomes (crop yield, resource \ninputs) was calculated. \nThis study\
    \ answered a question that how to use existing technologies to increase crop \n\
    yields, while reducing agricultural inputs and the associated negative ecological\
    \ impacts. The \nresults of this study have important implications for improving\
    \ the yield and productivity of \nfarming, and for the sustainable development\
    \ of agriculture. The effects of the climatic zones in \nwhich the farms are located\
    \ on performance of ICT sensor networks are also analyzed, and the \ninfluence\
    \ of location variation proved to be insignificant.  \n \n \n \n2 \n2. Background\
    \ \n2.1 Problem statement \nA growing population and the corresponding needs for\
    \ food throughout the world have \nprompted farm owners to expand the scale of\
    \ planting. As farm size expands, it is no longer \nfeasible to rely on collecting\
    \ data manually for making decisions on agricultural activities \n(Brase, 2006).\
    \ Breakthroughs in areas of information technology, lower manufacturing and \n\
    usage cost, smaller size, and longer life span have made sensors ubiquitous items\
    \ for the public \n(Nack, 2019), and there has been a trend that ICT sensors technologies\
    \ are being widely applied \nin agriculture, controlling the usage of water, fertilizer,\
    \ and pesticide. Meanwhile, in many \nstudies that discussed wireless sensor networks\
    \ in farms, the effects of using this service were \nnot clearly mentioned. To\
    \ describe the performance of ICT usage on farms, two types of \ninformation (indicators)\
    \ should be provided: the percentage of agricultural resources that can be \n\
    saved, and the increase in crop yield that are realized by using wireless sensor\
    \ networks. Some \nof the articles listed both indicators, while some of them\
    \ only provided one or neither of these \nindicators. \nMany previous studies\
    \ on sensor networks in agriculture have focused mainly on the \ndeployment and\
    \ configuration of wireless sensor networks, and the collection of environmental\
    \ \ndata. Work by Sakthipriya(2014) is a typical example. In the study by Sakthipriya(2014),a\
    \ crop \nmanagement system has two types of functions, sensing and decision making.\
    \ The sensor \nnetwork can collect environmental parameters including temperature,\
    \ soil moisture and soil pH \nvalue. Based on these environmental parameters sent\
    \ to the backbone, decisions on whether the \nwater sprinkler should be turned\
    \ on to provide sufficient water to the field can be made. \nHowever, there has\
    \ been little quantitative analysis on the potential of wireless sensor \nnetworks\
    \ to enhance crop yield or improve efficiency of resource use. Most of the studies\
    \ claim \nthat the wireless sensor networks solution they discussed will improve\
    \ or boost the crop \nproduction. iFarm designed by Jiber et al. (2011) is a typical\
    \ example. This system provided \nirrigation management (monitoring and controlling\
    \ water usage), pest and disease detection, \ncrop yield prediction, and resource\
    \ optimization. Few studies provided the percentage or \nincremental gain in crop\
    \ production and saving on agricultural inputs. For example, Xiong et \nal.(2008)collected\
    \ a variety of environmental and animal-related data (e.g. breed, days in milk,\
    \ \n \n3 \nmilk time, milk quality, reproduction status, location), but further\
    \ utilization of the data in \npredicting animal activities or future production\
    \ was not carried out. \n2.2 Research objectives \nThe overall purpose of my study\
    \ is to evaluate how the farmland and crop would \nrespond, when wireless sensor\
    \ networks are deployed to monitor and control how much water, \nfertilizer, and\
    \ pesticide are used. I decided to carry out research based on the performance\
    \ data \ncollected from existing farms using this type of service. The goal of\
    \ my research is to determine \nthe quantitative relationships between use of\
    \ wireless sensor networks and performance \nindicators (change in crop yield\
    \ and agricultural resource usage on farms). The analysis is based \non existing\
    \ farms that have already been equipped with wireless sensor networks and that\
    \ have \ncollected performance indicator data.  \nTherefore, my major research\
    \ questions are: \n(1) To what degree can ICT sensor networks boost crop yield\
    \ by monitoring and \ncontrolling the usage of water, fertilizer, and pesticide?\
    \ \n(2) If ICT sensor networks could be deployed throughout a selected country\
    \ or area, \nhow could the annual yield of crops change?  \n \n \n \n4 \n3. Literature\
    \ review \nIn this literature review, concepts of sustainable development, an\
    \ introduction to ICT \nsensor network, and applications of ICT sensor networks\
    \ are discussed.  \n3.1 Sustainable Development and ICT sensor networks \n3.1.1\
    \ Overview of sustainable development \nThe United Nations in 1987 articulated\
    \ a need “to make development sustainable to \nensure that it meets the needs\
    \ of the present without compromising the ability of future \ngenerations to meet\
    \ their own needs” (World Commission on Environment and Development, \n1987).\
    \ This concept drew the attention of the public toward finding ways to avoid sacrificing\
    \ \nthe natural environment for economic growth. Over time, given the changing\
    \ needs of people \nwith respect to the environment, society and economy, the\
    \ practices and definition of \nsustainable development need to be up-to-date.\
    \  \nThe US Department of Agriculture and the Environmental Protection Agency\
    \ defined \nsustainable agricultural development as “Agricultural sustainable\
    \ development refers to the \napplication of local intrinsic technology to achieve\
    \ the following objectives for a long time and \nstrive to form a comprehensive\
    \ production system for plant and livestock production.” (Hebei \nAcademy of Social\
    \ Sciences, 2017). These objectives include (1) to meet the needs of people's\
    \ \nfood and clothing; (2) to improve the quality of the environment and natural\
    \ resources on which \nagricultural production depends; and (3) to make the most\
    \ efficient use of non-renewable \nresources and materials available on farms,\
    \ and at the same time, comprehensive regulation of \nnatural resources management\
    \ methods is carried out if necessary; (4) maintaining the \neconomic vitality\
    \ of agricultural production entities; and (5) improving the overall quality of\
    \ \nlife of farmers and the whole society (Hebei Academy of Social Sciences, 2017).\
    \ \nA report from the United Nations claims that if the global population increases\
    \ to 9.6 \nbillion in the next 30 years, the equivalent of three planets would\
    \ be required to meet the \ndemands of humans given current lifestyles (United\
    \ Nations, 2016). Facing the challenge of \nfulfilling growing demands with limited\
    \ resource, it is essential to increase the efficiency of \nusing resources, so\
    \ the United Nations proposed a concept of Sustainable Consumption and \nProduction.\
    \ Based on the principle of higher efficiency with smaller input and more output,\
    \ this \n \n5 \nconcept improves the quality of life while reducing resource consumption\
    \ and environmental \ndegradation and pollution levels throughout the consumption\
    \ and production cycle, thereby \nenhancing the welfare benefits of economic activities\
    \ (United Nations Environment Programme, \n2010).  \nIn 2015, the General Assembly\
    \ adopted 17 Sustainable Development Goals for the \nfollowing 15-year lifespan,\
    \ aiming to achieve sustainable development inclusively for everyone. \nAmong\
    \ the 17 goals, Sustainable Development Goal 12 (also known as SDG 12) is most\
    \ related \nto this study. SDG 12 was to build a more sustainable and production-efficient\
    \ world. Its major \ntargets include (1) promoting resource and energy efficiency,\
    \ and (2) promoting sustainable \ninfrastructures (United Nations, 2015). The\
    \ SDGs were intended to promote a new worldview \nand provide the beginnings of\
    \ a plan to end poverty without imposing significant costs on \nEarth’s life-support\
    \ systems. The goals may help create a fresh global narrative around a \ncommon\
    \ future to mobilise collective action and help develop a shared understanding\
    \ of \ninterconnected risks and solutions(Gaffney, 2014).  \n3.1.2 Agricultural\
    \ waste issues \nHigher production and smaller input are required for sustainable\
    \ development. To meet \nthe demand for food by a growing global population, an\
    \ expansion in agricultural production is \nneeded. As farm sizes expand, it is\
    \ no longer viable to rely on collecting data manually for \nmaking decisions\
    \ on agricultural activities (Brase, 2006). At the same time, various sensors\
    \ \nwhich have lower manufacturing and utilization costs, smaller size, and longer\
    \ life spans, have \nbecome ubiquitous items for the public (Nack, 2019).  \n\
    Another aspect of accomplishing United Nation’s SDG 12 is to reduce the solid\
    \ waste \nthat is generated from production processes, which could cut down on\
    \ the amount of raw \nmaterials that manufacturers have to obtain from nature\
    \ or artificially create (Bishop, \n2004).Relevant to this research is agriculture\
    \ waste, produced by agricultural activities. \nAgricultural waste is comprised\
    \ of animal waste (manure, animal carcasses), food processing \nwaste (only 20%\
    \ of maize is canned and 80% is waste), crop waste (corn stalks, sugarcane \n\
    bagasse, drops and culls from fruits and vegetables, pruning) and hazardous and\
    \ toxic \nagricultural waste (pesticides, insecticides and herbicides, etc.) (Ramírez-García\
    \ et al., 2019; \nObi et al., 2016). \n \n6 \nMost chemicals of agricultural waste\
    \ are water-soluble and can leach and enter water \nbodies and food, leading to\
    \ severe ecologic and human health impacts.  This can cause serious \nhealth disorders\
    \ in humans, including cancer, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, birth\
    \ \ndefects, and reproductive disorders. Pesticides can also kill non-target plants,\
    \ birds, and other \nwildlife, and have a significant negative impact on soil\
    \ quality and fertility (Ramírez-García, \nGohil, & Singh, 2019). \nFertilizer\
    \ contains massive amount of nutritive minerals including nitrogen, phosphorus,\
    \ \nand potassium which provides support for plants to grow faster and increase\
    \ yields. However, if \nthe application of fertilizer surpasses the crop/soil\
    \ system’s capacity to absorb the nutrients, the \nexcessive minerals will leak\
    \ into surface runoff, and eventually enter waterbodies such as lakes, \nrivers,\
    \ creeks, etc. (Karunanithi et al., 2016). When the excessive NPK minerals enter\
    \ the \nwaterbody, eutrophication occurs, with mass production of photosynthetic\
    \ microorganisms. \nWhen these photosynthetic microorganisms die, bacteria activity\
    \ decomposing this biomass can \ndeplete dissolved oxygen, causing other organisms\
    \ such as fish to die of hypoxia (Wetzel, \n2001). \nUnited States Environmental\
    \ Protection Agency recommended the following ways to \nmitigate the pollution\
    \ by excessive agricultural inputs: (1) applying nutrients in the right \namount,\
    \ at the right time of year, with the right method and with the right placement;\
    \ (2) \nEnsuring year-round ground cover to avoid soil erosion and nutrients loss\
    \ to the waterway; (3) \nPlanting field buffers. Planted buffers can help prevent\
    \ nutrient loss from fields by absorbing or \nfiltering out nutrients before they\
    \ reach a water body; (4) Installing fence along waterways to \nkeep animals off\
    \ the stream, river, etc. (United States Environmental Protection Agency, 2019)\
    \ \n \nIn the context of this study, ICT sensor networks are deployed on farms\
    \ to collect \ninformation about the factors that would affect crop yield, such\
    \ as soil water content, fertilizer \nusage, and soil/atmospheric temperature\
    \ (Meeradevi & Mundada, 2015). Once information has \nbeen collected, it can be\
    \ processed in two different directions. The first is that information can \n\
    be sent directly to terminal clients and then converted into graphic deliverables\
    \ by visualization \nsoftware. With visualized content about the farm environment,\
    \ farm managers would know \nbetter about how the farm works, and what kind of\
    \ strategies they should take for better or more \n \n7 \nefficient crop production.\
    \ The second direction focuses on the idea of agricultural resource and \nwaste\
    \ control. The sensor network keeps contributing to making decision on the ground\
    \ \nregarding the proper amount of water, fertilizer and pesticide to be applied\
    \ on site. \n3.2 What is ICT sensor network? \nInformation and Communication Technology\
    \ is a varied cluster of digital tools and \nresources used to communicate, generate,\
    \ disseminate, store and perform information \nmanagement (Rahman et al., 2016).\
    \  \n3.2.1 Internet of Things \nIn this study, the main infrastructure used for\
    \ improving production is the sensor \nnetwork. The ICT sensor network is a subset\
    \ of the Internet of Things (IoT), referring to the \ninterconnection of smart\
    \ devices, ranging from appliances to tiny sensors (Stallings & Brown, \n2018).\
    \ An advantageous feature of the Internet of Things is that short-range mobile\
    \ transceivers \nare embedded in various gadgets and daily necessities, thereby\
    \ enabling new forms of \ncommunication between people and things, and between\
    \ things. The cloud systems today \nsupport the interconnection of billions of\
    \ industrial and personal objects. These objects can pass \ninformation collected\
    \ from distributed sensor nodes. Utilizing this low-latency information can \n\
    be used to effectively monitor the environment and make decisions for overall\
    \ management of \nlarge systems such as factories or cities. The farms involved\
    \ in this study are benefiting from \nthis technology. From the initial PC and\
    \ server to later professional operational technology and \npersonal electronic\
    \ communication equipment, sensor-based internet of things represents the \nlatest\
    \ products and trends of the Internet (Stallings & Brown, 2018). \nThe sensor\
    \ nodes are the most basic and underlying devices of an Internet of Things, \n\
    and at the same time they represent one of the core technologies of the wireless\
    \ sensor networks \nfor this study. A single sensor unit consists of five key\
    \ components, sensor, actuator, micro-\ncontroller, transceiver and radio-frequency\
    \ identification (Stallings & Brown, 2018), which will \nbe discussed in a following\
    \ subsection regarding sensor node structure. \nIn the context of a complete enterprise\
    \ network, an Internet of Things may have four \ndifferent layers. The bottom-up\
    \ order of these layers is the edge layer, the fog layer, the core \nlayer and\
    \ the cloud layer. The edge layer is mainly composed of sensors and switches,\
    \ which \n \n8 \ncan communicate information to each other when needed. At this\
    \ layer, there are a few \ngateways that connect sensors to communicate with higher-level\
    \ networks. After the data is \ncollected by the gateway, it is transmitted to\
    \ the fog layer. The amount of data this layer \nreceives from distributed sensor\
    \ networks on the ground is usually very large, so a significant \nfeature of\
    \ the fog layer is that it can be evaluated close to the edge layer. This can\
    \ effectively \nreduce the pressure on the entire network from transmitting a\
    \ large amount of data, whether it \nconsumes bandwidth or consumes other resources.\
    \ The main functions of the core layer above \nthe fog layer are to connect the\
    \ broadly distributed fog layer, and to open the interface to \nexternal servers.\
    \ The cloud layer on the top of the network, provides storage and processing \n\
    capabilities for large amounts of aggregated data sensor nodes from the edge (Stallings\
    \ & \nBrown, 2018). \n3.2.2 Network structure and architecture \nThe realm of\
    \ wireless networks can be divided into infrastructured and infrastructureless\
    \ \nnetworks. A typical infrastructured wireless network consists of a central\
    \ base station where all \nthe information transmitted from the ground is processed,\
    \ and nodes collect information at \nground level. A cellular wireless network\
    \ is the most common type of infrastructured network. \nDifferent from the infrastructured\
    \ network, an infrastructureless wireless network has \ndistributed, independent,\
    \ dynamic topology, low-power, task-oriented wireless nodes. With \nthese features,\
    \ a lot of decisions can be made at ground level, and as a result, some unnecessary\
    \ \ninformation for high-level decision-making will be removed from the information\
    \ package \nwhich will be sent to a central base station (Jangra, 2010). The wireless\
    \ sensor networks to be \ndiscussed in this study is a typical instance of an\
    \ infrastructureless network.  \n \nStallings and Brown (2018) summarized a sensor\
    \ network as a cluster of sensors \ntransmitting their data to one intermediate\
    \ entity that aggregates the data to be collected by a \nhigher-level entity.\
    \ There are five steps that a sensor network should take when a sensor node \n\
    has fetched data from an external environment: \n(1) Evaluation: evaluating data\
    \ for criteria as to whether it should be processed at a \nhigher level. \n(2)\
    \ Formatting: reformatting data for consistent higher-level processing. \n \n\
    9 \n(3) Expanding/decoding: handling cryptic data with additional context (such\
    \ as the \norigin). \n(4) Distillation/reduction: reducing and/or summarizing\
    \ data to minimize the impact \nof data and traffic on the network and higher-level\
    \ processing systems. \n(5) Assessment: determining whether data represent a threshold\
    \ or alert; this could \ninclude redirecting data to additional destinations.\
    \ \nAn advantage of the four-layered architecture of the Internet of Things networks,\
    \ is that \nthe size of data packets to be transmitted gradually shrinks as data\
    \ moves from ground level to \nthe higher levels (Stallings & Brown, 2018). \n\
    Another distinguishing characteristic of a sensor network is fog computing, which\
    \ is an \nopposite technical trend to cloud computing. Cloud computing refers\
    \ to the network that makes \nmassive and centralized storage, and processing\
    \ resources available to distributed users or \nclients. In fog computing, many\
    \ smart devices (e.g. sensors) are interconnected by fog network \nfacilities\
    \ that provide data processing function which is close to the sensors rather than\
    \ the \nhigher-level devices (Stallings et al., 2012). In terms of the efficiency,\
    \ the fog network between \nthe smart devices layer and the core network layer\
    \ enables lots of vital decisions to be made by \nthe smart devices on the edge.\
    \ That is to say, the time it takes for sensed data at ground/edge to \ntravel\
    \ to the higher-level cloud server can be saved by processing in the fog network.\
    \ The \narchitecture of the IoT equipped with a fog network relieves the burden\
    \ of computing in the \ncentral part of the IoT system, which in turn allows more\
    \ smart devices to be engaged in the \nnetwork. Owing to the rapid detection or\
    \ rapid measurements of sensors on edge, the risk of \ndisaster from a cascading\
    \ system failure would be decreased, and therefore the potential costs to \nmaintain\
    \ and repair the system would be saved (Cisco, 2015). Sliva’s research on WSNs\
    \ \nincludes a five-layered protocol, including a physical layer, a data link\
    \ layer, a network layer, a \ntransport layer and an application layer (Sliva,\
    \ 2008).Appendix Figure A1 is a common \narchitecture of ICT sensor network (Telecommunication\
    \ Standardization Sector of International \nTelecommunication Union, 2014). The\
    \ multi-layer feature of a sensor network is clearly \nillustrated in Appendix\
    \ Figure A1.  \n \n10 \n3.2.3 Sensor node structure \nNodes are a fundamental\
    \ part of a viable wireless sensor network. There are four major \ncomponents\
    \ in a node which are a power unit (e.g. battery sets), sensing unit, processing\
    \ and \nstorage unit and transceiver unit (for communication), with the major\
    \ structure of a node \ndepicted according to Sliva (2008)(Appendix Figure A2),\
    \ and a more detailed explanation (El-\nKader & El-Basion, 2013) (Appendix Figure\
    \ A3). In a fog network, these nodes have an \nadditional component, the microcontroller,\
    \ which is the intelligence for making basic decisions \nat ground level of a\
    \ whole network. \nTo ensure a sufficiently long network life, energy efficiency\
    \ in all parts of the network \nis critical. Therefore, data processing tasks\
    \ are often spread across the network: that is, nodes \nneed to cooperate to transmit\
    \ data to receivers (Galar & Kumar, 2017). \nIn real-world application of wireless\
    \ sensor networks in agriculture, one of the main \nconcerns and barriers is that\
    \ the farm owners or operators would worry about the costs of \nrunning the network\
    \ in fields, which includes the initial expense of setting up and configuring\
    \ \nhardware, the costs of maintenance and replacement, and of electricity for\
    \ devices in the long \nrun (Sliva, 2008; El-Kader & El-Basion, 2013). In order\
    \ to minimize the costs of nodes, more \ncircuits should be integrated into each\
    \ chip. Regarding the energy, less memory and less \npowerful processing units\
    \ in ground devices can be used to reduce cost (Sliva, 2008). This \nstrategy\
    \ makes sense, but at the same time it would increase the burden of computing\
    \ in a \ncentral base station, and in turn slow down the speed of processing data\
    \ and making decisions. \n3.2.4 Wireless standard used in ICT sensor networks\
    \ \nAt present, there are many standards and protocols for the wireless transmission\
    \ of \nsignals in wireless sensor networks. Among them, the following protocols\
    \ are the most \nfrequently used(Sohraby , Minoli, & Znati, 2007):  \n• IEEE 802.15.1\
    \ (also known as Bluetooth);  \nBluetooth is a standard for short range, low power,\
    \ and low-cost wireless \ncommunication that uses radio technology. Its short-range\
    \ wireless capability allows \nperipheral devices to communicate over a single\
    \ air-interface, replacing the cables that \n \n11 \nuse connectors with a multitude\
    \ of shapes, sizes and numbers of pins (McDermott-Wells, \n2004). \n• IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n\
    \ series of wireless LANs;  \nIEEE 802.11 and 802.11x refers to a family of specifications\
    \ developed by the IEEE for \nwireless local area network (WLAN) technology. 802.11\
    \ specifies an over-the-air \ninterface between a wireless client and a base station\
    \ or between two wireless clients \n(IEEE Standard Association, 2020). \n• IEEE\
    \ 802.15.4 (ZigBee);  \nZigBee is a specification for a suite of high-level communication\
    \ protocols using low-\npower digital radios based on IEEE 802.15.4. The technology\
    \ defined by the ZigBee \nspecification is intended to be simpler and less expensive\
    \ than the other consumer \nwireless personal area networks, such as Bluetooth.\
    \ A distinguishing feature of ZigBee \nis low cost, which allows this technology\
    \ to be widely used in the area of wireless \ncontrolling (Radmand, Talevski,\
    \ Petersen, & Carlsen, 2010). \n• MAN-scope IEEE 802.16 (WiMAX);  \nWiMAX standard\
    \ is a family of 802.16, that provides, multiple physical layer (PHY) \nand Media\
    \ Access Control (MAC) options (Nuaymi, 2007). \n• Radio-frequency identification\
    \ (RFID) tagging. \nThere are two general categories of RFID tagging, active and\
    \ passive, depending on \ntheir source of electrical power. Active RFID tags contain\
    \ their own power source, \nusually an on-board battery. Passive tags obtain power\
    \ from the signal of an external \nreader. This technique has been used widely\
    \ in the areas of supply chain management, \nsecurity, and movement tracking (Weinstein,\
    \ 2005). \nThese transmission protocols and their corresponding properties, including\
    \ transmission \nrange and speed, have been summarized in previous literature\
    \ (Sohraby et al., 2007; Ojha et al., \n \n12 \n2015). When configuring transmission\
    \ protocols for WSNs, the person who makes the decision \nshould select the appropriate\
    \ one based on energy availability, nodes characteristics, and \nperformance requirement\
    \ of this network. Appendix Figure A4 and Appendix Table A1 show \nthe differences\
    \ in data transmission rate, transmission range, and energy consumption of these\
    \ \navailable transmission protocols.  \nThe technologies described above enable\
    \ many sensors to be deployed in crop fields in \na non-destructive way, which\
    \ in turn helps increase the resolution when mapping soil, plant, \nand livestock\
    \ properties.  \n3.2.5 Energy efficiency matters \nThe energy consumed by an ICT\
    \ sensor network mainly has two aspects, the direct \ncurrent brought by the battery\
    \ used by the node, and the alternating current consumed by the \ndata center\
    \ or core layer of the network when processing data. A technology used to facilitate\
    \ \nsustainable development should be in line with its own idea of sustainable\
    \ development. \nTherefore, energy efficiency in ICT sensor networks should be\
    \ considered. Improving energy \nefficiency in the ICT solutions requires both\
    \ policy and technology guidelines (Cremer et al., \n2010). In terms of technologic\
    \ guidelines, these solutions start with where the ICT industry \nconsumes energy.\
    \ For example, server clusters, data centers, and base stations that are now \n\
    commonly used consume electric power for daily operations on the one hand, and\
    \ cooling \nhardware on the other(Fagas, Gammaitoni, Gallagher, & Paul, 2017).\
    \ For energy consumed to \nmaintain daily operations, the base station should\
    \ first ensure that there are no in-situ servers \nthat are powered on but not\
    \ working at all. The second step is to transform the traditional data \ncenters\
    \ into next generation hyperscale data centers. This upgraded data center has\
    \ 25% higher \nenergy efficiency than the traditional one. From 2016 to 2020,\
    \ a hyperscale data center is \npredicted to shrink the overall energy consumption\
    \ by 50%, with these small and less-efficient \ndata centers shut down (Jones,\
    \ 2018). \nTackling cooling down or maintaining system temperature is another\
    \ technical \nimprovement direction. Monitoring real-time operation conditions\
    \ including temperature and \nhumidity makes it possible to make dynamic actions\
    \ on the right timing to run a cooling system. \n \n13 \nThis practice can avoid\
    \ excessive cooling when the workload in the data center is not heavy \n(Shuja\
    \ et al., 2012). \nOptimizing computing procedure and network architecture is\
    \ another guideline for \nhigher efficiency. For example, streamlining the computing\
    \ process, scaling dynamic voltage \nand frequency for high-performance tasks,\
    \ and balancing the data pipeline are all feasible \noptions for architecture\
    \ (Fagas et al., 2017; Satran, 2018). However, implementing these \nmeasures to\
    \ improve the energy efficiency of ICT sensor networks will inevitably encounter\
    \ \nobstacles. As is mentioned above, guidelines for improving energy efficiency\
    \ in ICT industry \nimpact initially the businesses from an economic perspective,\
    \ and it will inevitably add \nfinancial burden to both business owners and their\
    \ clients/consumers. For instance, adding \ntaxes or extra fees to the price of\
    \ a product is never an easy task, because the stakeholders \nmight be reluctant\
    \ to accept this increase in cost. \nIn terms of deploying advanced cooling systems\
    \ for higher energy, this practice has two \nmajor obstacles for implementation.\
    \ The first one is the price that data centers have to pay for \nthis upgrade,\
    \ because cost-controlling is the very basis of running business in a robust manner.\
    \ \nAnother barrier is that some smart temperature controlling systems that are\
    \ integrated into data \ncenters involve deep customization for better compatibility.\
    \ Therefore, it will take time and \nefforts to set up such a system for a data\
    \ center. \nThe third guideline mentioned above may have technical difficulty\
    \ in implementing, \nthat is the transformation and upgrading of legacy architecture\
    \ and computing algorithms is a \nmentally work-intensive job, and it requires\
    \ massive assistance from external sources. If so, \nfurther collaboration between\
    \ internal and outsourced workers will cost time and effort for this \nintegration.\
    \ \n \n3.3 Applications of the Internet of Things \n \nInternet of Things has\
    \ been applied in various industries, including but not limited to \ngrid, transportation,\
    \ logistic and healthcare (Wu, 2010). This study mainly discusses the \napplication\
    \ of IoT in healthcare and finance. \n \n14 \n3.3.1 The Internet of Things in\
    \ Healthcare \nThe Internet of Things solutions for healthcare includes the following\
    \ aspects, \nequipment for patients, equipment designed for doctors' work, and\
    \ networks for hospital \nmanagement. \nInternet of Things for patients. IoT solutions\
    \ for monitoring the health or medical \nconditions of individuals are able to\
    \ collect parameters from patients, using the body-sensor \nnodes that are equipped\
    \ in wearable devices. These solutions play an important role in \nimproving the\
    \ quality of life and survival opportunities of critically ill patients and chronically\
    \ \nill patients. Fortino et al. (2014)designed a body sensor networks called\
    \ BodyCloud, which can \ngather real-time data regarding body temperature, blood\
    \ pressure, and electrocardiography, and \nconduct further processing on raw data,\
    \ data storage and analysis. Fanucci et al (2012)created a \nsystem to monitor\
    \ the vital signs of chronic heart failure patients. In this system, signs including\
    \ \nelectrocardiogram, SpO2, blood pressure, and weight are collected by non-invasive\
    \ sensor \nnodes. These data will be transmitted from sensor nodes to a home sensor\
    \ gateway for checking \nwhether the status of a patient who is prone to suffering\
    \ from heart failure is abnormal, \ncompared with the pre-set safety value range.\
    \ Once the detected values are beyond the \nthreshold, alerts will be sent from\
    \ home gateway and calls for instant supports, which allows \nearlier home interventions\
    \ thus reducing the number of hospitalizations. \nThe Internet of Things also\
    \ has significant impacts on the elderly who are living alone \nand their families\
    \ by continuously tracking their health. When someone's daily activities are \n\
    disturbed or changed, the alert mechanism will send signals to family members\
    \ and medical \npersonnel. For example, falls are a serious problem for the elderly,\
    \ so it is imperative to apply \nfalls detection in the daily life of the elderly.\
    \ There have been plenty of IoT-based fall detection \nand alerting solutions.\
    \ In Gutiérrez-Madroñal et al.’s (2019)solution of fall detection, once their\
    \ \nmotion sensors observe that the change in the acceleration of human motion\
    \ conforms to the \nfall pattern, these sensor nodes will determine a fall event,\
    \ and then an alert will be sent for help. \nThe combination of home monitoring\
    \ devices, such as wearables and fog computing, \ncan allow doctors to more effectively\
    \ track the patient's health. After the sensors installed on \nthe patient are\
    \ processed locally, the data necessary for the doctor's diagnosis will be uploaded\
    \ \nto the cloud. Doctors can track the patient's compliance with the treatment\
    \ plan or any need for \n \n15 \nimmediate medical attention. The Internet of\
    \ Things has made healthcare professionals more \nalert and able to proactively\
    \ contact patients. The data collected from IoT devices can help \ndoctors determine\
    \ the best treatment process for patients and achieve the expected results \n\
    (Alam et al., 2018). \nInternet of Things for hospitals. The National Health Service\
    \ in England declared the \npractices of using IoT in healthcare is effective\
    \ in tracking medical supplies and automating \nbasic data collection and patient\
    \ monitoring, so that the experienced healthcare workers can be \nset free from\
    \ repetitive tasks to focus on patients’ safety and services(Best, 2018). Hospitals\
    \ can \nuse IoT technology to track the use of medical equipment and consumables.\
    \ In most hospitals, \nequipment such as electrocardiographs and analgesic pumps\
    \ needs to be shared by patients. IoT \ncan not only provide insights for hospital\
    \ staff to plan resource allocation by sending the real-\ntime location of the\
    \ device, but also can be used to monitor the maintenance status of the device\
    \ \nand issue alerts when appropriate. For some medical consumables that are being\
    \ consumed at \nfast speed, low-cost RFID tags allow them to be marked, so it\
    \ is easy to count usage and then \ncharge the patient's account. At the same\
    \ time, tracking the usage of these medical consumables \ncan also help hospitals\
    \ manage inventory. For example, when the consumption of certain items \nis too\
    \ high or the rate of use is too fast, an alarm will be issued to remind the hospital\
    \ to \nreplenish inventory or reduce excessive consumption (Laplante & Laplante,\
    \ 2016). \nFor hospitals and some other healthcare providers, the significance\
    \ of using IoT is that \nafter collecting a massive amount of data from ground\
    \ devices, meaningful trends and \nconclusions can be drawn through centralized\
    \ sorting and analysis. These analytics deliverables \ncan be suggestions of medical\
    \ assistance or overall visualization of the condition of a patient \ngroup. Figure\
    \ 1is an illustration of the workflow of IoT solutions in healthcare (Mora et\
    \ al., \n2017; Mora, Gil, Terol, Azorín, & Szymanski, 2017) \n \n16 \n \nFigure\
    \ 1. Schema of IoT workflow (Mora et al., 2017) \n3.3.2 The Internet of Things\
    \ in Finance \n \nThe applications of IoT have transformed the way that the financial\
    \ sector works. \nKhanboubi et al. (2019)summarized the following trend in which\
    \ IoT solutions are changing \nfinancial services, mobile banking, crowd-based\
    \ financing, virtual money, high frequency \ntrading firms, cyber criminality,\
    \ big data and IT analytics. The applications of IoT in finance \ncan be classified\
    \ into two categories, one is financial services for individual users and corporate\
    \ \nusers, and the other is the measures used by banks and other financial institutions\
    \ to optimize \nand upgrade their own workflow. The most common of the first type\
    \ of application is the \nbanking service provided to users that can be accessed\
    \ at any time through a personal terminal. \nThese services include using the\
    \ user’s biological information to perform security \nauthentication of the banking\
    \ business or to replace the physical signature during the business \nprocess;\
    \ using the built-in near-field communication technologies (NFC) module of mobile\
    \ \nphone or wearable device to complete contactless payment; collecting funding\
    \ from a large \nnumber of individual to support a project financially via an\
    \ online platform (Khanboubi et al., \n2019). \nThere are some other IoT applications\
    \ in finance designed for business security and risk \nmanagement. For example,\
    \ Industrial and Commercial Bank of China is using IoT solutions for \nits financing\
    \ business risk management practices. RFID tags are deployed on collateral to\
    \ detect \nthe movement of objects. Any abnormal movement can trigger the alarm\
    \ system, a realization \n \n17 \nof the automatic collection of alarm information\
    \ and early warning of risk monitoring (InfoQ, \n2019). \n3.4 Concerns regarding\
    \ sensor nodes and the network \nAs discussed above, ICT sensor networks can indeed\
    \ play an effective role in detecting \nfarmland environment and controlling the\
    \ application of yield technology, but use of this \ntechnology in agriculture\
    \ is confronted with the limitations and challenges including, but not \nlimited\
    \ to, lifetime, energy and reliability. \n3.4.1 Energy consumption and Battery\
    \ life \nThe power unit is an essential part of an ICT sensor node (Sliva, 2008).\
    \ Rechargeable \nbatteries are usually used for power supply in a sensor node,\
    \ which have limited capacity and \npose a challenge to long-term deployment.\
    \ These batteries provide stable electricity to the other \nmodule in a sensor\
    \ node, so that each part of the node can work properly. To enhance energy \n\
    efficiency within a sensor node, the circuits and algorithm of the processing\
    \ and calculating \nmodule of a node have to be further optimized (Jawad, Nordin,\
    \ Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, \n2017). In wireless sensor networks, the lifetime\
    \ of a node is generally determined by its power \nunit, usually the life of batteries\
    \ used in the sensor nodes. To utilize the maximum of the battery \nlife, power\
    \ consumption of the nodes should be strictly controlled, which means that the\
    \ \nprogram and algorithms inside the nodes should be optimized and improved (Sliva,\
    \ 2008). The \ngood news is that the problem of limited node lifespan can be addressed,\
    \ with the use of \nenergy-harvesting techniques. Numerous techniques have been\
    \ developed to allow sensor nodes \nto harvest different types of energy, such\
    \ as solar, wireless power transfer, mechanical vibration, \nkinetic, and wind\
    \ energy, from different environments. Ambient energy can be converted into \n\
    electrical energy, and the electric energy can be used to charge the battery of\
    \ a sensor node, or \nit can be stored for later use. In agricultural applications,\
    \ energy harvesting can be used to \nextend the life of sensor nodes (Jawad, Nordin,\
    \ Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017). \n3.4.2 Equilibrium among energy consumption,\
    \ transmission range and node performance \nIn the realm of wireless communication\
    \ protocols, ZigBee consumes much less power \nthan these traditional transmission\
    \ methods, including Wi-Fi and GPRS, but the latter has a \nwider transmission\
    \ range. Similar trade-offs occur from time to time. Zigbee and low-energy \n\
    \ \n18 \nBluetooth are designed for battery-powered devices. Low-energy Bluetooth\
    \ is superior to \nZigBee in terms of power consumption, but due to its short\
    \ communication distance of 10 \nmeters, the protocol is limited in agricultural\
    \ applications. The Long-Range Radio (LoRa) \nProtocol covers large communication\
    \ areas with low power consumption. Therefore, it can be \nappropriately deployed\
    \ in a wide agricultural field. However, for this protocol, limited \ncommunication\
    \ time per hour for each device and message capacity for communication, and its\
    \ \ndependency on gateway make this protocol no longer the best option for configuring\
    \ \nagricultural ICT sensor networks (Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail,\
    \ 2017). \n3.4.3 Transmission loss \nWhen deployed for agricultural purposes,\
    \ WSN faces a more difficult environment than \nother uses, such as outdoor, orchards,\
    \ farms and other complex terrain. Signal transmission will \nbe disturbed by\
    \ obstacles. In agricultural applications, signals transmitted from sensor nodes\
    \ \nneed to reach the receiving node through a thick canopy. If a sufficient gap\
    \ cannot be ensured, \nthe signal will be absorbed, reflected, attenuated and\
    \ scattered during the propagation process \n(Jawad, Nordin, Gharghan, Jawad,\
    \ & Ismail, 2017). \n3.4.4 Immediate and reliable \nThe starting point for the\
    \ establishment of WSN determines that one of its first tasks is \nto provide\
    \ farmers with low-latency environmental information. Most crops are easily affected\
    \ \nby the weather. If WSN fails to detect environmental changes in a timely manner,\
    \ or detects \ninformation but does not transmit it to relevant clients in a timely\
    \ manner, it may lead to serious \nagricultural disasters, such as large-scale\
    \ diseases and insect pests, floods, fires, etc. Regarding \nsome existing ICT\
    \ sensor networks deployed in farms, the way they work is still to wait until\
    \ \nsymptoms appear so that the disease can be detected. Such systems do not qualify\
    \ as early \nwarning systems in detecting disease and pests (Datir & Wagh, 2014).\
    \ \n3.4.5 Fault tolerance \nIn ICT sensor networks, it is normal for one of the\
    \ hundreds of thousands of nodes to \nfail. Common causes include power exhaustion,\
    \ communication failure, and sensor module \nfailure. At this time, the most important\
    \ thing is to design a set of topological structures with \nstrong fault tolerance,\
    \ to prevent the entire network from collapsing due to a failed node(Jawad, \n\
    \ \n19 \nNordin, Gharghan, Jawad, & Ismail, 2017). Apart from solving this problem\
    \ from the \nperspective of network topology, some further improvement on the\
    \ combination of nodes \narchitecture and the network can be done as well. Geeta\
    \ et al.(2013) suggested a possible way \nof improvement. A single sensor node\
    \ should have the capability to send early alert to its \nneighbour node when\
    \ its battery is low or when it gets external interference, offering the \nnetwork\
    \ with enough time to adjust a transmission route to avoid network collapse. Hang\
    \ et \nal.(2015)designed a three-tiered unmanned aerial vehicle sensor network\
    \ for capturing \ninformation from farmland. This architecture realizes the extension\
    \ of the life of sensor nodes \nby reducing the transmission tasks of sensor nodes\
    \ in WSN. It enhances the data collection \nefficiency and life of the entire\
    \ system by enhancing the function of relay nodes and power \nsupply, reducing\
    \ resource consumption caused by transmission node failures, and improving \n\
    the network communication quality provided by mobile nodes. \n3.4.6 Data management\
    \ \nAgricultural monitoring practices generate large amounts of data because multiple\
    \ \nWSNs in agricultural applications include multiple crop sensor growth analysis\
    \ and harvest \nestimates. This situation requires the base station to monitor\
    \ and change farmland through \nanalysis mode. Therefore, base stations must support\
    \ high levels of storage capacity (Jawad et \nal., 2017). \n3.5 Review of ICT\
    \ sensor networks in agriculture \nDigital farming is the practice of modern technologies\
    \ such as sensors, robotics, and \ndata analysis for shifting from tedious operations\
    \ to continuously automated processes \n(Shamshiri et al., 2018). The terms digital\
    \ farming and precision agriculture are often used to \ndescribe the same concept\
    \ in many current contexts, but they are not the same thing. The \nconcept of\
    \ precision agriculture (PA) has been proposed for ages. At the very beginning,\
    \ PA \nwas mainly focused on the matching of environmental factors such as insitu\
    \ climate, soil \nproperty, and crop species (Krishna, 2016). \nInnovation in\
    \ digital farming occurs where the crops interact with their external \nenvironment,\
    \ for example, the physical, biological, and chemical components (Es van & \n\
    Woodard, 2017). Therefore, inspiration for innovations could be derived from the\
    \ factors that \naffect crop productivity. Lazarcik (1963) developed a term output-input\
    \ ratio for measuring \n \n20 \nproductivity. This ratio is about the relationship\
    \ of agricultural output to all production inputs \nused to produce that output.\
    \ It measures average aggregate productivity of all inputs together \n(operating\
    \ expenses, depreciation, interest on capital and cost of labor). It indicates\
    \ that in order \nto increase the productivity in agriculture, measures aiming\
    \ for both higher output and smaller \ninput should be taken. \nThere have been\
    \ many achievements in using wireless sensor networks in farms to \nmonitor the\
    \ environmental factors that affect crop yield, including but not limited to soil\
    \ \nmoisture, temperature, pH value, soil microbes load. Kalaivani et al. (2011)surveyed\
    \ ZigBee-\nbased wireless sensor networks in agriculture, which covers the features\
    \ and some drawbacks \nof the application of ZigBee in agribusiness. This transmission\
    \ protocol has good capability of \ntransmitting data with few losses within its\
    \ complimentary range, with low power consumption, \nprice and deployment difficulty.\
    \ However, the transmission quality can be significantly \nimpaired as the distance\
    \ changes and vegetable canopy keeps growing. The reason is that there \nis a\
    \ significant gray zone which is a range of distance between transmitter and receiver\
    \ where \nthe transmission doesn't work, and if the route between transmitter\
    \ and receiver is physically \nblocked by plant canopy, the connection would be\
    \ disturbed and closed (Kalaivani , Allirani, & \nPriya, 2011). \nYadav et al.\
    \ (2012)described a method to use wireless sensor networks to ensure that \neveryone\
    \ has enough food in some developing areas. In this study, wireless sensor networks\
    \ \nwere used to monitor the life cycle of food from producing stage to sales\
    \ stage. This monitoring \nprocess includes establishing a database by mapping\
    \ agricultural production and food shortages, \nconstructing efficient ways of\
    \ communication during emergency, monitoring real-time \nagricultural conditions\
    \ and sending an alert if an indicator meets its threshold. \nOjha et al.(2015)reviewed\
    \ various applications of WSNs in an agricultural context. \nThey divided wireless\
    \ sensor networks into two types according to different scenarios, which \nare\
    \ Terrestrial WSNs and Underground WSNs. They also listed some potential applications\
    \ \nsuch as automated irrigation scheduling for saving water, maintaining an optimized\
    \ \nenvironment for higher plant growth, monitoring cattle activities and ground\
    \ water quality to \nensure the cattle are staying in an appropriate environment\
    \ and location, simulating greenhouse \ngas distribution, and agricultural production\
    \ processing monitoring. These applications indicate \n \n21 \nthe feasibility\
    \ of utilizing ICT sensor network technologies in farms to improve production\
    \ by \ncreating optimal environment for crops. \nZhao et al. (2010) designed a\
    \ greenhouse environment monitoring system using IoT \ntechnology. This system\
    \ can control the on-site environment in real time according to the needs \nof\
    \ plants for temperature and humidity. Also, it’s able to collect a large amount\
    \ of \nenvironmental data and send it to research institutions for further processing\
    \ and analysis. \nDholu and Ghodinde (2018)created a similar IoT-based system\
    \ which can sense necessary \nparameters from the environment and make the necessary\
    \ decisions to control an actuator for \nirrigation. \nThe application of the\
    \ Internet of Things in agriculture is not limited to reading \nenvironmental\
    \ parameters and then taking corresponding irrigation or fertilization measures.\
    \ \nThe information collected by smart devices in the Internet of Things can be\
    \ accurately analyzed \nto improve agricultural productivity. Elijah et al.(2018)classified\
    \ the analysis into the following \ncategories. \nPrediction. The huge quantity\
    \ of environmental data such as moisture and temperature \ncollected by sensor\
    \ nodes and other smart devices in an IoT network can be used to develop \npredictive\
    \ algorithms to notify when diseases, drought, flood or fire is about to happen.\
    \ \nInventory management. In terms of storing agriproducts, external moisture\
    \ and \ntemperature can influence the quality of products significantly. In this\
    \ scenario, sensor nodes \nare deployed in inventory to collect this information.\
    \ After the data analysis has been sent to the \ncloud and analysis has been conducted,\
    \ automatic command will be sent for adjusting the \ncondition of inventory. This\
    \ practice can reduce the negative influence of spoilage and pests on \nfood quality.\
    \ \nDecision making. Big data obtained from sensors provides learning opportunities\
    \ to \nimprove decision-making for changing environmental conditions. An ideal\
    \ outcome of this \nanalysis is automatic decision-making by IoT systems involving\
    \ few human interventions, \nwhich could set the workers free from repetitive\
    \ work. \nInsurance. Agricultural activities are vulnerable to natural disasters.\
    \ IoT devices \ndeployed in remote areas can notify farmers or insurance companies\
    \ when a hazard or disaster \n \n22 \nis detected, reminding them to settle claims.\
    \ When extreme weather or another condition is \ndetected, access to information\
    \ by an insurance company can allow the company to make \nautomatic direct payment\
    \ to policyholders, initiated by the IoT system (Elijah, Rahman, \nOrikumhi, Leow,\
    \ & Hindia, 2018). \nUtilizing ICT sensor networks for collecting data from farmland\
    \ assists the farmers to \nmatch cropping practices to climatic trends, to use\
    \ inputs and resources more sustainably and \nreduce environmental impact, and\
    \ to cope with productivity threats. Moreover, it can enable \npublic officials\
    \ to integrate the data across the country and to adjust policies to reflect the\
    \ data \ncollected, to predict food supplies, and to target social programs or\
    \ promote yield technologies \n(World Bank, 2017). \n3.6 How do crops interact\
    \ with the external environment? \n3.6.1 Environmental factors \nWater and temperature\
    \ \nUnfavorable water and thermal conditions could sharply reduce crop yields.\
    \ For \nexample, excessively high temperature proved to have negative effect on\
    \ the yield of maize \n(Carter et al., 2016) and at the same time low-temperature\
    \ stress may damage photosynthesis \n(Oquist, 1983).Excessive high or low temperature\
    \ would impede the activity of enzymes, and \naffect the efficiency of metabolism\
    \ of plants.  \nAgriculture is one of the major consumer industries in the world\
    \ (Cazadilla et al., 2010). \nTwo aspects related to water consumption should\
    \ be considered, the direct effects of water \ncontent on crop growth, and the\
    \ economic cost of using water. In agribusiness, the term water \nproductivity\
    \ (WP), defined as the amount of yield produced per unit volume of water (\U0001D458\
    \U0001D454/\U0001D45A3), \nis often used to assess the efficiency of water usage\
    \ (Patil et al., 2015). Therefore, higher yield \nwith smaller water input can\
    \ be regarded as success in improving the productivity of crops. \nRespiration\
    \ by soil microorganisms can increase with increasing irrigation under water stress,\
    \ \nbut excessive irrigation can suppress soil respiration under the condition\
    \ of flooding (Wang, \nZhao, & Ouyang, 2010). For the crops, changes in atmospheric\
    \ moisture can alter the way their \nstomata work, and in turn the process of\
    \ plant transpiration, energy balance and tissue \ntemperatures (Grantz, 1990).\
    \ In some cases, the combination of high temperature and high \n \n23 \nvapor\
    \ pressure deficits could result in crops wilting when the water that crops take\
    \ up from soil \ncannot make up for the evaporation loss into the air (Carter,\
    \ Melkonian, Riha, & Shaw, 2016).  \nSoil nutrients \nSoil nutrients can be divided\
    \ into three types according to the amount that plants need \nduring for growth:\
    \ primary nutrients, secondary nutrients and micro-nutrients (Moore & \nBradley,\
    \ 2018). Fertilizer can be considered as a supplement to the original deficiencies\
    \ in the \nsoil, and the amount of fertilizers added to the soil should be precisely\
    \ calculated and controlled. \nN, P, and K are the most limiting factors in crop\
    \ production (primary nutrients) (Warpe & \nPippal, 2016).However, excessive application\
    \ of N-P-K fertilizers would lead to degradation of \nboth soil and water quality,\
    \ and production of crops. For example, nitrate leaching from the \nirrigated\
    \ farmland may move to lakes and groundwater, and then result in eutrophication\
    \ in \nlakes and nitrogen pollution in groundwater (Ju et al., 2007; Savci, 2012).\
    \ This practice in \ncontrolling the volume and usage of fertilizer is coined\
    \ as fertilizer management, which takes \nenvironmental, agronomic and economic\
    \ effects into consideration (Matson, Naylor, & Ortiz-\nMonasterio, 1998). \n\
    Soil pH \nA major issue regarding soil pH in agribusiness is soil acidity, resulting\
    \ from diverse \ncauses. For example, the parent rock material may enter soil\
    \ or groundwater due to weathering \n(Xu, 2015). Another cause of acidification\
    \ emerging in recent decades is the excessive use of \nchemical fertilizers. Common\
    \ chemicals found in artificial fertilizers, including ammonium \nsulfate, ammonium\
    \ phosphate, potassium nitrate, and ammonium nitrate have proven to be able \n\
    to lead to increase in H+ concentration in farmland soil (Pierre, 1928). A direct\
    \ effect of higher \nconcentration of H+ on soil is that activities and metabolism\
    \ of the microbes in soil could be \naffected. Altered soil pH may create conditions\
    \ that are less optimal for microbes or plants. \nExtreme pH could even inactivate\
    \ them. Some researchers have demonstrated the correlation \nbetween the soil\
    \ enzyme activity and crop yield (Tautges, Sullivan, Reardon, & Burke, 2016).\
    \ \nThere is another indirect effect that H+ could have on the soil. Higher concentration\
    \ of H+ \ncould change the form in which aluminum (and other metals) exist in\
    \ soil, and can increase the \n \n24 \nsolubility of Al+3in soil pore water (Gazey\
    \ & Azam, 2018). Excessive aluminum can lead to \nthe death of aquatic organisms,\
    \ the wilting of terrestrial plants, the reduction of crop yields, and \nthe decline\
    \ of forests (Weng, Huang, Liu, & Sato, 2000). Research conducted by Abruña-\n\
    Rodríguezet al. (1982) showed that higher concentrations of H+ and Al+3, decreased\
    \ the yield \nof crops like yam and cassava relative to their maximum yield. \
    \ \nSoil microbes \n \nSoil microbes consist of the fungi and bacteria in soil.\
    \ Soil microbes maintain or alter \nthe microscopic soil physical and chemical\
    \ properties by their metabolic activities, including \nthe soil properties in\
    \ the plant rhizosphere, influencing the efficiency with which plants are able\
    \ \nto utilize the soil nutrients (Sessitsch & Mitter, 2015). There is increasing\
    \ evidence that \nbiotechnology using microbes or their metabolites can enhance\
    \ nutrient uptake and yield of \ncrops, control pests and reduce plant stress\
    \ responses (Trivedi, Schenk, Wallenstein, & Singh, \n2017). At the same time,\
    \ research conducted by Gu et al. (2009)showed that a combination N-\nP-K fertilizer\
    \ could increase soil microbial biomass, diversify bacterial communities, and\
    \ \nmaintain crop production.  \nSoil depth \nResearch conducted by Khakural et\
    \ al.(1996)shows that the fertility of deeper soil can \ncontribute much to crop\
    \ yield than the fertility of topsoil. Williams et al. (1999) found that \nunder\
    \ sub-optimal living conditions, the properties of topsoil are definitely important\
    \ for \npredicting crop yield, while the properties of subsoil are relatively\
    \ more important in limiting \ncrop yields under normal conditions (Williams,\
    \ Ahuja, Naney, Ross, & Barnes, 1987). \nFarmland slope \n \nFarmland in sloping\
    \ area tends to have a thinner layer of soil (Atherton, Morgan, \nShearer, Stombaugh,\
    \ & Ward, 1999). Steep slopes are more vulnerable to soil erosion, therefore \n\
    soil layer on the slope is usually thinner, and the soil water content and soil\
    \ fertility are also \nrelatively poor (Mohammadi, Jalali, Kooch, & Said-Pullicino,\
    \ 2016), although Yang et \nal.(1998)found that the slope of farmland can have\
    \ a positively significant relationship with \nyield of wheat. \n \n25 \n3.7 Cultural\
    \ factors \n \nCommon cultural practices in agriculture include irrigation patterns,\
    \ fertilizer \napplication, planting spacing and density, intensity of various\
    \ routine agricultural practices, and \nharvesting time. The mechanism by which\
    \ some of these practices is able to influence crop \nyield is by modifying the\
    \ availability of sunlight (Atherton, Morgan, Shearer, Stombaugh, & \nWard, 1999).\
    \ Pathiratna et al.(2004)conducted several experiments to study the effects of\
    \ \nfertilizer, spacing and shade on the growth and yield of Aerva lanata. Results\
    \ from these \nexperiments showed that crops treated with organic and inorganic\
    \ fertilizers could produce \nhigher dry matter yields. Crops established with\
    \ a closer spacing have lower yield and growth \nthan those with wider planting\
    \ spacing, if yield per area is not considered. Ashraf and Saeed \n(2006) compared\
    \ two different irrigation methods in an area with saline groundwater. The \n\
    result shows that root zone of the crops which are treated with alternative, reduced-frequency\
    \ \nfurrow irrigation has smaller accumulation of salt than that with regular\
    \ furrow irrigation \n(Ashraf & Saeed, 2006). The planting date of a crop is fundamental\
    \ information for the \nmodeling of planting activities. It can be calculated\
    \ based on historical weather information \n(Dobor et al., 2016). Research conducted\
    \ by Kucharik (2008) in the United States shows that \nthe planting date, especially\
    \ the timing of planting the seeds has a significant impact on yield of \nmaize.\
    \ \nApart from the factors above, Krebs (1984)mentioned that there are some major\
    \ ways \nthat crops yield can be improved, including (1) improved quality of crop\
    \ varieties, (2) improved \nresistance to diseases, (3) improved resistance to\
    \ insects, and (4) adaptation to climatic \ncondition. \nThese known factors provide\
    \ direction for researchers and farm operators to improve \ncrops yield and labor\
    \ productivity. Among these factors, soil properties that can be measured by \n\
    sensors include soil moisture, concentration of specific ions required for plant\
    \ growth, and soil \nelectrical conductivity. Lab test and insitu measurements\
    \ on these soil properties of their \ncorresponding sensors are well matched.\
    \ However, for a lot of soil nutrients and soil organic \nmatter, there are not\
    \ reliable sensors for measurement.  \n \n26 \n3.8 Integration of sensor networks\
    \ with other ICT products for boosting production in \nagriculture \nAgriculture\
    \ is an important sector for the continuous growth of developing countries, \n\
    especially large agricultural countries. More than 80% of those who live in remote\
    \ areas are \nengaged in agriculture. The World Bank provided a guideline to guarantee\
    \ the security of \nreliable and stable access to nutritious, affordable food,\
    \ with access resilient to climate change. \nAs the World Bank pointed out in\
    \ a report, increasing the output of the agriculture, forestry, \nanimal husbandry\
    \ and fishery industries requires: 1) utilizing insitu technologies to characterize\
    \ \nfield conditions, in order to provide the optimal resources for plant growth.\
    \ These farming \npractices, after optimization, would result in more sustainable\
    \ and profitable farming; 2) \neliminating yield losses through early warning\
    \ systems. This revolves around identifying the \ninfection, disease, and upcoming\
    \ bad weather. \nMost farmers have access to the means of production and yield\
    \ enhancing technologies \nthat can help them increase their crop yields, such\
    \ as fertilizers and pesticides. Meanwhile, \nsometimes they do not know how to\
    \ use these products in a proper way. Although these \nproducts are usually equipped\
    \ with instructions, different application scenarios always have \ndifferent applicable\
    \ standards, with no universal standard practice. In this case, ICT technology\
    \ \ncan fill the gap of farmers' knowledge. With the help of ICT farmers can use\
    \ the optimal \nsolution for consuming resources in agriculture(World Bank, 2017).\
    \ \nIn agricultural production, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) are often used\
    \ in \nconjunction with ICT sensor networks. UAV is very suitable for spraying\
    \ pesticides and \nfertilizers due to its high speed and spraying efficiency (Costa\
    \ et al., 2012). However, as is \nmentioned in Faiçal et al.’s work(2014), the\
    \ working route of a UAV spraying pesticides or \nfertilizer is prone to being\
    \ disturbed by wind.The architecture and workflow of Costa’s \nUAV+sensor networks\
    \ monitoring system was similar to that of Faiçal et al.The UAV has to \ncommunicate\
    \ with sensor nodes on the ground periodically to make sure that it’s in the proper\
    \ \nlocation (Costa et al., 2012). \nZhang et al. (2015) designed a three-tiered\
    \ UAV farmland sensor network (TUFSN) for \ncapturing information. Figure 2is\
    \ an illustration of their network architecture. The data \ncollection layer on\
    \ the ground is where the distributed sensor network can monitor the external\
    \ \n \n27 \nenvironment and grab information. In this layer, a large number of\
    \ sensor nodes are deployed to \nstrengthen the monitoring of a target data collecting\
    \ area. Another feature of this layer is self-\norganization. Layered protocols\
    \ and distributed algorithms allow wireless sensor nodes to \nautonomously schedule\
    \ their work processes. When deployed to a specific area and activated, \nthe\
    \ corresponding network can be organized automatically. The relay transmission\
    \ layer \nconsists of a network established between the relay node and the UAV\
    \ mobile node. This layer \nhas the following characteristics: 1) simple structure:\
    \ direct communication between UAV and \nthe data collection layer; 2) more energy\
    \ available: the data collection layer is generally \npowered by solar energy\
    \ so that UAV can be powered by rechargeable batteries; 3) stable and \nreliable:\
    \ UAV communicates with the ground data collection layer in the air. The possibility\
    \ of \nbeing blocked by plants or houses in the middle is low, and the packet\
    \ loss rate will be reduced; \n4) Long communication distance: the communication\
    \ quality is good, and it can provide larger \npower antenna coverage. The mobile\
    \ convergence layer consists of a single or multiple UAVs \nand a network established\
    \ between data centres. UAV and data centres are directly connected \nby a cellular\
    \ data network. The mobile convergence layer network has a very long \ncommunication\
    \ distance, has error detection and packet loss retransmission functions, and\
    \ \nsupports real-time or delayed data transmission. Compared with the traditional\
    \ static WSN, in \nterms of economic efficiency, this architecture is more suitable\
    \ for scattered land, hills and \nmountains, and the ground wireless sensor network\
    \ has difficulty or is unable to form a \ncomplete network due to natural environment\
    \ constraints. They are divided into multiple \nindependent networks. The limitation\
    \ of this system is that flight missions are performed only \nwhen data are needed,\
    \ so the frequency of UAV flights determines the frequency of data \nupdates (Zhang\
    \ et al., 2015). \n \n28 \n \nFigure 2. Three-tiered UAV farmland sensor network\
    \ by Zhang et al. (2015) \nApart from the sensor networks studied in this article,\
    \ image-based techniques are \nanother major part of the ICT solutions applied\
    \ in agriculture. Remote sensing is a hit. In \ngeneral, remote sensing technology\
    \ refers to acquiring image information about an object in a \nnon-invasive way,\
    \ without actually coming into contact with it, from a physically high altitude\
    \ \nand a macro perspective (Horning, 2008). \nWhen applied to agriculture, the\
    \ major role of remote sensing technology is to collect \nraw data from farmland.\
    \ The methods of obtaining data and the form of data from mobile \nphones include\
    \ aerial images taken by airplane, helicopter, radio-controlled aircraft, and\
    \ \nunmanned aerial vehicles; satellite images captured by satellites in orbit;\
    \ surface GPS receivers \nand satellite linkage to obtain positioning information;\
    \ laser scanning, using a set of laser beams \nto measure accurate elevation,\
    \ i.e. the distance from an aircraft to features on the ground, \npruning the\
    \ disturbance of trees and buildings on the ground. This means that when measuring\
    \ \nthe elevation of sensing aircraft, ground elevation under tree canopy can\
    \ be measured (World \nBank, 2017).After data are collected by remote sensing\
    \ technology, the following analytic tools \nare used to provide a deeper understanding\
    \ of the farmland system being studied. With spatial \nmodeling, existing data\
    \ can be used to simulate the real-world farmland. Using data mining \ntechniques,\
    \ patterns of crops, such as their growth rate characteristics can be extracted\
    \ from the \ndata set. \n \n29 \nThe workflow of collecting and analysing image-based\
    \ data has been widely used in \nagriculture. Reinecke and Prinsloo(2017)designed\
    \ a system, using drones to capture aerial \nphotos of plant leaf. These data\
    \ were used to determine whether the crops were healthy. \nHonkavaara et al.(2013)used\
    \ drones to take aerial images at pre-set time intervals at the \nbeginning of\
    \ the crop growing season, during the season, and before harvest to check the\
    \ \ngrowth of the entire field and highlight growth stagnation caused by insufficient\
    \ irrigation or \nlow initial nitrogen content. Biossard et al. (2008)provided\
    \ a technique based on automatic \ninterpretation applied to images of rose leaves\
    \ scanned in situ. They propose a cognitive vision \nsystem that combines image\
    \ processing, learning, and knowledge-based technologies. The \nsystem is able\
    \ to detect and count white flies (Trialeurode Vaporariorum Westwood) at \nmaturity.\
    \ This technology provides early warning for pest management so that measures\
    \ can be \ntaken to reduce losses before the pests become severe.  \nApplication\
    \ of remote sensing technology is not limited to identifying bad weather, \nplant\
    \ disease and pests. On a smaller scale, this technology is widely used on individual\
    \ crops, \nsuch as for classification of vegetables, fruits, and livestock. Traditionally,\
    \ the classification \nwork is often finished by the human workers who are well\
    \ trained and experienced. However, \nthere are some disadvantages to relying\
    \ on the human workforce for classification. For example, \nthe classifying worker\
    \ may feel tired or lose concentration and then lower the accuracy of \nclassification.\
    \ Ideally, there should be a standard diagram for the workers to refer to when\
    \ \nclassifying, which will increase difficulty of work. Also, raters are prone\
    \ to various illusions \n(Barbedo, 2013). Therefore, image processing techniques\
    \ are needed for these tasks to relieve \nworkload.  \nGastelum-Barrios et al.(2011)reviewed\
    \ newly emergent non-invasive image processing \nmethods in determining the quality\
    \ of fruits during and after the harvesting period, and \nconcluded that it is\
    \ a high-efficiency and harmless solution to grade the fruits. Singh et al. \n\
    (2011)customized an automated classifier of four different bamboo species based\
    \ on shape \nfeatures of bamboo Culm sheath, using the central moment classifier.\
    \ Their classifier for \nbamboo shows considerable recognition accuracy, which\
    \ has great potential on saving labour of \nmanually recognizing bamboo species.\
    \ This outcome proved the possibility of putting this \ntechnology into commercial\
    \ use. Latha et al.(2014) implemented an image processing function \n \n30 \n\
    to detect weed areas. Once the function was equipped onto pesticide sprayers,\
    \ the automatic \nsprayers can target these blocks covered by weed. This not only\
    \ saves pesticides, but also \navoids generating agricultural waste, and additional\
    \ effects on the environment and other plants \ncaused by excessive use. \nPatil\
    \ (2011) designed a measuring method for leaf area based on image processing \n\
    techniques. A traditional graphic measuring method was used to verify the accuracy\
    \ of \nmeasuring leaf area using image processing. The new method proved to have\
    \ high precision \nand accuracy and take less processing time. This result provided\
    \ a theoretical basis for the \ndevelopment of an imagery leaf area meter that\
    \ meets the requirements of precision farming. \nXu et al. (2011)developed an\
    \ algorithm that can tell whether the plants are suffering \nfrom nutrient deficiency,\
    \ by recognizing the color and texture of the leaf. The accuracy of this \ndiagnostic\
    \ algorithm was above 82.5% and it was able to diagnose disease 6–10 days before\
    \ \nexperts could determine it. Arakeri et al. (2015)implemented a system which\
    \ provided early \nwarning to detect diseases on tomatoes. Tomatoes are very prone\
    \ to a disease called late blight, \nwhich happens when leaves get infected with\
    \ Phytophthora infestans fungus. Typical \nsymptoms of fungus infection include\
    \ irregularly shaped leaves and water-soaked lesions. This \nalert system was\
    \ able to recognize whether a leaf was ill or healthy, and whether the leaf had\
    \ \ncontracted the Phytophthora infestans fungus. The accuracy of analyzing the\
    \ late blight disease \nwas 84%. Chen et al. (2014)proposed an effective method\
    \ for judging the nutrient content of \ncrops. They extracted characteristic parameters\
    \ from years of images of healthy leaves and \nnutritionally deficient leaves.\
    \ They were able to determine from an image of a rice leaf whether \nthe plant\
    \ was deficient in N, P, and K based on the attributes of leaf sheath length,\
    \ leaf area / \nleaf length, leaf tip, leaf lightness, etc. The average identification\
    \ accuracy of this method for \nassessing N/P/K deficiencies was around 88%.In\
    \ 2019, Chen et al. optimized the algorithm of \nthis detection method, and the\
    \ average accuracy of recognition increased to 93.4%. \nApplication of image-based\
    \ technologies is not limited to crop assessment; it is \napplicable in animal\
    \ husbandry as well. Image processing systems have been widely used in \nmonitoring\
    \ livestock for many applications, including identification, tracking, behavior\
    \ analysis, \noccupancy rates, and activity calculations. Kashiha et al. (2014)designed\
    \ an image processing \nsystem for checking whether hens were staying inside the\
    \ chambers. This system could save \n \n31 \nmuch time on manually analysing videos\
    \ for monitoring hen chambers. Pradana et al. \n(2016)designed a method to accurately\
    \ estimate the weight of cattle, by visually measuring the \nbody length, chest\
    \ circumstance, height and width. Wongsriworaphon et al. (2012)conducted \nsimilar\
    \ research, but their focus was to recognize individual pigs based on their size\
    \ and weight. \nAppendix Table A2 from Gong (2010) compares the differences of\
    \ the node sensors \nfrom the perspective of price, reliability, performance and\
    \ power consumption. This table also \nlists some environmental parameters that\
    \ can be measured by available sensors, such as \ntemperature, carbon dioxide\
    \ concentration, and relative humidity. \n3.9 A case study illustrating use of\
    \ UAV and ICT sensor networks in sustainable agriculture \nThe system Faiçal et\
    \ al. (2014)designed for the linkage of unmanned aerial vehicles \n(UAV) and ICT\
    \ sensor networks for spraying pesticides is a typical application in agriculture,\
    \ \nand is described in detail in subsections below to illustrate the use. \n\
    3.9.1 Research background \n \nSpraying pesticides and fertilizers in farmland\
    \ is vital for crop yields. Aircrafts are \nbecoming more common and popular for\
    \ this task, mainly because of the speed and efficiency \nof aircraft spray operations.\
    \ However, certain factors may reduce yield and even cause damage. \nFor example,\
    \ the spraying process might miss some crop areas, repeat spraying in the same\
    \ \ncrop area, and apply pesticides to the outer edges of the farmland. This study\
    \ proposed an \narchitecture based on unmanned aerial vehicles that could be employed\
    \ to implement a control \nloop for agricultural applications with UAVs responsible\
    \ for spraying chemicals on crops. An \nalgorithm to adjust the UAV’s motion routes\
    \ when confronted with constantly changing wind \nwas also assessed in this work.\
    \ \n3.9.2 Methods and procedure \n \nIn this solution, an unmanned aerial vehicle\
    \ and several sensor nodes are deployed in \nthe farmland. The function of the\
    \ sensor mainly includes obtaining the current concentration of \nthe pesticide\
    \ chemical from the soil. Sensor nodes also communicate with the drone in the\
    \ air at \nany time to help the UAV verify its real-time position to avoid crossing\
    \ a boundary and \nspraying where it should not, or spraying an area repeatedly,\
    \ resulting in excessively high \n \n32 \nconcentrations of pesticides in a small\
    \ area causing damage to the crop. If the sensor detects \nexcess chemicals, the\
    \ drone in the air will be directed away from this area of excessive \nconcentration.\
    \ The role of the drone is relatively simple, it receives the concentration \n\
    information on the ground and judges whether it is necessary to spray. \nThe researchers\
    \ used the following steps to ensure that UAV sprayed pesticides where \nappropriate.\
    \ (1) The algorithm sends a message periodically to query sensor nodes scattered\
    \ \nthroughout the farmland. A sensor node located at a previous location of the\
    \ drone responds to \nthis message with information about the amount of pesticide.\
    \ (2) With this information, the \ndrone can calculate the difference in pesticide\
    \ concentration between each sensor node. (3) If \nthe difference is larger than\
    \ the predetermined threshold, the algorithm will re-plan the route, \notherwise\
    \ it will continue to advance in the predefined path and wait for the next round\
    \ of query. \nRegarding the robustness of this proposed algorithm for spraying\
    \ pesticides, the following \naspects were assessed. \nCalibration of UAV routes.\
    \ An unmanned aerial vehicle is influenced by wind when it is \nworking. A dataset\
    \ containing information about wind direction and intensity was used to \nreproduce\
    \ the constantly changing weather conditions, and check if the UAV was able to\
    \ \nhandle the changes. Also, considering the nature of the linkage of ICT sensor\
    \ network and \nUAV in this project, whether the number of message exchanges between\
    \ the two terminals \nwould improve performance was evaluated. \nMapping the pesticide\
    \ concentration. ICT sensor networks provide location information \nand information\
    \ on chemical concentrations to the UAV. However, in practice, crops may not \n\
    get the appropriate amount of pesticide. Possible reasons are the UAV may be flying\
    \ too fast, or \nthe pesticide spraying process may be disturbed by wind. Therefore,\
    \ given the information \nabout nodes location and their corresponding chemical\
    \ concentration, a complete map of \npesticide concentration distribution can\
    \ be drawn. A heat map is an illustration of pesticide \ndistribution, where green\
    \ represents higher concentrations, and red low concentrations (Figure \n3). For\
    \ the spraying system in this study, an ideal outcome is that each node of it\
    \ has the same \nor similar color. \n \n33 \n \nFigure 3. Map after the application\
    \ of the interpolation technique (Faiçal et al., 2014) \nPotential correlation\
    \ between UAV height and spray coverage. Researchers speculate \nthat drones need\
    \ to fly to a certain altitude when spraying to get the best spray effect. There\
    \ \nmay be a relationship between the spray angle / coverage and the height of\
    \ the drone, meaning \nthat the higher the UAV’s altitude, the larger the area\
    \ covered by the spray may be. \n3.9.3 Case study results \n \nFigure 4is a map\
    \ of pesticide concentrations after actual testing. Higher uniform the \ncolors\
    \ of this map represents higher stability and robustness of the algorithm, and\
    \ this feature \nlets the vehicle to be more resistant to wind disturbance. Most\
    \ areas of the farmland were \nsprayed with similar concentrations of pesticides,\
    \ leaving only several small clusters with \ninsufficient pesticide concentrations.\
    \ Researchers assessed the relationship between time \nrequired for communicating\
    \ with sensor nodes on the ground and height of the UAV, and the \ncorrelation\
    \ turned out to be insignificant. \n \nFigure 4. Map after the application of\
    \ the threshold value (Faiçal et al., 2014) \n3.9.4 Case study summary \nThis\
    \ project provided a practical example of the combination of ICT sensor networks\
    \ \nand some other ICT solutions, aiming to make agricultural activities to be\
    \ more precise. \nAccording to the result of assessing with simulation tools,\
    \ the algorithm designed for the \ncollaboration between UAV and ICT sensor networks\
    \ proved to work well. After further insitu \ntesting procedures, it would be\
    \ possible to utilize the system to improve sustainability in crop \nproduction\
    \ (Faiçal et al., 2014). \n \n \n34 \n4. Methodology \nThis study consists of\
    \ two parts designed to answer the research questions. The first part \nis to\
    \ simulate the performance (which is indicated by annual yield in this study)\
    \ of a farm where \nICT sensor networks are deployed. The second part is to conduct\
    \ a meta-analysis on the \noutcomes of existing studies and publications. \n4.1\
    \ Data sources \nData and information for this study were collected by two major\
    \ means, (1) published \nacademic papers that discussed the change in crop yield\
    \ of specific ICT sensor networks-based \nfarms; and (2) contacting the companies\
    \ who provide ICT sensor networks solutions for details \nof how the solutions\
    \ they provide work and performance data of their service. \n4.1.1 Samples overview\
    \ \n \nThis study examines how the annual crop yield would change, when ICT sensor\
    \ \nnetworks are deployed to control usage of water, fertilizer, and pesticide.\
    \ Therefore, the sample \nfarms in this study all use ICT sensor networks to control\
    \ one or more of these agricultural \nresource usages. Figure shows the distribution\
    \ of where the selected farms are located. The \ninvolved crop types in this study\
    \ include maize, grape, rice. \n \nFigure 5. Geographical distribution of the\
    \ farms involved \n \nYara Water Solution is a part of a Farm Management System\
    \ offered by Yara Inc.in \nNorway, which can enable the farmers to save irrigation\
    \ water. This solution provides a \ncontinuous and non-destructive way of measuring\
    \ plant status. It uses sensors to measure the \nNorth America, 36%\nEurope, 36%\n\
    Asia, 8%\nAustralia, 16%\nSouth America, 4%\n \n35 \nturgor pressure of the plants’\
    \ leaves to determine if plants are deficient in water, and then \nmakes a decision\
    \ on whether to irrigate. The service provider of Yara Water Solution claims \n\
    that with this solution, the irrigation water consumption would drop by 20% while\
    \ yield \nincreases by 15%. Also, this solution will help save maintenance work\
    \ and corresponding \nenergy consumed (Yara, 2018). \nAtfarm (2018) monitors the\
    \ growth of fields with images taken remotely from satellite. \nIt makes it possible\
    \ for users to compare with images from previous years and to benchmark the \n\
    development of crops. Its performance of saving resources and boosting crop yield\
    \ is similar to \nYara (Atfarm, 2018). \nAccenture has been providing digital-based\
    \ farm services to farm owners for years. \nThese services are helping to improve\
    \ financial performance and to boost yield. Accenture \nDigital Agriculture Services\
    \ can help both large and small farms use digital technology to \nimprove processes,\
    \ increase yields and increase profitability to meet growing global food \ndemand\
    \ and to reduce the overall environmental impact of agriculture. Digital Agriculture\
    \ \nService can help increase overall profitability by $55 to $110 per acre (Accenture,\
    \ 2017). \nThe Field Manager created by Xarvio digital farming solutions supports\
    \ the users to \nknow better about the farmland they are working. The Manager\
    \ can provide real-time \ninformation of water and nutrition and can generate\
    \ a map for better visualization. Spray Timer \nis a product of the Field Manager\
    \ scheme. As is stated on the official website, Spray Timer can \nsave the amount\
    \ of pesticide application by up to 30% (Xarvio Digital FArming Solutions, \n\
    2020). \nDSS4Ag is an expert system for precision farming research. This system\
    \ uses advanced \nartificial intelligence and computer science technology to make\
    \ spatially variable fertilizer use \nand economically optimal decisions for specific\
    \ locations. Field testing was conducted in a \nwheat farmland, and the result\
    \ showed a 39.7% cost saving using the DSS4Ag as compared to \nthose blocks managed\
    \ by the farm’s traditional uniform applications practices, with only a 3.3% \n\
    decrease in yield (Hoskinson, Hess, & Fink, 1999). \nWhiteley implemented a precision\
    \ farming technology to monitor and control pesticide \napplication. The research\
    \ found that the estimated saving on pesticide can be as much as 80% \nof the\
    \ original application (Whiteley, 2002). \n \n36 \nA closed-loop, distributed\
    \ control and data acquisition system for site-specific irrigation \nmanagement\
    \ was introduced and developed by Wang & Li (2013). The system is formed by a\
    \ \ngroup of stationary field sensing nodes deployed in a field and a group of\
    \ nodes, called P2K \nnodes. These nodes collected the data from the field and\
    \ the central pivot system and \ntransmitted them to a master controller through\
    \ a power-line carrier communication. The \nsystem performance was compared with\
    \ a conventional uniform irrigation treatment in a potato \nfield. Results showed\
    \ that, with essentially equal water consumption, the tuber yield under site-\n\
    specific irrigation management was significantly greater, by about 4%, than the\
    \ yield from \nuniform irrigation (Wang & Li, 2013). \nBongiovanni and Lowenberg-DeBoer\
    \ (2004)summarized the research carried out by \nWeisz et al.(1996)regarding the\
    \ performance of ICT sensor networks in controlling the amount \nof pesticide\
    \ applied in a commercial potato farmland. With the site-specific pest management\
    \ \nprogram, the input amount of pesticide in this experimental area dropped by\
    \ up to 40%. \nBausch and Delgado (2003)built an application to figure out if\
    \ it is feasible to use \nground-based sensing and the N Reflectance Index to\
    \ improve in-season N management of corn \nin a commercial sprinkler-irrigated\
    \ field. The results indicated that the application could reduce \nthe consumption\
    \ of nitrogen fertilizer by 47%. \nIn much of the literature that discusses ICT\
    \ sensor networks in farms, the effects of \nusing this service have not been\
    \ clearly described. To describe the performance of this type of \nfarm and the\
    \ benefits of wireless sensor networks, two indicators should be provided - the\
    \ \npercentage of agricultural resources that can be saved (e.g. water, fertilizer,\
    \ or pesticide), and \nthe effect on crop yield. Some of the articles reviewed\
    \ reported both indicators, while some of \nthem only provided one or neither\
    \ of these indicators.  \n4.2 Simulation \n \nIn this study, one of the aims was\
    \ to investigate the possible response to the equipment \nof ICT sensor networks\
    \ in farms for controlling the consumption of means of production in \nagriculture.\
    \ Before this predictive what-if analysis begins, the raw data collected from\
    \ \npublications and service providers have to be cleaned and formatted well according\
    \ to the \nmethodologies in the following paragraph.  \n \n37 \nThe collected\
    \ data are about the amount and percentage that usage of agricultural \nresources\
    \ including irrigation water, fertilizer and pesticide can be saved and reduced\
    \ by the \nwireless sensor networks solution in farm, and the amount and percentage\
    \ that crop yield can be \nimproved with the solutions. Apart from the numeric\
    \ data, location and crop type are recorded \nas well. These two attributes are\
    \ regarded as independent factors on sensor network \nperformance. \nThe first\
    \ step of data cleaning is to normalize all the raw data into the same value range,\
    \ \nand at the same time keeping the original relative deviation. In this case,\
    \ all the extents of \nchange in crop yield and resource usage are converted to\
    \ a value of percentage, which is the \n“final state” after ICT sensor networks\
    \ interfering with the crop production activities. These \nnormalized variables\
    \ include incremental changes in crop yield with ICT sensor networks, \npercentage\
    \ of saved resources, location, crop type, and information source. Table 1 is\
    \ an \nillustration of the details that will be analysed. \nTable 1. Illustration\

    \ Table 2, for some samples, one or more columns are missing. For this \nissue,\
    \ a R package called missForest is used for filling the missing values. This package\
    \ can \nhandle multivariate data consisting of continuous and categorical variables\
    \ simultaneously. This \nfeature matches the variable type of the dataset in this\
    \ study. Also, when applying this \nalgorithm, there is no need in setting tuning\
    \ parameters or making assumptions in data \ndistribution. The full potential\
    \ of missForest is deployed when the data include complex \ninteractions or non-linear\
    \ relations between variables of unequal scales and different types \n(Stekhoven\
    \ & Bühlmann, 2012).In other words, in contrast to the traditional way of using\
    \ \naverage or median values of missing data missForest uses a predictive algorithm\
    \ based on a \nrandom forest trained on the observed values to predict the missing\
    \ values. This will increase \nthe accuracy of estimated missing values. So far,\
    \ all the data used from here has been filled \n \n39 \nwith missing values with\
    \ missForest, and all variables have been normalized to the same value \nrange.\
    \ \nFor the modeling process, as is proposed in the methodology chapter, the first\
    \ step of \nmodeling was to preclude the statistical influence of locations on\
    \ the performance of ICT \nsensor networks. For this analysis, the General Linear\
    \ Model (GLM) Univariate procedure, \nwhich is based on the General Linear Model\
    \ procedure, was used for testing the significance of \nthe correlation of crop\
    \ production increasing and where the farms equipped with ICT sensor \nnetworks\
    \ are located. To assess the impact of location, general linear regression was\
    \ run with \nthe fixed factors being set as location. If the test statistic is\
    \ outside of the confidence intervals, \nthen the factor has a significant effect\
    \ on the response variable. In this study, the statistical \nsignificance of the\
    \ correlation between location and ICT sensor networks performance can be \nassessed\
    \ by this test. The statistical software used for this step was SPSS. In the GLM\
    \ \nregression setting in SPSS, the increased percentage of yield was set as the\
    \ dependent variable, \nand the percentage of water/fertilizer/pesticide saved\
    \ by ICT sensor network-based farms were \nset as covariates. This means that\
    \ the change in crop yield is the result of combined changes in \nusage of agricultural\
    \ input, controlled by ICT sensor networks.  \n \nThe following central issue\
    \ is to fit a function based on collected data. In this step, \nrandom forest\
    \ was used as the basis model for simulating how the farmland would respond with\
    \ \nICT sensor networks equipped on site. Random forest is a classifier consisting\
    \ of a collection of \ntree-structured classifiers {ℎ(\U0001D465, Θ\U0001D458\
    ),\U0001D458 = 1,… } where the {Θ\U0001D458} are independent identically \ndistributed\
    \ random vectors and each tree casts a unit vote for the most popular class at\
    \ input \U0001D465. \nWhen it comes to continuous numeric values instead of classification\
    \ questions, the random \nforest model works as well. Random forests for regression\
    \ are formed by growing trees \ndepending on a random vector Θ such that the tree\
    \ predictor ℎ(\U0001D465, Θ) takes on numerical values \nas opposed to class labels\
    \ (Breiman, 2001). This regressor fits classifying decision trees on \nvarious\
    \ sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy\
    \ and \ncontrol over-fitting (Pedregosa et al., 2011).  \nIn terms of implementation\
    \ of this simulation, a Python package called Scikit-learn was \nused. Scikit-learn\
    \ provides a functional implementation of the random forest regressor model, \n\
    RandomForestRegressor, which is written in Python. To optimize the accuracy of\
    \ modeling, \n \n40 \nparameters including, but not limited to, the number of\
    \ decision trees, maximum depth, \nminimum number of samples required to be at\
    \ a leaf node can be set to the model instance \n(scikit-learn, 2019). This implementation\
    \ has a class method score, which calculates the \ncoefficient of value (1 −\n\
    \U0001D462\n\U0001D463), where \U0001D462 is the residual sum of squares of the\
    \ difference between \nreal value and predicted value, and \U0001D463 is the total\
    \ sum of squares of the difference (Pedregosa et \nal., 2011). \nThis model can\
    \ be simplified to the form of \U0001D466 = \U0001D453(\U0001D4651,\U0001D465\
    2,\U0001D4653), where \U0001D466 stands for the \nincreased percentage of crop\
    \ yield, compared with the years during which ICT sensor networks \nare not used;\
    \ and \U0001D4651,\U0001D4652,\U0001D4653 represent the percentage of saving on\
    \ water, fertilizer and pesticide \nrespectively. The selected random forest Python\
    \ package provides several optional parameters, \nsuch as the number of trees\
    \ in the forest, criteria to measure the quality of splitting a tree, and \nminimum\
    \ number of samples required to be at a leaf node. I selected several parameters\
    \ that \nhave a significant impact on the random forest to fit the equation mentioned\
    \ above, and then \nfind a group of parameters that scored the highest among all\
    \ the parameter sets in an iterative \nway. After 500 experiments, it was found\
    \ that for the dataset in this study, the following \nparameter combinations had\
    \ the highest scores, with a score of 0.9946 (out of 1). This score \nindicates\
    \ that the current model fits the nature and distribution feature of dataset well.\
    \ \n{'bootstrap': True, 'criterion': 'mse', 'max_depth': None, 'max_features':\
    \ 'auto', \n'max_leaf_nodes': None, 'min_impurity_decrease': 0.0, 'min_impurity_split':\

    \ 0.0, 'n_estimators': 1, 'n_jobs': 1, 'oob_score': \nFalse, 'random_state': 50,'verbose':\
    \ 0, 'warm_start': False} \n \nGiven a model that has been fitted, predictive\
    \ analysis on the potential increase in crop \nyield with ICT sensor network deployed\
    \ for controlling external environment can be conducted. \nWith this predictive\
    \ model, as long as the percentages of the three resources saved are input, we\
    \ \ncan get a percentage of how the crop output will change in a farm using ICT\
    \ sensor networks. \n4.3 Meta-analysis \n \nMeta-analysis is a research method\
    \ that summarizes, integrates, and interprets selected \nsets of scholarly works\
    \ in the various disciplines (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001).Glass (1976)defined \n \n\
    41 \nthis research method as statistical analysis on a collection of research\
    \ results from individual \nstudies. It is the application of specific design\
    \ and statistical methods to the overall and \nsystematic qualitative and quantitative\
    \ analysis of previous research results. It is retrospective \nand observational,\
    \ it is improvement on the traditional review (Xia, 2005). \n \nResearch findings\
    \ which are applicable for this method must meet the following criteria: \n(1)\
    \ they must deal with the same constructs and relationships, (2) they must be\
    \ configured in \nsimilar statistical forms. To be specific, the involved studies\
    \ must focus on the same correlation \nor causality relationship in the research\
    \ scope. In meta-analysis, effect sizes are used to \nrepresent the outcome of\
    \ each study. The effect size indicates the critical quantitative \ninformation\
    \ from each study. It should represent either the direction or the magnitude of\
    \ \nquantitative research findings, or both(Lipsey & Wilson, 2001). \n4.3.1 Analysis\
    \ steps \n \nThe statistic tool used for the meta-analysis is an R package called\
    \ metafor. The \nfunction rma() in this package allows for fitting fixed- and\
    \ random/mixed-effects models with \nor without moderators via the usual mechanics\
    \ of the general linear (mixed-effects) model \n(Viechtbauer, 2010). \nThere are\
    \ two major models to use for meta-analysis, the fixed-effects model and the \n\
    random-effects model. The difference between these two models is that a random-effects\
    \ model \nallows the true effect to vary among studies. For further scalability\
    \ (Brockwell & Gordon, \n2001), the random-effects model is chosen for this study.Then,\
    \ the individual effect size \nforeach sample (i.e. finding) is calculated, using\
    \ the calculating tools provided by \nWilson(2001).The most common format of calculating\
    \ effect size is \U0001D451 = (\U0001D44B\U0001D452 − \U0001D44B\U0001D450)/\U0001D446\
    , where \n\U0001D44B\U0001D452 is the average value of an experimental group,\
    \ \U0001D44B\U0001D450 is average value of the control or reference \ngroup, and\
    \ \U0001D446 is the common standard deviation of both groups(Peng & Zheng, 1999).The\
    \ value \nof the overall effect size is positively related to the influence, which\
    \ means that higher effect \nsize indicates greater influences (Yuan, Sun, You,\
    \ Liu, & Li, 2018). \nIn this study, standard deviation from the involved studies\
    \ is collected for further \nanalysis. For these publications that did not provide\
    \ the statistical information, emails for \nenquiry were sent to the authors.\
    \  \n \n \n42 \n5. Results and Discussion \n5.1 Research question evaluation \n\
    Research question 1: To what degree can ICT sensor networks boost crop yield by\
    \ monitoring \nand controlling the usage of water, fertilizer, and pesticide?\
    \ \nAccording to the result for the test of between-subjects effects proposed\
    \ in Section 3.2, \nthe significance value for location (continent) term is 0.181\
    \ (p = 0.181), which is higher than \n0.05. Table 3 is the result of statistical\
    \ analysis from SPSS. Therefore, the correlation between \nincreased crop yield\
    \ and continent was not statistically significant. From a statistical point of\
    \ \nview, the influence of area on performance can be temporarily excluded in\
    \ this study. \nTable 3. Result of Test of between-subjects effects from SPSS\

    \ of irrigation water, fertilizer and pesticide are 80%, 86%, \nand 75% respectively,\
    \ compared with the conditions that these ICT solutions were not utilized \non\
    \ site. \nGiven the random forest model built above, a percentage to which the\
    \ ICT sensor \nnetworks can assist farms increase yield can be estimated. In this\
    \ case, with the \U0001D45D\U0001D45F\U0001D452\U0001D451\U0001D456\U0001D450\U0001D461\
    () \nfunction provided by RandomForestRegressor class in Scikit-learn, prediction\
    \ based on the \nmodel that was fitted, with parameters as the above three percentage\
    \ value set (80, 86, 75) can \nbe conducted. Output value of this prediction turned\
    \ out to be 116.26746667. This result \n \n43 \nindicates that, if the ICT sensor\
    \ network can be deployed and used in a crop farmland, with an \naverage percentage\
    \ of saving water, fertilizer and pesticide resources, the corresponding \nestimated\
    \ increase in crop yield is approximately 16%. \nAccording to the results of simulation,\
    \ the deployment of such ICT sensor networks on \nfarms can indeed reduce the\
    \ amount of agricultural resources (such as water and fertilizers) \nwhile increasing\
    \ crop yields. Such a decrease in input and an increase or change in output just\
    \ \nimprove the productivity of the farm, which is in line with the idea of sustainable\
    \ development \nin agriculture. In addition to increasing production, the more\
    \ important significance of this \napplication is to reduce the impact of human\
    \ agricultural production on the natural environment \nby controlling the amount\
    \ of chemical substances used. This protects animals and plants from \ntoxic chemicals\
    \ on the one hand, and protects human safety on the other. \nResearch question\
    \ 2: If ICT sensor networks could be deployed throughout a selected \ncountry/area,\
    \ how could the annual yield of crops change? \n \nFor this research question,\
    \ Canada is taken as an example for estimating the potential in \nincreasing crop\
    \ yield with ICT sensor networks. Except for 2015, in the past five years, \n\
    Canada's annual principal crop yield has remained at around 88.6 million metric\
    \ tonnes \n(Statistics Canada, 2020).At the same time, according to previous research\
    \ results, the \nconsumption of irrigation, fertilization and spraying of pesticides\
    \ on those farms using ICT can \nbe reduced to 80%, 86% and 75% respectively,\
    \ with boost of annual crop yield by 16%.  \nIf the result of this estimation\
    \ is extended to the entire scope of Canada, taking into \naccount the average\
    \ crop yield of Canada over the past five years, it can be concluded that if \n\
    this ICT sensor network that detects and controls water, fertilizer, and pesticides\
    \ can spread \nacross the farms in Canada, the annual crop yield in Canada (shown\
    \ in Figure 6)(Statistics \nCanada, 2019)may rise from 88 million tonnes to 98\
    \ million tonnes. Considering that Canada \nhas been exporting more than half\
    \ of the crops to the overseas demand side (Agriculture and \nAgri-Food Canada,\
    \ 2019), this potential growth in crop production will help alleviate the \ndemand\
    \ around the world. \n \n44 \n \nFigure 6. Estimated production of principal field\
    \ crops of Canada (Statistics Canada, 2019) \nAccordingly, with ICT sensor network,\
    \ the amount of resources saved for agricultural \nproduction cannot be overlooked.\
    \ In Canada, the annual total irrigation volume for crops was \n2.05 million cubic\
    \ metres in 2016, rising to 2.95 million cubic metres in 2018, a 43% increase\
    \ \n(Statistics Canada, 2019).Fertilizer consumption per hectare of arable land\
    \ in Canada was \nreported at 87.63 kg in 2016. With 41,224,000 hectares of arable\
    \ land in Canada, the annual \nfertilizer consumption is estimated as 36 million\
    \ tonnes in 2016, which has increased from 29 \nmillion tonnes in 2010, a 25%\
    \ increase (Index Mundi, 2020; World Bank, 2020). Only \nconsidering irrigation\
    \ and fertilizer use, ICT sensor networks are expected to help Canada save \n\
    irrigation water by 0.59 million tonnes, and fertilizer by 5.76 million tonnes,\
    \ with increases in \ncrop yield of 14 million tonnes. \nAs can be seen from the\
    \ results above, since the consumption of water, fertilizer and \npesticide can\
    \ be controlled by ICT sensor networks, deploying this solution across the country\
    \ \nin Canada is likely to have a huge positive influence on the crop yield and\
    \ the environment. \n5.2 Conclusion and Limitation \nAccording to Food and Agriculture\
    \ Organization of the United Nations, the growth in \nyield of rice in developing\
    \ countries has been declining or stagnating for years since 2009. In \n0\n10,000,000\n\
    20,000,000\n30,000,000\n40,000,000\n50,000,000\n60,000,000\n70,000,000\n80,000,000\n\
    90,000,000\n100,000,000\n2015\n2016\n2017\n2018\n2019\nEstimated production of\
    \ principal field crops of Canada \n(metric tonnes)\nBarley\nCanary seed\nCanola\n\
    Chick peas\nCorn for grain\nFlaxseed\nLentils\nMustard seed\nOats\nSoybeans\n\
    Sunflower seeds\nWheat\n \n45 \nsouth Asia, the annual yield of rice has dropped\
    \ by 10% due to the primary and secondary \ndamage to farmland due to effects\
    \ of climate change. There are many reasons for the low yield, \nsuch as diseases\
    \ and insect pests, soil erosion, and improper farming. In addition, limited \n\
    research investment and transfer of scientific and technological practices have\
    \ also put \nunderdeveloped regions into inefficient agricultural production,\
    \ and the lack of technology \nleaves their agricultural industry vulnerable (World\
    \ Bank, 2017). \nThis study aimed to address the gap in knowledge from the few\
    \ quantitative analyses of \nthe performance of ICT sensor networks that reported\
    \ simultaneous monitoring of water, \nfertilizer and pesticide (or some subset\
    \ of these). In this study, the necessity and feasibility of \nutilizing ICT sensor\
    \ networks in agriculture have been clarified. \nThe analysis shows that as a\
    \ whole, ICT sensor networks can indeed effectively \nimprove the use of agricultural\
    \ resources, such as water, fertilizers and pesticides, and can also \nincrease\
    \ crop output by 16%. If this technology can be widely used in developing countries\
    \ or \nregions that rely heavily on agriculture as a source of income and livelihood,\
    \ then farmers and \nthe agricultural sector there can satisfy more of them with\
    \ limited resources in a sustainable \nway.  \nMeanwhile, the cost of deploying,\
    \ setting up and maintaining a network is often a \nstumbling block to prevent\
    \ farmers from adopting ICT sensor networks. In fact, there are \nalready some\
    \ low-cost solutions, such as a basic version of the network designed by Polo\
    \ et al. \n(2015).  The total cost can be controlled within $1,000, operating\
    \ in a farm of around 100 ha. \nRegarding the limitation of this study, the first\
    \ is that the small amount of data has \nlimited the development of this study.\
    \ Although the research on the combination of ICT and \nagriculture is not a new\
    \ topic, most of the literature that can be found now does not include \nquantitative\
    \ statements regarding the performance of their equipment. Therefore, it is not\
    \ easy \nto find a lot of information about the performance of ICT sensor networks\
    \ in agriculture. \nAttempts have been made to reach out to the authors and researchers\
    \ for more detailed \ninformation regarding the research questions, but very few\
    \ replies were received. \nAnother limitation of this study is that the original\
    \ meta-analysis was not completed. \nJudging from the publications I've been exposed\
    \ to regarding the application of the ICT sensor \nnetwork in agriculture, no\
    \ researcher provided information about the experimental group and \n \n46 \n\
    the control group in their articles, and the standard deviation used to calculate\
    \ meta-analysis is \neven more rare. Similarly, I wrote some emails to these researchers,\
    \ but unfortunately there are \nfew responders and insufficient data to support\
    \ this analysis. In the end, the focus of this \nresearch was on the simulation\
    \ of farmland equipped with ICT sensor network equipment. \n \n47 \n5.3 Future\
    \ recommendations \nThis study can be a very small part of future studies looking\
    \ to provide optimal \nallocation of agricultural resources in crop production.\
    \ The perspective of this research is \nrelatively macro. It is based on the existing\
    \ research conclusions of previous people. In the \nfuture, more micro experiments\
    \ can be conducted. For example, ICT sensor networks can be set \nup in situ to\
    \ control irrigation and fertilizer application on farmland, and eventually figure\
    \ out \nthe best external conditions for planting. To be specific, a piece of\
    \ farmland can be divided into \na grid, and ICT sensor networks will be deployed\
    \ for monitoring and controlling the amount of \nagricultural input. By comparing\
    \ crop yields under different conditions, find out the most \nsuitable external\
    \ environmental parameters for certain farmland and crops. \nIn the long run,\
    \ after collecting and analyzing many years of data, ICT can be used to \nmatch\
    \ the right environment with cultivars, to increase understanding of the interactions\
    \ \nbetween genotypes and the environment, and to adapt planting strategies to\
    \ constantly changing \nclimate. \n \n \n48 \nAppendices \nAppendix A: Tables\

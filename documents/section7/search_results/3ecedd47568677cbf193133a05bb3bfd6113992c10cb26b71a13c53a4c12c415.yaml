  description: With the continuous development of China’s Internet of Things technology,
    the application of this technology in agriculture is becoming more and more extensive.
    China’s agricultural irrigation has shown a trend of automation, but the current
    automatic irrigation system cannot automatically control the amount of water irrigation,
    and it is not intelligent enough. The irrigation water closely related to the
    development of modern green agriculture is far from meeting the development requirements
    of China’s agriculture. When the irrigation amount is too large, it will cause
    serious waste of water resources, and when the irrigation amount is too small,
    it will affect the growth of crops. Based on this situation, this paper designs
    an intelligent agricultural irrigation system, which combines the communication
    module with the single-chip microcomputer, and monitors the data of the crop growth
    environment in real time with the help of ZigBee wireless communication and sensors.
    According to different crop growth models and soil nutrient content and the characteristics
    and laws of fertilizers needed by crops, an intelligent irrigation system platform
    model for real-time monitoring of crop growth environment information based on
    the Internet of Things is constructed. After testing, the model can predict the
    amount of water and fertilizer required in the process of crop growth, so as to
    make timely and appropriate irrigation decisions scientifically, so as to improve
    the level of irrigation management. The system can greatly alleviate the problem
    of waste of water resources and soil compaction. It can not only realize water
    saving and energy saving, but also promote agricultural production and income
    increase. It provides a technical basis and support platform for the follow-up
    development of intelligent agriculture.

    Recommendations Comments ABSTRACT With the continuous development of China''s
    Internet of Things technology, the application of this technology in agriculture
    is becoming more and more extensive. China''s agricultural irrigation has shown
    a trend of automation, but the current automatic irrigation system cannot automatically
    control the amount of water irrigation, and it is not intelligent enough. The
    irrigation water closely related to the development of modern green agriculture
    is far from meeting the development requirements of China ''s agriculture. When
    the irrigation amount is too large, it will cause serious waste of water resources,
    and when the irrigation amount is too small, it will affect the growth of crops.
    Based on this situation, this paper designs an intelligent agricultural irrigation
    system, which combines the communication module with the single-chip microcomputer,
    and monitors the data of the crop growth environment in real time with the help
    of ZigBee wireless communication and sensors. According to different crop growth
    models and soil nutrient content and the characteristics and laws of fertilizers
    needed by crops, an intelligent irrigation system platform model for real-time
    monitoring of crop growth environment information based on the Internet of Things
    is constructed. After testing, the model can predict the amount of water and fertilizer
    required in the process of crop growth, so as to make timely and appropriate irrigation
    decisions scientifically, so as to improve the level of irrigation management.
    The system can greatly alleviate the problem of waste of water resources and soil
    compaction. It can not only realize water saving and energy saving, but also promote
    agricultural production and income increase. It provides a technical basis and

  description: Soil moisture and salinity are both important environmental variables
    for crop growth in agricultural production areas. Optical remote-sensing datasets
    from different sensors are available for estimating soil moisture and salinity
    from different spatial-temporal scales. Given the co-regulation of soil spectral
    reflectance (SR) by soil moisture and salinity, the simultaneous estimation of
    moisture and salinity in saline soil may result in great bias and uncertainty.
    To address this problem, soil samples were collected in the salinized area during
    irrigation. Synchronously, processed multi-spectral images were acquired from
    Sentinel-2 satellite. The spectrum mechanism responsive to soil moisture and salinity
    was verified by statistical tests, and its corresponding mathematical model (MSS
    model) was developed to identify the dominant factors affecting SR and to inverse
    moisture and salinity. The result showed that the effects of moisture and salinity
    were temporally constant (facilitation) and changing (from inhibition to facilitation),
    respectively, during the irrigation stages. The dominant factors in the variation
    of SR shifted from salinity and moisture-salinity interaction to moisture. Reliable
    accuracy was achieved in the moisture and salinity estimation using inverse MSS
    model. The profile from the series of estimations can further reveal the dynamic
    changes of soil moisture and salinity content during irrigation, and provide guidance
    for local irrigation management.

    areaMoisture-salinity interaction 1. Introduction In arid and semi-arid areas,
    soil salinization and moisture deficit caused by local climate condition of strong
    evaporation stress crop growth and reduce agricultural production (Asfaw et al.,
    2018, Li et al., 2014). Timely and accurate monitoring of soil moisture and salinity
    at regional scale contribute to the development of strategies to solve these issues.
    Relying on continuously evolved remote sensing techniques, satellite remote sensing
    can provide reliable and effective data support for soil moisture and salinity
    content monitoring (El Hajj et al., 2016, Abbas et al., 2013, Boren and Boschetti,
    2020, Dong et al., 2019, Ambrosone et al., 2020). The estimation of soil moisture
    and salinity content using optical satellite images has been investigated extensively.
    Soil salinization at a regional scale can be identified easily by RGB images (composed
    of the reflectance in Visible wavelengths, i.e., Red, Green and Blue) from optical
    satellite images (Sadeghi et al., 2017). Spectral reflectance of the wavelength
    at Short-Wave Infrared Reflectance (SWIR), which is usually derived from multispectral
    satellites sensors (e.g., MODIS, Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2), is feasible for reflecting
    relative changes in soil moisture and salinity content (El Harti et al., 2016,
    Rahimzadeh-Bajgiran et al., 2013). By combining the SWIR with Land surface temperature
    (LST), the soil moisture content can be quantified by the empirical modeling methods
    based on semi-physical mechanism (Bazzi et al., 2020, Sadeghi et al., 2017). The
    spectral reflectance at wavelengths of Red and Near Infrared (NIR) usually falls
    in the spectrum boundaries fixed by a series of feature parameters. These parameters
    are demonstrated as promising proxies for indicating soil properties (Amani et
    al., 2016). For example, Urban et al.(2018) input these parameters to an inversion
    model to detect the spatial-temporal variation of soil moisture content across
    different seasons over Southern Kruger National Park, where annual drought was
    evident. Owing to the discrepancy on relationships between the soil moisture,
    salinity and their corresponding spectral reflectance at wavelengths ranging from
    Visible to SWIR, the reasonable selection of wavelengths is needed before modeling
    (El Harti et al., 2016). Moreover, the availability of spectral indexes and learning
    machine techniques in a modeling process has turned out to be useful for more
    reliable estimation. For example, Wang et al.(2019) constructed a soil salinity
    inversion model with machine learning techniques and optimal combination of spectral
    indexes to monitor the dynamic changes of soil salinity in dry and wet seasons
    over Ebinur Lake region, Xinjiang, China. As is mentioned above, estimating soil
    moisture or salinity content using optical data is essentially a process to quantify
    differentiated performance of spectral reflectance at wavelengths. In this process,
    soil moisture or salinity content is assumed to be the main, even the only factor
    affecting the spectral reflectance generated from optical satellite images at
    regional scale. Thus, this estimation may sometimes be compromised by the irrigation
    process where highly variable moisture and salinity content are both significant
    factors determining the spectral behavior at wavelengths from Visible to SWIR
    (Lievens et al., 2009, Melendez-Pastor et al., 2008). To address this issue, research
    efforts focused on how soil spectral reflectance vary under different soil moisture-salinity
    coexistence conditions. When soil moisture and salinity content are specified,
    the soil spectral characteristic curve can be plotted from continuous spectral
    reflectance obtained from Analytical Spectral Devices (e.g., Hand-held spectrometer)
    (Farifteh, 2011). The geometrical parameters (e.g., A, Rd, mA, mRd) of the curve
    can be obtained from Inverse Gaussian function model (IG model) under indoor experimental
    condition, and considered as input variables for soil moisture or salinity content
    prediction in saline soil context (Zeng et al., 2016). The semi-empirical exponential
    model was presented to measure the responsive process of soil spectral reflectance
    to soil moisture and salinity in term of a physical mechanism of radiation transmission
    theory (Wang et al., 2012, Yang and Yu, 2017). This model can interpret the individual
    effect of soil moisture and salinity on soil spectral reflectance and allows well-defined
    allocation of soil spectral reflectance to each factor. However, this model structure
    of binary equation with first-order has inherent algorithmic weaknesses and may
    be insufficient to reveal the effect, especially the co-effect of soil moisture
    and salinity on soil spectral reflectance(Bell, 1997, Farifteh, 2011). Meanwhile,
    the experimental data for these models was typically acquired from soil samples
    and the corresponding spectral reflectance was obtained under artificial indoor
    light instead of natural sunlight. The results derived from ideal indoor experimental
    conditions may be insufficient to represent real outdoor situation (Schug et al.,
    2020, Xu et al., 2019, Xu et al., 2010, Yu et al., 2010). In this research, an
    extended semi-empirical exponential model (MSS model) was proposed to address
    the issues mentioned above. The soil samples were collected during irrigation
    period from the Hetao Irrigation Area, which is an important grain-producing region
    with 12500 km2 in China. The soil spectral reflectance was obtained from Sentinel-2
    satellite. The spectrum mechanism responsive for soil moisture and salinity was
    investigated to explore the following problems: How do soil moisture and salinity
    act on soil spectral reflectance？ What is the dominant factor influencing soil
    spectral reflectance？ Can soil moisture and salinity content be accurately estimated
    by inverse MSS model? 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Description of experimental
    area Soil samples used for this research were collected at Huangji canal of Yongji
    irrigation region (107°17′43′′E to 107°22′45′′E, 40°03′44′′N to 41°08′38′′N),
    which is located in Hetao Irrigation Area of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
    of China (Figure S1). The local is characterized by typical continental climate.
    The precipitation (about 158 mm for annual precipitation) is much lower than evaporation
    (about 2000 mm for annual pan evaporation), which was measured by WUSH-TV2 evaporator
    (Tianjin Meteorological Instrument Factory, China). This characteristic introduces
    challenges into local agricultural production and development (Gao et al., 2018).
    The soil type derived from field investigation is mainly clay loam composed of
    fine particles. Due to the physical structure of poor permeability, clay loam
    is unfavorable for irrigation (Jia et al., 2017). The crop cultivated in experimental
    area within the study period (March ~ June) is Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.).
    Its growing season ranges from 25–35 days. From June to October, the main planting
    crop is corn and sunflower with a growing season of 90–110 days (Yu and Shang,
    2017). Currently, there are approximately sixty percent of the total plantation
    area suffering from different degrees of soil salinization, posing potential threats
    for local agricultural production. Thus, accurate and timely estimation of soil
    salinity content at regional scale is significant for developing strategies regarding
    the mitigation of soil salinization. 2.2. Collection and process for experimental
    data 2.2.1. Acquisition and pre-process of Sentinel-2 satellite The multi-spectral
    imager aboard Sentinel-2 satellite can deliver optical images with fine spatial
    resolution (i.e. 10, 20 and 60 m) covering spectral reflectance at wavelengths
    from Visible to SWIR. The Sentinel-2 satellite archive is available from the official
    website of USGS. Its corresponding acquisition time is consistent with sampling
    time of soil samples (Table S1). A three-step image processing technique is performed
    to generate directly available optical images with 10 m spatial resolution, which
    involves atmospheric correction, images cropping and resampling. These processes
    were carried out using SNAP software released by the European Space Agency. 2.2.2.
    Collection and pre-process of soil samples The layout of sampling sites was designed
    by considering local irrigation management, soil properties and crop species (Figure
    S2). For each sampling site, the soil sample was collected at the depth of 10
    cm using Five-points sampling method. Soil moisture content (SMC) of collected
    soil samples was derived from gravitation measurement by the mass percentage of
    water in a soil sample. Soil salinity content (SSC) was calculated from measured
    electric conductivity (EC, unit: mS/cm) of mixed soil solution (mass ratio of
    soil sample and purified water is 1:5) by using an empirical formula (i.e., SSC=
    0.2882*EC+0.0183) (Huang et al., 2018). The detailed statistical results of soil
    moisture and salinity content can be found in Table S2~S3. Considering the disparity
    of soil moisture and salinity content in unit and value range, the normalization
    process was performed using the following equations: (1) (2) Where, and represent
    soil moisture and salinity of ith soil samples, respectively; and represent the
    minimum of soil moisture and salinity of all soil samples, respectively; and represent
    the maximum of soil moisture and salinity of all soil samples, respectively; and
    represent soil moisture level and soil salinity level of ith soil samples, respectively.
    2.3. Construction of land-use classification model There existed obvious land-vegetation
    alternation during the whole study period (March~June,2019). For each Sentinel-2
    observation, the area involving bare soil was required to be identified and extracted
    by a land-use classification model. The modeling data for this model was derived
    from in-situ field survey and manually labeling Sentinel-2 RGB images. By using
    the supervised method of decision tree and Kennard-Stone algorithm, land-use classification
    model was trained iteratively until the accuracy of validation dataset was close
    to that of modeling dataset. The detailed results regarding classification accuracy
    and the spatial-temporal variation of land-use types over the study area can be
    found in Table S4 and Figure S4~S5, respectively. 2.4. Spectrum mechanism responsive
    for soil moisture and salinity Correlation analysis between soil properties (SML
    and SSL) and soil spectral reflectance (at wavelengths from Visible to SWIR) was
    performed for statistical significance test. The level of significance was defined
    as p < 0.05. The testing result was that spectral reflectance of wavelengths at
    Green, Red-edge, NIR and SWIR were sensitive to both soil moisture and salinity
    and hereafter referred as to soil spectral reflectance (Table S5). The soil spectral
    reflectance with different soil properties were used for a series of statistical
    analyses (variance analysis, multiply compare and trend test) to determine the
    mechanism of soil spectral reflectance responsive for soil moisture and salinity.
    These statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA, Least Significant Difference
    method (LSD) and Mann-Kendall algorithms using the SPSS22.0 software. 2.5. Modeling
    of spectrum mechanism responsive for soil moisture and salinity (MSS model) 2.5.1.
    The structure of model Given a soil spectral reflectance at the specific wavelength
    of λ, its relationship with soil moisture-salinity can be expressed as following
    (Yang and Yu., 2017): (3) Where, R represents soil spectral reflectance affected
    by soil moisture and salinity; R0 represents soil spectral reflectance without
    the influence of soil moisture and salinity; a represents a ratio between changes
    of soil spectral reflectance and that of SML; b represents a ratio between changes
    of soil spectral reflectance and that of SSL; a, b and R0 are related to wavelength
    of soil spectral reflectance. The collected soil samples and processed Sentinel-2
    satellite images provided the variation of soil spectral reflectance as a function
    of soil moisture level (SML) and soil salinity level (SSL) (Figure S3). The observed
    highly nonlinear variation indicates that the existing model (Eq. (3)) may not
    fulfil needs for generating the accurate simulation of soil spectral reflectance
    under different SML and SSL. Compared with binary linear regression, binary quadratic
    regression has intrinsic mathematical strength in simulation of nonlinear variation.
    Thus, combining exponential function with binary quadratic regression equation
    may be more efficient for this demand. The detailed model structure was written
    as following: (4) (5) Where, R represents soil spectral reflectance simulated
    by MSS model; a and b represent coefficients in revealing relationship between
    soil spectral reflectance and soil moisture; c and d represent coefficients in
    revealing relationship between soil spectral reflectance and soil salinity; e
    represents interactive coefficients in revealing moisture-salinity effect on soil
    spectral reflectance. f is constant. 2.5.2. The proportional contributions of
    soil moisture and salinity on spectrum As known in Eq. (5), MSS model decomposes
    effect of moisture and salinity on soil spectral reflectance into three parts:
    (6) (7) (8) Where, RSML, RSSL and RSML*SSL represents separately effect of moisture,
    salinity and moisture-salinity interaction on soil spectral reflectance. Then,
    effect of these factors on soil spectral reflectance can be measured as following
    equations: (9) (10) (11) (12) Where, Pall represents sum of contributions of moisture,
    salinity and moisture-salinity interaction on soil spectral reflectance. PSML,
    PSSL and PSML*SSL represent separately proportional contributions of moisture,
    salinity and moisture-salinity interaction on soil spectral reflectance. 2.5.3.
    Estimation for soil moisture and salinity content by using inverse MSS model Given
    a soil sample with SML1 and SSL1, soil spectral reflectance at two different wavelengths
    can be represented as following: (13) (14) Let compute the logarithm for both
    sides: (15) (16) Let and : (17) (18) SML1 and SSL1 of the soil sample can be solved
    from equation of (17) ~ (18) and transferred into soil moisture and salinity using
    equation of (1) ~ (2). Thus, estimation for moisture and salinity can be achieved
    from a system of binary secondary equations derived from MSS model at two different
    wavelengths. 2.6. Technology Route In this research, the achievement of objective
    was mainly composed of three steps: (1) Analysis of spectral mechanism responsive
    for soil moisture and salinity; (2) Construction of response model of soil spectral
    reflectance to moisture-salinity (MSS model); (3) Estimation of soil moisture
    and salinity content by inverse MSS model. The whole technology route covering
    all steps is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (572KB) Download

    of three steps: (1) Analysis of spectral mechanism responsive for soil moisture
    and salinity; (2) Construction of response model (MSS model); (3) Estimation of
    soil moisture and salinity using inverse MSS model. 3. Results 3.1. Response mechanism
    of soil spectral reflectance to moisture and salinity Most wavelengths of soil
    spectral reflectance increased as soil moisture level increased (Zc ranging from
    1.37 to 1.87), indicating general facilitating effect of soil moisture on soil
    spectral reflectance (Fig. 2). However, soil spectral reflectance reflectance
    will locally decrease with moisture increase (Fig. 2c). This phenomenon was also
    observed from the previous researches (Wang et al., 2012, Yang and Yu, 2017, Zeng
    et al., 2016). Irrigation can influence the spectrum mechanism responsive for
    soil salinity (Fig. 3). The effect of soil salinity on soil spectral reflectance
    of wavelengths except Green was temporally changing at different irrigation stages.
    Generally, soil spectral reflectance increases with salt content increase. The
    observed negative effect of soil salinity on soil spectral reflectance may be
    caused by other soil properties (e.g.,pH, SO42-, Na+, K+ Ca2+, Mg2+), which can
    be also found in previous researches (Chi et al., 2019, Fan et al., 2015, Melendez-Pastor
    et al., 2008, Nawar et al., 2015, Peng et al., 2016, Yahiaoui et al., 2015). The
    moisture-salinity interaction was derived from comparing the effects of soil moisture
    and salinity on soil spectral reflectance. During the whole irrigation process,
    the moisture-salinity interaction of Green and Red-Edge were restraint and synergism,
    respectively. For NIR and SWIR, their moisture-salinity interaction differed in
    irrigation stages. Download : Download high-res image (684KB) Download : Download

    reflectance. The columns of figures refer to spectral reflectance at wavelengths
    of Green, Red-Edge, NIR and SWIR.These spectral reflectance are sensitive to soil
    moisture and salinity. The rows of figures represent irrigation stages (before,
    during and after irrigation). Soil salinity level represents normalized soil salinity
    content, which ranges from 0 to 1. For soil spectral reflectance at specified
    soil salinity level, red line, black horizontal line and blue rectangle represent
    means, extreme(minimum/maximum) and quartile(1st/3rd), respectively. Means with
    the same letter are not significantly different (p >0.05). Zc > 0 and Zc < 0 refer
    to increasing and decreasing trend. Moreover, due to observed weak moisture-salinity
    interaction during irrigation, single-regulated effect existed in the specified
    ranges of SML or SSL. For example, when SSL ranged from 0.4 to 1.0, soil spectral
    reflectance of NIR was singly regulated by soil moisture due to no significant
    difference in this range (Figs. 2g and 3g). This single regulatory effect can
    be accounted from the reduced sensitivity of soil salinity to soil spectral reflectance
    due to introduced irrigation water. 3.2. The proportional contributions of soil
    moisture and salinity to spectrum The proportional contribution of each factor
    (i.e., soil moisture, soil salinity and moisture-salinity interaction) to soil
    spectral reflectance under different irrigation stages was measured by the constructed
    MSS models (Fig. 4). During the whole irrigation, proportional contributions of
    soil moisture, soil salinity and moisture-salinity interaction displayed the tendency
    of increase, decrease and decrease, respectively. This tendency indicates that
    the dominant factor(s) affecting soil spectral reflectance change(s) in irrigation.
    Without irrigation, soil salinity and moisture-salinity interaction were both
    the dominant factors. With irrigation, soil moisture became the dominant factor.
    After irrigation, soil moisture remained dominant factor (except for Green). Download

    3.3. Accuracy of the simultaneous estimation of soil moisture and salinity As
    is known in derived formulas from Section 2.5.3, soil moisture and salinity content
    can be simultaneously estimated by MSS models with two wavelengths (referred as
    the CMSS model). Four different wavelengths correspond to six CMSS models. The
    accuracy of these models was evaluated using R2 and RMSE (Table 1). Table 1. Evaluation
    of the ability of combined-wavelengths-based MSS model (CMSS model) to monitor
    soil moisture and salinity under different irrigation stages using R2 and RMSE.

    The order of prediction accuracy at different irrigation stages, from high to
    low, were before irrigation, after irrigation and during irrigation. Compared
    with soil moisture, the CMSS model displayed better estimation in soil salinity.
    For a specified irrigation stage, the optimal CMSS model needs to be selected
    from six CMSS models due to their observed difference in prediction accuracy (Fig.
    5). For soil moisture, the wavelength combination of optimal CMSS model at three
    different irrigation stages was Green + NIR, Green + NIR, and Green + Red-edge,
    respectively. For soil salinity, it was Green + NIR, NIR + SWIR, and NIR + SWIR,
    respectively. Download : Download high-res image (452KB) Download : Download full-size

    observed. 3.4. Spatial-temporal monitoring of soil moisture and salinity Fig.
    6 presents the spatial-temporal monitoring of soil moisture and salinity at field
    scale (spatial resolution of 10 m). Before irrigation, soil moisture and salinity
    concentrated on < 16.38% and > 0.5%, respectively (Fig. 6a and f). Excessive soil
    salinity (> 2.0%) in north and south of study area generate obvious salt aggregation.
    However, the salt aggregation in southern disappeared with the increase of soil
    moisture (Fig. 6b and g). On May 2, the ranges of soil moisture and salinity concentrated
    on >21.84% and < 0.5%, respectively, reaching the highest and lowest level throughout
    the study period (Fig. 6c and h). Then the south of study area witnessed a gradual
    decrease of soil moisture. Meanwhile, the center and south displayed a gradual
    increase of soil salinity (Fig. 6c~e). Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    to the soil moisture and salinity conditions:(a) moisture: blue for wetness (>21.84%),
    light blue for normal (16.38~21.84%) and red for drought (<16.38%);(b) salinity:dark
    red for saline soil (>2%), red for severe salinization (1~2%), light red for moderate
    salinization (0.5~1%) and white for none/light salinization (<0.5%).(For interpretation
    of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    web version of this article.) Overall, soil moisture and salinity over study area
    increased from 13.40% to 15.18% (Zc=0.08) and decreased from 0.97% to 0.80% (Zc=-0.12),
    respectively. These changes indicate that irrigation can regulate soil moisture
    distribution and mitigate soil salinity aggregation (Fig. 7). However, soil salinity
    rebounded within a short time after irrigation. This are likely related to inefficient
    irrigation. Ill-suited irrigation quota can provoke the backflow of irrigation
    water, resulting in water table rise and soil salt aggregation (Chang et al.,
    2019; Yu et al., 2010). Accordingly, some measures should be taken to mitigate
    this issue. The irrigation quota should be further optimized under the premise
    of satisfying crop growth (Xu et al., 2010). Meanwhile, for timely excretion of
    soil salt, the operational efficiency of drainage systems also needs improving
    (e.g., deepening the drainage ditch) (Wen et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res

    moisture and salinity content.Soil moisture content (SMC) refers to the mass percentage
    of water in soil. Soil salinity content (SSC) refers to the mass percentage of
    salt in soil. Dynamic changes of SMC and SSC caused by irrigation management are
    detected timely (soil moisture increased from 13.40% to 15.18% and soil salinity
    decreased from 0.97% to 0.80%). 4. Discussion 4.1. Spectral response mechanism
    of soil moisture and salinity Soil moisture and salinity are main factors affecting
    soil spectral reflectance with wavelength from Visible to SWIR in agricultural
    production area with irrigation management (Farifteh, 2011). Inverse Gaussian
    function model (IG model), as a technique to guide the quantification of geometric
    metrics in soil spectrum curves, has been promising in predicting moisture in
    the surface saline soil (Lobell and Asner, 2002; Whiting et al., 2004). However,
    the development of IG model requires optical data with continuous wavelengths,
    and regional application of IG model only depends on the fewer available hyperspectral
    satellites compared with multispectral satellites. Different from the IG model,
    the MSS model is derived from optical data at particular wavelength instead of
    continuous wavelengths. That is, the application of the MSS model has less data
    requirements, thus can be supported by numerously launched multispectral satellites.
    Meanwhile, due to its flexibility to accommodate nonlinear fluctuation of soil
    spectral reflectance, the MSS model has advanced performance in estimating soil
    moisture and salinity content in irrigation area with strong variability of soil
    moisture and salinity content during irrigation period (Farifteh et al., 2008).
    Moreover, the MSS model can explicitly interpret the process of the spectral response
    to moisture and salinity, and reveal the influencing mechanism of irrigation on
    soil spectral reflectance. 4.2. Effect of irrigation stages on moisture-salinity
    content monitoring Remote sensing-based estimation of soil moisture or salinity
    in irrigation areas has been carried out around the world using various modeling
    techniques (Casterad et al., 2018, Dari et al., 2020, González-Zamora et al.,
    2016, Guo et al., 2018, Han et al., 2019, Hajj et al., 2017, Veysi et al., 2020,
    Welle and Mauter, 2017). The optimal spectral indexes from procedural selection
    has become a vital step in the construction of inversion models. In this step,
    the selected spectral indexes served as the input for inversion model training,
    regardless of numerical differences of these indexes in irrigation stages. In
    fact, as is known in 3.1 Response mechanism of soil spectral reflectance to moisture
    and salinity, 3.2 The proportional contributions of soil moisture and salinity
    to spectrum, there are apparent differences of spectral response mechanism in
    irrigation stages. Failure to treat these differences may distort the modeling
    process, which is further propagated into the estimated results, causing unknown
    bias and uncertainties. Accordingly, the MSS model without considering irrigation
    stages (called the WMSS model) was developed. By comparing the accuracy of the
    WMSS model and MSS model, the effect of irrigation stages on the estimation in
    term of spectral response mechanism can be understood (Fig. 8). During the whole
    process of irrigation, the simulation of the WMSS model demonstrated an overestimation
    of soil moisture content and underestimation of soil salinity content. The accuracy
    of WMSS was lower than that of the MSS model. The problem of reduced prediction
    accuracy during irrigation compares favorably with previous researches. These
    findings indicate that the conventional modeling strategies still probably suffer
    from partially unreasonable prediction caused by irrigation even though they allow
    overall satisfying estimation with its strength in powerful generalization and
    robustness. Thus, irrigation information should be thoroughly considered in the
    practical inversion modelling based on optical satellite data. Download : Download

    The first and second columns of figures are estimation of soil moisture and soil
    salinity, respectively. Red, Blue and Green points represents estimated values
    before, during and after irrigation, respectively. The simulation of the WMSS
    model demonstrated an overestimation of soil moisture and underestimation of soil
    salinity. Irrigation stage should be thoroughly considered in the practical inversion
    modelling.(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend,
    the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) However, the spatial
    mismatch between irrigation information (irrigation stages at regional scale)
    and optical data (spectral reflectance at field scale) may cause additional uncertainty
    when irrigation information is used as an input for the inversion model. Thus,
    the spatially fine-resolution observation of irrigation information is crucial
    to the extensive application of the MSS model. The irrigation information can
    be determined according to the relative difference of soil surface roughness in
    irrigation stages due to the hydraulic properties of irrigation water. Due to
    the high sensitivity of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signal to soil surface
    characteristics, SAR (e.g. Sentinel-1) has great potential in identifying irrigation
    information at field scale (Baghdadi et al., 2018, Bazzi et al., 2020, Ullmann
    and Stauch, 2020). Thus, the applicability of Sentinel-1 was initially assessed
    by associating the VV backscatters of Sentinel-1 with proportional contributions
    of each factor (i.e., moisture, salinity and moisture-salinity interaction) to
    soil spectral reflectance (Fig. 10). The observed aggregation phenomena of VH
    backscatters represents the distribution pattern of proportional contributions
    of key factors to some extent. For example, for SWIR, the proportional contribution
    of soil moisture displayed an increasing tendency with VH backscatter increase.
    However, this tendency was not statistically significant due to a degree of the
    overlap of proportional contribution among VH backscatters. For this, the relationship
    between the signal from SAR and spectral response mechanism should be further
    investigated in the future. 4.3. Effect of land-vegetation alternation on soil
    moisture and salinity content The variation of soil moisture and salinity content
    over the study area is not only closely related to the irrigation management,
    but also the land-vegetation alternation (Feng et al., 2005, Zhao et al., 2014).
    A typical area with high frequency of land-vegetation alternation (Figure S5)
    was chosen from the study area and used for the study of the effect of the land-vegetation
    alternation on soil moisture and salinity content (Fig. 9). Download : Download

    figures are estimation of different dates (March~June, 2019). Green, dark blue
    and yellow represents the land-use of crop field, channel and building, respectively.
    Other colors refers to the soil moisture and salinity conditions:(a) moisture:
    blue for wetness (>21.84%), light blue for normal (16.38~21.84%) and red for drought
    (<16.38%);(b) salinity:dark red for saline soil (>2%), red for severe salinization
    (1~2%), light red for moderate salinization (0.5~1%) and white for none/light
    salinization (<0.5%).(For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure
    legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) Compared with
    bare soil, the water loss in crop field is relatively lower due to the lower evaporation
    capacity of vegetation, so the crop field has higher soil moisture content than
    bare soil. This phenomenon exists in the non-irrigated area (e.g., the IV region
    in Fig. 9d ~ e), and it will gradually disappear with the re-distribution of soil
    moisture content caused by persistent strong evaporation (e.g., the VI region
    in Fig. 10 c ~ d). Meanwhile, the gap of moisture content between the crop field
    and bare soil diminishes after irrigation (e.g., the I region in Fig. 9b~ c).
    Without irrigation, aggregation of soil salinity can be observed after crop harvesting
    (e.g., the IV region in Fig. 9i ~ j). The timely and efficient irrigation helps
    to mitigate the aggregation of soil salinity (e.g., the IV region in Fig. 9f~
    g). Download : Download high-res image (329KB) Download : Download full-size image

    salinity and moisture-salinity interaction to soil spectral reflectance are 100%.
    In general, reasonable irrigation of crop field can contribute to the soil salinization
    management. In the determination of irrigation quota, both crop water requirement
    and groundwater depth should be taken into consideration so as to avoid aggravation
    of soil salinity after crop harvesting. This area also needs timely irrigation.
    Otherwise, salinity control will be hindered and the cultivation time for subsequent
    crop will be delayed. 5. Conclusion Currently, the simultaneous estimation of
    soil moisture and salinity content using optical data suffers from low prediction
    accuracy. To overcome this limitation, the mechanism of soil spectral reflectance
    responsive to soil moisture and salinity was explored and used for the construction
    of inversion model. The main conclusions were drawn as follows: (1) The effects
    of moisture, salinity, and moisture-salinity interaction on soil spectral reflectance
    at wavelength of Green, Red-edge, NIR and SWIR were all significant. (2) Throughout
    the irrigation, soil moisture displayed a facilitative effect on soil spectral
    reflectance. The soil salinity had inhibitory effect on soil spectral reflectance
    at wavelength of Green. But for other wavelengths (i.e., Red-Edge, NIR and SWIR),
    the effect demonstrated a tendency of transforming from inhibition into facilitation.
    With irrigation stages proceeding, the dominant factors affecting variation of
    soil spectral reflectance changed from soil salinity and moisture-salinity interaction
    to soil moisture. (3) Reliable accuracy for estimating soil moisture-salinity
    content (with R2 of 0.69~0.85 and RMSE of 2.50~3.10% for soil moisture; and R2
    of 0.84~0.90 and RMSE of 0.20~0.26% for soil salinity) was achieved. Dynamic changes
    of soil moisture-salinity content (average value of soil moisture increased from
    13.40% to 15.18% and average value of soil salinity decreased from 0.97% to 0.80%)
    caused by irrigation management can be detected timely. (4) The dynamic variation
    of soil moisture and salinity content is valuable for water resource management
    in irrigation region. On the one hand, the amount of irrigation water should be
    designed to prevent soil salinization over non-crop area; On the other hand, crop
    field demands timely irrigation after harvest to ensure effective salinity control.

    is the largest consumer of fresh water supplies across the globe. The United States
    (U.S.) has the world''s third largest acreage under irrigation, 22.4 Mha, and
    in terms of agricultural water use, the country ranks fourth with 176.21 km3 of
    annual withdrawals [15]. There are 20 water resource regions (WRR) in the U.S.
    that are based on the major drainage areas of the country, and the Rio Grande
    is located among Southern WRR. The Rio Grande is a transboundary river that receives
    its water both from the U.S. and Mexico, and the latter shares almost half of
    the watershed area (Fig. 1). On the U.S. side, it flows from Southern Colorado
    through New Mexico and Texas and drains into Gulf of Mexico. The total area of
    Rio Grande basin is approximately 924,300 km2 (92.43 Mha) [29]. The upper reach
    of the river receives majority of its water from snow melt, whereas the runoff
    accumulation in the lower reach is mostly due to summer monsoon. Download : Download

    river and tributaries (US And Mexico). According to U.S. Department of Agriculture
    [56], the total cropland in the Rio Grande region (U.S. side) is 631,284 ha, out
    of which 364,450 ha is irrigated. Approximately, 53% irrigation is conducted using
    groundwater, and off-farm surface water use is 44%. The surface water governance
    in the basin is based on inter-state and international treaties, and uncertainty
    in the availability of surface water due to recurring dry periods poses challenges
    to water planning and management [49]. Prolonged droughts in the region increase
    the reliance on groundwater to offset the reduced surface water supplies. Also,
    the irrigation water demand increases due to elevated crop water requirement under
    drought-induced higher potential evapotranspiration (ET). Historically in the
    Rio Grande region, droughts have caused considerable decline in groundwater levels
    e.g., drought period between 2002 and 2015 in the headwaters region and 2003-2014
    in middle Rio Grande prompted intensive pumping [7]. In addition, climate change
    will give rise to more frequent droughts and several studies have predicted decline
    (25% to 50%) in the Rio Grande flows by the next century [9,36]. States in the
    Rio Grande region have developed regional and state level water plans to deal
    with future challenges, i.e., population growth and climate change. New Mexico''s
    state water plan, for regions overlapping Rio Grande basin, shows an annual administrative
    (normally available) versus drought water supply deficit range of 0.01-0.26 km3
    by 2030, which is mainly due to greater uncertainty associated with surface water
    availability [46]. In Texas, the regional water plan (RWP) of Rio Grande water
    planning area anticipates an annual supply and demand deficit of 0.84 km3 by year
    2030 (Texas Water Development Board [54], 2021). Also, in both states, the deficit
    is expected to enlarge based on the decadal estimations made untill 2060. Annual
    irrigation demand for New Mexico was approximately 4 km3 in 2020, which does not
    fluctuate considerably under low and high growth planning scenarios by 2060. However,
    for Texas, the overall irrigation demand is expected to decrease in future, from
    11.6 km3 in 2020 to 9.9 km3 in 2060. This decrease can be attributed to factors
    such as urbanization of agricultural lands, higher domestic demands due to rising
    population, costly pumping due to decline in groundwater levels, and expected
    improvement in irrigation water use efficiency. The reduction in irrigation demand
    in Texas’ Rio Grande RWP, would be 21.2% by 2060 [54]. This shows the need of
    better water management and technology in the Rio Grande region to prepare the
    irrigation sector to sustain under future challenges. Several best management
    practices (BMPs) have been suggested for optimizing irrigation water use in the
    Rio Grande region. Advanced or scientific irrigation scheduling (SIS) is one of
    the important BMPs that could play a significant role in the sustainability dynamics
    of Rio Grande [55]. Irrigation scheduling can be simply defined as the process
    used to decide the appropriate amount of water to be applied at a certain time
    to maintain healthy plant growth for achieving a planned crop yield [52]. Irrigation
    can be scheduled by following simple methods, e.g., visually assessing the crop,
    feeling soil for moisture, etc., whereas SIS involves data, measurements, and
    estimations, e.g., precipitation and ET data, in-situ soil moisture and plant
    canopy temperature sensing, remote sensing of crop water use and stress, crop
    water use modeling, etc. Adoption of SIS in a region can lead to considerable
    water savings and improved crop yield and quality [1]. For example, irrigation
    scheduling based on probabilistic rainfall forecasts could save 11% to 26.9% water
    [2]. Zhou et al [65] demonstrated 35% saving of irrigation water by using soil
    moisture sensors under micro-irrigation. Also, positive impact on crop growth
    and quality was noted by Nam et al [45] as a result of maintaining the root zone
    moisture at a certain level using soil moisture sensors. According to USDA [57],
    only 1.5% farms in the Rio Grande region use some type of sensing device or daily
    ET reports to decide when to irrigate, whereas 48% farms rely on conditions of
    crop and feel of soil, and about 10% farms initiate irrigation when a neighbor
    start irrigating. Based on this information, it can be inferred that farmers in
    the region either lack the capacity or resolve to use SIS. Any of these factors
    could be a hindrance for moving towards sustainable irrigated agriculture. Therefore,
    it is important to find out the barriers to adoption of SIS tools in the Rio Grande
    basin. There are a few studies that have looked into the barriers that discourage
    the adoption of SIS methods. Taghvaeian et al. [52] highlighted that installation
    and maintenance cost of the equipment and lack of technical support for end-users
    are some of the major challenges being faced by the growers in U.S. Risk of yield
    reduction, field limitations, reluctance from landlord to share the costs, uncertainty
    about future water availability, unsure about continuation of farming, and more
    time required for management were found as considerable barriers to adoption of
    SIS practices in U.S. by Fan and McCann [14]. Leib et al. [34] conducted surveys
    in Washington, U.S., to analyze the adoption of ET and soil moisture sensor-based
    irrigation scheduling. One of the major findings of this study was that such adoption
    of technology can be coupled with the farm size as growers with large farms were
    more inclined to use sensors and crop-water use information for irrigation scheduling.
    Also, they found that more high value crops i.e., onions, potatoes, wine grapes,
    and sugar beets, received advanced scheduling services in comparison to small
    grains and fodder crops. This suggests that profits and crop water sensitivity
    could become a factor for deciding on the use of SIS tools. A similar regional
    study from Australia [30] identified financial constraints as the largest barrier
    to the adoption of new technologies in irrigation including scheduling and discussed
    the need of confidence building measures to convince growers for making investment
    in technology. Very few studies have investigated the barriers to adoption of
    SIS tools in Rio Grande Basin. For example, Ward et al. [62] explored the barriers
    to water conservation in different parts of the Rio Grande Basin and listed water-saving
    incentives, issues with water rights and water transfers, and ease of using groundwater
    amid reduced surface water supplies as some of the main barriers. However, this
    study did not particularly focus on reasons that hinder the adoption of SIS. Also,
    the interstate and transboundary water agreements in Rio Grande Basin make the
    region unique in terms of water management [63], and SIS adoption focused studies
    conducted in other parts of the world may be less applicable here. Hence, there
    exist a need to thoroughly investigate the adoption barriers for SIS in Rio Grande
    Basin as well as the factors that influence the adoption decisions. Understanding
    the barriers to adoption of SIS tools could provide an insight into the overall
    propensity of the irrigators’ community for embracing the new technology. Since
    the diffusion and adoption of technology is a complex phenomenon that involves
    both sociological and technical domains [48], it is important that the agricultural
    water policymakers and water experts have the tools to decipher the socio-technical
    configuration embedded in a particular region''s growers community [41]. Information
    on factors affecting irrigators’ decision-making process can be pivotal for promoting
    the adoption of innovations made in optimizing agricultural water use. Based on
    the future needs of the irrigated agriculture in the Rio Grande region where irrigation
    sector needs to adapt with the declining water supplies, urbanization and population
    rise, and climate change, it is important to develop a comprehensive understanding
    of the barriers that slow down the adoption of SIS. The aim of this study was
    to get the irrigators perspective on the barriers to adoption of SIS tools in
    the Rio Grande region. The objectives were (i) to determine irrigators’ familiarity
    and usage of different methods for deciding when to irrigate; (ii) to assess irrigators’
    level of agreement on the extent of potential factors being a barrier to adoption
    of SIS tools; (iii) to assess irrigators’ level of agreement on the extent of
    potential factors influencing the adoption of SIS tools. The results of this study
    provide guidelines to extension experts, researchers, agriculture water policymakers,
    and industry to optimize the use of water resources and promote precision agriculture
    in the region. Also, this study can be considered as a benchmark for future planning
    of water-conservation focused incentive programs by states and federal agencies.
    2. Methodology Data collected for this study was through the administration of
    a mailed survey. To develop the survey, questions related to general farm information
    and basic characteristics of growers were adapted from Frasier et al. [16]. Growers
    were inquired about their familiarity with different irrigation scheduling methods.
    In addition, factors that could be potential barriers to adoption (e.g., reliability
    and access to weather data, cost-effectiveness of technology, field characteristics,
    etc.) were listed in survey questions with option to choose a level of agreement
    ranging between strongly agree and strongly disagree. Similarly, a question containing
    list of factors that influence growers’ decision to adopt advanced irrigation
    scheduling technologies (e.g., quality of land, water use efficiency, pumping
    cost, etc.) was added in the survey to know the level of agreement of respondents.
    Besides adoption barriers, information on factors influencing decision-making
    was sought to assess the motivation of growers towards adoption. Questions including
    aforementioned factors were mainly adapted from Schaible and Aillery [50], and
    additional questions were developed based on discussions with agriculture extension
    staff and growers [47]. Overall, the survey contained 18 questions across 7 pages
    (Survey questionnaire available in supplementary information). To develop list
    of contacts for this study, a Freedom of Information Request was made to USDA
    Farm Service Agency to gain Farm Payment Files from 2013 - 2017 [58], which is
    the list of agricultural producers who have received subsidy payments during aforementioned
    years for every county in the U.S. Names and addresses of subsidy payment recipients
    whose zip code fell within the boundary of the Rio Grande Basin on the U.S. side
    and within the states of Texas and New Mexico were selected to serve as the study
    population. Of this population, a simple random sample of 1,500 individuals were
    selected and addresses were validated. To administer the mailed survey, a modified
    Dillman et al. [10] Tailored Design Method was used where a pre-notice postcard
    was mailed on August 3, 2020, followed by a survey packet on August 10, 2020,
    followed by a reminder postcard on August 17, 2020, and a final survey packet
    on August 31, 2020. Of the 1,500 mailed, 96 were undeliverable, 310 were returned
    resulting in a 22% response rate and 77 responses were usable. It should be noted
    that at the time of administering this survey, Covid-19 had impacted the delivery
    and return of the mailed survey as surveys were delivered as late as December
    7, 2020. Data retrieved from the responses was analyzed to quantify the respondents’
    basic characteristics, irrigation methods used by respondents and their familiarity
    with various irrigation scheduling techniques, SIS adoption barriers, and factors
    influencing the adoption. Also, statistical tools were used to find trends and
    relationships in the data. Principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted to
    estimate the interrelationships between the uses of different irrigation scheduling
    methods by survey participants. PCA allows simplifying large set of variables
    and breaks the interrelations in data into multiple orthogonal components. PCA
    has been previously employed in studies focusing on the conservation practices
    in agriculture using survey data (e.g., [4,24]). Stepwise regression analysis
    was conducted to assess the relative importance of variables [61] including education,
    years involved in agricultural production, and farm-based income for the overall
    knowledge and use of SIS methods. Based on the level of familiarity and use of
    the SIS methods, knowledge and adoption score was assigned to each survey participant,
    respectively. Koech et al. [30] also used stepwise regression analysis for studying
    barriers to adoption of irrigation technologies in Australia. Minitab 17 Statistical
    Software [40] was used to perform PCA and stepwise regression analysis under default
    settings. 3. Results 3.1. Respondents’ basic characteristics Response to gender
    question in the survey was provided by 71 agricultural producers out of which
    58 were male, 3 were female, and 10 respondents preferred not to mention their
    gender. 57% of the respondents belonged to the age group of 51-70 years, 25% were
    71+, 3% and 1% were from 31-50 years and 18-30 years age group, respectively,
    whereas 2% respondents did not answer this question. In terms of education, 42%
    of the growers who participated in the survey had a 4-years degree (Fig. 2), 18%
    went to some college (post-secondary undergraduate education), 16% had high school
    (higher secondary education) diploma, and 10% and 4% of the respondents had masters
    and PhD degrees, respectively. 55% of the growers had white ethnicity, 30% were
    Hispanics, 3% were American Indians, and 13% did not provide this information.

    Fig. 2. Education level of respondents from Rio Grande Region. A large number
    of responding farmers (38%) had 41-60 years association with agricultural sector
    along with 8% who had spent 61+ years in farming (Fig. 3a). 25% were involved
    in agricultural production for 26-40 years, whereas 11% and 1% of the respondents
    of the survey were associated for 11-25 years and 0-10 years with agriculture,
    respectively. 80-100% household income of 26% growers was linked with agricultural
    production, which was followed by 24% farmers whose incomes was 1-20% dependent
    on farming (Fig. 3b). 18% growers had 21-40% income coming from agriculture sector,
    for 15% it was 61-80%, 8% had 41-60%, and 10% participants’ opted not to respond.

    Fig. 3. (a) Years involved in agricultural production (b) Percentage of household
    income that comes from agricultural production. Major crops grown and irrigated
    by the survey participants were cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), maize (Zea mays),
    wheat (Triticum aestivum), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), Citrus, sugarcane (Saccharum
    officinarum), and alfalfa (Medicago sativa) (Fig. 4), which consume the largest
    water share in the Rio Grande basin [31]. 51% growers reported growing one crop
    on their farm, 21% had two crops, 16% had three, 7% had four, 3% had five, whereas
    1% managed to grow six crops on their farms. Average acreage cultivated by the
    respondents was approximately 206 ha with a range of 0.1 ha and 2,388 ha. Distribution
    of the farm size in the survey was non-normal and it was negatively skewed (skewness
    = 3.19). First quartile was 10.12 ha, median was 34.1 ha, and third quartile was
    161.9 ha. Download : Download high-res image (685KB) Download : Download full-size

    methods and irrigators’ familiarity with various scheduling techniques Two most
    common methods for irrigating crops reported by the respondents were flexible
    plastic pipe with openings for furrows (commonly known as poly pipe), 27%, and
    any other gravity-based methods, 33%, (e.g., conventional flood irrigation using
    field ditches and furrows) (Fig. 5). This was followed by the center pivot (11%)
    which is mostly installed where groundwater is available. The survey also covered
    producers who use surface and subsurface drip irrigation, and a few survey participants
    picked multiple options, for example, center pivot, other sprinklers (e.g., micro
    sprinklers, solid set sprinklers, spray jets), siphon tubes, and any other gravity-based
    methods. Download : Download high-res image (573KB) Download : Download full-size

    of irrigation water involves both delivery methods and techniques to decide when
    to irrigate. Survey participants were asked about their familiarity and use of
    different methods for determining when to irrigate. Condition of crop and feel
    of soil were two major conventional methods with which 76.8% and 60.8% respondents
    were very familiar, respectively (Fig. 6a, b). 81.3% respondents frequently used
    condition of crop to schedule irrigation and 45.5% frequently used feel of the
    soil. Scheduled water delivery (52.2%) and calendar schedule (38.6%) were next
    with which irrigators were very familiar with, and their frequent use was reported
    by 36.4% and 25% respondents, respectively. Commercial scheduling services, computer
    simulations, and plant moisture sensing devices were ranked lowest by the survey
    participants in terms of familiarity and use as 89.7%, 84.2%, and 76.9% growers
    were not familiar and 91.5%, 90.9%, and 89.4% never used these techniques, respectively.
    Non-familiarity and non-usage was followed by media reports on daily ET (71.8%
    and 87%), infield weather stations (71.8% and 78.7%), and soil moisture sensing
    devices (57.5% and 76.65), respectively. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    method (b) Use of irrigation scheduling methods by survey participants. 3.3. Barriers
    to adoption of SIS methods According to the survey participants, the two largest
    barriers to adoption of SIS methods were lack of easy access to weather data and
    uncertainty about future water availability, as 37% and 35% respondent strongly
    agreed with these factors, respectively (Figure S1). This was followed by low
    cost-effectiveness of technologies (33% strongly agree), unreliable weather data
    (33% strongly agree), and lack of availability of SIS tools in the area (31% strongly
    agree). 37% of producers somewhat agreed that improvements or adoption will not
    reduce the expenses enough to cover the installation cost, and 28% producers viewed
    risk of reduced yield and poor quality of crop with the same level of agreement
    as a potential barrier to adopt SIS techniques. 39% survey respondents slightly
    agreed that excessive nature of training requirements for new irrigation scheduling
    systems can be a barrier for adoption, whereas 29% participants had a slight agreement
    on either irrigation scheduling tools related information not being presented
    in easily understandable way or not receiving enough information to persuade them
    for adoption. Table 1 provides an overview of the response of participants and
    summarizes the average and standard deviation of level of agreement on adoption
    barriers. Table 1. Barriers to adoption of SIS methods identified by survey participants.

    influencing the adoption of SIS were maintaining the quality of land along with
    producing more on the existing acreage (68% survey participants strongly agreed),
    becoming more water efficient (66% strongly agreed), and improving or maintaining
    water availability for future generations (61% strongly agreed) (Figure S2). Under
    somewhat level of agreement, 37% growers picked increasing the value of land as
    an important factor that influences the SIS adoption, which was followed by participating
    in government financial programs to offset cost of implementation (30% somewhat
    agreed). Table 2 provides an overview of the respondent''s level of agreement

    Principal component analysis of data on irrigation scheduling methods Principal
    component analysis was conducted to understand the trends and relationship between
    different irrigation scheduling methods being used by the growers. First four
    principal components represented almost 70% of the total variance. The first principal
    component (PC1) represented 29.6% variance, and it was moderately correlated with
    plant moisture sensing, computer simulations, and infield weather stations (Table
    3). PC2 represented 14.9% variance and it was strongly correlated with in turn
    and calendar schedule and negative values existed for soil moisture sensors. PC3
    represented 13.4% variance and it was strongly correlated with feel of soil and
    moderate correlation existed for nearby weather station. PC4 represented 11% variance
    and it was noticeably correlated with nearby weather station, whereas negative
    values existed for condition of crop, feel of soil, soil and plant moisture sensing.

    and adoption of SIS techniques Stepwise regression analysis was conducted with
    adoption score, knowledge score, and sum of adoption and knowledge score as response
    variables, and years involved in agriculture, income percentage linked to agriculture,
    age, and education of the respondents as predictors. The results showed that income
    percentage linked to agriculture was removed from the model in all three analyses
    (Table 4) that refers to a rare contribution of income in knowledge and adoption
    of SIS. Age and education played an important role to determine the adoption of
    SIS methods with adjusted coefficient of determination (R2) 27.82%. The knowledge
    on SIS tools of the survey respondents was markedly associated with the years
    involved in agriculture and age (Adj R2 = 13.92%), whereas for the sum of the
    knowledge and adoption score, age and education were considerable predictors (Adj
    R2 = 18.98%). Table 4. Results from stepwise regression analysis (Default α =

    of survey participants’ familiarity and use of different irrigation scheduling
    methods imply that a majority of farmers tend to use non-scientific methods. Similar
    to the selection of irrigation application method, adoption of SIS technique is
    also dependent on several economic, technological, field, and water supply related
    factors [25] that could be associated with the barriers to technology adoption.
    Main barriers to adoption of SIS methods identified in this survey concurred well
    with the ones highlighted by other researchers. For example, Frisvold and Murugesan
    [17] emphasized the importance of weather data to growers for agricultural decision-making
    and discussed that producer are less likely to use web-based data directly, most
    probably due to complexities in data and its retrieval process. The aforementioned
    study also argued that the growers would be more receptive to flow of repackaged
    or simple data from extension agents and irrigation districts. This suggests that
    in the context of Rio Grande region, by providing farmer-friendly online data
    and data products [22], such data access barriers could be alleviated. Currently,
    the weather and ET networks in Texas and New Mexico (e.g., texaset.tamu.edu, weather.nmsu.edu)
    lack grower oriented weather data products. A good example of developing agriculture
    weather focused products for producers is Oklahoma Mesonet [38] which offers tools
    like farm monitor, crop specific heat units calculator, irrigation planner, and
    daily ET maps. Unreliability in weather data was identified as another barrier
    that hinders the adoption of irrigation scheduling methods. Agricultural weather
    data in terms of reliability can be divided into two categories. One is near-real-time
    data and the other is forecast data, and the dynamics of their accuracy needs
    to be discussed separately [12]. Near-real-time data is usually based on the weather
    station measurements and its accuracy for an agricultural producer mainly depends
    on the spatial density of the instruments and type of variables. For example,
    in case of precipitation either end-users will look at the data from the nearest
    weather station or an interpolated value will be available for a particular location,
    yet the reliability of this data can be questioned due to spatial heterogeneity
    of precipitation [8]. On the other hand, temperature, relative humidity, and wind
    speed data originating from nearby weather stations or through interpolation would
    have relatively higher certainty, provided there is a reasonable spatial density
    of the sensors. The same applies for ET that is calculated using the aforementioned
    variables [59]. Weather forecast data is mostly based on statistical models that
    process the data from multiple regional weather networks to make daily and weekly
    prediction reports. The element of uncertainty is an integral part of forecasts
    that usually increases with the lead time and it is important that forecast providers
    add precision coefficients or accuracy levels to the data being made available
    to growers to inform them about the reliability [33]. Survey participants viewed
    uncertainty about future water availability as one of the important barriers to
    adoption of SIS. Ward et al. [62] also discussed the uncertainty of water availability
    as a barrier to water conservation efforts in terms of water rights adjudication
    in Rio Grande region in New Mexico. Growers tend to be less interested in moving
    towards advanced method or technology when they are not sure how their water supplies
    would fluctuate in future. A comparable argument was presented by Carey and Zilberman
    [3] as they studied the modern technology adoption in irrigation in the framework
    of water market and return on investment. They found that growers with abundant
    water supplies are more likely to invest in technology whereas growers with scarce
    supplies would wait until extreme weather events (i.e., droughts) push the return
    on investment considerably higher than the cost. Subsidies could also be helpful
    for growers to overcome such barriers as discussed by Heumesser et al. [26] who
    investigated the climate change induced precipitation uncertainty and irrigation
    technology adoption trends. Cost effectiveness of SIS technologies and risk of
    not being able to cover the installation cost were picked among the major barriers
    of adoption by the respondents of this study. Also, risk of reduced yield and
    poor crop quality were among the barriers accentuated by the growers. The cost
    of efficient irrigation scheduling tools or services would vary with the level
    of accuracy and ease of operation required/ afforded by the grower. For example,
    installing one low-cost soil moisture or plant moisture sensor (manual data retrieval)
    in the field versus having multiple wireless cloud-based sensors, integrated with
    online interface and supported by remote sensing-based data, would have different
    price tags. Therefore, to make these technologies cost effective, conducting need
    assessment based on yield goals, and seeking expert opinion is important. Risks
    of yield decline, possibly due to under-irrigation with imprecise irrigation scheduling
    method could prevent growers’ adoption, and if the water supplies are not limited,
    growers would rather over-irrigate the high value crops [44]. Gaps in knowledge
    on local crop coefficients, soil-water characteristics, and issues with higher
    levels of salinity and clay and site-specific sensor calibration may induce errors
    in crop water requirement calculations and soil moisture estimates [5,20,64] that
    could cause crop water stress. Adoption of technology with respect to production
    uncertainty was explored by Koundouri et al. [32] and their results showed that
    growers are more likely to adopt technology when it is coupled with increased
    profits in comparison to downside yield uncertainty. Galioto et al. [19] discussed
    that growers could adopt new methods to schedule irrigation to mitigate the impacts
    of long-term climate variability on yield; however, such adoption requires adequate
    availability of information. Survey participants picked multiple factors that
    influence the adoption of SIS methods and quality of land was ranked first. One
    of the main reasons for quality of land being at the top of the major factors
    could be the enhanced understanding of the growers about the adverse impacts of
    mismanaged irrigation on the farms that could cause root zone salinity problems
    in the long term [11]. Please note that salinity is among the major water quality
    issues in Rio Grande region, and it is caused mainly due to agricultural runoff,
    wastewater treatment plants, and geological formation of the basin, and because
    of surface‐groundwater interactions, groundwater quality is also deteriorated
    [27]. SIS adoption provides ways to mitigate the impact of saline water on crop
    yield while also reducing salt accumulation in the root zone [39]. Producing more
    on the existing acreage was also among the top factors that influence the adoption
    of SIS. As discussed earlier, yield improvements are usually a driving factor
    for growers to invest in technology. Potential of improving pecan yields in Rio
    Grande region was demonstrated by Ganjegunte and Clark [21] using soil moisture
    sensors. Enciso et al. [13] utilized soil moistures sensors to show that better
    yields and crop quality for onions were obtainable in Rio Grande Valley of Texas
    when soil moisture was kept above a certain threshold. Influence factors such
    as achieving high water use efficiency and improving or maintaining water availability
    for future generations can be linked with the idea of sustainable irrigated agriculture.
    Data driven decisions to determine the timing of irrigation discourages over-irrigation
    and even less than 100% crop ET equivalent amount of water could be optimized
    to achieve good crop yield, for example, managing deficit irrigation with the
    help of soil moisture sensors. Both natural and artificial storage of water such
    as aquifers and dams could be harnessed for longer time periods if the growers
    collectively decide to employ modern irrigation scheduling methods. Also, additional
    economic benefits can be associated with sustainable agricultural practices as
    there is an increasing demand of sustainably sourced products in global agri-food
    supply chains [53]. This provides an opportunity to farmers, adopting SIS techniques,
    to sell their crops at premium prices [6]. PCA helped understand the interrelationships
    between the uses of different irrigation scheduling methods by survey participants.
    PC1 suggested that the use of plant moisture sensing, computer simulations, and
    infield weather stations might vary together, and increase in one''s usage could
    step up the adoption of the remaining ones (Table 3). Also, the combination of
    these methods could improve the overall reliability of irrigation scheduling.
    For example, computer simulations for irrigation scheduling calculations would
    work better if infield weather station data were used as input, and the output
    from the simulations can be assimilated with plant moisture sensing to improve
    the overall performance [23]. The negative values of condition of crop show that
    its use tend to decrease as growers move towards SIS. The interrelationship in
    PC2 hinted towards those growers who rely on delivery from irrigation district
    and water is usually applied at critical crop stages, and therefore, they are
    probably less inclined towards the use of sensors as the farmers do not have much
    control on canal water supplies unless they store water on their farm (e.g., reservoirs
    for drip irrigation systems). PC3 indicated that growers that make decisions based
    on feel of soil, they might also be interested in checking the information from
    a nearby weather station to be certain about their irrigation timing and amount
    related decision. With the information present in PC4, it could be inferred that
    when growers have access to information from weather stations, visual methods
    to decide on irrigation take a back seat. Furthermore, growers would possibly
    not prioritize their investments in in-situ sensors when they have access to nearby
    weather station. Sui and Vories [51] compared the irrigation scheduling based
    on weather station data and soil moisture sensors and found that growers would
    be reluctant to adopt soil moisture sensors mainly due to initial investment,
    recurring service charges, and possibility of sensor damage in field.  The R2
    values estimated in stepwise regression analysis (27.82%, 13.92%, 18.98%) (Table
    4) were lower than the values estimated in a comparable study conducted in Queensland,
    Austraila [30] (38%) in which the researchers analyzed the impact of several predictors
    on farmers'' perception on current knowledge and understanding of irrigation as
    dependent variable using step wise regression. The current study particularly
    focused on irrigation scheduling methods in comparison to broader adoption studies
    for irrigation technology, hence the regression models are likely to be more susceptible
    to any potential noise in data. Low R2 is tolerable in studies when the model
    is not aimed for making any future predictions [43]. Also, smaller R2 hint towards
    significant trend amid high variability in data [18]. Despite the low R2 values,
    the impact of age, education, and years involved in agriculture on growers’ knowledge
    and adoption of SIS methods corresponded well with the studies focusing on adoption
    of technology in agriculture. For example, Lichtenberg et al. [35] argued that
    growers with higher education level are more receptive to sensor-based irrigation
    scheduling. Education levels of growers were found closely related to the adoption
    intensity of improved irrigation scheduling methods by Wang et al. [60]. The aforementioned
    studies discussed older age of grower as a dissuading factor to invest in technology
    for irrigation scheduling, whereas the stepwise regression analysis in this study
    revealed an opposite trend. This could be partly due to the fact that older growers
    usually have a greater social capital in terms of strong network in irrigators’
    community that plays a positive role in adoption of irrigation technology [28].
    On the other hand, young growers with better familiarity of technology could be
    more likely to use SIS methods but this might not have a notable impact on the
    overall adoption of modern irrigation methods as May et al. [37] found that young
    growers with higher education in U.S. are less interested to work on farms because
    of better off-farm job opportunities. 5. Conclusion Irrigation in Rio Grande region
    faces challenges due to uncertainty in surface water supplies and decline in groundwater
    levels. Also, increasing water demand from municipal sector poses a threat to
    future water availability for irrigated agriculture in the region. SIS methods
    offer solutions to optimize the irrigation water use and allow growers to make
    informed decisions related to irrigation amount and frequency. A survey was conducted
    in Rio Grande region (Texas and New Mexico) to understand the farmers’ perspective
    on adoption barriers for SIS methods. Results showed that lack of access to weather
    data and uncertainty about future water availability were the two largest barriers
    to adoption, followed by cost effectiveness of technologies, reliability of weather
    data and lack of availability of irrigation scheduling tools in the region. Also,
    grower''s skepticism towards technology due to risk of reduced yield and poor
    crop quality was listed among the significant barriers to adoption of SIS methods.
    The major factors influencing the adoption of SIS were maintaining the quality
    of land, producing more on the existing acreage, becoming more water efficient,
    and improving or maintaining water availability for future generations. Age, education,
    and years involved with agriculture were estimated as important factors that may
    drive the knowledge and adoption of SIS techniques in irrigators’ community. These
    results could help policy makers and extension experts narrow down their efforts
    to promote the water conservation in the Rio Grande basin as well as in other
    regions with similar attributes. One of the limitations of this study was the
    small response rate (77 useable responses) and slightly different findings could
    be expected with a larger set of respondents. Future studies may look into the
    efficacy of different SIS tools at sub-regional level and may determine which
    technology has the potential for fast adoption. Declaration of Competing Interest

  description: 'Irrigation is critical to sustain agricultural productivity in dry
    or semi-dry environments, and center pivots, due to their versatility and ruggedness,
    are the most widely used irrigation systems. To effectively use center pivot irrigation
    systems, producers require tools to support their decision-making on when and
    how much water to irrigate. However, currently producers make these decisions
    primarily based on experience and/or limited information of weather. Ineffective
    use of irrigation systems can lead to overuse of water resources, compromise crop
    productivity, and directly reduce producers'' economic return as well as bring
    negative impacts on environmental sustainability. In this paper, we surveyed existing

    and author information   Abstract Irrigation is critical to sustain agricultural
    productivity in dry or semi-dry environments, and center pivots, due to their
    versatility and ruggedness, are the most widely used irrigation systems. To effectively
    use center pivot irrigation systems, producers require tools to support their
    decision-making on when and how much water to irrigate. However, currently producers
    make these decisions primarily based on experience and/or limited information
    of weather. Ineffective use of irrigation systems can lead to overuse of water
    resources, compromise crop productivity, and directly reduce producers'' economic
    return as well as bring negative impacts on environmental sustainability. In this
    paper, we surveyed existing precision irrigation research and tools from peer-reviewed
    literature, land-grant university extension and industry products, and U.S. patents.
    We focused on four challenge areas related to precision irrigation decision-support
    systems: (a) data availability and scalability, (b) quantification of plant water
    stress, (c) model uncertainties and constraints, and (d) producers'' participation
    and motivation. We then identified opportunities to address the above four challenge
    areas: (a) increase the use of high spatial-temporal-resolution satellite fusion

    for precision irrigation decision-support systems for center pivots that can achieve
    scalable, economical, reliable, and easy-to-use irrigation management for producers.

    1. Introduction Irrigation is critical to sustain agricultural production in dry
    or semi-dry climates and maintain the economy of these regions (Stubbs 2016, US
    GAO 2019). Irrigation systems include gravity, sprinkler, and micro-irrigation
    systems (figure 1), and among these, sprinkler irrigation systems, mainly center
    pivots, are used in ∼55% of the U.S. total irrigated lands (USDA 2017, US GAO
    2019) (figure 1). For example, in 2015, 38% of corn and 25% of soybean production
    in the U.S. was produced with center pivots irrigation systems (Smidt et al 2019).
    Center pivot irrigation systems were invented by a farmer Frank Zybach in 1940
    and patented 12 years later (Zybach 1952). In general, these systems have water
    that is pumped from the center of the field to overhead nozzles of different sizes
    located along a long pipe that rotates in a circular pattern and used to irrigate
    large fields. In the U.S., these irrigation systems were quickly adopted and used
    to irrigate row crops. Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image size Figure 1. (a) Spatial

    Efficient irrigation is essential to achieve sustainability of food production
    and regional water security (Lobell et al 2008, Griggs et al 2014, Grafton et
    al 2018, Li et al 2020). However, currently, producers determine the irrigation
    timing and amount of center pivots largely based on their personal experience
    and weather information. According to a survey, >75% of irrigation scheduling
    methods used by U.S. producers are based on rule-of-thumb procedures that include
    crop calendars, visual observation, and ''what the neighbors are doing?'' (USDA
    2017). Fewer than 25% of irrigation scheduling methods are science- and technology-based.
    Decisions based on rule-of-thumb methods could lead to over- or under-irrigation.
    Over-irrigation may raise concerns related to water scarcity and environmental
    sustainability. For example, the extensive irrigated areas in Kansas, California,
    and Arkansas (figure 1) have resulted in large groundwater level declines in the
    High Plains, Central Valley, and Mississippi Embayment aquifers, respectively
    (Marston et al 2015, McGuire 2017, US GAO 2019). Over-irrigation using groundwater
    may further increase soil salinity and sodicity in areas with shallow groundwater
    tables and excessive evaporation losses, which threatens soil health of these
    regions (Hillel 2000, Tanji 2002). Over-irrigation can also result in leaching
    and runoff of nutrient-enriched water, causing contamination to ground water (Power
    and Schepers 1989, Exner et al 2014). Conversely, under-irrigation does not sufficiently
    alleviate crop water stress, which usually leads to both yield and economic loss
    for producers. Compared with rule-of-thumb methods, science- and technology-based
    irrigation scheduling methods may increase crop profits and reduce environmental
    impacts by minimizing crop water stress. Precision irrigation usually requires
    real-time information about soil water supply and crop water demand to determine
    optimal irrigation timing and varying amount in space, in order to reach predefined
    objectives such as the maximization of crop yield, resource use efficiency, or
    profitability (Sadler et al 2005, Smith 2011, US GAO 2019). Our study here will
    focus on discussing irrigation decision making tools for the majority of irrigation
    systems in the U.S., i.e. ''standard center pivots'', where irrigation timing
    and amount are uniform across a field. In recent decades, some studies have reviewed
    specific aspects of precision irrigation decision-support systems, such as soil-based
    and/or plant-based irrigation scheduling methods and applications of remote sensing
    data and wireless technologies (Jones 2004, Fernández and Cuevas 2010, Pardossi
    and Incrocci 2011, Zaks and Kucharik 2011, Ha et al 2013, Haule and Michael 2014,
    Kansara et al 2015, Ihuoma and Madramootoo 2017, Foster et al 2019, Lakhwani et
    al 2019, Pathak et al 2019, Evett et al 2020, Gu et al 2020). However, few studies
    have provided holistic reviews and perspective of integrating different components
    of precision irrigation decision-support systems. With extensive progresses made
    in precision irrigation in both academia and industry, there is a lack of comprehensive
    reviews on existing challenges and opportunities. This paper reviews recent advances
    and challenges, and envisions opportunities in precision irrigation decision-support
    systems for standard center pivots. We surveyed precision irrigation research
    from peer-reviewed literature, land-grant university extension and industry products,
    and U.S. patents. We identified challenges in data, decision-making approaches
    and criteria, and products used in current precision irrigation decision-support
    systems in this survey. We then proposed possible opportunities to address the
    corresponding challenges and bridge the gap between research and practice for
    precision irrigation decision-support systems, which we envision should be scalable,
    economical, reliable, and easy-to-use for producers. Although the survey is focused
    on the center pivot irrigation systems in the U.S, most of our review can be generally
    applied to different other types of irrigation systems at the global scale. 2.

    used in precision irrigation Data represents the basis of any precision management
    system. Multi-source data, including in-situ measurements, remotely sensing data,
    and gridded weather/climate/soil data (figure 2), are used for precision irrigation.
    in-situ sensors, e.g. soil/canopy temperature/weather sensors, can provide data
    with high accuracy but sometimes are expensive and labor-intensive to deploy those
    sensors. Soil sensors provide measurements of soil volumetric water content, water
    potential, salinity, and/or soil temperature, such as time-domain and frequency-domain
    reflectometer, capacitance probe, resistance probe, tensiometers, or cosmic-ray
    neutron sensor (Robinson et al 2003, Vaz et al 2013). The temperature sensors
    mainly are the infrared thermometer sensor, which can observe canopy or soil surface
    temperature. Weather sensors, largely deployed as weather stations, measure multiple
    meteorological variables, such as air temperature and humidity, solar radiation,
    wind speed and direction, barometric pressure, and precipitation. Producers have
    options to establish their own weather stations, but the cost is high and the
    current adoption is very low. On the other hand, public weather stations in the
    existing networks, such as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration managed
    by National Climate Data Center and state networks (e.g. mesonets) are usually
    not dense enough, often leading to tens of km or further away from a targeted
    irrigated field (Sassenrath et al 2013, Mun et al 2015). Zoom In Zoom Out Reset

    of precision irrigation. Download figure: Standard image High-resolution image
    Remote sensing data from satellites, airborne sensors, and unmanned aerial vehicles
    (UAVs) mainly characterize canopy conditions, such as vegetation indices, leaf
    area index (LAI), and canopy temperature (Guan et al 2016, Urban et al 2018, Kimm
    et al 2020b), and hydrological conditions, such as evapotranspiration (ET), rainfall,
    and soil moisture (Qiu et al 2016, Peng et al 2017, Guan et al 2018). Unlike in-situ
    data, satellite data provide information across space and time for large-scale
    applications. However, existing satellite technology has limited spatial and/or
    temporal resolutions for precision irrigation. For example, MODIS is in low-medium
    spatial (250 m–1 km) and daily temporal resolution; whereas, Landsat is in medium-high
    spatial resolution (30–60 m) but low temporal resolution (∼8 d). By contrast,
    airborne sensors and UAVs can provide data at higher spatial resolutions, e.g.
    ∼0.1 m, but require geometric and radiometric calibration, certified operators,
    and complex data processing, and thus they are usually cost-prohibitive. So far
    the most relevant remote sensing data for irrigation is ET, and there are various
    remote sensing-based ET models, e.g. atmosphere-land exchange inverse (ALEXI)
    (Anderson et al 2004), backward-averaged iterative two-source surface temperature
    and energy balance solution (BAITSSS) (Dhungel et al 2016), breathing earth system
    simulator (BESS) (Jiang and Ryu 2016), mapping evapotranspiration with internalized
    calibration (METRIC) (Allen et al 2007b), surface energy balance algorithm for
    land (SEBAL) (Bastiaanssen et al 1998), and their pros and cons have been reviewed
    in recent work (Zhang et al 2016, Jiang et al 2020a). Finally, gridded weather/climate/soil
    data, such as NLDAS (Xia et al 2012), PUMET (Pan et al 2016), PRISM (Daly and
    Taylor 2001), DayMET (Thornton et al 2018), and SSURGO (NRCS 2017), are usually
    used as the forcing or parameters of land surface models to analyze the impact
    of irrigation (Devanand et al 2019, Xu et al 2019). Gridded weather/climate data
    can provide large-scale information, but usually have a coarse spatial resolution
    (>250 m) and cannot meet the field-level resolution and low latency requirements
    necessary for precision irrigation decision-support systems. 2.3. Decision-making
    approaches and criteria used in current precision irrigation decision-support
    systems The major decision-making approaches for irrigation timing primarily depend
    on soil- and plant-based metrics (Elwin 1997, Jones 2004). Soil-based metrics
    determine irrigation timing based on soil moisture or soil moisture-derived metrics,
    such as maximum allowable depletion (MAD), which indicates the percentage of the
    available water capacity to which crops should be subjected. MAD is the most widely
    used precision irrigation decision-making method (Panda et al 2004, Lehmann et
    al 2013). Plant-based metrics mainly determine irrigation timing based on plant
    conditions, such as plant water conditions (e.g. leaf water potential) and/or
    canopy temperature, e.g. crop water stress index (CWSI) and integrated CWSI (iCWSI)
    (Jones 2004, Girona et al 2006). Leaf water potential, a direct measure of plant
    water status in terms of plant hydraulics, has been used by agronomists/consultants
    for the irrigation of high value crops, but this approach can be over-costly and
    unscalable for row crop (Jones 2004, Girona et al 2006). The CWSI and iCWSI provide
    irrigation-trigger information through the cooling effect due to plant transpiration,
    based on the normalized function of vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and temperature
    difference between canopy and air (Idso et al 1981, Jackson et al 1981, DeJonge
    et al 2015, O''Shaughnessy et al 2015). The most widely adopted approach to determine
    how much water to apply is based on root-zone soil moisture. Given that soil moisture
    sensors are not available in most cases, the irrigation amount can be determined
    using soil water balance through two types of methods: the process-based models
    and statistical/machine learning models. Process-based models, including crop
    models, e.g. APSIM, AquaCrop, DSSAT, EPIC, Hybrid-Maize (Hammer et al 2002, Steduto
    et al 2009, Rosenzweig et al 2014, Peng et al 2020), hydrological models, e.g.
    SWAT (Chen et al 2018), and land surface models, e.g. Noah-MP, CLM, JULES, PALMS
    (Best et al 2011, Niu et al 2011, Yang et al 2011, Booker et al 2015, Peng et
    al 2018), can be used to simulate water balance and surface biophysical processes
    based on physical mechanisms with inputs of weather, soil, and/or satellite-based
    vegetation information. Statistical/machine learning models usually use empirical
    approaches to calculate soil water content and crop water use to determine the
    irrigation amount, and these empirical models require rich historical data to
    train and test the models to make them useful (Goldstein et al 2018). Furthermore,
    daily ET reports is also widely used for irrigation scheduling based on the estimation
    of daily crop water use (Lascano 2000, Lascano and van Bavel 2007, USDA 2017).
    2.4. Existing products developed for precision irrigation decision support Based
    on the multi-source data, decision-making approaches and criteria used in precision
    irrigation, many products have been developed to provide precision irrigation
    decision support for producers. We have listed some examples of precision irrigation
    decision support products from the U.S. land-grant universities and industries
    (tables 1 and 2). The combination of reference ET (ETo), crop coefficient (Kc),
    and soil water stress coefficient (Ks) is the most widely used empirical method
    to estimate crop water use, i.e. ET = ETo Kc Ks. There are many approaches to
    calculate ETo, reference ET for a short crop with a height of 0.12 m (similar
    to grass), using meteorological data, such as FAO Penman–Monteith method (Allen
    et al 1998, Walter et al 2000, Allen 2009). The majority of products incorporate
    crop water use (i.e. ET) to soil water balance to infer soil moisture for irrigation
    scheduling, such as METRIC ET, WISE, and CropManage. Besides, some products can
    also provide irrigation scheduling with lead time of a few days with weather forecasts,
    such as CornWater and SoyWater developed by University of Nebraska–Lincoln. 3.
    Challenges and opportunities for precision irrigation decision-support systems
    Based on current precision irrigation research, we identified four critical challenge
    areas and corresponding opportunities (figure 2) to improve precision irrigation

    challenges and opportunities, our proposed precision irrigation decision-support
    system for center pivots, which includes three components: data acquisition, modeling
    and analytics, and decision-making support (figure 3), should be scalable, economical,
    reliable, and easy-to-use for producers. Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image size Figure

    Data availability and scalability One major challenge regarding data need for
    precision irrigation is the lack of field-level resolution and high-accuracy data
    for scaled-up applications. Here we first reviewed the challenges of different
    existing approaches, and then discussed the opportunities to obtain scalable and
    high-accuracy data that can be acquired in every field at large regions for precision
    irrigation. 3.1.1. Challenges Here we identify three challenges from in-situ,
    satellite-based vegetation, and satellite-based ET and soil moisture data in data
    availability and scalability (figure 2). 3.1.1.1. In-situ data Existing in-situ
    sensors in the market are generally expensive or at least not sufficiently cheap
    to enable wide adoption. They also typically need to be installed and removed
    before and after the growing season for row-crops, resulting in extra labor costs.
    Though in-situ sensors usually provide high-quality measurements, these measurements
    are from a single point and thus often have limitations in capturing spatial heterogeneity
    of a whole field (Geesing et al 2004, Dong et al 2013, Irmak et al 2014, Rudnick
    et al 2015, Vuran et al 2018). Large public in-situ networks are available to
    provide long-term datasets from the National Soil Moisture Network and state mesonets,
    but these network stations are usually deployed in natural landscapes, away from
    crop fields, thus they have to rely on interpolation for precision irrigation
    but with significant uncertainty (Mauget and Leiker 2010). 3.1.1.2. Satellite-based
    vegetation data To enable precision irrigation decision, field-level resolution
    and high frequency are needed for remote sensing data. However, conventional satellite-based
    datasets on vegetation conditions, e.g. LAI and land surface temperature (LST),
    cannot fulfill high resolutions in space and time simultaneously; and some satellite-derived
    products have inherent limitations, such as insufficient accuracy and significant
    time latency (table 3). These drawbacks limit their applications to provide real-time
    and field-resolution data to determine irrigation scheduling for precision irrigation.

    Beck et al (2019) 3.1.1.3. Satellite-based ET and soil moisture data Continuous
    real-time estimation of ET and soil moisture, which indicate crop water use and
    soil water supply for crops in irrigation decision-making tools, remains a major
    challenge at fine scales with high accuracy for precision irrigation. Current
    operational soil moisture products only have coarse resolutions and could not
    fulfill the field-level irrigation needs; to make them useful, they need to be
    downscaled to high resolutions in both space and time, which adds large uncertainties
    (table 3). Specifically, current satellite-based soil moisture products based
    on passive microwave remote sensing are still limited to coarse resolutions (e.g.
    >10 kms in SMAP L3 and SMOS L3 products) and are only sensitive to shallow soil
    depth (<0.05 m) (Entekhabi et al 2010, Chan et al 2016); the above limitations
    make these data not useful for field-scale precision irrigation. The existing
    operational ET data either has coarse resolutions or not effective under cloudy
    days. For example, ALEXI/DisALEXI and METRIC ET products are based on energy balance
    approaches, which retrieve clear-sky ET from satellite-observed LST and fill ET
    gaps for cloudy-sky days, and thus are considerably affected by atmospheric conditions,
    thus limiting its practical uses (Allen et al 2007a, Cammalleri et al 2013, Li
    et al 2017, Anderson et al 2018, Ma et al 2018). 3.1.2. Opportunities 3.1.2.1.
    In-situ data First, continuous development of soil moisture sensor is needed to
    reduce the cost while achieve the robust performance (Montzka et al 2020). Second,
    more in-situ measurements from low-cost sensors can be combined to fill in the
    critical data gap for essential plant and environmental conditions. For example,
    in-situ LAI measurements, along with some other environmental variables, such
    as air temperature and humidity, now can be acquired from low-cost sensors; these
    measurements can provide significant constraints to improve ET estimations for
    irrigation scheduling. Economic cameras, such as PhenoCam, point-and-shoot cameras
    and smartphones, and spectral reflectance sensors, have been deployed to track
    vegetation phenology, such as LAI, and productivity (Ryu et al 2010, 2012, Francone
    et al 2014, Richardson et al 2018, Yan et al 2019). Furthermore, recent advances
    in microcomputers and microcontrollers have improved the ability to intelligently
    integrate low-cost sensors and provide a comprehensive solution for crop growth
    monitoring (Kim et al 2019). Third, some mobile sensors may also contribute to
    fill the gaps of spatial and temporal sampling, such as putting the roving cosmic-ray
    neutron sensors on trucks to sample soil moisture at a regional scale (Franz et
    al 2015, Schrön et al 2018). Additionally, new technologies, such as 5G networks,
    Internet of Things (IoT), Long Range communication devices, and edge computing,
    can further speed up the development of wireless sensing networks (WSNs), which
    can possibly make it less expensive and easier to provide scalable in-situ data
    for precision irrigation. 3.1.2.2. Satellite-based vegetation data For remote
    sensing data for vegetation conditions, improved satellite technologies/algorithms
    and data fusion methods (figures 2 and 3) can help to provide high spatial-temporal
    resolution products directly. Notably, satellite datasets with high resolutions
    in both space and time, e.g. daily, 3 m resolution Planet Labs data, are emerging
    and becoming available; though whether these data can be commercially viable for
    irrigation products is still unclear. Alternatively, satellite fusion algorithms,
    such as the SaTellite dAta IntegRation (STAIR) fusion method (figure 4) (Luo et
    al 2018, 2020), have been developed to fuse various satellite data together, e.g.
    Landsat, MODIS, and Sentinel-2, to enable the operational and real-time generation
    of a 10–30 m, daily and cloud-/gap-free data product for surface reflectance,
    which has significantly advanced the field-scale and real-time monitoring of crop
    conditions (Jiang et al 2020a, Kimm et al 2020b). Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image

    image High-resolution image 3.1.2.3. Satellite-based ET and soil moisture data
    High-resolution and operational ET and soil moisture products, once become available,
    can enable precision irrigation scheduling at the field level and low costs without
    in-situ sensors. Notable, the recently developed BESS-STAIR ET product, generated
    by a satellite-driven water-carbon-energy coupled biophysical model BESS combined
    with the STAIR fusion data, not only has a high spatial-temporal resolution (daily,
    30 m) under all-sky conditions, but also has demonstrated a high performance in
    estimating field-level ET when benchmarked with 12 eddy-covariance flux sites
    across the U.S. Corn Belt (figure 5) (Jiang et al 2020a). It indicates that BESS-STAIR
    ET has potential for applications in field-level precision irrigation, and also
    has scalability to regional and global scales. Besides, high-resolution LST products
    could also be incorporated into the BESS model as constraints to improve BESS-STAIR
    ET''s performance in near future. Some other existing programs, such as OpenET
    (Hall et al 2020), also have plans to offer satellite-based ET data, but unless
    real-time and field-level ET data can be provided, the promise to resolve precision
    irrigation cannot be fulfilled. Zoom In Zoom Out Reset image size Figure 5. BESS-STAIR

    High-resolution image For field-scale soil moisture, leveraging recent advances
    in mobile proximal sensing, high-resolution satellite remote sensing and downscaling,
    model-data fusion, ground sensing networks, machine learning and data mining techniques
    may provide promising solutions. Several proximal sensing techniques (Babaeian
    et al 2019), such as cosmic ray neutron sensing, can be powerful in mapping field-scale
    soil moisture when mounted on mobile platforms (Franz et al 2015, Schrön et al
    2018). Higher resolution soil moisture estimation can also be achieved through
    synergic use of both active and passive microwave remote sensing (Das et al 2019)
    or spatial downscaling (Peng et al 2017). Field-scale soil moisture simulation
    can also be improved with model-data fusion. Soil moisture is highly connected
    with some other land surface state and flux variables, such as ET and LST. The
    recently developed satellite-based 30 m BESS-STAIR ET (Jiang et al 2020a), ECOSTRESS-based
    ET (Anderson et al 2020) and LST (Hook and Hulley 2019) can be used to constrain
    the hydrological models through model-data fusion methods and thus to better infer
    field-scale soil moisture. The soil parameters in the hydrological models, which
    are an important source of uncertainty in field-scale soil moisture simulation,
    can also be estimated through model-data fusions methods when proper field-scale
    measurements are available. With emerging technologies like WSNs and IoTs (Kiani
    and Seyyedabbasi 2018), more ground-based soil moisture observations will become
    available (Quiring et al 2016), which provides an opportunity for data-driven
    prediction of soil moisture. State-of-the-art data mining techniques based on
    a network of coevolving time series (Cai et al 2015, Hairi et al 2019) can simultaneously
    capture the structural topology and temporal dynamics of multiple time series
    for the temporal and spatial patterns of soil moisture and its correlation with
    other variables. Meanwhile, the emerging physics-guided machine learning approaches
    (de Bézenac et al 2019, Reichstein et al 2019, Yang et al 2019), which can integrate
    hyper-resolution hydrological modeling with advanced machine learning algorithms,
    may also shed light on field-scale soil moisture estimation. 3.2. Quantification
    of plant water stress A fundamental question about precision irrigation is ''what
    is plant water stress and how to quantify it?''. Answering this question requires
    us to fully consider the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum (SPAC). Only after this
    question is answered, optimal methods could be developed around the correct concepts.
    3.2.1. Challenges ''Plant water stress'' is a critical concept to indicate the
    water shortage status of plants, based on which we can create irrigation triggering
    rules. There are various definitions of ''plant water stress'', for example, based
    on soil moisture and/or plant conditions, including canopy temperature and/or
    leaf water potential (Jones 1990, 2004, 2007, Rodríguez-Iturbe and Porporato 2005,
    Möller et al 2007). 3.2.1.1. Soil-based concepts Soil-based metrics are the most
    widely used methods for irrigation decision-making, such as MAD (see tables 1
    and 2, figures 6(d) and 8(e)). These metrics are based on the available water
    in the root-zone for root water uptake to indicate plant water stress. It is worth
    noting that these soil-based metrics largely only reflect water supply and they
    do not consider atmospheric water demand. Since agricultural drought in the U.S.
    Corn Belt is both driven by soil water deficit and atmospheric dryness characterized
    by high VPD (Lobell et al 2014, Zhou et al 2020, Kimm et al 2020a), it could be
    inappropriate to quantify plant water stress solely based on soil moisture. Zoom

    (ecosys). (a) CWP: canopy water potential; (b) CWSI: crop water stress index;

    image 3.2.1.2. Plant-based concepts Canopy temperature and leaf water potential
    are often used for irrigation management (figures 6(a), (e) and 8(a), (b)). Canopy
    temperature reflects plant water stress indirectly through canopy energy balance,
    such that a reduction of ET leads to reduced evaporative cooling, and thus higher
    canopy temperature given the same net energy (Idso et al 1981, Jackson et al 1981,
    DeJonge et al 2015, O''Shaughnessy et al 2015). However, canopy temperature derived
    metrics, such as CWSI and iCWSI, which can be measured from proximal, airborne,
    or satellite thermal sensors at the canopy scale, contain non-negligible uncertainty
    due to the empirical calculation methods, and are also prone to weather conditions,
    i.e. no observations during cloudy days for satellite products. The empirical
    calculation methods usually use the empirical upper and lower limits of the temperature
    difference between canopy and air to estimate CWSI and iCWSI based on the standardized
    temperature difference, resulting in irreducible uncertainty and error. Leaf water
    potential, a more rigorous measure of plant water stress based on plant hydraulics,
    can indicate plant''s internal water stress directly, but it is relatively cumbersome
    and labor-intensive to measure (Jones 2004, Girona et al 2006). The traditional
    measurements of leaf water potential via pressure chambers are reliable but require
    destructive leaf sampling and could be time-consuming (Boyer 1967, Ritchie and
    Hinckley 1975, Turner 1988), while the psychrometric methods (Richards and Ogata
    1958, Barrs 1964, Pérez et al 2011) are non-destructive but expensive and require
    sophisticated equipment and high level of technical skill. Thus, economically
    it is not viable and scalable to use these methods for row crops, which have much
    lower value than fruit and vegetables. 3.2.2. Opportunities We interpret ''plant
    water stress'' as a joint contribution of soil water supply (i.e. root-zone soil
    moisture) and atmospheric water demand (i.e. VPD), mediated by plant physiological
    regulations (Rigden et al 2020, Kimm et al 2020a) (figure 3). Both low soil moisture
    and high VPD can lead to plant water stress, and different plants may have different
    physiological responses and water use strategies (Sinclair et al 1984, Sinclair
    2005, 2012, Katul et al 2012). Thus, plant water stress should be defined and
    quantified holistically based on the interplay between soil water supply, atmospheric
    water demand, and plant physiological regulations, i.e. SPAC concept, for irrigation
    scheduling. We propose three definitions based on transpiration, plant hydraulics,
    and stomatal conductance (figures 2 and 6). 3.2.2.1. Transpiration We can define
    ''plant water stress'' from the perspective of transpiration (figure 6(c)). As
    transpiration can be limited by soil water deficit and/or downregulated stomatal
    conductance due to atmospheric aridity, actual transpiration (Tr) is achieved
    as the minimum of atmospheric water demand and soil water supply (Sinclair et
    al 1984, Sinclair 2012), with the former defined as transpiration when soil moisture
    is non-limiting with the same vegetation conditions, i.e. reference transpiration,
    Tr_ref, and the latter defined as root water uptake given limited soil moisture.
    Thus, the ratio of Tr (with plant water stress) and Tr_ref (without plant water
    stress) can be used to indicate plant water stress, here we define it as transpiration
    stress index (TSI) (figure 6(c)). However, in practice it is difficult to obtain
    direct measurements of Tr and Tr_ref. Though there are multiple ET partitioning
    approaches that can separate evaporation and Tr, such as process-based models
    (Stoy et al 2019), energy balance (Kool et al 2016), remote sensing products (Talsma
    et al 2018), or geochemical signatures (Al-Oqaili et al 2020), these methods contain
    relatively large uncertainties, which limits the accurate calculation of TSI in
    real-world applications. Alternatively, we could use the ratio of actual ET and
    reference ET (ETo), i.e. evaporative stress index (ESI) (Anderson et al 2011),
    as an approximation of TSI to indicate plant water stress for precision irrigation
    (figure 6(c)). ESI, which has been extensively used to quantify agricultural drought
    in long-term baseline conditions (Anderson et al 2011, 2016), can be derived from
    remote sensing, e.g. ECOSTRESS ESI_PT-JPL (Fisher et al 2020) and BESS-STAIR ET
    (Jiang et al 2020a), and/or process-based models. 3.2.2.2. Leaf/stem water potential
    We also can define ''plant water stress'' using leaf/stem water potential based
    on plant hydraulics (figure 6(e)). Plant hydraulics is the fundamental theory
    that connects soil water supply and atmospheric water demand (Dixon and Joly 1895,
    Tyree 1997, 2003, Taiz and Zeiger 2006, Stroock et al 2014), and can realistically
    represent the path of water flow from the soil through the plant substrate to
    the atmosphere driven by the potential gradient (Anderegg 2015). When plant water
    stress is caused by soil water deficit and atmospheric aridity, either independently
    or collectively, a substantial drop in leaf/stem water potential can be observed,
    and consequently with a reduction in sap flow. Thus, leaf and stem water potentials
    can be used as metrics to quantify plant water stress (figure 6(e)). However,
    measurements of leaf and stem water potentials are labor-intensive and expensive
    to use for precision irrigation. Thus, accurately modeling plant hydraulic control
    and water transport in the SPAC to estimate plant hydraulic traits, e.g. leaf/stem/root
    water potential and hydraulic conductance, becomes the key to the quantification
    of plant water stress in practice. To manage the complexities of plant hydraulic
    models, some highly uncertain parameters can potentially be constrained using
    various measurements through data-model fusion approaches (referred to section
    3.3), and some processes can also be simplified for crops, e.g. neglecting plant
    water storage (Salomón et al 2017), to enable efficient and scalable adoption
    of this method. 3.2.2.3. Stomatal conductance (Gs) We can also define ''plant
    water stress'' in terms of Gs (figures 6(b), 7 and 8), which reflects the physiological
    regulation of the uptake of atmospheric CO2 for photosynthesis and water loss
    through transpiration (Ball et al 1987, Medlyn et al 2011). Stomatal regulations
    are co-regulated by water supply (soil moisture) and demand (VPD) (figure 6(b)
    and the co-regulation pattern in figure 7) (Lin et al 2018, Kimm et al 2020a).
    Gs decreases with VPD given a certain soil moisture, and increases with soil moisture
    given a certain VPD (figure 7). Besides, the strong relationship between CWP,
    CWSI, ESI, TSI, MAD and Gs indicates that different plant water stress metrics
    (CWP, CWSI, ESI, TSI, MAD) all reflect the information of Gs (figure 8). Thus,
    stomatal conductance is the most effective indicator of plant water stress based
    on the co-regulation from soil moisture and VPD. However, quantifying ''plant
    water stress'' in terms of Gs is difficult, since we do not have a direct measure
    of actual Gs in practice at the canopy level—we can only do it at the leaf level.
    Thus, the above approach may have to rely on either process-based models or observation
    derived proxies, such as inversed Penman–Monteith equation and semi-empirical
    Gs models (Ball et al 1987, Allen et al 1998, Leinonen et al 2006, Damour et al
    2010, Medlyn et al 2011, Gago et al 2016, Buckley 2017, Kimm et al 2020a). The
    effectiveness of the above modeling or proxy approaches remains to be investigated,
    but the promise lies in leveraging scalable field-level measurements (e.g. from
    novel satellite products, see section 3.1.2) with models through data-model fusion
    approaches to estimate Gs and then make irrigation decision guidance. Zoom In

    High-resolution image 3.3. Model uncertainties and constraints With the data availability
    and ''plant water stress'' definitions clarified, process-based models and/or
    statistical/machine learning models can be used to simulate the SPAC system for
    irrigation scheduling. Both two types of models can involve significant uncertainties
    if not properly used, thus data-model fusion methods should be used to constrain
    models at each individual field, using field-scale measurements (figure 2). 3.3.1.
    Challenges 3.3.1.1. Process-based models Uncertainties of the process-based models
    (referred to section 2.3) can come from model inputs, parameters, and structures.
    Beven and Freer (2001) and Liu and Gupta (2007) have provided some detailed discussions
    on these aspects. Here we only discuss our unique perspective related to two major
    challenges. The first challenge is that scalable precision irrigation through
    process-based models requires us to have accurate simulations at each individual
    field in large regions. Process-based models usually can be calibrated at fields
    with rich data. Many practitioners assume that a model that has been calibrated
    at one or a few locations can be applied directly to other random sites. However,
    this approach in general does not work. The reasons are two-folds: first, when
    applying a model to a new site, many site-specific input data is not available,
    such as management practices and soil characteristics, which can lead to large
    errors in the simulations. Second, there are some site-specific model parameters
    remaining unknown and using predefined values may lead to large uncertainties.
    To possibly resolve this issue, we need to calibrate the process-based models
    at each individual field. The challenge thus is how to get the required field-level
    measurements for the calibration at each individual field. Computation burden
    also exists when we want to constrain each individual field using the process-based
    models. The second challenge is the under-represented or missed critical processes
    in the current models. One typical example is the linear/nonlinear response functions
    of Gs to soil moisture used in many current land surface models, such as in NOAH-MP
    model (Niu et al 2011), JULES model (Best et al 2011), and CTESSEL model (Boussetta
    et al 2013). These linear/nonlinear soil moisture-based water stress functions
    only consider soil water supply but ignore atmospheric water demand, thus these
    models have been found to overestimate soil moisture impacts on Gs, thus overestimated
    loss of ET with decreasing soil moisture (Ukkola et al 2016, Lei et al 2018).
    Few models consider the complicated interaction between surface water and groundwater,
    which is critical for the conjunctive use of these two sources for optimal irrigation
    in regions with active surface water and groundwater interactions (Singh et al
    2016). Besides, ignoring these active interactions may also lead to large uncertainties
    of the subsurface hydrological conditions. 3.3.1.2. Statistical/machine learning
    models The first challenge is that statistical/machine learning models are usually
    seen as ''black boxes'', which lack the physical mechanisms related to water cycle
    and irrigation (Torres et al 2011, Goumopoulos et al 2014, Navarro-Hellín et al
    2016, Romero et al 2018). It is difficult to trace the highly variable hydrological
    and vegetation conditions using ''black boxes'' machine learning algorithms. Another
    challenge is the data scarcity for the training of statistical/machine learning
    models at every individual field. The statistical/machine learning models can
    be trained at data-rich fields, while they cannot be extrapolated to other fields
    due to the lack of generality (Goldstein et al 2018, Romero et al 2018). 3.3.2.
    Opportunities 3.3.2.1. Process-based models Regarding the first challenge, process-based
    models should be constrained at each individual field by integrating the field-level
    measurements into data-model fusion methods for scalability. From the perspective
    of data, field-level measurements can be acquired by economic sensors and/or satellite
    remote sensing (see section 3.1.2). Advanced satellite remote sensing technologies
    nowadays can accurately estimate crop conditions (e.g. LAI and GPP) (Wu et al
    2020, Jiang et al 2020b, Kimm et al 2020b) and hydrological conditions (e.g. ET)
    (Jiang et al 2020a), making field-level information available. From the perspective
    of model, sensitive analysis should be applied first to screen out the most sensitive
    model parameters. Then, the most sensitive parameters need to be constrained for
    each individual field using field-level measurements (Yang et al 2020). There
    are many data-model fusion methods that can be used to integrate data and model
    for model constrains at each individual field, including calibration (e.g. Bayesian
    inference) and/or data assimilation. Detailed applications of these methods are
    referred to Houska et al (2014) and Liu and Gupta (2007). Regarding the computational
    cost, surrogate models, based on machine learning methods, can be applied to improve
    the calibration efficiency (Wang et al 2014, Zhang et al 2017). Regarding the
    second challenge of the under-represented or missed critical processes, we envision
    the following opportunities for model. Improved quantification of plant water
    stress following the supply-demand concept and hydraulic functions (referred to
    section 3.2.2) should be incorporated into the process-based models to replace
    the original soil moisture-based water stress functions. The interactions between
    surface water and groundwater should also be incorporated into the process-based
    models at regions where the groundwater level is shallow and consequently active
    interactions happen. It can not only improve the simulation of subsurface hydrological
    conditions for precision irrigation with possible subsurface measurements from
    low-cost subsurface sensors, but also can contribute to the sustainable irrigation
    with the conjunctive use of surface water and groundwater (Wu et al 2016). 3.3.2.2.
    Statistical/machine learning models The nature of ''black boxes'' can be potentially
    resolved by the emerging physics-guided statistical/machine learning models. Physics-guided
    statistical/machine learning models mainly incorporate some physical laws, such
    as water and energy balance, into original ''black boxes'' to improve the traceability
    and prediction performance (de Bézenac et al 2019, Reichstein et al 2019, Yang
    et al 2019) (figure 3). For the limitation of data scarcity for model training,
    the growth of rich data from in-situ sensors and remote sensing (e.g. satellites,
    airborne sensors, and UAVs) can effectively enhance the training of statistical/machine
    learning models (see section 3.1.2). Besides, integrating process-based models
    with statistical/machine learning models will also help alleviate the limitation
    of data scarcity (Shen 2018, Shen et al 2018). 3.4. Producers'' participation
    and motivation Now following the discussion of data, mechanisms, and modeling
    in precision irrigation, we focus on the producers'' participation and motivation
    that is needed to promote precision irrigation decision-support systems. According
    to USDA in 2017, producers'' adoption rate of precision irrigation decision-support
    systems was less than 25%, and their adoption decision is largely depended on
    whether the expected benefits outweighed the adoption costs (USDA 2017, US GAO
    2019). 3.4.1. Challenges Producers have low confidence in precision irrigation
    decision-support systems, and also have concerns in data privacy (Cox 1996). It
    is generally recognized that there are three challenges to the producers'' participation
    and motivation (figure 2). 3.4.1.1. Impractical and unreliable tools Many of the
    existing precision irrigation tools lack the proper user interface and are difficult
    to use, leading to poor user experience (Mir and Quadri 2009). Furthermore, the
    accuracy underlying these tools are in general low, and thus producers are reluctant
    to use them (Cox 1996, Mir and Quadri 2009, US GAO 2019). Besides, most current
    precision irrigation decision-support systems assume that producers follow the
    recommended irrigation decisions strictly for each recommended irrigation event,
    and give producers no flexibility on the recommended irrigation timing (US GAO
    2019). 3.4.1.2. Limited access to information Producers in general have limited
    access to information on the development of new precision irrigation decision-support
    systems. The tools developed by land-grant university extensions are mainly applied
    in experimental fields for research, rather than for practical applications; while
    those from industries are promoted to large-scale producers, rather than those
    with medium to small-sized farms. Besides, there is limited expertise to help
    producers to set up and maintain the precision irrigation decision-support systems
    (Mir and Quadri 2009, US GAO 2019). 3.4.1.3. Limited market-based incentives for
    water conservation There is limited reliance on economic instruments, such as
    water pricing, water trading, and caps on water use, for managing water scarcity
    (Moore 1991, Olmstead and Stavins 2009). Additionally, sustained investments have
    not been made in governance and adequate institutional capacity to manage conflicts
    and adapt to changing conditions. The establishment of water markets could encourage
    water conservation, increase the value of water and induce public and private
    investments in irrigation efficiency (Rosegrant et al 1995, Johansson et al 2002).
    3.4.2. Opportunities Regarding the low confidence from producers on precision
    irrigation decision-support systems, three types of measures could be used to
    increase the producers'' adoption rate (figure 2). 3.4.2.1. Easy-to-use tools
    with flexibility Accuracy and easy-to-use are the basic features affecting the
    adoption rate of precision irrigation tools (Keil et al 1995, Mir and Quadri 2009).
    Use of these tools can be validated using some historical extreme weather events
    (such as drought), and the performance can be shown to producers (figure 3). Besides,
    tools should be provided with easy-to-use interfaces. Additionally, dynamic decision-making
    in precision irrigation tools can provide some flexibility for producers. For
    example, multiple solutions of irrigation timing (the gray region in figure 3)
    can be recommended together, and producers can select the favored one or decide
    not to irrigate. If producers decide not to irrigate, the new and updated irrigation
    scheduling should be provided rapidly based on updated soil and plant conditions.
    The frequent interactions between producers and these tools can give producers
    more flexibility and improve the accuracy of irrigation scheduling. 3.4.2.2. Farm
    policies for promotion The government can develop farm policies to promote precision
    irrigation decision-support systems. For example, the government can provide more
    education and training about these systems and their impact on water sustainability
    through extension and partnerships with private companies. Incentives can also
    be provided to the tool developers to encourage them to deliver technologies and/or
    perform as consultants to provide the support for the tool users (producers).
    Subsidies can also be provided for early adopters, i.e. higher risk tolerance,
    to encourage producers to adopt precision irrigation decision-support systems.
    3.4.2.3. Market-based water institutions Additionally, market-based water institutions,
    such as water markets with caps on water withdrawals and the ability to trade
    water across users, will provide incentives for adopting technologies that increase
    resource use efficiency (Garrick et al 2020). Subsidies to reduce the upfront
    costs of precision technologies can also promote adoption, particularly if producers
    have high discount rates. Enhanced resource use efficiency can however create
    financial incentives to increase economic return; thus, market-based solutions
    in favor of precision irrigation systems should be promised as a joint effort
    of governments, industry, and producers. 3.4.2.4. Extension to the existing center
    pivots Except for the above three types of measures, producers can also add telemetry
    to allow remote control or automatic control of the center pivots (figure 3).
    Producers can receive alerts by e-mail and/or text messages about decision-making
    information and any potential problems online. With the above suggested opportunities,
    precision irrigation decision-support systems can be promoted to producers with
    the existing standard center pivots. 4. Concluding remarks This systematic review
    focuses on precision irrigation research, identifies critical challenges and opportunities
    in four areas, which can be treated as the research directions of precision irrigation
    decision-support systems in the future, thus bridging the gap between research
    and practice. With more efforts in these research directions, our envisioned precision
    irrigation decision-support system (figure 3) can be applied universally and cost-effectively
    using the recent advanced technologies at each individual field in large regions.
    (a)   Data availability and scalability. High spatial-temporal-resolution satellite
    fusion products and low-cost sensor networks are emerging and should be used to
    scale up the adoption of precision irrigation decision-support systems. (b)   Quantification
    of plant water stress. Mechanistic quantification of ''plant water stress'' is
    suggested as triggers to improve irrigation decision, by explicitly considering
    the interaction between soil water supply, atmospheric water demand, and plant
    physiological regulation. (c)   Model uncertainties and constraints. The process-based
    and statistical/machine learning models should be constrained at each individual
    field using field-scale measurements and data-model fusion methods to investigate
    plant water relations for scalable precision irrigation. (d)   Producers'' participation
    and motivation: Easy-to-use tools should be developed with flexibility, and governments''
    financial incentives and support should also be increased to improve adoption
    rates of new irrigation technologies. Acknowledgments We acknowledge the support

  description: This paper provides a chronology and overview of events and policy
    initiatives aimed at addressing irrigation sustainability issues in the San Joaquin
    River Basin (SJRB) of California. Although the SJRB was selected in this case
    study, many of the same resource management issues are being played out in arid,
    agricultural regions around the world. The first part of this paper provides an
    introduction to some of the early issues impacting the expansion of irrigated
    agriculture primarily on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley and the policy
    and capital investments that were used to address salinity impairments to the
    use of the San Joaquin River (SJR) as an irrigation water supply. Irrigated agriculture
    requires large quantities of water if it is to be sustained, as well as supply
    water of adequate quality for the crop being grown. The second part of the paper
    addresses these supply issues and a period of excessive groundwater pumping that
    resulted in widespread land subsidence. A joint federal and state policy response
    that resulted in the facilities to import Delta water provided a remedy that lasted
    almost 50 years until the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act of 2014 was passed
    in the legislature to address a recurrence of the same issue. The paper describes
    the current state of basin-scale simulation modeling that many areas, including
    California, are using to craft a future sustainable groundwater resource management
    policy. The third section of the paper deals with unique water quality issues
    that arose in connection with the selenium crisis at Kesterson Reservoir and the
    significant threats to irrigation sustainability on the west side of the San Joaquin
    Valley that followed. The eventual policy response to this crisis was incremental,
    spanning two decades of University of California-led research programs focused
    on finding permanent solutions to the salt and selenium contamination problems
    constraining irrigated agriculture, primarily on the west side. Arid-zone agricultural
    drainageinduced water quality problems are becoming more ubiquitous worldwide.
    One policy approach that found traction in California is an innovative variant
    on the traditional Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) approach to salinity regulation,
    which has features in common with a scheme in Australia's Hunter River Basin.
    The paper describes the real-time salinity management (RTSM) concept, which is
    geared to improving coordination of west side agricultural and wetland exports
    of salt load with east side tributary reservoir release flows to improve compliance
    with river salinity objectives. RTSM is a concept that requires access to continuous
    flow and electrical conductivity data from sensor networks located along the San
    Joaquin River and its major tributaries and a simulation model-based decision
    support designed to make salt load assimilative capacity forecasts. Web-based
    information dissemination and data sharing innovations are described with an emphasis
    on experience with stakeholder engagement and participation. The last decade has
    seen wide-scale, global deployment of similar technologies for enhancing irrigation
    agriculture productivity and protecting environmental resources.

    Side of the San Joaquin Valley Irrigated agriculture development on the west side
    of the San Joaquin Valley (SJV) of California dates back to the middle nineteenth
    century, fueled by the California gold rush and the policy aims of the federal
    government to open up the western United States to economic development. Sustainable
    irrigated agriculture has two main requirements—an abundant supply of irrigation
    water delivered to the field at the right time and a water supply of adequate
    quality to maintain crop yields. The Irrigation District Law of 1887 (also known
    as the Wright Act) recognized that irrigated agriculture was beneficial to society
    and therefore deserving of public support [1]. This legislation emanated from
    prior basic and applied science directed at solutions to problems associated with
    increasing agricultural productivity and profitability. The Reclamation Act of
    1902 provided public subsidies for irrigation projects for 17 states in the arid
    west following the basic premise of maximum resource utilization enhancing agricultural
    productivity. The federal Central Valley Project that was established in the 1930s
    transformed the economic, social, and political landscape of California’s SJV.
    Patterns of agricultural land use and irrigation practices in the SJV have evolved
    since this time in response to changing resource conditions and technological
    innovation. The advent of the deep-well turbine pump during the 1920s helped farmers
    extract good quality water for irrigation from deep aquifers, often with pump
    lifts of 2000 feet or more [1] (metric unit conversions may be found in Appendix
    A). By the 1930s, the negative effect of this large-scale groundwater utilization
    began to manifest itself in the form of land subsidence, particularly over the
    more actively pumped regions of the SJV such as the west side along Highway I-5,
    which historically received lower allocations of federal water supply. Figure
    1 [2] shows the disaggregation of the Central Valley into major basins—the northern
    Sacramento Basin drainage by the Sacramento River; the San Joaquin (River) Basin
    (SJRB) drained by the San Joaquin River; and the closed Tulare Basin, which is
    usually further divided into the Tulare Lake and Kern sub-Basins. Irrigation water
    supply is conveyed largely by federally-owned facilities (Central Valley Project–CVP)
    in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River Basins and by the State Water project
    (SWP) in the Tulare Basin (Figure 1) [2]. The federal and state water agencies
    contract with local water districts (irrigation districts if they also purvey
    electrical power) for distribution to farmers and municipal customers. California
    is a state that recognizes both appropriative and riparian water rights. Appropriative
    water rights dictate the priority of water delivery to federal and state customers—which
    can create shortages for junior water right holders during dry and critically
    dry years when water deliveries can be cut back or even curtailed. Reliance on
    groundwater escalates during these water-year types—especially for those water
    users who have no other source of water supply, such as those west side farmers
    without riparian water rights to the SJR or Sierran tributary rivers (Figure 1
    and Figure 2) [2,3]. Figure 1. Map of California depicting the state, federal,
    and local water conveyance facilities and domain of service. Agriculture in the
    San Joaquin River Basin (SJRB) receives water through diversions from the SJR
    and the major east side tributaries—the Merced, Tuolumne, and Stanislaus Rivers
    and from the federal Delta Mendota Canal (DMC) and the shared (state–federal)
    California Aqueduct. Only the Sacramento and San Joaquin Basins have a drainage
    outlet to the Delta and San Francisco Bay—the Tulare Basin is a closed basin [2].
    Figure 2. Detailed map of the San Joaquin River (SJR) and its major tributaries
    that provide drainage to the San Joaquin River Basin (SJRB). Irrigation water
    supply sources to agriculture in the San Joaquin Basin include direct diversions
    from the SJR and major tributaries, federal project water from the Central Valley
    Project (CVP) and groundwater. Reservoirs above the Valley floor on the east side
    tributaries are owned by the federal government and by local water districts.
    Major highways such as Interstate I-5 and Highway 99 are shown in light red running
    north and south in the SJRB [3]. The alluvial fans on these margins of the Basin
    contain coarse-grained sediments with lower water-holding capacity requiring higher
    water applications. Inelastic, irrecoverable land subsidence in the Basin resulted
    from extraction that resulted in groundwater heads that exceeded pre-consolidation
    heads (the maximum decline in hydraulic head in the aquifer experienced historically)
    and that is associated with the initiation of new subsidence impacts. Aquifer
    consolidation occurs when the weight of the overlying strata exceeds the ability
    of the aquifer porous media and interstitial groundwater to support it. The largest
    deformation occurred in the soft sediment layers—predominantly clays and silts
    that form aquitards separating each aquifer layer. By the 1970s some west side
    land had subsided as much as 25 feet [1]. Moreover, the declines in pumping water
    levels ensuing from excessive groundwater extraction added significantly to the
    lift costs of pumped water. Over the past three decades, these limited objectives
    have come into conflict with emerging public awareness about the environment in
    general, particularly with the environmental impacts of irrigated agriculture.
    With or without further water development, greater conflict over water can be
    expected to occur, especially in years of shortage. No longer can demand for water
    be accommodated simply by the construction of a new reservoir or storage facility.
    Irrigation-induced salinization of land was observed and documented by Hilgard
    (1889) [4], who drew attention to the long-term consequences of irrigated agriculture
    in saline river basins in the United States and around the world. Salinity problems
    on the west side of the SJV of California are not unusual in river basins where
    the valley soils are developed in alluvial basins that once were covered by the
    ocean. What is unique about the west side of the San Joaquin Valley and the SJRB
    is the impact of selenium environmental toxicity on the drainage problem. The
    SJV occupies the southern two-thirds of California’s Central Valley and the SJRB,
    the focus of this paper, is located in the northern portion of the SJV that drains
    to the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta with an outlet to the Pacific Ocean. The characteristics
    unique to the combined water quality problems in this region have led to innovative
    policy responses and adaptive implementation solutions that continue to evolve.
    California is blessed with highly regarded research institutions that have provided
    service to California agriculture for more than a century and commit significant
    state fund resources to develop technical and policy-oriented strategies to address
    this and other sustainable agricultural issues. This paper analyzes the role these
    institutions have played in addressing the water quality aspects of the problem
    to ensure irrigation sustainability. 2. Water Supply Issues Impacting Irrigation
    Sustainability In the 1960s federal and state agency determination to arrest land
    subsidence and offset rising pumping costs led to a joint project to import surface
    water supply from the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta to the south through the federal
    pumping plant of the Central Valley Project (CVP) located at Tracy. Water deliveries
    from the federal Delta–Mendota Canal (the major conveyance of the San Luis Unit
    of the CVP), which began in 1951, helped arrest subsidence and led to recovery
    of piezometric heads in the underlying aquifers to resemble pre-pumping levels.
    Although the piezometric heads in the confined aquifers recovered significantly,
    only about 10% of the total aquifer deformation was recovered due to the inelastic
    nature of the deformation. Distinguishing between elastic (recoverable) and inelastic
    (irrecoverable) deformation is important for understanding the long-term impacts
    on irrigated agriculture in the San Joaquin Valley and throughout the U.S. [5]
    However, regional groundwater models of the San Joaquin Valley have only relatively
    recently incorporated this feature [6]. This structural solution to the subsidence
    problem was largely successful at the time because much of the pumping occurred
    at great depth, below the Corcoran Clay confining layer, uniformly affecting the
    land surface and resulting in few of the infrastructure impacts associated with
    differential subsidence. Response at the agency level, although slow—some sites
    near Mendota had already declined by more than 35 ft as evidenced by powerline
    poles—absolved stakeholders from having to bear the major financial costs of the
    intervention. During the past decade, however, especially in the regions of the
    SJRB in close proximity to the San Joaquin River or along the alignment of the
    Delta–Mendota Canal (DMC) and the California Aqueduct, subsidence has once again
    been reported [5]. Data from a United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) monitoring
    site showed a subsidence rate of 0.6 ft/year between December 2012 and December
    2013 in the vicinity of Sack Dam on the SJR (Figure 3) [7]. The impacts of this
    more recent subsidence have been more dramatic—in some instances flooding out
    water control structures, causing cracks to the concrete canal lining, and reducing
    the capacity of irrigation canals. Unprecedented rates of well development occurred
    in response to the recent four-year drought that occurred between late 2011 and
    late 2015, which were the driest years since record keeping began in 1895. High
    temperatures worsened the impacts of the drought, with 2014 and 2015 witnessing
    the highest temperatures in the state’s recorded history [1]. Actions by the state
    is this instance have been largely policy-oriented through the passage of the
    Sustainable Groundwater Management Act (SGMA) of 2014 [8] and have been complemented
    by actions at the local level, where alternate water supplies have been found
    to help offset the high volumes pumped by those stakeholders identified as the
    most likely contributors to the problem. Under SGMA, recently formed groundwater
    sustainability agencies (GSAs) are required to restore the groundwater basins
    in their jurisdiction to hydrologic balance by 2040 through implementation of
    policy guidelines and local actions enshrined in groundwater sustainability plans
    (GSPs). Rigorous adherence to these plans and actions achieved through consensus
    are meant to stabilize groundwater levels, decrease additional water quality degradation,
    and halt irreversible land subsidence and the damage to water conveyance infrastructure.
    The SGMA legislation recognizes seven co-equal policy objectives that together
    could achieve sustainable groundwater conditions by first identifying the major
    source and nature of the groundwater overdraft problems and then targeting management
    measures to ensure each basin operates within its long-term estimated sustainable
    yield [9]. These measures include. Figure 3. Total land subsidence measured between
    July 2012 and December 2016 in the SJRB. Subsidence jeopardizes the water supply
    deliveries for SJRB water districts that divert from the SJR along the Arroyo
    Canal with headworks near Sack Dam. The most significant subsidence of over 2.5
    ft occurred in the east side bypass that now conveys a portion of the SJR annual
    flow [10]. Reduction in the chronic lowering of groundwater levels that could
    lead to significant and unreasonable depletion of long-term groundwater supply
    if continued long-term; Reduction in significant and unreasonable losses of available
    groundwater storage; Interventions to eliminate significant and unreasonable impacts
    to the water quality of the groundwater resource through seawater intrusion; Other
    actions designed to prevent degraded groundwater quality; Targeted interventions
    to recognize and prevent future irreversible land subsidence; Actions to avoid
    depletions of interconnected surface waters that could have significant and unreasonable
    adverse impacts on existing and future surface water beneficial use (Cal. Water
    Code §10721(w)). Implementation of SGMA by stakeholders in California will have
    a significant impact on agriculture, particularly in the southern SJV, where irrigators
    are more dependent on groundwater for the majority of their water supply. In some
    areas, it is likely that large amounts of agricultural land will need to be retired
    or enter fallow rotations—some predictions suggest up to 500,000 acres will need
    to be taken out of production over the next 10 to 20 years to achieve basin sustainability
    [11]. In the SJV GSAs can achieve groundwater sustainability in a number of ways,
    including (a) Recharging groundwater basins and temporary wetland areas on fields
    in areas where surplus water supply is available; (b) Reducing water demand through
    crop substitution and increasing water use efficiency through infrastructure and
    irrigation technology investments; (c) Converting agricultural landscapes to wildlife
    habitat that could improve potential recovery of many endangered species in the
    SJV [12]; (d) Fallowing, retiring, or converting land to municipal or industrial
    use such as renewable energy in wind or photovoltaic power. On land where agricultural
    productivity and potential wildlife habitat potential is low, renewable energy
    options may be cost-effective [13]. Reducing the land area devoted to agriculture
    may also improve air quality and eliminate groundwater nitrate levels that pose
    a public health threat associated with intensive agriculture [14]. Stakeholder
    response to SGMA legislation has been remarkably positive and proactive, given
    the decades of policy inaction on groundwater sustainability issues since the
    last major water agency intervention in the 1960s, previously described. This
    may be due in part to the widespread recognition of the severity of the problem,
    a reluctance to engage in years of unproductive litigation, and the fact that
    the state launched this policy initiative with a well-conceived conceptual plan
    that gives stakeholders substantial flexibility and scope for self-governance.
    The SGMA policy initiative may serve as an exemplar to other states and nations
    who are similarly placed to develop public–private partnerships for groundwater
    resource sustainability. Regional Groundwater Models to Guide SGMA Policy Planning
    and Future Irrigation Sustainability Implementation of SGMA will require reliable
    policy assessment and resource planning tools to support future water reallocation
    and water resource management decisions. SGMA policy requires the reporting of
    groundwater pumpage for the first time—requiring direct metering of groundwater
    extraction and allowing groundwater resource analysts to close hydrologic budgets,
    which hitherto were not easily validated. A significant case in point was the
    recent detailed comparison of two integrated regional surface-groundwater hydrologic
    models [15,16], the USGS Central Valley Hydrologic Model (CVHM) [6] and the state’s
    Central Valley Simulation Model (C2VSIM) [17]. These agency models, which were
    developed as basin-scale planning tools covering the entire Central Valley (Figure
    4), were those suggested by SGMA management as essential, publicly available tools
    for GSA analysis and GSP formulation purposes. Maples and others [18,19] reported
    significant differences in annual estimates of both simulated agricultural groundwater
    pumping and aquifer storage when both were analyzed at regional and sub-regional
    scales (Figure 4). Figure 4. (a) Average annual groundwater pumping discrepancies
    and (b) percent differences in average annual groundwater pumping for the USGS
    Central Valley Hydrologic Model (CVHM) and Central Valley Simulation Model (C2VSIM)
    models at the sub-regional, regional, and supra-regional scale during 1962-2003
    [13,15]. The SJRB is shown occupying the southern two-thirds of the Central Valley
    of California [17]. At the sub-regional scale, the average annual volumetric discrepancy
    between the CVHM and C2VSIM models’ estimated groundwater pumping was 0.22 million
    acre-feet per year. All sub-regions showed a greater proportion of excess irrigation
    as deep percolation in CVHM, while C2VSIM showed a greater proportion of excess
    irrigation as runoff and return flow. Further analysis of the CVHM and C2VSIM
    model simulation results showed the greatest differences between the CVHM and
    C2VSIM models at the sub-regional scale—the scale most important for SGMA decision-making.
    This lack of agreement would also impact basin-scale salinity management, since
    many basin-scale salinity mass balance models are underpinned by regional scale
    hydrologic models such as CVHM and C2VSIM. Weaknesses in the capabilities of these
    major agency models will have implications for the utility of these models for
    salinity planning and management at the basin scale. Recent research by Maples
    [18,19] and others identified potential sources of these model simulation discrepancies.
    The fact that input data sets were largely shared by the two models with minor
    differences in inputs such as land use designation and the number of crops considered
    suggests that the results of the comparison were most sensitive to model conceptual
    differences rather than data inputs, particularly at the sub-regional scale [19].
    Additional questions have arisen related to the limitations of these model tools
    to guide sustainable groundwater pumping decisions, which suggests agency inertia
    in the adoption of newer and technically advanced techniques for the development
    of crop water budgets and crop evapotranspiration—the major water loss term in
    the hydrologic budgets. Techniques utilized by both models make use of estimates
    of potential crop evapotranspiration and crop coefficients, most of which come
    from handbooks and field data collected in the 1970s. Plant breeding and the development
    of more drought-tolerant cultivars have brought about changes in the water use
    requirements of these commonly grown agricultural crops, changing the quantity
    of water lost to evapotranspiration during the growing season. In this aspect
    both models may be subject to error and provide limited guidance to agricultural
    stakeholders. There were methodological differences over and above the crop coefficient
    that also contributed to model discrepancies. The CVHM model code calculates the
    E and T components of ET separately and does not independently simulate soil moisture,
    whereas the C2VSIM model code attempts to simulate root-zone soil moisture using
    a single algorithm to manage soil water depletion [6,15]. Whereas the CVHM model
    recognizes root-zone factors such as anoxia and deficit irrigation, these factors
    are ignored in C2VSIM. C2VSIM simulates irrigation hydrology separately for each
    crop within a sub-area that can be reduced in scale to a single model grid cell,
    whereas CVHM simulates this hydrology for the majority land use within each sub-area
    “farm.” Farm size can also be defined as a single model cell. These and other
    factors, when extrapolated over a watershed or river basin, can lead to significant
    differences in the estimates of groundwater storage, aquifer pumping to meet irrigation
    demands, and estimates of land subsidence required under SGMA. One recent development
    that may help to reduce discrepancies in these groundwater resource planning and
    management tools might be the substitution of remote-sensing-based direct estimates
    of crop evapotranspiration to replace algorithmic-based estimates based on potential
    evapotranspiration and crop coefficients. Reliable evapotranspiration (ET) estimation
    is a recognized limitation for water resources planning, irrigation water management,
    water regulation, and water quality estimation in both surface water and in groundwater
    and has been the subject of considerable research innovation in recent years [20,21].
    Over the past decade, researchers have enhanced a number of remote sensing techniques
    and introduced new surveillance platforms to estimate ET. During October 2008
    all remote sensing imagery collected by the LANDSAT 7 satellite became free to
    the public and by December 2009, all LANDSAT data archived by the USGS followed
    suit. The SEBAL (surface energy balance algorithm for land) was one of the early
    applications of remote sensing that used LANDSAT imagery to estimate daily evapotranspiration
    rates at the field scale (30 m) [18]. Remote-sensing-based evapotranspiration
    estimation techniques using “hot” and “cold” pixels have become more ubiquitous
    and have seen significant adoption by agencies and stakeholders alike with the
    SJV. “Hot” and “cold” pixels refer to the electromagnetic radiation from pixels
    representing dry land and irrigated land, respectively, that define the range
    of ET values [21]. The more popular and widely used techniques include METRIC
    (Mapping Evapotranspiration at high Resolution) and Google EARTHENGINE, which
    utilizes METRIC algorithms in a new formulation known as EEFlux (Earth Engine
    Evapotranspiration Flux) [21]. EEFlux is a comprehensive surface energy balance
    model that estimates net radiation (Rn), sensible heat flux to the air (H), and
    conductive heat flux to the ground (G), relative to measured reference evapotranspiration
    (ETr). ETr is the rate at which soil water is vaporized from vegetated surfaces,
    such as grass or alfalfa, based on the Standardized Reference Evapotranspiration
    Equation (ASCE-ET). Updating existing surface and groundwater hydrology models
    to take advantage of this new technology will likely resolve the more important
    technical issues that are constraining the use of these models for long-term resource
    sustainability planning and allow their eventual use for basin-scale salinity
    management. 3. Water Quality Impediments to Irrigation Sustainability Irrigation
    sustainability in the SJV and SJRB, as previously stated, is a function of both
    future water supply and future projected water quality (primarily salinity) of
    irrigation applied water. Developing an understanding of SJV and SJRB hydrology
    is a prerequisite for understanding the dynamics of water quality in the Basin—however,
    water quality cannot be fully resolved without an appreciation for the physiography
    of the Basin that is responsible for the genesis and evolution of the Basin’s
    soils. The SJV contains two hydrologic basins—the SJRB is an open basin that extends
    south of the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta that drains into the SJR. The major
    tributaries to the SJR that provide drainage to the east side of the SJR are the
    Fresno, Merced, Tuolumne, and Stanislaus Rivers. The headwaters of these SJR tributaries
    receive water of high quality that provides dilution to poorer quality drainage
    from west side sources to the SJR. Dams on these tributaries to the SJR for flood
    control and irrigation water supply include Millerton Lake (on the SJR above Friant
    Dam), Lake Hensley (Fresno River), Lake McClure (Merced River), New Don Pedro
    Reservoir (Tuolumne River), and the New Melones Reservoir (Stanislaus River).
    The San Luis Reservoir, located above Highway I-5 on the west side of the SJRB,
    is an off-stream storage facility for the Central Valley Project (CVP) and State
    Water Project (SWP) and is hydraulically connected to the California Aqueduct
    and the DMC. The SJR provides riparian diversions for those stakeholders with
    water rights and who were not signatories to the Exchange Contract with the USBR
    that exchanged SJR water for diversions from the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta.
    Prior to development of the San Luis Unit of the CVP and the DMC, SJR water supply
    irrigated land on the west side of the SJV. Post-CVP construction, water released
    from Friant Dam (Millerton Lake) was diverted south to the Friant–Kern Canal to
    irrigate land in the Tulare Basin and the substitute water supply to the Exchange
    Contractors was supplied via the DMC, which, as its name implies, connects the
    Delta to the Canal’s terminus in the town of Mendota. The Mendota Pool is another,
    much smaller CVP storage reservoir, located at the terminus of the DMC, which
    supplies the century-old agricultural canal distribution system that continues
    to be operated by the Exchange Contractors. This large-scale exchange of water
    rights had an environmental impact that was not fully recognized until later—ostensibly,
    the trade of a very high-quality, albeit less reliable, Sierran water supply for
    a more reliable, brackish water supply, pumped from the Delta. Salinity in the
    Delta pumped supply originates, in part, as agricultural returns from agriculture
    in the Sacramento and SJV municipal discharges and some blending of freshwater
    outflows to the Delta with tidal incursions from San Francisco Bay. The salinity
    of this new project water supply will be of importance in salinity management
    policy described later in this paper and the development of a salinity TMDL. Although
    the primary source of salt to the SJR is in water supply imported from the Delta,
    it is important to recognize that soils on the west side of the Basin are sedimentary
    and alluvial in origin, having been formed in an uplifted seabed that became the
    Coastal Range that borders the west side of the Valley. The native salts in these
    soils mineralized and leached over time with the introduction of higher quality
    irrigation water, which led to rising saline water tables, especially in the Valley
    trough at the medial and distal ends of the alluvial fans where clay and silty
    clay soil textures predominate. For decades, the major constraint to crop productivity
    and irrigation sustainability was increased salinity due to soluble salt accumulation
    in the crop root zone and plant toxicity due to elevated concentrations of trace
    elements such as boron. As root-zone salinity increases, the crop must expend
    extra energy to overcome osmotic forces and extract nutrients and fresh water
    from the soil. High root-zone salinity correlates with high crop water stress
    [22,23,24,25]. This is remedied by flushing the crop root zone of excess salts
    through irrigation leaching, applied in excess of the crop’s water requirement.
    This process is facilitated through installation of sub-surface tile drains, installed
    to remove the flushed salts and to control the proximity of the crop roots to
    the groundwater table [22,24,26]. Maintenance of a groundwater table five feet
    or more below the soil surface reduced root-zone evaporation and concentration
    of salts. An extinction depth of approximately seven feet is used as a typical
    threshold for west side SJV soils [27]. This extinction depth is defined as the
    limit of salt evaporative concentration and is a function of soil texture and
    capillarity. Within the SJRB there are three major categories of land use: agricultural,
    wetlands, and urban/municipal. Administratively, agricultural lands within the
    SJV and SJRB are serviced by water (irrigation) districts that manage water conveyance,
    and drainage districts that often have the same footprint and are responsible
    for district drainage and investments in related drainage conveyance infrastructure.
    Federal, state, and private wetland entities operate like water districts although
    all rely on entities like the Grassland Water District to perform water-wheeling
    operations. The largest water district on the west side of the SJV is the Westlands
    Water District, most of which drains naturally to the closed Tulare Basin and
    which does not have a historic right to convey drainage water to the SJR. The
    San Luis Drain, which was originally designed to convey drainage to the Delta,
    has a terminus at Kesterson Reservoir [26]. While the Drain was in operation it
    provided drainage relief to 5300 acres of irrigated land in the northeast corner
    of Westlands Water District before drainage discharge ceased in 1986 by court
    order. Sub-surface tile drains were installed on approximately 135,000 acres of
    irrigated lands in the SJRB [26] to control seasonally elevated water tables and
    to dispose of accumulated salts in the crop root zone. 3.1. The Kesterson Crisis
    and Policy Implications for Irrigation Sustainability In order to mitigate long-term
    salinity problems that were first recognized and described more than one hundred
    years ago in the SJV, the federal and state governments embarked on an ambitious
    joint policy and structural solution—a master drain designed to collect and convey
    mostly subsurface agricultural drainage from the west side of the SJV to the Delta.
    However, the reproductive failure of waterfowl and embryo deformities first observed
    at Kesterson Reservoir in 1983 and attributed to selenium poisoning from agricultural
    drainage became an environmental disaster for agency planners [28]. The selenium
    debacle cast a spotlight on the potential hazards associated with agricultural
    return flows and for a while distracted from the pervasive threat of long-term
    basin salination and the need for science-based salinity management strategies.
    It was also instrumental in creating a significant shift in public perception
    of the environmental impacts of agriculture that continues to this day. In hindsight,
    the early discovery of these problems may have averted a longer term, more serious
    disaster. The long-term chronic consequences of selenium contamination may have
    led to many more instances of nesting failure and wildfowl mortality. The Kesterson
    experience merely helped, albeit dramatically, to focus attention on the potential
    environmental consequences of intensive irrigation and subsurface drainage in
    an arid environment. Since the Kesterson crisis, other sites throughout the western
    U.S. have been identified where concentrations of selenium and other trace elements
    such as arsenic occur at potentially toxic levels [28]. The fallout from this
    event galvanized the U.S. Congress to launch two USD 50 million five-year research
    programs to gain knowledge of the fundamental science underpinning the selenium
    contamination issue and to fund a long-term selenium management and disposal solution
    for Kesterson Reservoir. The Kesterson disaster also highlighted the lack of preparedness
    within both state and federal agencies for dealing with this sort of event and
    the fundamental lack of scientific data and decision support tools needed to manage
    a credible crisis response. The state and federal agencies joined forces to create
    the San Joaquin Valley Drainage Program (SJVDP) with congressional appropriation
    and approached the University of California research community to address information
    and data gaps and to develop analytical modeling tools and procedures to provide
    long-term decision support for this and future environmental resource crises [26].
    3.2. Research Directed at Sustainable Solutions to Irrigation-Induced Water Quality
    Problems Agency analysts associated with the SJVDP formed the University of California
    Salinity Drainage Task Force, which became a primary vehicle to fund mission-relevant
    research activity at the major campuses of UC Davis, UC Riverside, UC Berkeley
    and the University of California, Los Angeles. These campus researchers formed
    partnerships and collaborations with agency scientists aside from those affiliated
    with the SJVDP, such as the U.S. Geological Survey, California Department of Fish
    and Game, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and USBR, who helped to lend credibility
    to work being performed within the agencies and gave them access to superior laboratory
    research facilities within the universities. The studies funded ran the gamut
    of field-scale hydrologic and solute transport studies of selenium, boron, and
    other contaminants of concern to fish and invertebrate toxicity studies conducted
    in both field and laboratory. Annual results from these investigations were presented
    in an annual conference that continued into the late 1990s [26]. The hydrodynamicist
    and salinity model expert Orlob (1991) [29] analyzed historical data to determine
    the long-term state of balance between salt imported to and salt exported from
    the SJRB. Results of his study showed that since completion of the DMC, over 20
    million tons of salt had been imported into the SJV through diversions. Water
    quality in the DMC is generally inferior to that in the California Aqueduct, owing
    to the proximity of the Tracy pumping plant (Figure 1) to the SJR confluence.
    Typical salinity of the DMC was between 400 and 500 mg/I total dissolved solids.
    The average salt accretion to the SJRB through the DMC was between 1.2 and 1.46,
    million metric tons per year [29]. Since the construction of the surface water
    reservoirs on the east side of the SJV and subsequent diversion of water along
    the Friant–Kern Canal, the average annual flow in the SJR (as measured at the
    Vernalis gaging station) declined by about 13 million acre-feet. Consequently,
    outflow of salt from the SJRB is now much smaller than that imported into the
    SJV by way of the DMC and the California Aqueduct. The remaining salt accumulates
    in the crop root zone or in the shallow groundwater aquifers beneath agricultural
    land on the west side. At the calculated rate of accretion Orlob calculated the
    net annual import of salt to be about 2.4 million tons by the year 2007 [29].
    Other regional and sub-regional scale models have also served a useful purpose
    in the evolution of salt management policy in the SJRB—primarily to generate quantitative
    understanding of the fate and transport of salt from the point of diversion through
    to discharge to the SJR. Most models used for quantification of crop leaching
    requirements are based on mass-balances of water and salt using a theoretical
    one-dimensional column of soil extending from the soil surface to the groundwater
    table, which simulates water uptake in the crop root zone. These models utilize
    inputs of rainfall, applied irrigation water, and calculate crop evapotranspiration
    and the change in root-zone stored moisture as a function of time. Salt accumulation
    in the crop root zone accounts for salt imported with irrigation water, precipitation
    and dissolution of minerals, salts advected by root-zone deep percolation and
    any minor salt removal with the harvested crop. Although conceptually simple,
    accurate and reliable simulation of root-zone water balance and salt transport
    remains elusive at the field, watershed, and basin scales. Approximations such
    as the idealized model of Hoffman and van Genuchten [24] have used a linearly
    averaged salt concentration for the root zone. The most significant of these hydrology
    and water quality simulation tools was completed in 1987 as a collaboration between
    UC Davis and the State Water Resources Control Board. The San Joaquin River Input–Output
    (SJRIO) Model [30,31] was the first comprehensive data-driven water quality simulation
    model of the SJR that became the basis for the Watershed Analysis Risk Management
    Framework (WARMF) forecasting model underpinning the Real-time Salinity Management
    program presented in the last section of this paper. Although not part of the
    University of California research consortium, members of the Irrigation Technology
    Research Center (ITRC) at California Polytechnic University (CalPoly) played a
    key role by providing a technical liaison between individual growers, water districts,
    and agency planners—providing realistic field and farm data for use in agency
    models [32,33]. CalPoly agricultural engineers recognized the importance to growers
    of correctly estimating the crop leaching requirement, the importance of developing
    a shared understanding of how irrigation efficiency is estimated and the fact
    that field and farm assessments of irrigation are closely tied to grower behavior
    [33]. Irrigation efficiency has been defined differently in the literature for
    both practical and policy purposes. A common definition of crop irrigation efficiency
    is the ratio of the applied irrigation water to the proportion of that water beneficially
    used by the same crop. Beneficial use refers to the annual crop water requirement.
    Irrigation consultants occasionally adopt a broader definition of crop beneficial
    use that includes a minimum leaching requirement and allowance for frost protection
    and other routine cropping practices. These additional factors usually produce
    higher estimates of irrigation efficiency and can result in estimated irrigation
    efficiencies of greater than 100% in instances where upward capillary flow from
    shallow groundwater can satisfy a portion of crop ET. In these circumstances the
    event-based irrigation efficiency can increase over the irrigation season with
    crop root development and the increased ability to access capillary water from
    the shallow groundwater table. Burt et al. [33] stress that the selection of an
    appropriate irrigation efficiency in salinity management models at all scales
    should be done judiciously and be transparent to irrigation consultants and agency
    planners alike so as to maintain confidence in the use of these models. Different
    ontologies for computation of important factors such as irrigation efficiency
    can lead to differences in model outputs, as described earlier in the case of
    the CVHM and C2VSIM models. Researchers at CalPoly’s ITRC also provided practical
    advice [32,33] that provided guidance for the interpretation of agency planning
    simulation models. An example is the maxim that maximizing water use efficiency
    is not always in the best interests of the grower in fields and farms where soil
    texture is heterogeneous and high irrigation application distribution uniformity
    performance for furrow and basin irrigation systems is hard to achieve. ITRC guidelines
    suggested a practical distribution uniformity goal of 80% for most furrow irrigation
    systems. The ITRC researchers also suggested that high irrigation water use efficiency
    was not likely for those irrigation systems with poor distribution uniformity
    if sufficient water is to be applied that satisfies crop ET requirements. In cases
    where there is cost associated with drainage disposal measured either according
    to volume or salt load, it can be more cost-effective to maximize investments
    that improve water use efficiency and help reduce drainage discharge. Irrigation
    and drainage unit costs were incorporated by the SJVDP in the development of the
    Westside Agricultural Drainage Economics (WADE) model [34,35]—a seasonal agricultural
    production and hydrosalinity model designed to make long-term projections in irrigation
    and drainage technology in response to drainage policy options. WADE model simulations
    showed that increased costs of drainage disposal, applied to the WADE model as
    cost constraints of the agricultural production function, led to investments in
    water-conserving irrigation technologies such as shortened rows, sprinkler or
    drip irrigation, which, in turn, reduced irrigation applied water [35]. In circumstances
    where model sub-areas received less than an optimal water supply, the model reduced
    ET, which led to a reduction in crop yield. During severe drought when water deliveries
    to irrigators can be reduced by as much as 75%, prompting irrigators to choose
    between fallowing large tracts of farmland and/or deficit-irrigating crops, the
    WADE model allowed both to be simulated while also factoring in the costs associated
    with well pumpage [35]. The WADE model realized the potential yield reduction
    associated with elevated water salinity in well pumpage during the subsequent
    irrigation season and elevated salinity in the crop root zone [35]. The WADE hydrosalinity
    model simulated downward displacement of salts from root zone to shallow aquifer
    and between the shallow semi-confined aquifer (set at an elevation of 50 ft below
    the soil surface) and the deep semi-confined aquifer that was bounded by the top
    of the Corcoran Clay. The WADE model also recognized a sub-Corcoran aquifer that
    was the major zone of well pumpage and where salinity levels were assumed to be
    below 1500 ppm [35]. Aquifer characteristic data such as layer depths, hydraulic
    conductivities, storage coefficients, and aquifer anisotropy values were derived
    from the U.S. Geological Survey regional simulation model developed by Belitz
    [35,36]. Cross-Corcoran fluxes were similarly used directly by the model. Reuse
    of shallow groundwater is a process also captured by the WADE model that can have
    a significant impact on estimated system and crop irrigation efficiency as well
    as salinity concentration in the crop root zone because of salt evaporative concentration.
    When subsurface drainage is available, a portion of the saline percolating water
    may be intercepted by the tile drains and subsequently discharged to sumps or
    surface drainage ditches. The WADE model allowed specification of this intercepted
    portion removed from the shallow aquifer layer. The WADE model used a simplified
    link-node algorithm, calibrated using MODFLOW ZONEBUDGET output from the USGS
    regional model [36] to simulate lateral flow between adjacent sub-areas. The WADE
    model did not capture scenarios where complex lateral groundwater flow patterns
    exist and where groundwater salinity is impacted by groundwater gradients. The
    WADE model adopted the USGS conceptual model [36] of a vertically dominant aquifer
    where groundwater flow is predominantly in the vertical direction and horizontal
    flow less significant in response to shallow groundwater gradients. In this manner,
    shallow groundwater salinity can, through the process of evapo-concentration,
    achieve a concentration of 20 to 30 times the applied water salinity for undrained
    soils and around five times the applied water salinity for drained soils. 3.3.
    Surface and Groundwater Strategies for Sustainable Irrigation Groundwater is increasingly
    recognized as valuable natural resource, as evident from the SGMA policy and legislation
    described earlier, and the strong connection between surface and groundwater ensures
    not only a sustainable water supply but also that groundwater aquifers provide
    water of sufficient quality for sustainable irrigation. Deep percolation of irrigation
    applied water displaces better quality groundwater; the rate at which this displacement
    occurs is a function of the rate of groundwater extraction from the deep semi-confined
    and lower confined aquifers, which, in turn, can affect the vertical hydraulic
    gradient driving the flow of groundwater between aquifers. Reversing long-term
    irrigation-induced salinization of these groundwater aquifers requires quantifying
    current day practices such as over-irrigation and groundwater mining coupled with
    improving information on how irrigation leaching requirements can be optimized
    through more effective irrigation scheduling and the selection of appropriate
    irrigation technologies best tailored to match crop ET requirements. One management
    strategy [37] sought to maintain the salinity concentration in the root zone at
    a level tolerated by the plants without leading to yield declines. The researchers
    described how dynamic programming methods can help to redesign irrigation schedules
    to better manipulate salts in the soil profile. The selection of irrigation technology
    (e.g., furrow, drip, etc.) as well as the intensity of irrigation water management
    can affect the ability of irrigators to control the distribution of salt in the
    soil profile. Others [38] concurred that adoption of new technologies alone would
    have a limited effect on improving irrigation water use efficiency and controlling
    soil salinity—these need to be complemented by active management using decision
    support tools and a combination of water application and drainage control strategies
    to achieve irrigation sustainability goals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture
    Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) [39] described a number of on-farm techniques
    sanctioned by the USDA to improve irrigation water use efficiency and control
    salinity. These techniques include: improved irrigation and drainage technologies;
    a reduction in pre-plant irrigation applications; better management of deficit
    irrigation for certain crops as they near maturity; partial reuse of drain water;
    and the use of on-farm indicators and decision support tools to dynamically guide
    irrigation water applications. Irrigation technologies covered include furrow,
    corrugation, basin and border irrigation, as well as micro-irrigation technologies
    comprising surface and subsurface drip irrigation and sub-irrigation [40]. Sprinkler
    irrigation systems also can be acquired in a number of forms including permanent,
    moved, side roll, and center pivot systems that can be optimally matched to various
    crops, cropping practices, soil conditions, and active management capabilities.
    3.4. Economic Factors Impacting Sustainable Irrigation Policy While process-based
    simulation models can relate crop yield and drainage salt load to a variety of
    water application and drainage strategies, certain activities aimed at improving
    crop yield may conflict with SGMA goals of sustainable protection of groundwater
    quality in the shallow groundwater aquifer on the west side of the SJV. These
    conflicting objectives may be similarly constrained by economic considerations
    of cost and benefit. To identify the optimal irrigation strategies, linear and
    dynamic programming methods [41] were studied that consider crop water requirements,
    soil salinity, and the costs of production both at the individual farm and water
    district levels. This selection process can be accomplished with dynamic optimization
    at the farm level over a sequence of years under various permutations of crop
    rotation, soil salinity management practices, and investments in irrigation and
    drainage technologies, as demonstrated by Knapp [42,43,44]. Dinar et al. [45]
    also used dynamic programming models to develop a policy analysis framework for
    irrigated agriculture sustainability in arid environments such as the west side
    of the SJV. Dinar’s model used data-derived, empirical input functions for factors
    such as crop yield, salinity, and drainage discharge and used a production model
    objective function with both cost and revenue terms [45]. The economic model of
    irrigation sustainability suggested that direct drainage control policies exacting
    penalties for saline drainage discharge were slightly more cost-effective than
    indirect control policies. The research concluded that dynamic models may be overly
    complex for this class of problem given the fact that these agro-economic systems
    often converge to a steady state, eliminating the dynamic model requirement that
    time be considered an independent variable. In practical terms, dynamic optimization
    is computationally intensive and requires significant computer resources to run
    the model quickly, more so when the interacting physical, chemical, and anthropogenic
    system inputs are complex. Under these circumstances, dynamic optimization may
    be more useful as a tool for screening various policy or management options, followed
    by the evaluation of specific management options using more detailed and comprehensive
    process-oriented simulation models [41]. Social behavior modeling can also offer
    insight into adaptive behavior and technology adoption as growers and water districts
    evolve towards greater sustainable utilization of natural resources for sustainable
    irrigation and drainage salinity management [46,47,48]. 3.5. Regional Policy Planning
    and Assessment Models for Irrigation Sustainability Policy planning and assessment
    models are often integrated with the process-oriented models described above and
    typically focus on large regions at the scale of the SJV or SJRB. These models
    often relate economic objectives to resource constraints and responses. Physical
    and chemical processes, defined at the field and farm scale, become less and less
    meaningful as the spatial scale expands to the regional scale. Hence regional
    scale planning and assessment models utilize fewer parameters and typically combine
    model parameters into a smaller number of lumped parameters in order to generalize
    responses to the most sensitive hydrologic, agronomic, and geochemical processes
    and interrelationships. When available, these regional scale models can use empirical
    relationships derived from higher resolution and more detailed models, given that
    regional scale models are more difficult to calibrate and validate. Models used
    in agency planning studies emphasize model output comparisons between potential
    future scenarios and no-action and base conditions rather than promise accurate
    and reliable model predictions. A successor to the previously described Westside
    Agricultural Drainage Economics (WADE) Model [35], the Agricultural Production
    Salinity Irrigation Drainage Economics (APSIDE) model [49] is a good example of
    this class of policy model. Unlike the WADE model, the APSIDE model was reworked
    to simulate the same agricultural production and income projections in response
    to irrigation water quality and drainage policy constraints and a monthly timestep
    to allow linkage to a climate-driven water resource allocation model (CALSIM-II)
    and an SJR water quality model (WARMF). Output from the model suggested optimal
    investments in irrigation and drainage technology over the 50-year planning horizon
    in response to monthly drainage salt load constraints and irrigation water supply
    salinity that was expected to degrade with climate change in the SJRB. The APSIDE
    model production function used the same empirical algorithm calibration technique
    for the agricultural production function as was used in the WADE model, which
    set annual cropping practices and made changes to irrigation and drainage investments
    at the beginning of the irrigation season. It used an error minimization algorithm
    in lieu of the production function for each month of the simulation to resolve
    hydrology and salinity mass balances [49]. Major APSIDE decision variables, some
    of which were supplied by linkages to water allocation models such as CALSIM to
    address climate change impacts, included: water supply, water supply water quality,
    crop selection, irrigation and drainage improvement costs, groundwater pumping,
    drainage recycling, water transfers between regions, and land use changes. 4.
    Evolution of Environmental Policy Mandates Impacting Irrigated Agriculture The
    Kesterson selenium crisis and the stigma newly inflicted on irrigated agriculture
    in the SJV that suggested that agriculture posed a threat to SJRB environmental
    quality, weakened alliances that had previously formed with urban and municipal
    interests and with the environmental lobby. Agricultural interests had aligned
    with cities to assist in drought mitigation by voluntarily fallowing land during
    dry and critically dry years and providing additional water supply to cities.
    Likewise, rice farmers embraced winter flooding of rice fields, eliminating annual
    rice burning and the smoke and particulate pollution that followed, also providing
    essential overwintering habitat to migratory waterfowl on the Pacific Flyway.
    These alliances became fractured and a weakened agricultural lobby led to an unprecedented
    reevaluation of federal water contracts within the CVP, resulting in the so-called
    \"Miller Bill\" (CVP Improvement Act PL 102-575 Title 34). The Environmental Impact
    Statement (EIS) requirement for contract renewal for each CVP contract reduced
    the total allocation of federal developed water to agriculture by 800,000 acre-feet
    and redesignated this water allocation for fish and wildlife purposes. The Miller
    Bill redressed the loss of wetland acreage that had occurred over the past century,
    diminishing it from four million acres to a little over one million acres by the
    early 1920s and to about 10% of the original wetland area of 1850 [1]. Agriculture
    on the west side of the SJV found itself constrained by the seemingly opposing
    objectives of economics on the one hand and the less tangible objectives of quality
    of life, stemming from prosperity. The net result was also a turning away from
    voluntary accommodation of irrigated agriculture, more questioning of the ability
    of agriculture to conduct business in a sustainable fashion, especially in the
    western SJV and the SJRB, and a preference for future legislative and environmental
    policy solutions after the success of the Miller Bill. A common tool for water
    quality regulation used throughout the conterminous U.S. is the EPA-supported
    Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL). The TMDL is a regulatory tool for allocating
    responsibility for pollution in impaired waterbodies by estimating the assimilative
    capacity of the waterbody for the pollutant, determining the mass loading from
    point and non-point sources contributing to this impairment, and developing downstream
    water quality objectives in the waterbody that are rarely exceeded. Compliance
    is achieved in the TMDL methodology by choosing a conservative lowest 10% hydrologic
    condition and an adequate margin of safety. For salt management in the western
    U.S. this methodology can be excessively restrictive and costly for agricultural
    stakeholders [50]. The ability to craft a credible science-based TMDL is predicated
    on the ability to develop a data-driven modeling approach, which is especially
    important in the SJRB where powerful political forces are aligned with agricultural,
    urban municipal, and environmental interests that often have competing development
    and resource sustainability agendas. Although, as noted in the previous sections
    on water supply and water quality in this paper, the groundwater resource sustainability
    problem and the Kesterson agricultural drainage-induced water quality crisis have
    together ensured a deep well of discrete and agency-sponsored routinely collected
    data to launch a defensible model-based analytical approach. Although no modeling
    approach is without its flaws, since models are typically conceived and funded
    for a specific purpose and are not always supported beyond the initial problem
    mandate. Under SGMA renewed concern about aquifer subsidence has allowed agencies
    to rehabilitate aquifer extensometer monitoring sites that had not been actively
    maintained since the 1960s [7]. New remote sensing for estimating land surface
    deformation, such as InSAR, have allowed the collection of accurate regional subsidence
    data at a fraction of the cost of maintaining an extensometer monitoring station.
    Similarly, many of the core flow gaging and water quality monitoring stations
    that were installed in the aftermath of the Kesterson crisis have been maintained
    through a combination of state and federal water agency and local agency support
    and most recently by the San Joaquin River Restoration Program. These stations
    have provided analysts with a sufficient data record to allow calibration and
    validation of models such as the San Joaquin WARMF (Watershed Analysis Risk Management
    Framework), a data-driven flow routing and comprehensive water quality simulation
    model [51] that has supplanted the SJRIO model, previously described, which provided
    the basis for the SJR salinity TMDL. 4.1. Salinity Load Regulation Methodology
    for the SJRB The Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board’s (CVWB)
    Salt and Boron Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) for the SJR [52,53] was approved
    on 28 July 2006. In response to the Salinity and Boron TMDL, the USBR adopted
    a salinity control plan entitled “Actions to Address the Salinity and Boron TMDL
    Issues for the Lower SJR” and entered into a Management Agency Agreement (MAA)
    with the CVWB on 22 December 2009. The MAA describes the actions the USBR will
    take to meet Salinity and Boron TMDL obligations, in particular, maintaining compliance
    with salinity objectives of 700 µS/cm during the irrigation season (1 April–31
    August) and 1000 µS/cm during the non-irrigation season (1 September–31 March)
    measured as a 30-day running average electrical conductivity (EC) at the Vernalis
    compliance monitoring station. The Action Plan also describes procedures to manage
    and mitigate adverse impacts of salt and boron imported into the SJRB via the
    USBR’s DMC as included in the CVWB’s most recently amended Water Quality Control
    Plan for the Sacramento River and the SJRB [53]. The USBR routinely provides dilution
    flows from the New Melones Reservoir on the Stanislaus River to meet the Vernalis
    30-day running average salinity objectives when there is insufficient salt load
    assimilative capacity in the SJR. 4.2. Model-Based TMDL Salt Load Allocation Methodology
    The CVWB salinity TMDL model methodology, supported by archival and current discrete
    and continuous flow and EC monitoring data, followed a protocol that the CVWB
    believed would be perceived as equitable and fair. Regulators divided the SJRB
    into seven watershed-based sub-areas that contribute flow and salt loads to the
    SJR. The Grassland sub-area of the west side regularly contributes between 50%
    and 65% of the total salt load in the SJR, followed by the northwest side sub-area
    (Figure 5). Growers in both sub-areas obtain irrigation water supply from the
    DMC, the SJR, and local groundwater. Irrigation drainage recycling in both sub-areas
    contributes to the available water supply. The TMDL approach is designed to assign
    to each contributing sub-area a salt load allocation based on the sub-area average
    annual contribution to the salt load scaled back and weighted, using techniques
    to account for water-year types with low monthly SJR salt load assimilative capacity,
    measurement uncertainty, and an inherent lack of central coordination of drainage
    scheduling. This lack of coordination between west side sub-areas contributing
    the highest salt loads and east side sub-areas (the tributary watersheds and the
    East Valley Floor sub-area) that provide SJR dilution through reservoir releases
    along the three major Sierran tributaries prevents full use of the SJR salt load
    assimilative capacity. The TMDL is unusual in that it recognized the federal water
    agency and purveyor of water supply as a primary stakeholder, given that this
    supply introduced salt loads to the SJR elevated above historic background levels
    for normal east side tributary inflow to the SJR. The Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta
    is the source of the USBR water supply delivered via the DMC to both the Grassland
    and Northwest sub-areas (Figure 5). The salinity of this supply water can degrade
    along the DMC because of inflow of storm drainage and runoff, subsurface drainage
    from interceptor drains, and pumped groundwater from wells along the canal alignment
    that help to increase the total volume of water supply delivered to federal Central
    Valley project (CVP) contractors. Figure 5. SJR Basin showing contributing sub-areas
    as defined in the 2002 TMDL [50]. This figure shows the alignment of the Delta–Mendota
    Canal (DMC) and the San Luis Drain that terminates at Kesterson Reservoir. Major
    SJR and west side and east side tributary monitoring stations are also shown.
    4.3. West Side Salinity Sources The CVWB periodically updates their SJRB Water
    Quality Control Plan, which allocates a salt load to the USBR for water supply
    delivered to CVP contractors on the west side of the SJRB. The load allocation
    (LA) for these DMC deliveries to the Grassland and Northwest side sub-areas was
    calculated as follows: LADMC = QDMC ∗ 52 mg/L ∗ 0.0013599, where LADMC = Load
    Allocation of salt for DMC water deliveries (tons) QDMC = monthly volume of water
    delivered to Grassland and Northwest side sub-areas (acre-feet) 52 mg/l = “background”
    TDS of SJR water at Friant Dam (SJRB Basin Plan) 0.0013599 = TDS unit conversion
    factor (mg/L to tons/acre-feet) Salt loading above this load allocation was considered
    an “excess” salt load, which must be offset by watershed sources that increase
    SJR salt load assimilative capacity or that reduce non-point source salt loading.
    The USBR agreed upon a suite of actions, described in the stakeholder-endorsed
    SJRB Action Plan, that was designed to offset this excess salt load. Excess salt
    loads (ELDMC) were calculated as follows: ELDMC = QDMC ∗ (CDMC − 52 mg/L) ∗ 0.0013599,
    where ELDMC = excess salt load above the Load Allocation (LADMC), in tons CDMC
    = monthly average (arithmetic mean) of salinity of the water delivered to Grassland
    and Northwest sub-areas, in mg/L QDMC was calculated for each reach of the DMC
    to the point of delivery and paired with the associated monthly average TDS (from
    measured EC) for the same reach to produce the equation for the cumulative ELDMC.
    Accordingly, the Grassland and Northwest sub-areas were assigned independent salt
    load allocations described as water supply credits that are a function of the
    total volume of water delivered to each sub-area. Water deliveries were apportioned
    by sub-area where the DMC supplied water across the sub-area boundary. The calculated
    Consumptive Use Allowance is the product of the actual monthly flow volume and
    a trigger salinity value of 192 mg/L TDS, which was assumed equivalent to the
    mean salinity of drainage return flows after accounting for seasonal crop evapotranspiration
    for an irrigation water supply with a salinity of 52 mg/L. 4.4. Quantification
    of East Side Assimilative Capacity Generating Flows The U.S. Congress authorized
    the construction and operation of New Melones Reservoir on the Stanislaus River
    as a multi-purpose facility, which includes water quality as a qualified use.
    Non-consumptive water releases from this reservoir are of high quality and provide
    significant dilution flow for salinity in the SJR. Other releases of stored water
    from New Melones are made for instream fishery benefits and to maintain the dissolved
    oxygen level in the Stanislaus River above the confluence with the SJR. Any time
    these routine releases are insufficient to decrease SJR salinity below the 30-day
    running average salinity objective at Vernalis (Figure 5; Site 2) additional water
    quality releases are scheduled by the USBR to maintain salinity compliance and
    offset excess salinity loads imported through the DMC. The current CVWB Basin
    Water Quality Control Plan specifies that entities providing dilution flows obtain
    an allocation equal to the salt load assimilative capacity provided by this flow
    (Figure 6). This allocation is only applied if the dilution flow being quantified
    provides measurable dilution in the SJR to the Vernalis compliance monitoring
    station and creates assimilative capacity without interfering with the Stanislaus
    River sub-area’s salt load allocation. Figure 6. Monthly assimilative capacity
    calculation for the Grassland sub-area [52]. In each case the monthly measured
    load (adjusted for the estimated salt load from groundwater accretions) should
    be added to the CVP salt load offset (provided by USBR dilution flow from New
    Melones Reservoir) and compared to the monthly sub-area allocation. The difference
    between these totals is the monthly sub-area salt load allocation or assimilative
    capacity unused. If this number is negative the salt load is in excess of the
    salt load allocation and the sub-area is out of compliance and could be subject
    to a fine. To calculate the assimilative capacity (Figure 7) created by the USBR’s
    operations on the Stanislaus River both the actual salt load and the salt allocation
    of the River were calculated. The monthly salt load was subtracted from the monthly
    salt load allocation to determine available salt load assimilative capacity [32].
    A site-specific ratio of 0.69 was used for all east side tributaries to convert
    EC to TDS. The actual salt loading was calculated as follows: Lactual = Qactual
    ∗ Cactual ∗ 0.69 ∗ 0.0013599, where Figure 7. Monthly assimilative capacity calculation
    for the Stanislaus River sub-area [50]. As with Figure 6 the monthly sub-area
    load should be compared to the measured salt load. The difference between the
    sub-area monthly salt load and the monthly allocation is the monthly salt load
    assimilative capacity that is unused. Hence the Stanislaus River sub-area typically
    provides more salt load assimilative capacity than it consumes. Lactual = actual
    tributary salt loading (tons/month) Qactual = actual flow volume (acre-feet/month)
    Cactual = monthly mean EC (µS/cm) 0.69 = TDS:EC ratio specific to Stanislaus River
    0.0013599 = TDS unit conversion factor (mg/L to tons/acre-feet) The salt load
    allocation to the Stanislaus River sub-area was calculated as the sum of its Load
    Allocation (LA) and the Consumptive Use Allowance, as previously defined. Likewise,
    salt load assimilative capacity allocations for the Merced River and Tuolumne
    River sub-areas were calculated as the sum of the Base Load and the Consumptive
    Use Allowance allocations. Flow data for the Tuolumne River were obtained from
    the USGS stream gaging station at Modesto (11290000) and for the Merced River
    at the USGS stream gaging station near Stevinson (11272500). Fish and wildlife
    protection, restoration, and enhancement became important USBR project purposes
    with the passage of the Central Valley Project Improvement Act (CVPIA) in 1992.
    The CVPIA committed 800,000 acre-feet of annual CVP project water, previously
    allocated to agriculture, to meet these objectives. A Water Acquisition Program
    (WAP) was created to acquire additional water supply when needed, and to improve
    the agency’s ability to meet new regulatory water quality requirements under a
    new Program to Meet Standards. These additional project water supply deliveries
    provide additional assimilative capacity that adds to the USBR’s project area
    salt load allocation [52,53]. Water supply dilution flow allocations were equated
    to the salt load assimilative capacity provided by this flow as follows: Adil
    = Qdil ∗ (Cdil − WQO) ∗ EC:TDS ∗ 0.0013599, where Adil = salt load assimilative
    capacity allocation provided by dilution flow (tons of salt/month) Qdil = dilution
    flow volume (acre-feet/month) Cdil = dilution flow EC (µS/cm) WQO = salinity water
    quality objective for the LSJR at Airport Way Bridge near Vernalis in μS/cm EC:TDS
    = TDS:EC ratio specific to the SJR (0.64). Ratio set to 0.66 for the Merced River
    and 0.67 for the Tuolumne River 0.0013599 = TDS unit conversion factor (mg/L to
    tons/acre-feet) Sub-area allocation calculations are based on the Base Load Allocations
    and the Consumptive Use Allowance calculations (Figure 6) for the Merced River
    and Tuolumne River sub-areas. Flow data were obtained from USGS stream gaging
    stations at Modesto for the Tuolumne River (11290000) and near Stevinson for the
    Merced River (11272500). 4.5. Salinity Management Policy Implementation Implementation
    of the salinity TMDL for the SJRB has been constrained by several factors: (a)
    The salt load allocation process in the TMDL is complex. Individual sub-areas
    defined in the TMDL have no easy way to ascertain their contribution to salt loading
    to the SJR. Assessment of penalties for non-compliance with objectives is not
    transparent and may be onerous to enforce. (b) Salt loading is a product of flow
    and TDS (often measured via EC) and salt load assimilative capacity is a concept
    that is understood by few stakeholders. There is an educational outreach activity
    needed to address this deficiency and to show the benefits of coordination of
    activities to improve compliance with salinity objectives. (c) The TMDL provided
    no guidance with respect to the formation of an organizational entity with police
    power for implementing the TMDL or the way a market for salt load trading might
    be established. (d) The TMDL was developed using existing agency and stakeholder
    publicly accessible data. No guidance was provided on the expansion of existing
    or development of new monitoring networks for additional flow and EC data needed
    to understand current patterns of salt export from sub-areas within the watershed
    and for improved salt control and management within each sub-area. In 2013 the
    CVWB presented to stakeholders an analysis to partly address criticism of the
    complexity of the TMDL development process and to provide an incentive to embrace
    a real-time management program alternative to the formal salinity TMDL accounting
    procedures. The Real Time (Salinity) Management Program (RTSMP) was introduced
    in the 2004 CVWB Basin Plan Amendment [52,53] as a stakeholder-driven effort to
    access shared real-time water quality and flow monitoring data to maximize the
    use of salt load assimilative capacity in the SJR. The CVWB defined salt load
    assimilative capacity as 85% of the product of the prevailing Vernalis salinity
    objective (30-day running average) and the current flow of the SJR minus the actual
    salt load in the River (i.e., the current SJR flow times the measured EC at Vernalis).
    This adaptive approach was suggested as a more flexible alternative to the published
    TMDL in that it was easier to understand, encouraged more stakeholder coordination
    for control of salt loading, and promoted maximum export of salt from the Basin
    while still meeting the stated salinity objective. An upstream SJR objective was
    added as a further SJRB Water Quality Control Plan Amendment in 2017 to protect
    SJR riparian diverters in the reach between Crows Landing and Vernalis (Figure
    5, Sites 5 and 2, respectively), especially during summer months of dry or critically
    dry years when river flows are low and salinity levels elevated [53]. Another
    CVWB action to incentivize consideration of the RTSMP and to provide more clarity
    to stakeholders was an analysis [54] (Brownell, 2013) that showed a potential
    fine schedule for non-compliance with sub-area TMDL load limits. This analysis
    was conducted using available SJR flow and the 30-day running average EC data
    at the Vernalis compliance monitoring station through the period of record. The
    period 2001 through 2012 was a period when there were frequent monthly violations
    of the salinity objectives at Vernalis, as shown in Figure 8. The figure shows
    the water-year classification over the time period analyzed and the number of
    times the 30-day running average monthly objective for EC was exceeded during
    each month. The Grassland sub-area experienced the greatest number of exceedances
    prior to 2012, primarily during winter and early spring months when runoff from
    west side agriculture and drainage drawdown from seasonally-managed wetlands (typically
    February through April) deliver salt loads to the SJR during periods of low SJR
    salt load assimilative capacity. Figure 8. Enumeration of monthly SJR salinity
    objective exceedances of the 700 µS/cm irrigation season and 1000 µS/cm non-irrigation
    season salinity objective at Vernalis for the period of record (column 1) through
    2012 [34]. Color ramp from blue to red indicates water year type that ranges from
    wet (blue) to critically dry (red) according to the State of California San Joaquin
    River index. The Vernalis Adaptive Management Program (VAMP) was active during
    this period and provided scheduled fishery flows in the LSJR between 15 April
    and 15 May each year [54]. In Table 1 the exceedances shown in Figure 8 are translated
    into hypothetical annual penalties using an assumed USD 5000/day fine that would
    be applied for the number of days in each the month when the 30-day running average
    EC was exceeded. The average annual penalty for a sub-area was calculated from
    the total penalties for the sub-area (total number of daily exceedances multiplied
    by the daily penalty) divided by the number of years in the analysis [54]. Table
    1. Schedule of potential annual average penalties between 2001 and 2012 that could
    have been assessed for exceedances of salinity objectives at Vernalis under the
    salinity TMDL, assuming a hypothetical penalty of USD 5000/day for each monthly
    overage [54]. Northwest side (NWS); Grassland (GL); Upstream San Joaquin River
    (SJR), East Valley Floor (EVF). The average annual penalty was also divided by
    the sub-area area (acres) to obtain an annual average penalty per acre [54]. The
    average annual sub-area penalties of USD 303,750 and USD 569,500 per year, equivalent
    to USD 1.23 and USD 3.05 per acre per year (Table 1), are powerful incentives
    for agricultural and wetland stakeholders to seek an alternative regulatory salinity
    management solution such as the option to embrace Real-time Salinity Management
    (RTSM). 4.6. Real-Time Salinity Management Program (RTSMP) Salinity management
    in the SJRB is complex, involving agricultural, wetlands, and municipal stakeholders
    within the Basin and interested environmental groups and municipal entities downstream
    in the San Francisco Bay Area. The concept behind the RTSMP is to use existing
    or anticipated salt load assimilative capacity generated by dilution flows to
    increase the export of salt load from the Basin, when available, and to improve
    the scheduling of salt load discharge into the River or temporary storage facilities
    when salt load assimilative capacity is more limited or not available [55]. This
    could be extended to scheduling additional dilution flow releases such as those
    provided by the USBR through New Melones Reservoir and the Stanislaus River. Stakeholders
    from water districts that rely on New Melones Reservoir for a portion of their
    water supply have been supportive of the RTSMP concept, since optimized control
    of salt discharged to the River from upstream sources would likely reduce the
    draw on New Melones Reservoir for water quality purposes. The CVWB prescribed
    the requisite components of a successful RTSMP as follows [52] (CVWB, 2004): (a)
    The Program maintains and (where necessary) expands existing accessible real-time
    monitoring networks that measure flow and EC necessary to assess daily SJR salt
    load assimilative capacity. The sharing of private water district drainage flow
    and EC data, as well as diversion data for those riparian districts that utilize
    the SJR for irrigation water supply, helps to expand the current environmental
    sensor network and is an important way the agricultural and wetland entities can
    show their commitment to the RTSMP. (b) The Program provides technical support
    of the RTSMP that includes the development and maintenance of a computer-based
    water quality simulation model that can be used to estimate salt load assimilative
    capacity in the SJR. The simulation model would accommodate the inclusion of real-time
    drainage and SJR diversion data from cooperating stakeholders. The model would
    make 14-day forecasts of SJR flow, EC, and salt load assimilative capacity based
    on advance schedules of east side tributary reservoir releases and other planned
    operations such as district diversion pumping schedules. Where these advance schedules
    are not available, archived data that match time of year and water-year type can
    be used by the model to make provisional forecasts. (c) An accessible data repository
    is a necessary feature of the Program that archives sensor network data and a
    data screening capability to provide a minimum level of data quality assurance
    and control. Several of the larger water districts and water agencies use hydrological
    data management software such as WISKI and HYDSTRA, (https://www.kisters.net)
    and AQUARIUS (https://aquaticinformatics.com/products to perform real-time quality
    assurance on data downloaded from their sensor networks. (d) The Program will
    benefit and require the construction of physical infrastructure, such as temporary
    holding ponds, drainage control structures, and drainage reuse and recirculation
    systems at the water district or sub-basin watershed level to provide rapid response
    to periods of potential non-compliance with salinity objectives. 4.7. Real-Time
    Salinity Monitoring and Estimation of Salt Load Assimilative Capacity Over the
    past decade there have been significant technology improvements in the accuracy
    and reliability of flow and water quality sensors and sondes and in Web-based
    data accessibility. Rotary wipers now allow the efficient maintenance of sensor
    electrodes, permitting sondes to be deployed longer between service quality assurance
    checks [56]. Calibration procedures are now built into the software of these instruments,
    reducing the time needed to perform these checks. Data telemetry hardware and
    programming software procedures have also become more plug-and-play and, at the
    same time, cellular data service plans have become much more affordable. Most
    of the current data logger/modem devices on the market also allow two-way communication,
    overcoming a long-standing limitation of the GOES satellite radio communication
    system that has been popular with water agencies because of its low cost. Real-time
    data access has also undergone significant improvement with vendor-supported Web
    portals now available at low cost to store and allow flexible visualization of
    real-time and archived data. More recent data logger innovations now allow some
    basic arithmetic operations to be conducted on the collected data, such as calculation
    and display of salt loads after combining flow and EC data. Several vendors are
    also exploring adding basic data quality assurance functionality to their data
    loggers by allowing access to basic Python scripting functions. 4.8. Real-Time
    Salinity Modeling and Forecasting Model-based forecasting of salt load assimilative
    capacity requires ready access to current flow and EC data within the SJRB and
    an underlying hydrology and water quality simulation model to relate these data
    to flow and salinity at the two SJR compliance monitoring stations. The model
    should be watershed-based if on-farm and water-district-led management strategies
    for control of salt export are to be assessed. The Watershed Management Risk Management
    Framework (WARMF) model [57,58,59] is a comprehensive decision support tool that
    was designed specifically to facilitate TMDL development at the watershed-level
    and that has been applied to facilitate RTSM in the SJRB. The model performs mass
    balances for a large suite of potential SJR contaminants including total dissolved
    solids (measured as EC), suspended solids, phosphates, and nitrates and simulates
    SJR tributary inflows from the major east side rivers, riparian, and appropriative
    diversions. The model also estimates agricultural and wetland drainage return
    flows and calculates likely accretions from shallow groundwater along the SJR
    (Figure 9). The WARMF model uses hydrologic routing to calculate flow and water
    quality at approximately one-mile intervals along the main stem of the SJR. For
    the purposes of the RTSMP only the flow and salinity outputs of the model are
    critical. Figure 9. The Watershed Analysis Risk Management Framework-San Joaquin
    River (WARMF-SJR) model user interface showing the disaggregation of minor watersheds
    within each major sub-area that contribute flow and salt load to the SJR. The
    political boundaries of individual agricultural water districts are the most appropriate
    management entities for monitoring, management, and control of salt loading to
    the SJR from each west side sub-area. Wetland drainage from the Grassland Ecological
    Area (a 140,000-acre tract in the Grassland sub-area) is similarly partitioned
    into individual watersheds representing the state, federal, and private wetland
    sub-areas contributing to SJR salt load [56,58]. The GIS-based WARMF model graphical
    user interface (GUI) allows easy visualization of WARMF model flow and salinity
    input data. Spreadsheet-like data templates are accessible to store data downloaded
    daily from state and federal agency hydrology and water quality databases to provide
    automated updating of model input files and to keep the WARMF model current. Customized
    output graphical displays such as the Gowdy Output (Figure 10) provide the user
    with a powerful tool to interpret WARMF-SJR model simulation results and to toggle
    between daily flow, EC, and salt load for the 60-mile SJR reach between Lander
    Avenue and Vernalis. On the left panel, inflow to the SJR is depicted as green
    horizontal bars superimposed over the inflow source label, whereas diversions
    from the SJR are depicted as red horizontal bars to the left of the vertical axis.
    The uppermost panel on the right displays SJR travel time with a starting value
    of 1.8 days that declines to zero days at the Vernalis compliance monitoring station
    for EC. SJR flow is displayed in the same panel increasing from left to right,
    incrementing in steps at the points of confluence with the three east side tributaries.
    The lower right-hand panel shows cumulative SJR flow relative to cumulative SJR
    diversions at the intakes to West Stanislaus, Patterson, and El Solyo irrigation
    districts. The Gowdy Output (Figure 10) also provides the user with a detailed
    snapshot of past and current flow and water quality conditions in the SJRB [38]
    by using the daily date dialog box located on the upper left of the figure. Figure
    10. Customized WARMF model Gowdy output showing (left panel) daily SJR inflows
    and diversions every mile (1.6 km) for the mainstem of the SJR [58]. Output is
    for a single day and date that can be incremented or decremented in the upper
    left dialog box. Upper right panel shows both travel time from Lander Avenue and
    cumulative flow increases from Lander Avenue to Vernalis. The lower right panel
    shows cumulative flow and cumulative diversions. Other panels (not shown) show
    EC and cumulative salt load along the same reach of the River. 4.9. Web-Based
    WARMF Model Data and Model Forecast Visualization for Sustainable Real-Time Salinity
    Management The concept of RTSM is most readily facilitated when all stakeholders
    have an easy way to access and process real-time data and make short-term reliable
    forecasts that inform management decisions and operations [59]. The RTSMP began
    development of a comprehensive resource in 2014—the San Joaquin River Real Time
    Management (SJRRTM) Online Web portal that provides real-time access to a comprehensive
    array of watershed flow and EC data (Figure 11), WARMF model data input, and 14-day
    forecasts of SJR salt load assimilative capacity. The SJRRTM Web portal was designed
    to enhance stakeholder awareness of the current status of water and water quality
    conditions in the SJR and to support collaborative actions to enhance salinity
    management decision-making. The Web portal also provides stakeholders access to
    information resources (reports, GIS, data sets) and other reporting dashboards
    for viewing WARMF model output. A goal of the SJRRTM Web portal was to provide
    water district managers and those responsible for coordinating sub-area salt loading
    with the tools for anticipating salt loading schedules so that they could be matched
    with scheduled or forecast reservoir releases of dilution flows from the east
    side tributaries [59]. Figure 11. Display of the SJR Real-Time Management Online
    Web portal built using the 34-North OpenNRM visualization software toolbox. The
    Web portal provides dashboard access to available SJR-related data as well as
    WARMF model input and salt load assimilative capacity forecast output. It is a
    “one stop shop” for all data related to the SJR. The Web portal was implemented
    using the open-source OpenNRM software, a suite of software tools developed by
    34 North Inc. [59]. The OpenNRM software tools allow users to create, modify,
    and manage data and Web content systematically and also provide content filtering
    capability to organize information based on subregion boundaries, specific areas
    of interest, and personalized data dashboard selections. One of the unique features
    of the SJRTM Web portal has been the integration of real-time SJR and tributary
    flow and EC data with WARMF model-generated flow, salinity, and salt load assimilative
    capacity forecasts—these are rarely supplied on a common platform. The assembled
    data sets were reformatted and aligned by the OpenNRM client software for direct
    import into the WARMF model for forecasting purposes and to the customizable data
    reporting dashboards. The OpenNRM software was also configured to supply relevant
    baseline data for those only interested in running the WARMF model and making
    model-based forecasts—accessed through a separate Web portal tab. One stakeholder
    client was sufficiently enamored by the customizable data dashboard capability
    to engage the OpenNRM developer to create a custom application to support her
    individual water-quality-related oversight responsibilities, which hitherto had
    required tedious visitation of multiple agency websites and those of other data
    providers. Despite the unique capabilities of the SJRRTM Online Web portal to
    help visualize and operationalize current SJRB data in combination with the WARMF
    model for salinity compliance assessment and decision support, the tool has not
    enjoyed the level of support anticipated among SJRB stakeholders. Reasons may
    include (a) The Web portal is comprehensive and allows easy access to all current,
    publicly accessible real-time flow and EC data, however, stakeholder feedback
    suggests that the Web portal is hard to navigate and there are often too many
    steps involved in accessing specific data. Although one stakeholder invested time
    and effort in building a custom dashboard with URL links to data she used routinely
    others appeared less willing to commit the time. This can be ascribed to the fact
    that their data access needs were less prescribed and more random—the productivity
    gains they anticipated from use of the tool were lower than expected by the development
    team. (b) There are no current financial incentives with respect to salinity non-compliance
    that might encourage stakeholders to take advantage of the resources offered by
    the SJRRTM Online Web portal. During periods of non-compliance the imposition
    of fees associated with salt loads in excess of sub-area monthly salt load targets
    would likely incentivize the quantification of salt loads and salt load assimilative
    capacity and comparisons between monthly sub-area salt load targets and sub-area
    performance with the SJRB. 4.10. Alternative Modeling Approaches for Sustainable
    Real-Time Salinity Management The WARMF model has provided a scientifically defensible
    framework for analysis of SJR flow and salinity data primarily from west side
    agricultural drainage and for developing watershed-based forecasts of short-term
    salt load assimilative capacity for sustainable SJR salinity management. Sustainable
    SJR salinity management is equated to compliance with current SJR salinity objectives
    at the Vernalis, Crows Landing, and, most recently, Maze Road compliance monitoring
    sites. Salt load assimilative capacity forecasts require the provision of both
    current (real-time) flow and salinity data as well as information on anticipated
    actions impacting SJR flow and salinity over the chosen, two-week forecast period.
    The accuracy of these forecasts is typically a function of the level of stakeholder
    involvement and the sharing of information. The WARMF watershed-based forecasting
    model approach allows SJRB stakeholder entities responsible for regulatory compliance
    to recognize individual sub-area salt load discharges over and above allowable
    load limits during periods of insufficient SJR salt load assimilative capacity.
    The WARMF model armed with these salt load assimilative capacity forecasts can
    be run to assess the most cost-effective and politically expedient actions for
    resolving these periods of potential overage before they occur. In general, the
    30-day running average EC objective at the Vernalis compliance monitoring site
    is most likely to be exceeded during the months of late March, April, and May
    when seasonally managed wetlands discharge to the SJR and upstream reservoirs
    are actively filling, providing diminished dilution flow. While supporting WARMF
    model routine forecast activity, the USBR recognized the need for a more easily
    automated screening-level decision support tool for the majority of time periods
    when no remedial action may be necessary. It was recognized that with climate
    change and the propensity for extreme events and more severe drought events the
    incidence of stress on SJR salt assimilative capacity may increase over time.
    This novel hybrid approach to salinity forecasting in the SJR undertaken by the
    USBR was based on a data-driven regression model that relates flow to EC using
    an inverse gradient algorithm (Figure 12). This screening-level approach for estimating
    EC has been applied to the Vernalis, Crows Landing, and Maze Road compliance monitoring
    stations on the SJR [60]. Figure 12. Comparison of regression-based (left panels
    in blue) and WARMF-based (right panels in green) real-time salinity forecasting
    models. Inset (middle) shows the smartphone RTSM screening model interface that
    allows stakeholders to readily view both regression model and WARMF model forecasts
    [58]. The basis for the inverse gradient regression model was the observation
    that: (a) EC decreased when stream flow increased, and vice versa; and (b) the
    EC’s rate of change was proportional to the River’s change in flow rate. The inverse
    gradient regression model has yielded good forecast accuracy for EC and salt load,
    especially when paired with independent 10-day SJR flow forecasts made daily by
    the NOAA River Forecast Center [60]. One distinct advantage of this data-driven
    regression model approach has been the time savings compared to the setup and
    execution of the WARMF model forecast simulations and the time associated with
    WARMF model data updating and model maintenance. Preliminary results, based on
    flow and EC data for the years 2004 to 2019, indicated that the regression model
    performed as well as the WARMF model for forecasting EC at the Vernalis and Crows
    Landing compliance monitoring stations (Figure 11). This screening-level approach
    can be used to alert stakeholders to conditions where EC forecasts approach the
    EC compliance objectives at either site, which might warrant intervention to actively
    manage salt loading to the River. In such situations the WARMF basin-scale model
    aids stakeholders by providing estimates of load contributions from each of the
    seven sub-areas contributing salt load to the SJR. Awareness of current salt loading
    from each of these sub-areas and comparison of these loads to those allowable
    under the salinity TMDL for each sub-area allows more targeted interventions.
    4.11. Case Study of the Hunter River Salinity Trading Scheme The goal of simplifying
    and making more intuitive the forecasting model interface to end users has an
    inspiring exemplar in the Hunter River Salinity Trading Scheme (HRSTS) in New
    South Wales, Australia (Figure 13). This is a stakeholder-led licensing scheme
    to manage discharges of salt load in the Hunter River Basin primarily from mines
    and power stations that discharge into the River, and it was compared to an earlier
    iteration of the RTSM program in a study [59,61] that examined the policy goals
    and directives and implementation success of the two systems. Like the RTSM program,
    the HRSTS relies on a comprehensive network of real-time monitoring stations that
    keep track of daily discharge and salt loading to the Hunter River and ambient
    river conditions. Although hydrological and water quality models of the Basin
    exist, the main “workhorse” of the HRSTS is a simple accounting spreadsheet called
    the River Register that was operated by the Department of Natural Resources and
    funded by stakeholders who kept daily track of these flows and salt loads. The
    simple website provides ready access to the credit register and other information
    on the HRSTS as well as current salt load account balances for registered scheme
    members. A simple freight train and boxcar analog is used to explain the scheme,
    asking stakeholders to visualize a series of boxcars, each containing salt, that
    can be filled to a daily limit established by the assimilative capacity of the
    train (River) during each 24-h period [61]. Each stakeholder can trade a portion
    of his/her allocation for the right to load salt onto the boxcar. Following the
    boxcar analog, the Hunter River was notionally divided into “blocks” where each
    block represents a portion of the River (boxcar) predicted to pass a designated
    gaging station (Singleton) on the Hunter River within a 24-h period (Figure 13).
    Figure 13. Hunter River Basin in New South Wales, Australia, which adopted a more
    stakeholder-centric policy for control of a salt management system that relies
    on real-time sensor networks and greater local coordination and cooperation [61,62].
    Salt management policy provides a very simple method for managing discharge into
    the River by classifying each block with respect to the reach (sector) of the
    River it passes through, using the following designations: low flow—discharges
    not allowed, high flow—discharges allowed using tradeable salt load credits, flood
    flows—no limit to salt load unless restricted under a policy provision. During
    high flow events, stakeholders can discharge a salt load expressed as a share
    of the total allowable daily discharge for each block according to the number
    of salt credits, out of the 1000 available each day, that they own. Hence, each
    credit entitles a stakeholder to a salt load discharge equivalent to 1/1000 of
    each high flow day’s total allowable discharges. Credits are tradable on the HRSTS
    River Register to ensure salt loads are managed in an efficient and cost-effective
    manner and that river water quality goals are met sustainably according to national
    and state salinity management policy [61]. Although the Hunter River Basin example
    is much smaller in scale and involves only two major stakeholder groups—miners
    and power plant operators—as opposed to the more diverse stakeholder population
    of irrigated agriculture, urban/municipal and environmental interests at play
    in the SJRB, the contrast in implementation effectiveness and potential sustainability
    is instructive. In the SJRB river assimilative capacity is estimated daily using
    a similar real-time sensor network, although there was no provision to pull together
    the disparate elements of this network until the SJRRTM Web portal was developed.
    The highly disaggregated and ambitious goals of the Web portal have made it difficult
    to support financially and maintain. In the HRSTS the salt load assimilative capacity
    of the River is strictly tied to river flow and the allocation of load clearly
    defined according to the low/high/flood flow designations and the market-based
    trading system. In the SJRB water flow and quality from all sources are combined
    daily to assess salt load assimilative capacity, and there is no current mechanism
    for managing load over and above the CVWB TMDL and real-time allocations. Calculation
    of these daily allocations, as was demonstrated earlier, is complicated and, even
    with powerful visualization tools, is not provided in a decision support context
    that allows successful implementation and the potential for sustainability as
    described in the HRSTS. There is also a sociological aspect of cooperation and
    collaboration, which is, in part, tied to the size of the stakeholder group [61].
    The evidence of greater trust and degree of cooperation between landowners, resource
    management advisers, and regulators in the Hunter River Basin allows stakeholders
    to achieve their salt management goals with a simple and robust accounting system.
    5. Discussion This paper focused on irrigation sustainability of agriculture on
    the west side of the SJV and the SJRB—the west side of the SJRB is that subregion
    within the SJV that drains to the SJR and, hence, to the Sacramento–San Joaquin
    Delta and San Francisco Bay. The SJRB is an exemplar of the conflicts that occur
    around the world between agricultural, urban/municipal, and environmental users
    of scarce water supply and, hence, is well suited for an exploration of evolving
    policy interventions and how these options have led to the desired level of environmental
    protection. This paper started out by noting that there are two component resource
    constraints to agricultural irrigation sustainability—these are the provision
    of an adequate water supply and the provision of a water supply of sufficient
    quality, typically measured in terms of salinity, to achieve sustainable crop
    yields. This paper then discussed each of these constraints in turn, showing and
    discussing how policy has addressed the unregulated extraction of groundwater
    in the 30 years since the first adoption of the groundwater turbine pump in the
    1920s. The paper described how this technology innovation led to a massive replumbing
    of the water supply delivery system in the SJV and SJRB, which in turn introduced
    a new set of environmental problems. Those are now associated with water quality—primarily
    salinity in the case of agricultural beneficial use of this water supply. In the
    paper we also described a reemergence of many of the problems that were largely
    solved by investments in the water supply infrastructure provided by the federal
    CVP San Luis Unit until a sequence of crippling droughts in California triggered
    a surge in (still unregulated) groundwater development. This market-driven response
    to the drought brought back some of the same regional subsidence problems and
    damage to critical water supply infrastructure. However, this time the rates of
    land surface deformation and subsequent damage were more localized and more costly
    to contain. Research by the U.S. Geological Survey and others has shown that the
    majority of this subsidence [7] occurred in the interbeds below the Corcoran Clay
    and not in the clay itself, as in the previous case in the 1930s. Another wave
    of policy interventions, this time accompanied by legislation in the form of the
    SGMA and without the promise of a replacement water supply, charged stakeholders
    with the responsibility for both improving their understanding of the limits of
    their groundwater resource and developing their own constraint mechanisms to limit
    future groundwater extraction for long-term sustainability. Since agriculture
    dominates land use and groundwater supply utilization in the SJRB, the decisions
    made within the GSAs formed under SGMA will have profound impacts on the future
    of irrigated agriculture in the Basin. These decisions are also likely to impact
    the second rail of sustainable irrigation agriculture in the Basin—that of water
    quality. Surface and groundwater are now recognized as a single resource not only
    in state environmental and resource management policy but also in the models that
    are continuously under development in the state and federal water resource agencies,
    the USBR and the California DWR. The paper, while applauding this new “one-water”
    mantra by water resource agencies, laments the fact that we are still some way
    from having a universally accepted tool for surface and groundwater resource planning
    in the state [19], although a recognition of the limitations of these tools is
    a necessary first step in overcoming them. Although water quality impacts are
    certainly likely with SGMA it is also clear that these modeling tools—CVHM and
    C2VSIM—are not currently capable of providing long-term decision support for water
    quality and guiding decisions for irrigated agriculture sustainability. The second
    part of the paper provided an overview of water quality (primarily salinity) constraints
    to irrigated agriculture and of the limitations of our knowledge and ability to
    perform salt management at the farm and regional scales. The paper advances the
    thesis that it was the selenium crisis at Kesterson Reservoir and its aftermath
    that permanently changed the relationships between irrigated agricultural, municipal/urban,
    and environmental resource advocates, which has been the genesis of much environmental
    regulation aimed at drainage return flow impacts on the environment. The policy
    response in this case was to embark on a massive research and information gathering
    mission led, primarily, by researchers within the University of California system
    and funded by federal and state water resource agencies. The most significant
    of this multi-agency effort was the federal SJVDP, which pulled in researchers
    from state and federal water agencies as well as those concerned with fish and
    wildlife resources and completed its policy and planning roadmap in September
    1990 [26]. Although the accomplishments of this joint effort under the UC Salinity
    Drainage Program were significant, implementation of the recommendations of the
    SJVDP plan did not follow. California irrigated agriculture entered a holding
    pattern through the subsequent jointly funded San Joaquin Valley Drainage Implementation
    Program (1991–1999) and the federal San Luis Drainage Feature Reevaluation (2007)
    [63]. It was not until CVWB approval of the initial salinity and boron TMDL in
    2002 that any real progress was made at setting targets and constraints of drainage
    salt loading. The political response by irrigated agriculture advocates to the
    TMDL was largely muted by the years of defensible research that occurred under
    the SJVDP and consequent programs that were mostly focused on selenium drainage.
    The response was also influenced by the early successes of the Grassland Bypass
    Project (GBP) (1996–2019) [64,65] which showed that agricultural water districts
    located in the 100,000 acre sub-area most affected by selenium drainage were capable
    of real-time management of selenium drainage through adaptive irrigation and drainage
    management [66,67]. These Grassland sub-area drainage entities were able to meet
    every monthly and annual selenium load target set by the Use Agreement for interim
    use of the San Luis Drain for drainage conveyance, except during the first two
    years of the project in 1996 and 1997 when back-to-back El Niño storm events caused
    widespread flooding and inundation. A more detailed description of the Grassland
    Bypass Project and the San Joaquin River Improvement Project (SJRIP) reuse area
    and facility, used to dispose of selenium and salt loads that would otherwise
    have discharged into the SJR, is provided in an unpublished companion paper in
    this same Special Issue of Sustainability [68]. Adoption of RTSM as a whole-basin
    alternative to a more restrictive and resource-inefficient salinity TMDL achieved
    some early success in the SJRB. However, long-term implementation of the concept
    will require a high level of cooperation and coordination, which hitherto has
    not existed in the Basin, unlike the Hunter River Basin in New South Wales, Australia,
    where real-time salinity management was achieved with a much simpler, less cybertechnology-
    and monitoring-intensive approach [59]. This was ascribed to higher levels of
    interaction and corporation between regulators, government extension specialists,
    and landowners, and a simple conceptual model of salt load management and Hunter
    River assimilative capacity using a boxcar analogy that all involved were able
    to understand. Realization of the full potential of RTSM will require the formation
    of a basin-scale, stakeholder-led salinity management entity with the authority
    and police power to enforce compliance with river water quality objectives and
    to impose penalties on stakeholder coalitions representing stakeholders within
    each sub-area. In the SJRB two major agricultural coalitions exist representing
    stakeholders on the east and west sides of the SJR. These existing coalitions
    could play a more active role, not only in the funding and maintenance of flow
    and EC sensor networks and implementation of a data quality assurance program,
    but also in coordinating salt load management actions within each sub-area and
    between sub-areas. The CVWB envisaged a marketplace for salt load discharge to
    the SJR, similar to the carbon offsets that can be purchased by CO2 emitters who
    need to reduce their carbon footprint. This would help reduce reliance on New
    Melones Reservoir for the release of flows for salinity dilution purposes [59],
    allowing more efficient allocation of water resources to junior water-right stakeholders
    who typically receive less than their contract water supply from the USBR. An
    entity known as the SJV Drainage Authority currently exists and is financed by
    west side SJRB stakeholder contributions and retains a staff to oversee the activities
    of west side agricultural, wetland, and municipal dischargers of salt and other
    contaminants into the SJR. This Drainage Authority’s role might be expanded to
    include east side SJRB districts to fulfill the coordination and compliance enforcement
    activities identified above. Long-term implementation of RTSM will ultimately
    require coordination of both drainage return flows and reservoir releases from
    east side tributaries, synthesis of real-time data, computer-based modeling of
    real-time salt load assimilative capacity, and effective dissemination of daily
    salt load assimilative capacity forecasts for the SJR [59]. 6. Summary and Conclusions
    Salinity problems on the west side of the SJV and, in particular, in the SJRB
    were exacerbated in the 1960s with the development of the federal San Luis Unit
    of the CVP that substituted west side diversions from the SJR for pumped water
    from the Sacramento–San Joaquin Delta. This alleviated, for a period, some of
    the groundwater mining and land subsidence issues that had beset the west side
    since the advent of the deep-well turbine pump in the 1920s, only to have these
    same problems reemerge at the turn of the century for many of the same reasons—a
    lack of commitment to sustainable resource planning and a myopic and self-serving
    refusal to recognize the connectivity between surface and subsurface water resources.
    In the 1980s, after the tragedy of the selenium poisoning of waterfowl embryos
    at Kesterson Reservoir awakened the public to the linkage between agricultural
    return flows and environmental health, the University of California mobilized
    and engaged in a tsunami of applied research studies that resulted in a greater
    understanding of agricultural hydrology and of how to control and mitigate water
    quality impacts that was enshrined in a broad array of mathematical models, at
    both the field and regional scales, offering potential for decision support. However,
    these models alone, without the will of the California electorate to make hard
    policy choices aimed at environmental justice and sustainability, have proved
    to be ineffectual until relatively recently. As was pointed out in this paper,
    even a century after Hilgard’s pioneering insights [4] and warnings on the topic
    of sustainable irrigation and salinity, the two primary agency-sponsored surface
    and groundwater simulation models have no capability to simulate salinity or offer
    decision support for salt management decision-making. There has, however, been
    an awakening in recent years of policy makers in the domains of both groundwater
    and surface water quality resource sustainability. The RTSM program and SGMA have
    made up for decades of stakeholder and agency inertia and have shown great promise,
    to date, in fostering resource management innovation. Since 2014 SGMA planning
    activities have ushered in the first statutory requirement for measurement and
    public dissemination of groundwater pumping data and a commitment from stakeholders
    in self-organized “groundwater sustainability areas” to develop long-term plans
    to eliminate overdraft and subsidence problems while protecting local aquifers
    and groundwater quality in groundwater sustainability plans. Technical advances
    in data acquisition and information dissemination technologies have made possible
    the implementation of an RTSM program in California’s SJRB. RTSM relies on continuously
    recording sensors that form the backbone of a monitoring network and simulation
    models that are used to forecast flow and water quality conditions in the receiving
    waterbody [59] and the tributary watersheds that contribute flow and salt load
    to the River. Effective implementation of RTSM has an educational and extension
    requirement, which has yet to be fully realized, as was demonstrated in the SJRRTM
    Web portal, which, unfortunately, proved too complex and too demanding of stakeholder
    time to be fully utilized. However, by fusing real-time data reporting and dissemination
    and model-based salt load assimilative capacity forecasting, stakeholders are
    beginning to comprehend the connections between SJR drainage salt loading data,
    SJR riparian diversions, and reservoir release schedules. The two-tiered approach
    that initially uses a screening tool to identify a potential salinity compliance
    problem [60], followed by application of the more comprehensive WARMF watershed-based
    simulation and forecasting model to explore salt management options, should be
    part of a robust, long-term, and resource-efficient decision support system for
    SJRB water quality and agriculture sustainability. Although this paper took a
    deep dive into irrigation sustainability issues impacting the SJR and SJRB in
    California, the issues being tackled in California are manifest in arid zones
    around the world. The State of California, with its abundant resources as one
    of the world’s largest economies, has been able to mobilize considerable research
    manpower that is focused on these issues of irrigation sustainability. I hope
    that some of the experience and lessons learned as described in this paper will
    help guide agriculture in other regions to make appropriate, cost-effective policy
    decisions moving forward. Funding This research received no external funding.

  description: Several research institutes, laboratories, academic programs, and service
    companies around the United States have been developing programs to utilize small
    unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) as an instrument to improve the efficiency of in-field
    water and agronomical management. This article describes a decade of efforts on
    research and development efforts focused on UAS technologies and methodologies
    developed for irrigation management, including the evolution of aircraft and sensors
    in contrast to data from satellites. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations
    for UAS operation in agriculture have been synthesized along with proposed modifications
    to enhance UAS contributions to irrigated agriculture. Although it is feasible
    to use sUAS technology to produce maps of actual crop coefficients, actual crop
    evapotranspiration, and soil water deficits, for irrigation management, the technology
    and regulations need to evolve further to facilitate a successful wide adoption
    and application. Improvements and standards are needed in terms of cameras’ spectral
    (bands) ranges, radiometric resolutions and associated calibrations, fuel/power
    technology for longer missions, better imagery processing software, and easier
    FAA approval of higher altitudes flight missions among other issues. Furthermore,
    the sUAS technology would play a larger role in irrigated agriculture when integrating
    multi-scale data (sUAS, ground-based or proximal, satellite) and soil water sensors
    is addressed, including the need for advances on processing large amounts of data
    from multiple and different sources, and integration into scientific irrigation
    scheduling (SIS) systems for convenience of decision making. Desirable technological
    innovations, and features of the next generation of UAS platforms, sensors, software,
    and methods for irrigated agriculture, are discussed.

  description: Over the past six years, our national team has developed, tested and
    commercialized wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and advanced software which allows
    for automated decision irrigation, based on grower-defined irrigation strategies.
    WSNs have been implemented in ten commercial greenhouses and nurseries across
    the Unites States, where irrigation events are automatically controlled based
    on soil/substrate moisture measurements, or by modeled crop water use. Sensor
    networks provide growers with real-Time soil moisture and environmental data from
    their own production systems, accessible from their cell phones over the internet.
    We have learned that growers make much better irrigation management decisions
    once they have access to their own data, i.e., information they trust and can
    control. Our research with commercial operations has enabled us to document the
    numerous economic and environmental benefits of sensor networks (http://smart-farms.org/impacts).
    We have consistently seen large (40-70%) reductions in irrigation water use in
    field (soil) as well as container (soilless) production systems. For most growers,
    the cost of water is low compared to other variable costs, such as labor. However,
    reduced water irrigation time (duration) typically translates into more operational
    flexibility, including being able to irrigate additional production areas. We
    have demonstrated that most sensor networks have a typical return on investment
    of less than six months. We have shown that incremental economic benefits accrue
    from increased crop yield and quality, reduced production times, demonstrated
    reductions in fertilizer use and nutrient leaching, reductions in root disease
    and the effective use of deficit irrigation for non-chemical growth regulation.

  description: Globally, the irrigation of crops is the largest consumptive user of
    fresh water. Water scarcity is increasing worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation
    of its use for agriculture. This necessitates the development of irrigation practices
    that are more efficient in the use of water but do not compromise crop quality
    and yield. Precision irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal
    of precision irrigation is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely
    manner and as spatially uniformly as possible. However, to maximize the benefits
    of precision irrigation, additional technologies need to be enabled and incorporated
    into agriculture. This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive decision support
    systems into precision irrigation management will enable significant advances
    in increasing the efficiency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature
    review, it is found that precision irrigation can be applied in achieving the
    environmental goals related to sustainability. The demonstrated economic benefits
    of precision irrigation in field-scale crop production is however minimal. It
    is argued that a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing
    real-time data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform
    for improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows that
    adaptive decision support systems based on model predictive control are able to
    adequately account for the time-varying nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system
    while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives in arriving
    at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that significant improvements
    in crop yield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive
    control into precision irrigation decision support tools. Further improvements
    in water savings can also be realized by including deficit irrigation as part
    of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future research is
    needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deficits, developing improved
    soil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop simulation
    frameworks that can be applied to evaluate adaptive decision support strategies
    related to irrigation.

    Introduction Globally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation of crops, making
    irrigation the largest consumptive user of fresh water [1]. Over 80% of freshwater
    withdrawals in developing countries is applied in irrigation [2]. Irrigated agriculture
    provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20% of the cultivated area highlighting
    the importance of irrigation in global food security [3]. Irrigated crop production
    globally extends over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual increase
    of 1.3% [2]. Global climate change may further increase irrigation water demand
    due to a greater variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested
    that irrigation will provide 46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025,
    which was computed as 28% in 1995, resulting in a decline of rain-fed agriculture.
    Food production in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast and East
    Asia, is at present heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in
    Asia is 230 million ha, which represents over 70% of the global irrigated area.
    Of the 230 million ha of irrigated land area, 60% is located in China and India
    [3]. It is estimated that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent on
    irrigation [2]. Sarma [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water
    to produce one unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This
    implies that an improvement in water use efficiency in the developing world would
    conserve at least half of the water presently applied in irrigation. It is estimated
    that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground water
    sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources in
    a number of communities has further increased the pressure on groundwater resources.
    This has resulted in the over-abstraction of global groundwater sources which
    is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per annum [2]. A global shortage in freshwater
    sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve water management and increase
    water use efficiency. This has necessitated greater regulatory demands for environmental
    protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported that only half of the total freshwater
    volume abstracted for irrigation globally reaches the targeted crops [2]. These
    have brought about the need to devise procedures to use the limited water more
    efficiently while maximizing crop yield and quality. Conventional irrigation practice
    involves applying water uniformly over every part of the field without taking
    into account the spatial variability in soil and crop water needs; this consequently
    leads to overirrigation in some parts of the field while other parts of the field
    are underirrigated [8]. The risks associated with overirrigation include surface
    runoff, deep percolation and leaching of nitrates and nutrients. Those associated
    with underirrigation are more subjective and include reduction in crop yields
    and quality, as well as inefficient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs
    for crop production [9]. The irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’
    in order to optimize the water input and crop response, while minimizing adverse
    environmental impacts. Precision irrigation is an evolving field with active interest
    by both industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by some researchers
    as the use of efficient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it
    as the variable application of irrigation based on predefined maps or sensor feedback
    [10]. Smith et al. [11] suggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate determination,
    quantification of crop water needs and the precise application of the optimal
    water volume at the required time. This implies that varying water application
    spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of ‘precision’ in the
    irrigation process. Hence, precision irrigation can be defined as the process
    of accounting for the field-scale spatial variability in crop water need and applying
    the right amount of water to match the spatial crop water need at the right time
    [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation include increased crop
    yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efficiency/savings, reduction
    of energy costs and reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12]. Pierce [13]
    viewed precision irrigation as a tool for improving sustainability in irrigated
    agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use efficiency and improved
    environmental quality of irrigated fields. The balance of several core aspects
    is however important for the successful implementation of a robust precision irrigation
    system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves efforts on real-time
    monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation and control of the
    irrigation application equipment. Research has been mainly focused on the sensing
    and control aspects of precision irrigation with much advancements in the last
    decade [12]. Research is limited, however, in the development of appropriate irrigation
    scheduling tools for the precision irrigation process [14]. Irrigation scheduling
    is the process by which a producer determines when to apply irrigation and the
    amount of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that
    the irrigation scheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision
    support system for irrigation management. A robust decision support system is
    important in the successful implementation of precision irrigation. The need for
    a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions of when, where
    and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in climatic inputs,
    the time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment and operational
    limitations cannot be overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17] noted that the development
    of an optimal decision support tool for precision irrigation will involve the
    combination of appropriate modeling and management tools. The decision support
    tools available for precision irrigation management are presently inflexible and
    difficult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios [18]. In recent years, there
    has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),
    and our intention is not to repeat the areas they addressed. Rather, our aim is
    to provide an in-depth technical analysis of the considerations necessary for
    the development of a practical and robust decision support system for precision
    irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated agriculture. To that end,
    the review will focus on the following critical aspects of precision irrigation:
    (1) monitoring considerations; (2) present limitations and state of the art in
    decision support; and (3) opportunities for improving sustainability. We will
    however include brief sections on the concept of spatial variability and the control
    of water application in precision irrigation. 2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term
    Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture The underlying argument for precision irrigation
    is the presence of within-field spatial variability that influences crop water
    demand. The spatial variability in crop water demand may have a direct influence
    on the crop yield, quality and the environmental quality of irrigated fields [19].
    The soil water presents the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake
    and therefore its spatial variability will have a direct influence on crop water
    demand. Soil and landscape characteristics like soil texture, topography, abiotic
    and management factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary
    spatially across a field [11]. These have a direct influence on the water-holding
    capacity of the soil. Hedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation
    in the soil water retention characteristics was strongly correlated with the spatial
    variation in soil texture across a field, noting that areas with heavier soils
    within a field had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with
    light textured soils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping
    soil properties, specifically electrical conductivity mapping, can reveal within-field
    variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation management. These have
    been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8]. Readers
    are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity
    mapping. The variability in yield across a field has also been found to be strongly
    correlated with the spatial variability in water available for crop use. The spatial
    variability in crop yield is a function of the interplay between water stress,
    nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24]. The yield
    map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map. These similarities
    can be explained through the spatial variability of soil properties that exists
    across a field. The water-holding capacity of the soil is a major factor affecting
    yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong correlation to soil EC [25].
    Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability in soil water retention characteristics
    played a dominant role in explaining the spatial yield variability observed in
    soybean. Martinez-Casasnovas et al. [27] suggested yield mapping as an important
    tool in variable rate irrigation management. A robust precision irrigation system
    will be able to meet the spatially varying crop water demand across a field at
    the right time. This requires accurate knowledge of the within-field variability.
    This is addressed by applying the concept of irrigation management zones/units
    in precision irrigation. The irrigation management zones are a group of homogeneous
    units with similar soil water retention characteristics [21]. It is however important
    that these management zones are large enough to be managed individually while
    remaining relatively homogeneous in order to reflect the spatial soil variation
    across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based on real-time
    sensor data has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying infrared
    thermometry/thermography to assess the spatial variation in crop canopy temperature
    across a field [28]. The crop canopy temperature of a healthy transpiring crop
    will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop transpiration is reduced
    as a result of water deficits, the crop canopy temperature is expected to increase.
    The characterization of crop water status as a function of the canopy and ambient
    temperature is the basis for using infrared thermometry/thermography as a mapping
    tool for precision irrigation [29]. Shaughnessy et al. [30] and Evett et al. [31]
    have successfully applied this procedure in generating dynamic maps to guide variable
    rate water application for field crops grown under a center pivot system. It should,
    however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements are usually taken over
    a short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected to experience the highest
    evaporative demand. Hence, this method is well suited for crop production systems
    in which the soil moisture dynamics has relatively long time constants. 3. Spatial
    Scales of Irrigation Management Centre pivot, lateral move and low energy precision
    application (LEPA) moving machines can be modified to apply spatially variable
    irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly suited to variable rate water
    application because of their current level of automation and large coverage area
    with a single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation systems also have potential to be
    deployed for variable rate water application as they can be very accurate and
    can be automated based on sensor feedback [2]. Implementing a spatially varied
    irrigation system requires an understanding of the characteristics of the irrigation
    application system deployed including the spatial scales covered by the water
    application equipment. The spatial scale associated with the variability in crop
    water requirements and its impact on yield should also be identified [32]. O’Shaughnessy
    et al. [33] suggested that the size and numbers of irrigation management zones
    that can be controlled in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall
    flexibility of the system. For moving application systems, the width of the management
    zone is dependent on the number of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled
    set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single solenoid valve) and the length will
    be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the traveling sprinkler.
    The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns between management
    zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume applied. Raine and McCarthy
    [32] noted that the spray diameter and overlap achieved by moving application
    systems make it impossible to target water applications on a single crop basis
    using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that the economic benefits of
    spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration even when the
    system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint. The spatial scales
    associated with moving and fixed irrigation systems is presented in Table 1. Smith
    et al. [11] concluded that the spatial resolution of a precision irrigation system
    will be influenced by the spatial scales associated with the application system,
    spatial resolution of the infield sensors and the spatial scales associated with
    the variability in crop water requirements. Table 1. Spatial scales of fixed and
    moving irrigation systems. 4. Control of Water Application in Precision Irrigation
    The water application system used in the precision irrigation process must be
    able to control the water application volume applied per unit time to each defined
    irrigation management unit within a field [13]. The development of variable rate
    water application systems has been mostly focused on continuous move systems [11].
    The control of water application on continuous move systems (centre pivot, linear
    move, boom and reel) is based on databases of spatially referenced data defining
    irrigation management units [20]. The volume of water applied to each management
    unit can be achieved by varying the application rate of sprinklers or controlling
    the ground speed of continuous move systems [13]. The application rate of sprinklers
    is mostly varied through the pulse modulation of the sprinkler nozzles. This involves
    the application of normally opened solenoid valves to control flow through an
    individual or group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the flow of water either
    on or off at a sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth
    within a specified cycle time. The cycle time is the total number of switching
    (either to on or off phase) required by the solenoid valves during a pulse cycle
    [34]. Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control on a linear
    move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems
    indicated a satisfactory performance over a range of water application rates.
    They however noted a problem with sprinkler overlap at the edge of the irrigation
    management units. The variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous move
    system can also be achieved by varying its travel speed. The sprinklers on the
    manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated at a specified flow rate
    and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the application
    depth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application depth [35].
    This type of system cannot be applied in situations where variable application
    depths are needed along the length of the irrigation system [34]. Al-Karadsheh
    [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving variable water application
    rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers was reported
    to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed to travel a
    minimum distance of 16 m before a desired change in application volume can be
    reached. This suggests that this system is not suitable for use in applications
    where the management units are small in scale. The adaptation of fixed irrigation
    systems for variable rate water application has been achieved (e.g., [36]). Variable
    water rate application in these systems is usually achieved either by individual
    nozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers are referred to [13]
    for a comprehensive review of such systems. Miranda et al. [37] described a distributed
    control system implemented to achieve variable rate water application in a fixed
    irrigation system operating in predefined management zones. Their results indicated
    that the system was able to apply the irrigation volume required in each zone.
    Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable rate water application setup
    for a fixed irrigation system capable of zone-specific irrigation of strawberries.
    Individual nozzle control in a micro-sprinkler system has been demonstrated by
    Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual control of 54 nodes in a vineyard
    with the system. The nozzle connected to each node was capable of achieving a
    unique water application volume. They concluded that the water requirements of
    each defined zone in the vineyard can be individually met by the irrigation system.
    The authors reported a payback period of between 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.
    5. Monitoring The routine or continuous monitoring of moisture fluxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere
    system is a fundamental aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture.
    Monitoring can essentially be viewed as the application of various sensing technologies
    in determining and characterizing the spatiotemporal field-scale moisture dynamics
    and plant water use. These sensing methods can be classified under three broad
    headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40]. Soil-based sensing
    typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture content or
    potential. This information is then used to infer the amount of water available
    for plant use and its temporal dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the
    use of the crop evapotranspiration to determine the temporal crop water use. The
    evapotranspiration is determined using climatic variables such as radiation, rainfall
    and wind speed [41,42]. The plant-based sensing involves the determination of
    plant water status which is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements
    of canopy temperature, stomatal resistance, sap flow, leaf turgor pressure, stem
    diameter and leaf thickness are used to infer plant water status [43]. Recent
    advances in remote sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial
    nature of both soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact
    technologies that are capable of sensing radiation reflected or emitted from agricultural
    fields. They are deployed using satellites, aerial platforms and tractors [44].
    These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited for regional
    soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies
    that can be applied in monitoring field-scale soil and crop water dynamics. Readers
    are referred to [44,46] for a comprehensive review of remote sensing technologies
    applicable in precision agriculture. 5.1. Soil-Based Sensing The knowledge of
    soil moisture fluxes comprising of the depletion and refill of soil water can
    be used to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool in irrigation
    scheduling and management decisions [47]. Several methods have been developed
    for measuring soil moisture content; they are indirect methods which rely on the
    strong relationship between a particular property of the soil and the soil moisture
    content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring and are non-destructive
    [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied method for monitoring the
    temporal dynamics of field-scale soil moisture is the dielectric-based method
    [20]. This is because of the ease of their deployment in large-scale soil moisture
    sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper deployment and management of this technology
    can optimize the sustainability of irrigated agriculture. Consequently, this section
    will outline a brief description of this method including a consideration of the
    factors affecting sensor performance. For a more detailed description of other
    state-of-the-art soil moisture sensing technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].
    5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture Sensors Dielectric soil moisture sensors operate
    by exploiting the dielectric properties of soil and its constituents [52]. The
    relative dielectric permittivity of a substance is used to describe the effect
    of an electromagnetic field on its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless
    constant greater than one, made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent
    relative dielectric permittivity of soil, ε′ soil is a function of its constituents
    majorly being water, air and solid particles. The relative dielectric permittivity
    of the other constituents except water has a negligible effect as they have small
    values in the range of 1–7. The one of water, ε′ water having a value of approximately
    80 has the most remarkable effect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric
    moisture content (VMC) to ε′ soil using empirical equations at a frequency range
    of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency range, ε′ soil is highly
    stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of soil
    [54]. A range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide a non-destructive
    in situ measurement of soil moisture contents. They include time domain reflectometry
    (TDR) sensors, time domain transmission (TDT) sensors and capacitance sensors.
    5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric Soil Moisture Sensors The
    accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important in the precision irrigation
    process. Over estimation of soil moisture status may lead to a delay in irrigation
    scheduling decisions and consequently affect crop yield and quality. Underestimation
    of soil moisture status on the other hand may lead to application of irrigation
    too often or when not required by the crops. This will result in water/energy
    wastage and adverse environmental effects. Dielectric soil moisture sensors measure
    the soil moisture content for the soil volume corresponding to their sphere of
    influence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric soil moisture
    sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture, bulk density
    and temperature. A variation in any of these factors around the sphere of influence
    of the dielectric sensor will have an effect on its performance. These properties
    vary with location and depth in a soil profile and it is important to take them
    into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors [55]. These sensors
    often rely on site-specific calibration, but they often come with ‘universal’
    calibrations which can be used where absolute accuracy is not required. The accuracy
    of calibration equations supplied by manufacturers of these sensors are usually
    between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied in non-saline soils [56]. Site-specific
    calibration equations which are developed by comparing the sensor output to gravimetrically
    derived soil moisture content can be applied when a higher level of accuracy is
    required [57]. In addition, for capacitance type probes, it is essential that
    the probe access tubes are fitted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust
    soil water measurements. For a detailed technical description of factors affecting
    the performance of dielectric sensors, readers are referred to [58,59]. 5.2. Proximal
    Sensing and Mapping of Soil Moisture The recent advances in rapid mapping and
    positioning technologies enables the spatial characterization of soil moisture
    retention properties to inform precision irrigation decisions. The electromagnetic
    induction (EM) technique is used in combination with accurate positioning systems
    to quantify soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides
    a highly accurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2]. The EM sensor maps the soil’s
    apparent EC which is influenced by soil texture and moisture in non-saline soils
    [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.
    Based on the EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different parts
    of the field. Topographic features that are likely to influence field-scale soil
    moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60]. The EC maps enable the grouping
    of discrete units known as management units with similar available water-holding
    capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting soil moisture
    monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The data from soil moisture
    sensors located in the management units can also be used in generating dynamic
    application maps based on a relationship between the soil moisture depletion and
    the mapped EC values. These application maps serve as an input into the precision
    irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule [21] applied soil moisture sensors
    and an EC map in generating dynamic water status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated
    maize field. Daccache et al. [8] applied a similar method in producing dynamic
    soil moisture maps for various fields. The electric resistivity tomography technique
    can also be applied in deriving the EC map of a field. Hedley et al. [2] reported
    that the method has a good vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a
    moving platform for rapid non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et
    al. [62] in positioning soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.
    The ground-penetrating radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the field-scale
    soil moisture status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation
    system for mapping soil moisture in a field. The GPR is however affected by high
    clay content, is not amenable to automation and requires further development to
    improve its viability in precision irrigation applications [63]. The deployment
    of soil moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques
    enables the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate
    water application. 5.3. Weather-Based Sensing Weather-based sensing involves the
    use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative of the crops’
    daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to the
    air from the soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation or applied
    irrigation. Transpiration accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the
    subsequent loss of water as vapor through stomata in its leaves, required for
    metabolic cooling of the leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf overheating
    [41]. Evapotranspiration is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation
    of water from the soil, evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration
    [64]. The evaporation and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often
    difficult to distinguish. The predominance of each of these processes however
    varies at different crop growth stages. At the initial crop growth stage, water
    is lost mainly in form of evaporation from the soil surface. As the development
    of the crop progresses, transpiration becomes the major medium of water loss to
    the atmosphere [45]. The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor
    pressure deficit of the atmosphere at any given time and wind speed. It is also
    influenced by soil water content, the rate at which water can be taken up from
    the soil by the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth
    stage) [64]. Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET
    process. The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales
    is appropriate for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process.
    The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM)
    equation presents a procedure for computing hourly or daily ET values using standard
    climatological measurements of solar radiation, air temperature, humidity and
    wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass surface [41].
    These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on a specific
    field or from a metrological network. The equation provides a basis from which
    reference ET (ET from the well-watered grass surface) for different time periods
    can be calculated and to which ET from other crops can be computed using crop
    coefficients, K c [66]. The crop coefficients are specific to each crop and crop
    canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The K c curve defined
    for a crop over its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar climates.
    The K c is however dependent on the canopy dynamics including cover fraction,
    leaf area index and greenness which may vary across regions with similar climates
    [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using the standard FAO-PM
    crop coefficient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a relatively easy procedure
    for determining the temporal dynamics of crop water use. The crop coefficient
    used in determining the actual ET of a particular crop however needs to be estimated
    at each growth stage. It is noted in Allen et al. [41] that reference ET can be
    overestimated by as much as 20% during conditions of low evaporative demand. Remote
    sensing provides a means of overcoming the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefficient
    approach of estimating crop ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water
    use as influenced by actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and
    field spatial variability [68]. The remotely sensed normalised difference vegetation
    index (NDVI) computed from crop canopy reflectance measurements in the red and
    near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in computing
    accurate crop coefficients for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70]
    has demonstrated the use of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed
    NDVI in estimating the water use of cotton. A similar procedure has also been
    demonstrated by Farg et al. [67] for estimating the daily water use of wheat.
    The surface renewal analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the
    real-time temporal dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method
    is used to determine the sensible heat which can then be applied to the energy
    balance equation to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is based on
    analyzing the temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in
    heat content of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel
    comes in contact with the crop canopy, the air temperature remains constant for
    a brief time period known as the quiescent period. The temperature of the air
    parcel however increases after this time period as energy is transferred to it
    from the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel
    is replaced by cooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature of
    the air shows a sharp drop [72]. A high frequency trace of this temperature renewal
    event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying structure function theory to the
    ramp function enables the determination of the sensible heat flux. The instrumentation
    requirement for an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter fine wire
    thermocouples or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data
    acquisition system (2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements
    are also required to obtain the other parameters in the energy balance equation.
    The SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above
    the crop canopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb
    all the momentum transferred to it by the ambient airflow [73]. This assumption
    introduces errors in ET estimates over fields with variable canopy structures.
    Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be applied for estimating
    ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from the environment.
    The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance system or a lysimeter.
    This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment. The SR methodology
    proposed by Castellvi [75], however, does not require calibration. Rosa and Tanny
    [76], Shapland and Snyder [72], and Rosa et al. [77] have reported highly accurate
    hourly ET estimates from various crops using a surface renewal analysis system.
    5.4. Plant-Based Sensing The importance of plant-based monitoring becomes emphasized
    when studying the effect of water deficit on plants and its relation to plant
    water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use can be monitored using a
    number of plant-based methods. They include methods that require direct contact
    with the plant and those that require only proximal contact with the plants [78].
    The contact sensors are useful in monitoring the temporal dynamics of the plant
    water status while the proximal sensors are capable of assessing the spatial nature
    of crop water status across a field and hence well suited for the precision irrigation
    process [11]. A good understanding of the various aspects of plant water status
    and plant drought physiology is important in the successful application of these
    systems. Readers are directed to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based
    sensing methods applicable in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems
    measure either the plant water content, plant water potential or the plant physiological
    response to moisture deficits. A summary of various plant-based sensing systems
    is given in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require skilled manpower
    and considerable management time for their operation. Table 2. Summary of plant-based
    monitoring methods. 5.5. Thermal Sensing Plant canopy temperature is a widely
    accepted variable indicative of plant water status. The stomata controls evaporative
    cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing environmental
    conditions. It closes due to increased water deficits and a reduction in plant
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement
    of the crop canopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized
    using an index such as the crop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining
    the plant water status and its response to water deficits [79]. The CWSI is a
    well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature
    as a function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deficits
    [92]. It relates the difference in the crop canopy temperature measured using
    infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a function of atmospheric vapor
    deficit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper and lower
    temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop
    under the same prevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless
    value of between 0 and 1, with a value of 0 indicating a well-watered crop and
    a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93]. Biotic factors can
    also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water use
    and canopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and morphology
    which in turn affects the optical properties of the crop canopy [94]. In order
    to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a tool for assessing plant water
    status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as water stress)
    and biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation). Multiband optical
    sensors could be applied in detecting various crop diseases and crop infestation
    within a field by computing vegetation indices based on canopy reflectance measurements
    [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et al. [95] for detecting citrus greening
    and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting infestation of green bugs and aphids in
    wheat. It may be useful to outfit precision irrigation systems with these sensors.
    The main advantage of thermal sensing for precision irrigation application is
    related to the non-contact and real-time capability of the system. Infrared thermometry
    and thermography provide the opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop
    water status which can guide in variable rate irrigation management. The use of
    thermal sensing for guiding zone-specific water application has been demonstrated
    as noted in Section 2. A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach
    is the establishment of the baseline temperatures. In climates in which the air
    humidity is often high, variations in wind speed and net radiation introduce significant
    errors in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97]. A number
    of studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility
    of applying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water status
    in humid regions. Jones [98] provides an excellent summary of these research efforts.
    They include the use of well-watered plots to substitute for empirical non-water
    stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots are rarely available in
    practice. The use of artificial reference surfaces for measuring baseline temperatures
    has been proposed but it is reported that these artificial reference surfaces
    differ significantly in thermal and radiative properties in comparison to real
    leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy resistance of well-watered
    plants has also been investigated but this is limited by the difficulties encountered
    in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence canopy resistance. The possibility
    of including a wide range of metrological data including net radiation and vapor
    pressure deficit in deriving CWSI models for humid climates has also been investigated.
    The mathematical complexity typical of the models however limit their practical
    application. Another problem commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements
    of canopy temperature in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil
    temperature and other background temperature including the sky and stems in the
    measured canopy temperature. This usually leads to errors in estimation of the
    canopy temperature as the soil and background temperature are usually many degrees
    different from the canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow
    acceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned to view only single leaves
    as a solution to this problem. It has however been found that the temperature
    estimates of single leaves determined by this method is mostly not representative
    of the temperature of the plant canopy. A dense deployment of infrared sensors
    may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive in terms of cost for practical
    applications. The advancements in the field of thermal imagery and the recent
    availability of low-cost thermal cameras has presented the possibility of overcoming
    the problems associated with the inclusion of soil and background temperatures
    in the measured canopy temperature. Thermal imagery allows for the average temperature
    of a defined area to be obtained and also the separation of background temperature
    from the area of interest. The temperature of a large number of individual leaves
    making up a canopy can be included in an image while the soil and background temperature
    can be discarded by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo
    et al. [100] has demonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water
    status in a commercial orchard in Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping
    of field-scale crop water status by deploying thermal imaging equipment on an
    unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Plant-based sensing methods including thermal sensing
    only provide information on the need for irrigation and provide no information
    on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used in combination with
    soil-based sensing for this reason [19]. 6. Decision Support A decision support
    system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a framework for incorporating
    various tools and techniques for site-specific irrigation decisions. The widespread
    commercial adoption of precision irrigation will be predicated on the development
    of robust and optimal decision support systems [19]. A number of decision support
    systems schedule irrigation at predefined intervals and apply predefined irrigation
    volumes. They do not incorporate any form of sensor feedback on plant water status,
    soil water status and climatic variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely
    designed based on heuristics and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested
    that this is an inefficient approach often leading to overwatering and waste of
    fertilizer and other supplemental crop inputs. Closed-loop irrigation strategies
    aim to irrigate: when the soil moisture content reaches a certain threshold [103,104,105];
    when plant sensors indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback
    from crop simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological
    response or economic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies
    have been shown to improve water use efficiency in the production of horticultural
    crops under protected environments. Environmental conditions in such production
    systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the stochastic
    plant response often encountered in field-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh
    et al. [110] implemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors for
    closed-loop irrigation control in a pot-in-pot nursery. A significant reduction
    in water use was achieved by the system. The authors also reported a 2.7-year
    payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings of
    83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected crop
    production system. They noted that there was less occurrence of plant diseases
    in the nursery due to the elimination of over-watering. Saavoss et al. [112] reported
    a 65% increase in profit due to the implementation of a wireless sensor network-based
    closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors noted that the increase in
    profit was due to improvement in crop quality and yield resulting from the precise
    control of irrigation applications. In field-scale crop production, the crop needs
    vary over time and space due to both biotic and abiotic factors [9]. McCarthy
    et al. [113] noted that in these crop production systems, closed-loop strategies
    are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics, the stochastic nature of climatic
    variables and crop response, and the time-varying nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere
    system. This last point is especially due to crop growth, crop management and
    infestation of pests and diseases. The closed-loop systems are also unable to
    consider equipment and other operational limitations. McCarthy et al. [114] concluded
    that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with the ability of
    accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the field. The decision
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions
    in response to crop physiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation
    systems and water supply limitations, economic considerations and the quality
    of sensor feedback. 6.1. Adaptive Decision Support The characteristics of a cropping
    system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties that will typically
    vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil properties (due to addition
    of nutrients and other management processes) and climate. This will have a direct
    influence on the irrigation timing and volume required for optimal crop growth
    [11]. An adaptive decision support system is able to continuously re-adjust the
    irrigation scheduling algorithm in order to retain the desired performance of
    the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive decision support system is able to utilize
    historical or real-time sensor data to arrive at irrigation timing and volume
    that adequately accounts for the temporal and spatial variability in the field
    [114]. In control theory an adaptive control system is generally accepted as a
    control system able to adjust its controller parameters based on sensor feedback
    from a process, such that the controlled process behaves in a desirable way [11].
    McCarthy et al. [108] noted that an adaptive decision support system for irrigation
    may either be sensor-based if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation
    strategy or model-based if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation
    decisions. The development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity
    to improve sustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and
    crop productivity. They will also enhance synergistic applications of data available
    from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at optimal irrigation scheduling
    decisions [108]. In this section we will present a brief discussion on state-of-the-art
    of adaptive decision support systems. We will thereafter discuss the opportunities
    these systems present in improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. Readers
    are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview on the application of advanced
    process control to irrigation, details on methods of operation and a consideration
    of fundamental control concepts as they apply to irrigation scheduling. 6.1.1.
    Mechanistic Models A number of irrigation decision support systems are based on
    complex physical models which closely resemble the actual physical system [115].
    They are able to incorporate the physiological and morphological representation
    of the plant into the decision support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116] described
    an irrigation scheduling system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model,
    MAESTRA (Multi-Array Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy
    photosynthesis and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics
    and environmental variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant
    transpiration. They reported that the model-based tool applied between 18% and
    56% more water than a sensing-based method for scheduling irrigation in four species.
    They, however, noted that the model-based approach produced greater tree growth.
    Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining
    the crop aerodynamic characteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith
    equation for calculating the actual crop ET. A major drawback of these mechanistic
    models is that they include static parameters which, once identified, are assumed
    to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as
    the cropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors. 6.1.2.
    Simulations Crop simulation models based on first principle physical models of
    crop phenology, soil physics and hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop
    response to irrigation and cropping system management [115]. These simulation
    models provide the opportunity to evaluate the benefit of several precision irrigation
    strategies as they eliminate the need for time-consuming field experiments [118].
    They can be interfaced with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors
    and weather data to determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can
    also be used in predicting the yield impact of an irrigation strategy. This is
    achieved by employing weather forecast data in computing a daily soil moisture
    balance and assessing the impact of soil moisture deficits on crop growth [118].
    DeJonge et al. [14] investigated the effect of variable rate irrigation management
    on corn production in Iowa using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared
    for a period of 28 years under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled
    uniform irrigation and precision irrigation. They reported no significant difference
    in corn yield and water use between the uniform irrigation and precision irrigation
    scenarios. Thorp et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision
    Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing
    variable rate management practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield.
    The platform enabled the evaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop
    performance in predefined management zones. These systems are however incapable
    of real-time decision support and can only be applied using historical data. McCarthy
    et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time decision
    support in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable of incorporating
    real-time data input from field sensors in arriving at irrigation decisions. The
    combination of different sensor inputs into the simulation framework enables adaptive
    decision support with the system being able to re-adjust irrigation decisions
    based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies. Simulation
    models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration and
    validation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available for this
    endeavour often limit the use of the platforms to specific crops. 6.1.3. Artificial
    Intelligence Artificial intelligence presents the potential of solving problems
    in precision irrigation which are complex, non-linear and ill-defined [119]. Artificial
    intelligence algorithms are able to emulate the human decision-making process
    when applied to a particular problem domain. They have been deployed for implementing
    adaptive decision support in irrigation in form of artificial neural networks,
    fuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed success to date [118,119,120]. ● Artificial
    Neural Networks Artificial neural networks (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures
    employed in modeling when the underlying data relationship is not well defined.
    ANN are able to identify and learn correlations between input data and corresponding
    target output values. They are able to predict the outcome of new independent
    data sets making them a useful tool in predictive modeling [121]. ANN are well
    suited for the irrigation decision support problem that can often be complex and
    stochastic in nature. These networks are also adaptive in nature and are able
    to continuously learn in order to provide optimal solutions to target problems
    in dynamic systems. Karasekreter et al. [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling
    irrigation in a strawberry orchard using soil moisture and its physical properties
    as model inputs. The system was able to achieve water savings of 20.5% and an
    energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however require large datasets for training and are
    unable to describe the physical dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited
    in real-time decision support tools. ● Fuzzy Logic Fuzzy logic is an artificial
    intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate it to human
    experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made up of a set
    used to classify input data into membership classes, a decision rule that is applied
    to each set which culminates in a human-like decision output from the system [123].
    A detailed description of the process is given in [124]. Mousa and Abdullah [123]
    successfully applied a fuzzy logic model in scheduling irrigation in drip and
    sprinkler irrigation systems using ET, soil moisture data and crop growth stage
    as model inputs. Prakashgoud and Desai [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using
    soil moisture data, leaf wetness and climatological data as model inputs in order
    to implement irrigation scheduling decisions. The system was capable of maintaining
    soil moisture thresholds in the specified range. Giusti and Marsili-Libelli [125]
    described an adaptive irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy
    logic. The system incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an
    inference system for maintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold.
    The system was reported to adapt irrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty
    and produced water savings of 13.55% over a simulation period of 168 days. The
    accuracy of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the
    system. They also lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability
    limited to the range of training data used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.
    [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision making with a fuzzy system
    an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support. ● Expert
    Systems An expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process a human
    expert would employ in a decision-making process in his/her field of expertise.
    It captures the human decision-making expertise and heuristics representing it
    in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically consists of a
    knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning tool
    [127]. Expert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are of a
    complex nature. They are also well suited to dealing with incomplete and uncertain
    data [128]. This makes them well suited for irrigation decision support which
    often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions. Expert systems
    applied in irrigation decision support can be classified as either ‘expert systems
    proper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the application of expert
    systems in irrigation decision support is given in [128,129]. The ‘expert systems
    proper’ class of irrigation decision support tools schedule irrigation based on
    soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider the time-varying
    nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest infestation) to arrive
    at optimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable to account for the stochastic
    nature of climatic variables and are not well suited for real-time applications
    [129]. Hybrid expert systems which are also referred to as model-based expert
    systems combine algorithmic techniques and a knowledge-based component in solving
    problems relevant to its application domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that
    optimal irrigation decision can be made by combining expert knowledge with data
    feedback from infield sensors, data-driven models and crop simulation models [130].
    Thomson and Ross [131] described a model-based expert system designed for decision
    support in irrigation management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture
    sensors to adjust the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth
    simulation model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation.
    The system was reported to maintain soil moisture at the defined thresholds. Goumopoulos
    et al. [38] developed an expert system-based adaptive decision support platform
    for zone-specific irrigation of strawberry plants. The system includes a wireless
    sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback for the decision
    support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable of inferring
    new rules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets. The system was
    reported to reduce irrigation water consumption by around 20%. A hybrid expert
    system based on real-time soil moisture data with the capability of incorporating
    plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132]. The performance of an expert
    system is largely dependent on the effectiveness of the knowledge acquisition
    process. An error in this process will drastically affect the system reliability
    and its performance. 6.1.4. Learning Control Learning control decision support
    strategies perform systems identification using sensor feedback without defining
    a mathematical model [113]. Systems identification models a dynamic system based
    on a time series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview
    on the theory of systems identification is presented in [134]. Iterative learning
    control can be applied in systems with ill-defined models that operate repetitively
    and assume the same initial condition after each iteration. It is well suited
    to the irrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive
    problem over the crop season. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere
    system can also be viewed as an ill-defined problem. The strategy is also able
    to improve system performance by eliminating the effects of a repeating disturbance
    with undefined dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured crop response
    that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes in crop water
    use and weather conditions are not considered [113]. McCarthy et al. [114] noted
    that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be the inefficient systems
    identification resulting from the slow system dynamics of the crop system in response
    to irrigation events. This results from the evaluation of the effect of only one
    irrigation volume on plant response at any water application event. They suggested
    that this drawback may be eliminated by applying the process of iterative hill
    climbing control. This learning control strategy employs an adaptive varied identification
    process. A range of irrigation volumes are applied at each irrigation event to
    a number of test cells on the field. The response in the test cell that best matches
    the desired system performance is identified as the optimal irrigation process.
    They reported that the iterative hill climbing control procedure was capable of
    maximizing cotton yield when used with a combination of plant and soil sensors
    to provide feedback for the identification procedure. Their conclusions were however
    based on results from a simulation study and a field-based validation of the procedure
    was not reported. The results of the learning control procedure are based solely
    on sensor measurements and may be largely affected by sensor drift as a model
    of the crop response is not developed from the identification procedure. This
    method can be considered more of a “brute force” approach than a scientifically
    based approach to scheduling irrigation. 6.1.5. Model Predictive Control Model
    predictive control (MPC) is an industrial control approach employed in decision
    support for large-scale multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has
    been successfully implemented in the food industry, petrochemical industry and
    power generation among others [135]. Model predictive control employs a plant
    model and optimization algorithm to calculate plant inputs in order to achieve
    a future value of a performance criterion. The system performance is predicted
    over a finite horizon subject to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of
    the plant [101]. Readers are directed to [135,136,137] for an in-depth review
    of the theory of model predictive control and its application in various industries.
    In the case of irrigation, applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input
    will be the irrigation amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deficit,
    and both crop ET and precipitation values will be considered as disturbances as
    they cannot be controlled. A prediction of future input values and disturbances
    is required in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system output [138].
    This highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the
    MPC framework for irrigation decision support. Model predictive control appears
    to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support. The irrigation
    problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output
    constraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds and the desired plant response
    to water deficits [135]. Ooi et al. [139], Lozoya et al. [101] and Saleem et al.
    [135] described a model predictive control framework for irrigation scheduling
    based on a soil moisture balance model. They employed a system identification
    procedure to generate a grey box model of the soil–plant–atmosphere system with
    a network of soil moisture sensors providing real-time feedback to the control
    algorithm. They all reported the ability of the MPC platform to sufficiently predict
    crop irrigation needs and also observations of significant water savings. The
    authors of the discussed systems however fail to account for the stochastic nature
    of rainfall and crop water use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138] noted
    that an adequate consideration of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into
    the water balance model employed in the MPC framework will improve the capability
    of the MPC system. Delgoda et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above
    MPC frameworks by employing disturbance affine feedback control, an uncertainty
    modelling technique widely applied in MPC to account for the stochastic nature
    of rainfall and crop water use. A simple order model of soil moisture dynamics
    is included in the system to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence
    accounting for the time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors
    reported an optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable
    uncertainties in climatic variables exist. 6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications
    in Adaptive Decision Support Manufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators
    are showing considerable interest in developing innovative tools that will further
    optimize irrigation water use. A sensor integration project is described by AgSmarts
    (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation systems are equipped with sensors which
    provide data on crop growth stage and soil profile. Aquaspy soil moisture sensors
    (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the field also provide data
    on soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing and calculation
    of irrigation volumes. These irrigation decisions are automatically adjusted based
    on the varying water requirements at each crop growth stage [140]. Omica, Italy
    has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental and soil moisture
    sensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support irrigation decisions.
    The sensors are interfaced to a geo-referenced decision support system which enables
    zone-specific irrigation management. The system is able to predict crop yield
    based on irrigation timing and application volumes combined with historical yield
    data. This can then be applied in optimizing the decision support system towards
    achieving a desired crop yield goal. Most decision support systems presently produced
    for commercial use provide on/off irrigation control based on specified thresholds
    and plant/crop sensor feedback. The incorporation of predictive models into these
    systems will enhance the possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop
    yield [141]. 7. Opportunities for Improving Sustainability Sustainability is premised
    on the principle of meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising
    the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture
    is focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse
    impact on the environment [142]. Pretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture
    integrates the main goals of environmental health and economic profitability.
    The efficient and effective use of water is considered the main driver for improving
    sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water
    for irrigating crops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional
    irrigation practices apply water uniformly over a field resulting in a high volume
    of water use. Overirrigation may also result from this practice which causes leaching
    of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important consideration
    would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and irrigation
    application equipment. Soil erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability
    in irrigated agriculture. This can be eliminated by applying precise irrigation
    volumes to reduce surface runoff. Precision irrigation presents a promising platform
    for improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This is especially hinged
    on the possibility of eliminating the adverse environmental impacts related to
    conventional irrigation practices with the adoption of precision irrigation. The
    economic profitability of the adoption of precision irrigation is however a very
    important point to consider. This will be manifested in terms of improved crop
    yields and increased water savings including the associated reduction in energy
    consumption resulting from the optimal matching of irrigation inputs to the spatial
    water demands of the field, thus reducing costs [11]. Precision irrigation is
    predicated on the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially across
    a field. In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also
    due to physiological factors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed
    that varying water application across the field to meet this spatial crop water
    need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs. Smith
    et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial crop
    production is not readily found in literature. Evans and King [18] reviewed much
    of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the improvements in crop yield
    and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested that the
    greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased utilization
    of stored moisture and in-season precipitation. Results from simulation- and field-based
    case studies they reviewed showed water savings of 0% to 26% for well-watered
    crop production employing precision irrigation strategies. No significant improvements
    in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision irrigation were reported.
    They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision irrigation is more
    suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may have greater potential
    in reducing irrigation water use in humid climates when irrigating to maximally
    utilize in-season precipitation. They further noted that the economic benefit
    of adopting precision irrigation for field-scale crop production is limited. This
    is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and management is much greater than
    the revenue improvements achieved as a result of improved yield and water savings.
    The payback period of implementing the technology may also exceed the useful life
    of the water application equipment, typically placed at 15 years. A payback period
    ranging from 5 to 20 years is noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision
    irrigation for crop production in New Zealand. Evans et al. [145] reviewed the
    adoption trends of spatially varied irrigation in the USA covering a period of
    20 years. They noted that about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems
    in the USA were fitted with variable rate water application technology. They suggested
    higher net returns on investment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation
    by growers. Growers that had adopted the technology reported no significant savings
    in water and energy use in non-limiting water situations. They noted that in more
    than 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management, the
    economic benefit was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal
    water savings (5%–15%) which is insufficient to realize a payback for the initial
    investment in the water application technology. They concluded that an economic
    strategy that optimizes net return rather than total returns for the technology
    should be adopted as a long-term investment goal. Heeren et al. [146] conducted
    a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs through the adoption
    of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated fields in Nebraska, USA.
    The study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining undepleted
    available water. They noted that the reduction in pumping costs achieved from
    the adoption of precision irrigation in all fields may be negligible in comparison
    to the cost of variable rate water application equipment. They concluded that
    the adoption of this technology will be economically justifiable only with an
    increase in energy costs. An economic evaluation of spatially varied irrigation
    applications is presented in Lee [147]. The study assessed energy savings resulting
    from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation on a 67-acre field in Wyoming.
    The cost of installing the variable rate water application equipment on the field
    was reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return
    for the equipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71, which
    equates to a payback period of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback will
    only be realized for the technology outside the useful life of the equipment.
    Precision irrigation offers the benefit of providing water conservation benefits
    by avoiding overirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts [18].
    Sadler et al. [148] discussed water conservation strategies where precision irrigation
    can potentially reduce the total water applied and improve the environmental quality
    of irrigated fields. They suggested that programing zero irrigation amounts to
    non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision irrigation.
    They also noted that adjusting spatial water application based on the infiltration
    rate of the soil and soil water storage capacity will reduce the occurrence of
    surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff and leaching were identified as
    the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They suggested the occurrence
    of this can be eliminated by spatial application of precise irrigation volumes
    based on the soil water-holding characteristics. They presented several case studies
    in which the adoption of precision irrigation has been demonstrated to enhance
    the environmental quality of irrigated fields. They concluded that precision irrigation
    has the capability of improving water use efficiencies while reducing the adverse
    environmental impacts associated with conventional irrigation practices. The results
    from the above studies show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving
    sustainability in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health.
    Its economic justification in terms of significant yield improvements and water
    savings is however limited. Evans and King [18] suggested that the lack of significant
    improvements in yield response when employing precision irrigation may result
    from the fact that the yield response to the water curve near maximum yield (100%
    ET) is almost flat, with small changes in water applied using precision irrigation
    having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies
    have used only soil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate and
    crop genetics may however have a direct influence on the yield response of the
    crops. Soil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication of crop
    water status, rather the plant may be the best indicator of water availability.
    The decision support systems employed by current precision irrigation systems
    assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with time. The characteristics
    of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and optimal
    amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event. We argue
    that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and weather data)
    will enhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation decisions and hence
    an improvement in economic outcomes. This should be integrated with a decision
    support system that has the capability to adapt to the time-varying nature of
    the cropping system. The decision support system should also have the capacity
    to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience and a target
    crop production function. We discuss how this can be achieved by exploiting improvements
    in monitoring and management considerations. 7.1. Monitoring Considerations A
    precision irrigation system is designed to apply water at a differential rate
    in response to the temporal and spatial variation in crop water need across a
    field. This process is supported by a number of sensors providing data to a real-time
    decision support system. These sensors include weather stations, soil moisture
    sensors, environmental sensors, plant sensors and thermal sensors which may be
    integrated into a wireless sensor network. A careful design of these sensing systems
    including a consideration of factors affecting their performance is crucial in
    realizing the goal of improved water use through precision irrigation. Dielectric
    soil moisture sensors sense the water content of the immediate soil in their zone
    of influence. The zone of influence reported for most commercial dielectric soil
    moisture sensors corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149].
    It is therefore important to install the sensors in areas representative of the
    soil moisture available for plant use. The normal practice employed by most users
    is to place the sensors in the driest regions of the field or in the regions comprising
    of a soil profile with the lowest available water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting
    this approach will most likely lead to wetter regions in the field receiving more
    frequent irrigation which will consequently result in overirrigation. A more efficient
    approach is to define irrigation management zones and place a number of sensors
    in each management zone to give the average soil moisture estimate. This may however
    be limited by cost. A structured installation profile is also necessary in order
    to capture soil water movement and availability. It is recommended that sensors
    should be installed at each soil horizon along the plant rooting zone [151]. An
    accepted convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along
    the rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the
    uppermost soil profile is able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the
    deepest part of the profile is able to detect drainage and the other sensors located
    midway in the soil profile are able to capture soil moisture dynamics useful in
    supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing
    knowledge of the site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two depths
    and still adequately capture the soil moisture dynamics. The soil moisture sensors
    should also be deployed using soil-specific calibration equations to enable accurate
    estimates of soil moisture content. The actual crop evapotranspiration can vary
    spatially and temporally under conditions of unrestricted water supply. These
    variations can be the result of several factors including differences in crop
    genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability
    and stage of growth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a field may result
    in significant water savings. The accurate measurement of evapotranspiration is
    crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure
    for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation systems relies
    on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which
    is adjusted for specific crops using crop coefficients. This calculated ET is
    assumed to be uniform for every part of the field. This will however result in
    the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace crop water use, owing
    to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique
    in determining site-specific crop coefficients provides a platform for overcoming
    this challenge. The surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising
    tool for quantifying the actual crop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,
    short and dense canopies. Plant-based measurements provide the best indication
    of plant water status as they provide a direct measure of the plants’ response
    to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based monitoring
    system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in water deficits.
    Measurements of leaf water potential and sap flow are contact methods which give
    direct information on plant water status but their spatial resolution is limited
    as many samples are required to effectively monitor the dynamics of field-scale
    plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has provided a robust platform
    for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated from the infrared measurements
    of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify field-scale crop water status
    with high spatial and temporal resolution. This presents a robust and cost-effective
    tool for use in precision irrigation. Its application in humid regions is however
    marred with difficulties. A systems engineering approach can be applied in overcoming
    the difficulties encountered with applying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical
    model derived using this approach may adequately simulate the real-time dynamics
    of the baseline temperatures required for computing the index. A summary of the
    technology gaps and refinements necessary in monitoring tools in order to achieve
    robust precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the
    limited volume of influence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement
    accuracy of soil moisture sensors. The refinements recommended include the development
    of low cost soil measurement sensors with a wider volume of influence, low cost
    and resilient wireless communication networks able to link spatially deployed
    soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order
    to improve the accuracy of soil moisture sensors. The technology gaps identified
    in plant sensing technology include the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds
    and quantity, and low spatial resolution. The refinements recommended include
    the integration of plant-based sensing with soil moisture sensing tools in order
    to determine irrigation volumes, calibration of infra-red thermography against
    physiologically explicit plant measurements in order to determine critical thresholds
    and the deployment of IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance
    spatial coverage. A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density
    that captures spatial variability is therefore likely to yield the most robust
    and accurate solution for precision irrigation. This will ensure that the decision
    support system is robust to data availability, gaps and deficiencies. This will
    include data from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration
    will also include developing cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will
    enhance the adoption of these adaptive systems by farmers. 7.2. Management Considerations
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation
    system. Management acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,
    culminating into irrigation decisions. This enables the implementation of vital
    management decisions of when and where to apply irrigation and also the irrigation
    volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps the management backbone
    of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital for improving
    sustainability in irrigated agriculture. The adaptive decision support tools discussed
    have the capability of improving crop yield and water savings when deployed as
    part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al. [11] noted that the simulation
    of adaptive decision support strategies can be used in identifying optimal irrigation
    scheduling decisions. A simulation tool capable of representing a range of field
    conditions at different spatial and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such
    a simulation framework is presented in [114]. Model-based decision support systems
    using feedback from multiple sensors may present a platform for arriving at optimal
    water applications. MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the aim of
    improving sustainability in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based
    on MPC employs an optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the
    best performance. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision
    irrigation system could involve the use of real-time data from field sensors to
    calibrate a crop or soil model and then optimizing this calibrated model to arrive
    at optimal irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil moisture
    sensors, thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The
    data from the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are
    not required at a high temporal resolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment
    of these sensors is however required to account for the spatial nature of field-scale
    crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving platform for spatial
    data collection across the field. Equipment availability, irrigation system capacity
    and other operational considerations can be incorporated as system-level constraints
    in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints can be considered to
    arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113]. MPC uses a model’s simulation
    to determine the optimum irrigation application timing and volume. When combined
    with a soft sensing system, variables that are not directly measured can be controlled
    and optimized. This presents a possibility of applying decision support systems
    based on MPC in realising a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].
    There has been considerable research into water use procedures that can achieve
    improved water savings in irrigated agriculture, particularly deficit irrigation.
    Deficit irrigation (DI) is an irrigation strategy in which a crop is exposed to
    a level of water stress at certain growth stages in its development (regulated
    deficit irrigation) or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which
    the plant is subjected to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant
    stage. The goal of deficit irrigation is that there will be little adverse effect
    on yield and irrigation water can be conserved [154]. Evans and King [18] suggested
    deficit irrigation as a tool for improving water use in precision irrigation.
    They noted that it can be applied in maximizing net returns and conserve large
    amounts of water in arid and semi-arid regions. It is however important to investigate
    the response of different crops to water deficits including timing tolerances
    in order to develop optimal deficit irrigation strategies that can be integrated
    into the precision irrigation decision support framework. It is also important
    to investigate the economics of yield reduction associated with deficit irrigation
    strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that implementing deficit irrigation
    as part of precision irrigation management will involve the continuous assessment
    of crop stress and growth stage throughout the growing season. This will be instrumental
    in avoiding temporary severe stress which could result in uneconomic reduction
    in crop yield or quality. The high cost of the component technologies of precision
    irrigation including soil, plant and weather sensors, decision support systems
    and variable rate water application systems is presently a constraint to the wide-scale
    adoption of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield improvements and
    water savings currently achieved through field-scale precision irrigation may
    not justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh
    water resources become scarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed
    on water abstracted for irrigated agriculture. Regulatory agencies may also require
    farmers to continuously demonstrate the efficient use of water. These factors
    may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155]. A conceptual
    model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather
    and soil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is currently
    being developed by the authors. It involves the integration of various sensing
    systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning and model predictive control into
    an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation. Figure 1. Conceptual
    model-based decision support system for precision irrigation. Elements in blue
    represent novel ideas from the Authors and elements in orange are from the decision
    support system presented in McCarthy et al. [114]. 8. Conclusions Technological
    innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture form an important
    vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water resources. Precision
    irrigation has been demonstrated as such an innovation, though presently the economic
    benefit related to the adoption of this technology at field-scale crop production
    is minimal. This is because the potential for yield improvements and water savings
    may not cover the cost of technology required for its implementation. The application
    of adaptive control techniques to irrigation decision support and improvements
    in monitoring tools has the capability of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic
    nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere system while also considering operational
    limitations in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents
    a platform for actualizing the environmental and economic goals of sustainability
    in irrigated agriculture. A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper
    combination of soil, weather and plant sensors is however vital for the proper
    operation of an adaptive decision support system. The decision support system
    should be able to account for the varying crop water requirements within season
    as a result of both biotic and abiotic factors. The decision support system should
    also consider agronomic objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is
    delivered by the precision irrigation system. The high cost of sensors and the
    requirement for dense deployment in order to obtain data at high spatial resolutions
    is presently a constraint. The large dataset required for the calibration of crop
    simulation models is also another significant problem. Future research needs include
    the development of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of
    influence, identification of irrigation thresholds for plant-based sensors and
    the development of self-learning crop simulation models that are able to infer
    relationships from a limited data set. The field evaluation of adaptive decision
    support systems would also be beneficial in quantifying their sustainability improvement
    potential. Acknowledgments The authors wish to acknowledge John Oldacre Foundation

  description: Italy is the leading rice producer in Europe, accounting for more than
    half of the total high-quality production of this crop. Rice is traditionally
    grown in fields that remain flooded starting with crop establishment until close
    to harvest, and this traditional irrigation technique (i.e., continuous submergence)
    is recognised as an important water resource sink (almost 40% of the irrigation
    water available worldwide is used for paddy areas). Meanwhile, the water management
    in rice areas requires a high level of labour because it is based on maintaining
    a predetermined water height in paddy fields and because the regulation of input
    and output flow is typically operated manually by the farmer. This study reveals
    the hardware and software characteristics of an automated and remote controlled
    technology tested for the first time in a rice farm near Pavia (Italy), during
    the 2016 growing season, aiming at a more efficient and less burdensome irrigation
    management system for rice fields. A water level sensor in the field provides
    the data required to govern the inflow regulation gate in real-time, according
    to the precise time to cut off the flow rate. Using a dedicated web page, the
    farmer can control flows, volumes and water levels in the fields by operating
    directly on the gate if necessary or setting the irrigation program according
    to his agronomic practices.

    80 percent of the consumptive water use in the United States, which is the water
    lost to the environment, goes to irrigated agriculture [1]. The Mississippi River
    Valley alluvial aquifer of the Delta is used by agriculture in Arkansas, Missouri,
    Mississippi, and Louisiana, and irrigated acreage has more than doubled from 1982
    to 2007 [1]. Critical groundwater areas in the Delta region of eastern Arkansas
    continue to experience decline as groundwater demand outpaces recharge. Demand
    for groundwater constitutes 81% of the total water demand in the East Arkansas
    Region (Figure 1), and a groundwater gap of over seven million acre-feet is projected
    for 2050 [2]. A declining aquifer raises the cost of pumping groundwater and risks
    the future profitability of agriculture, the dominant industry in the region.
    These risks are amplified by prospects of long-term drought and climate uncertainty.
    Additional benefits to society of a greater aquifer volume include the avoidance
    of subsidence, less seepage of surface water from riparian areas vital to wildlife,
    and less pumping of underlying aquifers used for drinking water in towns. There
    is a need to move toward sustainable levels of groundwater withdrawal. Figure
    1. Three eight-digit hydrologic unit code (HUC) watersheds in the Mississippi
    Delta region of eastern Arkansas define the outer boundary of the study area.
    An eight-digit HUC defines the drainage area of the sub-basin of a river. County
    lines overlay the study area. Public land and urban areas are excluded. The location
    of the study area within the state of Arkansas is shown. Precision agriculture
    provides the potential to enhance irrigation efficiency through site-specific
    variable-rate irrigation management of crops. Irrigation efficiency is defined
    as the ratio of applied water that is beneficially used for crop growth to the
    total amount of applied water [3]. The irrecoverable fraction of applied water
    includes runoff from a geographic area, evaporation, and plant evapotranspiration
    [3,4]. Some fraction of applied irrigation water is recoverable, re-entering the
    aquifer in the future as deep percolation [3,4]. Field-level spatial variability
    in soil characteristics results in spatial variability of irrigation efficiency
    and can lead to over- or under- application of water under uniform application
    conditions. In most cases, a farmer will tend to over-apply to account for uneven
    distribution of water in the field and maximize yield [5]. Mapping the variability
    of appropriate field conditions using remote monitoring methods can allow a farmer
    to apply variable-rate irrigation management and maintain yields while decreasing
    water use and groundwater pumping [6,7,8,9]. Precision agriculture adoption is
    one means by which farmers can limit the over-application of crop production inputs
    such as irrigation water and nutrients by using technology to inform site-specific
    management according to spatially localized conditions [8,10,11]. The spatial
    information technologies that have enabled precision agriculture include global
    positioning systems, geographic information systems, remote sensing, and variable-rate
    application technologies [12]. Precision agriculture involves combining the functions
    of these technologies to help with decision-making about crop and soil management
    in specific field locations [13]. For the purposes of managing variable irrigation
    rates, two different paradigms of monitoring field-level spatial variability have
    emerged and proved effective: one based on monitoring soil properties and the
    other on monitoring plant conditions [6,14,15]. Hedley and Yule [6] demonstrated
    the potential to reduce irrigation water use by using soil–water balance to inform
    variable-rate irrigation of pre-mapped management zones at two sites in New Zealand.
    Stone et al. [16] demonstrated the potential of similar methods in the humid Eastern
    U.S. Soil-based methods are thought to be superior because they more directly
    measure water-related stress as a function of plant available water content, whereas
    it can be more difficult with plant-based methods to separate the effect of the
    soil moisture property from that of other possible stresses such as nutrient deficiency
    [17,18]. Soil water measurements using soil moisture sensors, however, are only
    accurate for a small area, and soil water content is highly variable spatially
    and temporally [19]. There is evidence that relative spatial variability of soil
    water content is persistent over time, further indicating the feasibility of variable-rate
    irrigation based on management zones [20,21]. Networks of remote soil moisture
    sensors have shown the ability to effectively inform variable-rate irrigation
    and contribute to improvements in irrigation efficiency [6,8,11,15,18]. Though
    the soil moisture sensors themselves perform in-situ measurement of soil properties,
    these networks of sensors are monitored wirelessly by either an automated system
    or a user physically removed from the measurement site. In the past, installation
    of enough soil moisture sensors to capture soil variability has proven costly
    for farmers and has limited technology adoption [22,23]. This technology is getting
    better and more affordable at the same time that unmanned aerial vehicles are
    also becoming more economical for the purposes of plant-based remote sensing.
    Unmanned aircraft can deliver a variety of sensing devices including visual, multispectral,
    and thermal to monitor different aspects of plant health. There is even potential
    in the future for these vehicles to serve as the medium by which important production
    inputs such as seed, fertilizer, and chemical are applied [24]. Though unmanned
    aerial vehicles have not been commonly used in agriculture to this point, the
    Department of Transit and Federal Aviation Administration have recently enacted
    a clear regulatory framework for small unmanned aerial aircraft, and many expect
    this to spur more widespread adoption in commercial uses such as agriculture [25,26].
    We compare the two remote monitoring methods, soil moisture sensors and unmanned
    aerial vehicles, for cost-effectiveness and net return per acre-foot of aquifer
    retention by modeling crop production and groundwater use across a spatially-explicit
    farm landscape in the Delta region of eastern Arkansas. The model evaluates the
    optimal crop mix and irrigation practices to maximize farm returns across the
    gridded farm landscape. Spatial variation in crop yields, aquifer thickness, and
    the costs of groundwater pumping all influence the spatial-dynamic path of optimal
    management [27]. The effectiveness of the remote monitoring methods for enhancing
    profitability and decreased pumping depends on these spatial variations. The area
    for the application of our model encompasses three eight-digit hydrologic unit
    code (HUC) watersheds overlying the Mississippi River Valley alluvial aquifer
    where groundwater levels are critical (Figure 1). Eight-digit HUCs define the
    drainage area of a sub-basin of a river [28]. In addition to remote monitoring
    and variable-rate irrigation, we allow for the construction of on-farm reservoirs
    and tail-water recovery systems to help reduce pumping costs and promote recharge
    of the underlying aquifer. The impacts of remote monitoring and variable-rate
    irrigation are evaluated with and without the presence of reservoirs on the landscape.
    There are also ranges of potential costs and irrigation efficiencies associated
    with these remote monitoring methods, and the implications of these for investment
    in the technologies is considered. In addition, the effectiveness of policies
    that encourage the adoption of the remote monitoring for improved water management
    and aquifer retention is compared to typical fee and quantity policies for conservation.
    We describe the model for the dynamics of land cover, water use, and profit maximization
    in Section 2. Data for crop land and model parameters are presented in Section
    3. Section 4 discusses results and sensitivity analyses. We conclude with a discussion
    of major findings and future research needs. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Methods
    We consider how crop patterns and irrigation use change as a farm collective maximizes
    profits on the landscape over time. The model is then used to evaluate which approach
    to precision irrigation is more cost-effective for reducing groundwater pumping
    or delivers higher net return per acre-foot of aquifer retention. 2.1.1. Land
    Cover The land cover of the farm landscape includes crops, reservoirs, and conserved
    land set aside through a rental program of the government. The chosen crops generate
    economic returns, and irrigation depletes groundwater. The landscape is spatially
    heterogeneous due to differences in long-term investment in farm practices, soil
    types, and access to water resources [29,30,31]. A time horizon T is chosen for
    a single generation of farmers to observe how depletion of the aquifer influences
    production decision, and a grid of m cells (sites) represents spatial differences.
    Major crops on the landscape include rice, irrigated soybean, corn, and cotton,
    non-irrigated sorghum and soybean, and double-cropped irrigated soybean with winter
    wheat. The model tracks acreage across n number of land cover types j, including
    each of the crops, reservoirs that have tail-water recovery, and the U.S. Department
    of Agriculture’s Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). Lijt denotes the amount of
    land (acres) at site i in land cover type j at the end of period t. At the end
    of each period t, which is a 10-year interval, we assume any other land cover
    j can become on-farm reservoirs and tail-water recovery or CRP. A 10-year interval
    is appropriate because we expect crop rotations to emphasize more profitable crops
    over a decade, and this is a typical contract period for CRP land. A profit-maximizing
    farmer may switch land out of irrigated crops into non-irrigated crops with declining
    groundwater availability at the end of each period. The initial land availability
    equals the sum of the land covers chosen for site i at any time t (Equation (1)).
    ∑ 𝑛 𝑗 𝐿 𝑖𝑗𝑡 = ∑ 𝑛 𝑗 𝐿 𝑖𝑗0 , for 𝑗 = crops, CRP, on-farm reservoirs (1) 2.1.2.
    Irrigation The average annual irrigation that crop j receives to supplement precipitation,
    wdj, is the demand for irrigation in acre-feet. The groundwater stored in the
    aquifer beneath site i at the end of the period t is AQit. The water that comes
    from the on-farm reservoirs is RWit, and the water from well pumping is GWit.
    There is recharge of the groundwater, nri, that occurs naturally from precipitation,
    streams, and underlying aquifers each period. Equation (2) shows the acre-feet
    of water stored in an acre reservoir as ( 𝜔 max + 𝜔 min )− 𝜔 max ∑ 𝑛 𝑗 𝐿 𝑖𝑗0 𝐿
    𝑖𝑅𝑡 , (2) which includes 𝐿 𝑖𝑅𝑡 as the acres in reservoirs at time t, and the total
    acreage at site i, ∑ 𝑛 𝑗 𝐿 𝑖𝑗0 . If the reservoir occupies the entire site i and
    only the rainfall fills the reservoir, then the low-end acre-feet of water that
    fills each acre of reservoir is 𝜔 min . If the reservoir is small compared to
    the entire site, then 𝜔 max ∑ 𝑛 𝑗 𝐿 𝑖𝑗0 𝐿 𝑖𝑅𝑡 is close to zero, and the recovery
    of the runoff and rainfall fills the reservoir to near capacity in acre-feet per
    reservoir acre of ( 𝜔 max + 𝜔 min ) . This does not account for temporal variability
    in the evaporation, leakage, and the timing of rainfall within each period, which
    could influence the values of 𝜔 max and 𝜔 min for the reservoir. The intensity
    of well pumping across the landscape influences aquifer depletion variability
    over space. The proportion of the underground flow into the aquifer at site k
    and out of site i when an acre-foot is pumped from a well at site k is pik, which
    depends on the distance and the lateral speed of underground water movement based
    on the soil profiles observed between sites [27]. This means the groundwater that
    leaves site i is ∑ 𝑚 𝑘 𝑝 𝑖𝑘 𝐺 𝑊 𝑘𝑡 . We assume pumps have the same efficiency
    and power units to deliver a fixed amount of water per minute. The water used
    for irrigation must be less than the water available from reservoirs and wells
    (Equation (3)), and Equation (4) indicates the water stored in the reservoirs
    must be greater than the water used from the reservoirs. The aquifer volume in
    the previous period less the spatially weighted proportion of water pumped from
    the surrounding sites plus natural recharge equals the current aquifer volume
    (Equation (5)). The cost of pumping groundwater at a site, GCit, depends on the
    cost to lift an acre-foot of water by one foot, cp, and the initial depth to the
    groundwater, dpi. The depletion of the aquifer volume, (𝐴 𝑄 𝑖0 −𝐴 𝑄 𝑖𝑡 ) , divided
    by the area of the site, ∑ 𝑛 𝑗 𝐿 𝑖𝑗0 , shows how much the depth to the aquifer
    increases. Capital costs per acre-foot for the well, which accounts for new well
    drilling in response to aquifer decline, is cc (Equation (6)). ∑ 𝑛 𝑗=1 𝑤 𝑑 𝑗 𝐿

    ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ (6) 2.1.3. Profit Objective The cost to produce an acre of the crop,
    excluding the irrigation costs caj and the price per conventional unit of the
    crop, is prj and constant in real terms. We assume no productivity growth trend
    for the constant yield of crop j per acre at site i, yij. Excluding the costs
    of irrigation, the net value for crop j is then prjyij − caj per acre. The CRP
    payment per acre to the landowner, prcrpyicrp, with yield normalized to one and
    price is the payment per acre, less the cost to establish and maintain an acre
    of CRP (cacrp) is the net value per acre of CRP. The reservoir pumping cost per
    acre-foot is crw, and the per acre capital and maintenance cost of a reservoir
    each period is cr. We make values over time comparable in monetary terms using
    the real discount factor, 𝛿 𝑡 . Equation (7) indicates the economic objective
    to maximize the present value of farm profits over the fixed horizon T by changing
    the amount of land in each crop or CRP, the reservoir water use, and groundwater
    use, namely Lijt, RWit, and GWit. The fixed horizon T is a 30 years in length,
    and each period is ten years in length. The non-negativity constraints on land,
    water use, and the aquifer are shown in Equation (8). max 𝐿 𝑖𝑗𝑡 ,𝑅 𝑊 𝑖𝑡 ,𝐺 𝑊 𝑖𝑡

    𝑖𝑡 ≥0,𝐴 𝑄 𝑖𝑡 ≥0 (8) and the spatial dynamics of land and irrigation (Equations
    (1)–(6)). We use the non-linear programming solver CONOPT from AKRI Consulting
    and Development to perform the optimization in the Generalized Algebraic Modeling
    System [32]. 2.1.4. Cost-Effectiveness and Net Returns per Acre-Foot of Aquifer
    Retention with Precision Irrigation The cost-effectiveness of aquifer retention
    using precision irrigation is calculated by first finding the difference in the
    present value of costs and the difference in the final aquifer volume between
    the baseline and a model with only the soil moisture sensors or only the unmanned
    aerial vehicles. The baseline model supposes no adoption of soil moisture sensors
    or unmanned aerial vehicles, and this is compared to models with only soil moisture
    sensors or only unmanned aerial vehicles. The division of the difference in the
    present value of costs by the difference in the final aquifer volume indicates
    the cost effectiveness of a particular precision irrigation technique. The net
    returns per acre-foot of aquifer retention come from the division of the difference
    in the present value of net returns by the difference in the final aquifer volume.
    2.1.5. Sensitivity Analyses and Conservation Policies The baseline, soil moisture
    sensors only, and unmanned aerial vehicle only models are then run again with
    on-farm reservoirs on the landscape to see how this changes crop choice, cost-effectiveness,
    and net-benefit assessments. Another sensitivity analysis considers low- and high-range
    costs and water-use efficiencies for each of the crops using either the soil moisture
    sensors or the unmanned aerial vehicles. Policy options for groundwater conservation
    include cost-share for the precision irrigation techniques of soil moisture sensors
    and unmanned aerial vehicles by modifying cajk. Scenarios regulating groundwater
    pumping levels and taxing groundwater pumping cost GC are also compared. The cost
    share is 60% for soil moisture sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles based on the
    rates from similar improvements under the Natural Resource Conservation Service’s
    (NRCS) Agricultural Water Enhancement Program [33]. We chose a regulation on groundwater
    pumping to 220% of initial levels and a fee on groundwater pumping costs of 4%
    to achieve groundwater conservation similar to the cost share on reservoir construction.
    Farm net returns in policy scenarios include the payments to or receipts from
    the government because of the policy. Groundwater conservation cost is calculated
    as the policy cost (baseline farm net returns less the farm net returns plus government
    revenue) divided by the change in aquifer level between the policy option and
    the baseline. All policy scenarios allow for construction of on-farm reservoirs.
    2.2. Data The outer boundary of the study area consists of three eight-digit HUC
    watersheds in the Arkansas Delta region with critical groundwater areas and non-point
    source pollution priorities (Figure 1). These watersheds overlap eleven Arkansas
    counties, and the average for the past 5 years of crop yields by county is a proxy
    for the yield of the crops [29]. We evaluate crop mix and irrigation methods on
    a landscape with spatial heterogeneity by dividing the study area into 2724 sites
    of approximately 600 acres each. At this size, sites approximate farm scale and
    realistically capture the dynamics of the aquifer in response to pumping across
    the landscape. Sites having entirely non-cropland uses in the 2013 Cropland Data
    Layer (CDL), e.g., public lands, water, and urban areas, are removed [34]. The
    initial acreage of rice, corn, cotton, soybeans, and sorghum comes from the 2013
    CDL, and on the basis of harvested acreage for 2010–2011 the soybean acreage is
    split into non-irrigated soybean, irrigated soybean, and double crop soybeans
    (Table 1) [35]. In addition, to account for the time-value of money in the optimization
    of returns over the 30-year period, the yield of the 30-year Treasury Bond over
    the last decade suggests and we employ a real discount rate of 5% [36]. Over the
    last 5 to 10 years the real discount rate is close to 2%, but looking back over
    30 years a 5% discount rate is a better approximation. Table 1. Descriptive statistics
    of the model data across the sites of the study area. 2.2.1. Aquifer Table 1 shows
    the initial depth to the water table and volume of the Alluvial aquifer from the
    Arkansas Natural Resources Commission [31]. The acreage of the site times the
    saturated thickness of the aquifer is the volume of the aquifer at site i. The
    natural recharge, nri, of the Alluvial aquifer is based on a calibrated model
    of recharge for the period 1994 to 1998 associated with precipitation, flow to
    or from streams, and other groundwater fluxes [37]. It is important to note that
    improvements in irrigation efficiency resulting from the use of precision irrigation
    impact both recoverable and irrecoverable fractions of applied irrigation water.
    Some improvement comes in the form of decreased amounts of direct evaporation
    and runoff which directly contributes to groundwater conservation [4,38,39]. This
    is accompanied, however, by decreased amounts of the recoverable fraction of deep
    percolation. The proportions of improved irrigation efficiency attributable to
    recoverable and irrecoverable fractions are not precisely known. Furthermore,
    decision makers in many aquifer systems consider losses to deep percolation to
    be irrecoverable fractions due to the amount of time it takes for water to reach
    a reusable state [3,40,41]. With these facts in mind, we do not consider differences
    in the rate of recoverable deep percolation resulting from precision irrigation
    in our modeled calculations of aquifer levels. The spatial weight (pik) is the
    expected proportion of groundwater that flows underground out of site i into site
    k when an acre-foot of groundwater is pumped from site k, where pik is based on
    the distance between sites i and k, the saturated thickness, and hydraulic conductivity
    of the aquifer [27]. These dynamics dictate how well pumping reduces the aquifer
    beneath the surrounding cells. The aquifer below the well and the aquifer of the
    surrounding sites declines in response to well pumping. Water flows from the aquifer
    of surrounding sites into the site with the cone of depression created by the
    pumped well. The distance from the pumped site and the hydraulic conductivity
    of the aquifer, as described above, influence the volume of the underground flow
    from the surrounding sites. Clark, Westerman and Fugitt [30] use spatially coarse
    pilot points to digitize the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer measured by
    feet per day. The spatial weight depends on the volume of underground flow, and
    this determines how much an acre-foot of water pumped from a well reduces the
    aquifer beneath the surrounding sites. 2.2.2. Farm Production and the On-Farm
    Reservoir and Tail-Water Recovery System The costs of production by crop from
    the 2014 Crop Cost of Production estimates, excluding irrigation, are shown in
    Table 2 [42]. The crop specific irrigation water use comes from the Division of
    Agriculture [29]. The 5-year average of December futures prices for harvest time
    contracts for all crops are used for the crop prices [43]. The sign-ups in Arkansas
    as of March 2015 indicate the CRP payment per acre [44]. Table 2. Value of economic
    and irrigation model parameters. Variable irrigation costs from wells or reservoirs
    include fuel, lube and oil, irrigation labor, and poly pipe for furrow irrigation
    plus the levee gates for the flood irrigation of rice [45]. The fuel cost per
    acre-foot of groundwater depends on the fuel needed to raise water from the aquifer,
    which depends on the depth to the aquifer and the efficiency of the pump, gear-head,
    and motor. The groundwater pump is assumed to deliver 1800 gallons per minute
    and the stationary re-lift pump for the reservoir and tail-water recovery system
    to deliver 2000 gallons per minute [45]. The range in diesel use for a well is
    13 gallons of diesel per acre foot for a 100 foot well to 26 gallons of diesel
    per acre foot for a 200 foot well, and 6 gallons of diesel is needed per acre-foot
    for pumping water to and from the reservoir [29]. To account for the oil and lube
    for irrigation equipment, we add 10% to the fuel cost of $3.77 per gallon of diesel
    fuel [46]. To calculate a capital cost per acre-foot pumped, the capital cost
    of the irrigation equipment is amortized, and this is divided by the acre-feet
    pumped from the well [45]. These technologies and costs characterize the conventional
    irrigation methods of our baseline scenario. On-farm reservoir/tail-water recovery
    construction and maintenance costs for various reservoir sizes were estimated
    using Modified Arkansas Off-Stream Reservoir Analysis (MARORA) to obtain capital
    cost estimates [47]. Since a majority of the construction cost for a reservoir
    rests on the cost to move one cubic yard of soil, this cost was updated from $1
    per cubic yard to $1.2 per cubic yard to reflect changes in fuel cost. The remainder
    of the investment and maintenance cost comes from MARORA estimates and includes
    re-lift pumps for moving water from the tail-water pit to the reservoir and from
    the reservoir to the field. The reservoir and tail-water recovery system capital
    cost is amortized to annual per acre payments. The minimum volume of water (ωmin)
    an acre reservoir will hold comes from the tail-water recovery system collecting
    rainfall alone to fill a reservoir by 1.4 acre-feet of water [48]. The maximum
    capacity accounting for evaporation of 11 acre-feet per acre is based on irrigation
    runoff supplementing the rainfall runoff [47]. 2.2.3. Production Cost and Water
    Use Factors for Remote Monitoring Technologies Model scenarios involving precision
    irrigation technologies require adjustment factors for production cost and water
    use. Table 3 reports these factors by crop type. In addition to a baseline scenario,
    adjustment factors are provided for sensitivity analyses involving low and high
    cost and water use scenarios. Water use improvements resulting from soil moisture
    sensor-informed variable-rate irrigation were taken from LaRue [15], who conducted
    field experiments to determine the benefits of variable-rate irrigation relative
    to applying uniform irrigation amounts. Hedley et al. [7] and Hedley, Yule, and
    Bradbury [9] also observed comparable water savings over several years using similar
    methods. The adjustment factor for water use in the baseline scenario draws from
    these experimental results, while the high and low adjustment factors used for
    sensitivity analysis come from discussion in Hedley et al. [49]. The soil moisture
    sensor network and variable-rate system used in the field experiments were similar
    to Vories et al. [50], and costs associated with these methods were gathered from
    several sources and used to calculate additional per-acre production costs associated
    with the soil moisture sensors. Production cost adjustment factors were calculated
    separately for each of the crop types. Soil mapping is necessary for delineating
    management zones, and services are available for approximately $4.00 per acre
    [51,52,53,54]. An interval of five years is used for the re-delineation of management
    zones. The network of soil moisture sensors costs approximately $8400 for a farm
    similar in size to a single grid cell (600 acres) in our modeled study area, while
    a digital data logger costs approximately $1300, and both may need replacing approximately
    every five years [55]. Costs for a retrofitted variable-rate irrigation system
    approximate $50,000 for a farm of grid cell size, and it is assumed to last the
    entire thirty years of the study period [56]. Capital costs were amortized and
    all additional production costs calculated on an annual per-acre basis in present
    value terms, allowing for easy calculation of adjustment factors for production
    costs. Table 3. Value of production cost and irrigation efficiency factors. The
    same retrofitted variable-rate system is used with the scenario of precision irrigation
    informed by unmanned aerial vehicles monitoring plant conditions. The application
    of unmanned aerial vehicles for precision management through mapping crop water
    stress has been demonstrated [57,58,59,60,61]. Because unmanned aerial vehicles
    can monitor plant conditions with a high degree of spatial resolution—as opposed
    to the limited point measurements of soil moisture sensors—soil mapping is not
    a necessary cost associated with this practice. The use of unmanned vehicles for
    mapping water stress depends on unmanned fixed-wing aircraft equipped with GPS,
    autopilot, and appropriate sensing devices. The platform used in modeling this
    scenario is described in Ireland-Otto et al. [62]. It is a X-8 fixed-wing craft
    with a ground control station and launcher ($12,000). A thermal infrared sensor
    ($3500) mounted under the aircraft is necessary to monitor water stress. Aircraft
    and sensor replacement are assumed at ten years. Some data processing is required
    to apply monitoring data to variable-rate irrigation, at an annual cost of $0.20
    per acre. Automated closed-loop programs that include data processing are likely
    to emerge in the near future, so costs are likely to change. Peters and Evett
    [14] demonstrated the automation of variable-rate irrigation using the Temperature-Time-Threshold
    (TTT) method of plant monitoring to determine water stress and compared results
    with those of soil moisture sensor monitoring methods. The TTT method was not
    quite as water efficient as the soil moisture sensing method. Based on the relative
    water-use efficiencies for increasing yield observed by Peters and Evett [14]
    (TTT = 0.909 kg dry biomass/m3 irrigation water, SMS = 0.961 kg dry biomass/m3
    irrigation water), a water-use adjustment factor for each crop was calculated
    for the precision irrigation scenario informed by unmanned aerial vehicle monitoring.
    Because production cost and water use adjustment factor parameters have been populated
    with data collected under different irrigation and cropping systems than we observe
    and model in the Arkansas Delta, sensitivity analyses considering low- and high-range
    costs and water-use efficiencies are particularly helpful to the cost-effectiveness
    comparison (Table 3). 3. Results Table 4 indicates the results of the baseline
    model without precision irrigation or reservoirs. The relative prices over the
    last 5 years make rice and corn the predominant crops on the landscape at the
    end of the study period (Figure 2a), and both are irrigation intensive crops.
    This makes the aquifer decline from 76 million acre-feet to 48.2 million acre-feet
    in 2045, and the 30-year farm net returns are $5.22 billion. We compare these
    results with a landscape where farms adopt soil moisture sensors or unmanned aerial
    vehicles to reduce the costly application of irrigation water. The use of soil
    moisture sensors increases the amount of land in rice from 305 thousand acres
    to 343 thousand acres, and most of the rice acreage adopts soil moisture sensors
    to mitigate irrigation costs (Figure 2b). The increase in rice acreage is accompanied
    by a decline in corn, cotton, soybean, and non-irrigated sorghum acres. Although
    rice acreage expands, the soil moisture sensors mean less well pumping, and the
    aquifer in the final period is close to 48.7 million acre-feet. Figure 2d,e depicts
    the extent of precision irrigation adoption under each scenario. Figure 2. Predominant
    crops grown on the landscape in: (a) the baseline (No SMS and no UAV); and with
    precision irrigation using (b) soil moisture sensors (SMS); or (c) unmanned aerial
    vehicles (UAV). Non-irrigated crops and precision irrigated rice replace corn
    when remote sensing techniques are adopted. The percent of cropland using precision
    irrigation is shown when the remote sensing technique is: (d) soil moisture sensors;
    and (e) unmanned aerial vehicles. The percentage of precision irrigated cropland
    is higher in the northern and western sections of the landscape where the aquifer
    is more depleted. Table 4. Influence of precision irrigation on land and water
    use in 2045, and 30-year economic returns without and with on-farm reservoirs.
    The use of unmanned aerial vehicles increases rice acreage to only 316 thousand
    acres because of the lower irrigation efficiency compared to soil moisture sensors,
    and much of the rice remains in conventional irrigation. There is a slight decline
    in the acres of corn, cotton, double crop soybean, and non-irrigated sorghum compared
    to the baseline (Figure 2c). The final aquifer volume is 48.6 million acre-feet,
    slightly lower than the 48.7 million acre-feet with the soil moisture sensors,
    but higher than the 48.2 million acre-feet baseline. The soil moisture sensors
    have greater net returns per acre-foot conserved than the unmanned aerial vehicles,
    $9.09 per acre-foot versus $7.69 per acre-foot, because high-value rice acreage
    increases more with the soil sensors. The soil moisture sensor technology is more
    expensive per acre, though, and this makes it a less cost-effective solution for
    aquifer retention than the unmanned aerial vehicles. The positive net returns
    indicate that both farmers and conservationists gain from the technologies. Though
    the utility of unmanned aerial vehicles for precision management through mapping
    crop water stress has been demonstrated [57,58,59,60,61], and plant-based monitoring
    of water stress to automate variable-rate irrigation has shown the ability to
    improve irrigation water use [14], systematic and multidisciplinary research is
    still necessary to verify and quantify improvements from managing crop inputs
    based on images from unmanned aerial vehicles [61,65]. The presence of on-farm
    reservoirs and tail-water recovery increases the land in rice and corn compared
    to the baseline, and the non-irrigated sorghum is nearly gone. When the soil moisture
    sensors are adopted on the landscape rice increases to 390 thousand acres, corn
    falls to 672 thousand acres, and the acres in both non-irrigated crop and in reservoirs
    falls. The aquifer level in the final period rises to 50.4 million acre-feet from
    50.2 million acre-feet without the soil moisture sensors. If unmanned aerial vehicles
    are adopted on the landscape with reservoirs, then the rice acres rise slightly
    to 357 thousand acres, and the corn acres fall to 678 thousand acres. The acres
    in reservoirs and non-irrigated sorghum are virtually unchanged from the landscape
    with reservoirs but without the unmanned aerial vehicles. The aquifer volume increased
    slightly over the baseline with 50.3 million acre-feet in the final period. The
    net returns per acre-foot are higher for the precision irrigation when reservoirs
    are used on the landscape. This is because more crops use irrigation when reservoirs
    provide surface water. The farm returns to irrigation that is more efficient and
    the aquifer retention are magnified by precision irrigation when more of the landscape
    is using irrigation than before. The net returns per acre are $62 per acre-foot
    for the soil moisture sensors and $31 per acre-foot for the unmanned aerial vehicles.
    Looking only at cost-effectiveness for an acre-foot of aquifer retention, though,
    the unmanned aerial vehicles are preferred since the technology is somewhat less
    expensive. The cost and irrigation efficiency of the soil moisture sensors and
    unmanned aerial vehicles is not known with certainty. We use a low and high-end
    range for the cost and irrigation efficiency of the precision irrigation technologies
    to see how crop choice, well pumping, and the farm net returns are affected in
    Table 5. For the soil moisture sensors, rice expands to 452 thousand acres for
    the low cost/high irrigation efficiency scenario while the high cost/low irrigation
    efficiency scenario has rice expand to just 331 thousand acres. The large expansion
    of rice in the low cost/high irrigation efficiency scenario makes corn and other
    crop acreage fall compared to the baseline, and even though more irrigation intensive
    rice is grown, the well pumping falls to 1422 thousand acre-feet in the final
    period because the soil moisture sensors increase irrigation efficiency. The crop
    mix in the high cost/low irrigation efficiency scenario for the soil moisture
    sensors is largely the same as the landscape without the soil moisture sensors.
    The well pumping, though, does fall from the baseline to 1433 thousand acre-feet
    in the final period because of soil moisture sensor adoption. Table 5. Sensitivity
    analysis of the costs and irrigation efficiency of precision irrigation on land
    and water use in 2045, and 30-year economic returns. These crop and water use
    changes on the landscape from the soil moisture sensor use make the 30-year farm
    net returns edge up slightly with the high cost/low irrigation efficiency scenario
    and go up substantially to $5.40 billion in the low cost/high irrigation efficiency
    scenario. The aquifer rises to 50.2 million acre-feet in the low cost/high irrigation
    efficiency scenario and to just 48.6 million acre-feet in the high cost/low irrigation
    efficiency scenario. The net-benefit assessment indicates $90 per acre-foot if
    the soil moisture sensors are low cost and high efficiency, and a modest $8.57
    per acre-foot for high cost and low efficiency sensors. This means there is a
    wide range of potential net returns to an optimized landscape allowing the use
    of soil moisture sensors, but implementation that more closely approximates the
    low cost/high irrigation efficiency scenario can generate substantial gains to
    both farmers and the aquifer. The use of unmanned aerial vehicles makes the rice
    acreage expand to 430 thousand acres in the low cost/high irrigation efficiency
    scenario but fall slightly to 304 thousand acres in the high cost/low irrigation
    efficiency scenario. The low cost/high irrigation efficiency scenario for unmanned
    aerial vehicles has 1338 thousand acre-feet of well pumping in the final period
    because the unmanned aerial vehicles allow for a reduction in water use even as
    rice acres expand. There are 1437 thousand acre-feet of well pumping in the final
    period for the high cost/low efficiency scenario, only slightly below the baseline,
    because there is limited adoption of the unmanned aerial vehicles when the irrigation
    efficiency is low. The aquifer rises to 49.7 million acre-feet and 30-year farm
    net returns rise to $5.3 billion in the low cost/high efficiency scenario; however,
    the aquifer rises to only 48.4 million acre-feet and $5.2 billion in 30-year farm
    net returns for the high cost/low irrigation efficiency scenario. The wide range
    in the net returns per acre-foot for the low and high-end scenarios, from $70
    to $5.55 per acre-foot, for the unmanned aerial vehicles indicates, as for the
    soil sensors, that improving the efficiency of the technology is valuable for
    profitability and aquifer retention. The use of cost-share assistance to encourage
    precision irrigation, shown in Table 6, improves farm net returns over 30 years
    and increases the volume of the aquifer, but the subsidy represents a loss of
    government revenue that the taxpayer must bear. The policies result in a loss
    of economic value to society because the rise in farm net returns is less than
    the loss in government revenue. However, these polices allow more of the aquifer
    to be retained. The groundwater conservation cost per acre-foot for the study
    period is found by dividing the economic cost to society of the policy by the
    acre-feet of the aquifer conserved. The soil moisture sensors are more irrigation-efficient
    and only slightly more expensive than the unmanned aerial vehicles, and this makes
    the $59 groundwater conservation cost per acre-foot for the cost-share on the
    soil moisture sensors less than the $67 cost per acre-foot for the unmanned aerial
    vehicles. The cost-share policies are both expensive, however, compared to the
    groundwater conservation cost associated with policies such as a cap on groundwater
    use ($12/acre-foot) or a fee on groundwater use ($1.6 acre-foot). Policies that
    target groundwater use directly through a cap or tax appear more cost-effective
    at groundwater conservation than the policies that offer a cost-share on irrigation
    technology for crops such as cotton and soybeans that are not especially irrigation
    intensive. Table 6. Water conservation policies influence on aquifer, and economic
    returns, government revenue, and groundwater conservation cost. 4. Discussion
    Our results support the conclusion that remote monitoring to inform variable-rate
    irrigation practices is an increasingly viable alternative for reducing groundwater
    depletion through precision agriculture. We demonstrate that remote monitoring
    to inform variable-rate irrigation can improve irrigation efficiency modestly
    enough to conserve aquifer volumes, reduce pumping costs, and increase net returns
    by still allowing for more production of profitable but water-intensive rice.
    Furthermore, our results indicate the potential of remote monitoring and variable-rate
    irrigation to provide benefits in tandem with other complimentary practices such
    as the use of the on-farm reservoirs. The uncertainty around the cost and water-use
    efficiency of the remote sensing techniques suggest that the net-returns per acre-foot
    of aquifer retention could be significantly larger or a little lower than the
    baseline costs and water use efficiencies for the precision irrigation techniques
    suggest. As the costs of the sensors fall and the efficiencies continue to improve,
    then the net returns per acre-foot of conserved aquifer promise to become substantially
    larger. As an important reminder, our model makes the simplifying assumption that
    all reduction in applied water due to improved irrigation efficiency saves irrecoverable
    fractions of applied irrigation water. While the overwhelming proportion of annual
    recharge to the alluvial aquifer is the result of precipitation and surface water
    flux [37], precision irrigation scenarios may overestimate the aquifer volume
    by failing to account for decreased levels of deep percolation over the long term.
    A cost-share policy to encourage more adoption of the sensing technologies appears
    to incur greater costs on society than either a regulatory cap of groundwater
    use or tax on groundwater use. Leaving aside issues surrounding an equitable share
    of the conservation burden across the agricultural producers and the rest of society,
    the most efficient approach to conservation is through directly targeting the
    overused resource with a cap or a tax. The evaluation of benefits and costs here
    between soil moisture sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles only considers increased
    performance in irrigation efficiency with respect to soil-based versus plant-based
    monitoring regimes. We do not consider other benefits of variable-rate irrigation
    or other applications of remote monitoring which might present other benefits.
    Another implication of targeted spatial application of irrigation is that nutrient
    and sediment runoff is minimized, improving the quality of surface waters [66].
    In addition, it may be possible to monitor a range of other plant conditions with
    unmanned aerial vehicles at little additional cost that are not able to be measured
    by wireless soil moisture sensors [24]. Explicit spatial management of other crop
    conditions might even allow farmers to realize more fully the benefits of high
    spatial resolution monitoring. For instance, producers may be able to improve
    the efficiency of nutrient application and uptake in a way that both lowers costs
    and increases yield. Although many farms may already have spatial soil information,
    we do not know how many have this information or how many use any form of precision
    agriculture. To be conservative in the adoption rates of this technology, we attribute
    all the costs of this spatial soil information to the soil sensors. To the extent
    most farmers already have this information, the soil moisture sensors will be
    more profitable than we have indicated. The soil sensor technologies resemble
    a constant return to scale technology more than other irrigation equipment like
    center pivots or on-farm reservoirs. This is because soil sensors only have a
    particular spatial radius where they are effective. However, the unmanned aerial
    vehicle technologies do exhibit economies of scale, and the unquestionable improvement
    in these technologies is likely to further increase consolidation in the farming
    sector. The average farm size in the region has risen from 750 acres in 2002 to
    820 acres in 2012 [35]. Improved sensing technologies are likely to augment this
    trend. As costs associated with unmanned aerial vehicles or their services decrease
    and monitoring applications increase, the aircraft are likely to surpass soil
    moisture sensors in terms of both cost-effectiveness of aquifer savings and net
    returns. Given that the most attractive policy alternative among the farming community
    also comes at the greatest cost to society, it may be that widespread implementation
    of one of these practices depends on a continued drop in costs. Future work should
    continue to explore the role of precision technology and high-resolution monitoring
    in agriculture by giving needed attention to adapting best practices to region-specific
    constraints. Toward this goal, it will be important to continue to characterize
    the benefits and costs of these applications under different environmental and
    economic conditions. Acknowledgments The authors received support for this study

  description: Currently, 80% of the world's available fresh water resource is used
    for irrigated agriculture. Growers usually try to ensure profitable crop production
    rather than considering possible environmental impacts, which can lead to misjudgement
    of the plant's actual needs and result in under- or over-irrigation. To understand
    how manual watering influences soil water status, soil moisture sensors were deployed
    in a representative commercial nursery. By automatically scheduling irrigation
    according to soil moisture thresholds, this work tries to understand the effects
    of deficit irrigation (under-irrigation ' applying less than full water requirements)
    on possible growth regulation through changes in leaf water status, gas exchange
    and plant hormone balance. Tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum Mill. 'Ailsa Craig')
    were grown in a peat-based substrate in a controlled environment, and exposed
    to different irrigation treatments by varying the number of drippers in the pot
    (1 water deficit, 2 control). Hand-watering in a commercial nursery resulted in
    significant variation in soil water content that may compromise crop uniformity
    and quality. In contrast, feedback regulation of irrigation via soil moisture
    monitoring provides a useful tool to water plants according to their actual water
    needs, with significantly less variation in soil moisture. Under-irrigating containerised
    tomato plants significantly reduced evapotranspiration, crop fresh weight, height
    and leaf area and decreased leaf water potential and stomatal conductance. Although
    foliar concentrations of the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) varied throughout
    the treatment period, ethylene emission from shoot increased. However, the role
    of these plant hormones during water deficit requires further experimentation
    using mutants deficient in these hormones. Although deficit irrigation as applied
    here limited tomato vegetative growth, further long-term experiments (that measure
    fruit yield) are needed to evaluate whether automatic irrigation scheduling can
    be used as a water-saving technique.

  description: Many agricultural activities can be highly enhanced by using digital
    technologies. One of these activities is the regulation of the quantity of water
    in cultivated fields, a process which is directly interwoven with the sustainability
    and the productivity of crops, since insufficient or excessive irrigation may
    not only be obstructive, but also destructive. This paper proposes a scheme based
    on the collaboration of an integrated system for automated irrigation management
    with an advanced novel routing protocol for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), named
    ECHERP (Equalized Cluster Head Election Routing Protocol). At its core, the proposed
    system aims at efficiently managing water supply in cultivated fields in an automated
    way. The system takes into consideration the historical data and the change on
    the climate values to calculate the quantity of water that is needed for irrigation.
    In case that the change on the collected values is above a threshold more frequent
    data collection is proposed to minimize the necessary quantity of water. On the
    other hand, in case that the change of the values is below a preset threshold
    then the time interval to collect data can increase to save sensor energy, leading
    to a prolonged sensor lifetime. The results show that network lifetime using ECHERP
    is improved up to 1825. min and if a round is 110. s the model provides energy
    efficiency using smaller water quantities.

    Efficiency 1. Introduction Agriculture plays a vital role in the economy and,
    in many cases, in the survival of nations, since it provides the basic subsistence
    for the entire population of a country while at the same time it interacts with
    several other industries. Especially in rural areas, inhabitants depend on agriculture
    as it is critical not only for their nutrition but it also constitutes the base
    of all trade. Moreover, the ever increasing world population demands larger amounts
    of food which subsequently presupposes a well-managed and cost-effective agriculture.
    Throughout the world, irrigation is one of the main water consumers. Almost 60
    percent of all the world water, taken from rivers, lakes, reservoirs, and wells,
    is used for the irrigation of. Without irrigation, crops would never have been
    grown in the deserts of California and Israel. Irrigation has been around for
    as long as humans have been cultivating plants. Even though the traditional way
    of pouring water on fields is still a common irrigation method, other more efficient
    and mechanized, methods are also used. One of the more popular mechanized methods
    is the centre-pivot irrigation system, which uses moving spray guns or dripping
    faucet heads on wheeled tubes that pivot around a central source of water. There
    are many irrigation techniques farmers use today, since there is always a need
    to find more efficient ways to use water for irrigation. Producers need to find
    more effective and efficient use of water resources while maintaining high crop
    yields. Some efforts to more efficiently utilize water for crop production are
    examined, Producers has to find more effective and efficient use of water resources
    while maintaining high crop yields. While the producers have to apply water to
    meet the needs of the crop, they must realize that with traditional management
    practices, yields and returns from the irrigated crop will be reduced as compared
    to a fully irrigated crop. Moreover, to properly manage the water for the greatest
    return, producers must have an understanding of how crops respond to water, how
    crop rotations can enhance irrigation management, and how changes in agronomic
    practices can influence the water needs. Water stress during critical times may
    result in low yields. Crops, such as corn, respond with more yields for every
    inch of water that the crop consumes as compared to other crops such as winter
    wheat or soybeans. However, crops, such as corn require more water for development
    or maintenance before any yield is produced. Corn requires approximately 10 in.
    of water to produce the first increment of yield as compared to 4.5 and 7.5 in.
    for wheat and soybeans respectively. The integration of automated procedures in
    agriculture increases the productivity as well as the quality of the products,
    thus fulfilling the ever increasing demand for healthy and inexpensive food around
    the world. However, an efficient automated system has to describe all the main
    processes that are involved in the agriculture chain. Plant cultivation, which
    can be considered as the most critical process, is affected by many factors such
    as the temperature, the humidity and the topography of the surrounding environment.
    Achieving ideal values for these factors and optimizing their consequences depend
    on the type of the crops cultivated. Thus, the design of an efficient irrigation
    system should consider these factors to achieve a successful and high quality
    harvest. For example, the process of grape maturation is affected by the photo-synthesis
    that produces the sugar that is stored in the grapes. In grapes, the balance among
    sugar, acid, pH and potassium is fundamental in determining the quality of the
    produced wine. This balance depends to a large extent on the frequency of the
    irrigation of the cultivated fields. The scientific discipline of Wireless Sensor
    Networks (WSNs) has reached a point of maturity that it can provide accurate and
    highly effective services to farmers. Thus, WSNs should monitor the above described
    factors to achieve an improved harvest (Shu-ming et al., 2009). WSNs are able
    to rapidly capture process and transmit critical data in real time. The real-time
    data collected by sensors located in the cultivated fields may be used by experts
    or by automated systems to make decisions, such as which irrigation policy should
    be applied. Additionally, since a WSN does not require the deployment of wires,
    the need for human intervention is minimized. For these reasons, it is expected
    that WSNs will become a low cost yet effective approach for the monitoring of
    fields in the near future. Additionally, WSNs can be combined with a system that
    manages the water applied to each field based on the environmental conditions
    and on the feedback sent by the individual sensors. There are several advantages
    in using WSNs and automated decision systems in agriculture: • Improved estimation
    and planning of field irrigation based on the available water supply. • Minimization
    of the required human resources, time, and effort in the agricultural production.
    • Early detection of possible floods in the field that could be destructive for
    the crops and proper pumping of the water to mitigate such cases. • Better coordination
    between different working groups, i.e. farmers and technical assistants thanks
    to a clear division of responsibilities. • Creation of knowledge gathered from
    the deployed sensor networks for future applications in the agriculture domain.
    All the irrigation models that have been proposed so far do not use an agriculture
    model to calculate the quantity of water for irrigation. Moreover, they use WSNs
    to collect data from the area without considering the routing of data from the
    sensors to the base station, a technique that could provide improved energy efficiency.
    In this paper, we propose a system that takes into consideration the historical
    data and the change of the climate values to calculate the quantity of water that
    is needed for irrigation. In case that the change of the collected values is above
    a threshold more frequent data collection is proposed to be performed to minimize
    the necessary quantity of water. On the other hand, in case that the change of
    the values is below a preset threshold then the time interval to collect the data
    can increase to save sensor energy, leading to a prolonged sensor lifetime. In
    this paper an integrated architecture, based on the use of WSNs, for automated
    irrigation management is proposed that aims to achieve effective and prompt irrigation
    of parcels with great energy efficiency due to the utilization of a novel routing
    protocol. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the related work is
    presented. Section 3, describes the structure of the proposed system. Section
    4, presents the performance evaluation. In Section 5, the paper is concluded and
    areas of future work are presented. 2. Related work The work in the area of WSNs
    in agriculture is composed of two parts. The first part deals with the routing
    protocol used to minimize the energy consumption in WSNs, while the second part
    addresses the development of irrigation systems in agriculture that manage the
    water used for irrigation. 2.1. Energy efficient routing algorithms in WSNs There
    exist several proposals to develop protocols that consider the energy efficiency
    of sensors in their routing activities. In hierarchical networks, nodes are organized
    in clusters in which a node plays the role of a cluster head. The cluster head
    is responsible for coordinating activities within the cluster and for forwarding
    information between clusters. Clustering has the potential to reduce energy consumption
    and to extend the lifetime of the network, by achieving a high delivery ratio
    in a scalable manner. In agriculture, the network used may be rather large since
    it needs to cover the entire cultivated fields. Therefore, the hierarchical protocols
    may be suitable and beneficial for precision agriculture. In (Heinzelman et al.,
    2000) LEACH, a hierarchical protocol in which most nodes transmit to cluster heads,
    is presented. The operation of LEACH consists of two phases: • The Setup Phase.
    In the setup phase, the clusters are organized and the cluster heads are selected.
    Each node determines whether it will become a cluster head in this round by using
    a stochastic algorithm at each round. If a node becomes a cluster head once, it
    cannot become cluster head again after P rounds, where P is the desired percentage
    of cluster heads. • The Steady State Phase. In the steady state phase, the data
    is sent to the base station. The duration of the steady state phase is longer
    than the duration of the setup phase in order to minimize overhead. LEACH is a
    wireless distributed protocol that helps WSNs to use less energy. However, LEACH
    uses single-hop routing where each node can transmit directly to the cluster-head
    and the sink. Therefore, it is not recommended for networks that are deployed
    in large regions. PEGASIS is an energy efficient protocol (Lindsey and Raghavendra,
    2002) using a chain-based protocol and providing an improvement over LEACH. In
    PEGASIS each node communicates only with a nearby neighbour in order to send and
    receive data. It also takes turns (cluster head transmit after collecting data
    from all the nodes) transmitting to the base station, thus reducing the amount
    of energy spent per round. The nodes are organized in such a way as to form a
    chain, which can either be accomplished by the sensor nodes themselves, using
    a greedy algorithm starting from a certain node, or the Base Station (BS) can
    compute this chain and broadcast it to all the sensor nodes. TEEN is a hierarchical
    protocol designed for sudden changes in the sensed attributes, such as sudden
    drops in temperature due to frost (Manjeshwar and Agrawal, 2009). Responsiveness
    is an important attribute of time-critical applications, in which the network
    is operated in a reactive mode. The sensor network architecture in TEEN is based
    on a hierarchical grouping where closer nodes form clusters and this process goes
    to a higher level until the sink is reached. Even though TEEN works well in conditions
    like sudden changes in the sensed attributes, in large area networks and when
    the number of layers in the hierarchy is small, TEEN tends to consume a lot of
    energy, because of long distance transmissions. Moreover, when the number of layers
    increases, the transmissions become shorter and the overhead in the setup phase
    as well as in the operation becomes dominant. In (Lotf et al., 2008), a routing
    protocol for self-configuration and hierarchal routing, named ELCH, is presented.
    In this protocol, the sensors vote for their neighbours to elect suitable cluster
    heads. It combines the cluster architecture with multi-hop routing for the reduction
    of the total transmission energy. The above approaches take into consideration
    the energy consumption of the sensors in order to extend the lifetime of the network.
    However, since they are general purpose networks they do not take into account
    the principles, characteristics and requirements of the specific application that
    sensor networks are used for. All the aforementioned protocols try to minimize
    the energy consumption. However, they differ on the algorithm used. Most of these
    algorithms are based on the selection of the node having the higher residual energy
    in every cluster as the cluster head for the next round. Although, this consideration
    seems to be quite rational, there are many cases where its effectiveness is limited.
    For instance, in the cases where the node having the higher energy residues is
    positioned close to the border line of its cluster, significant amounts of energy
    are spent by the cluster nodes in order to transmit to their cluster head. 2.2.
    Automated irrigation in agriculture WSNs have been used for the automated irrigation
    of parcels (Rehman et al., 2011). These applications address the scarcity of water
    problem and the need of proper water management. This is achieved by providing
    water only to places where it is needed, while at the same time controlling the
    quantity of the consumed water. Various models, systems and methodologies for
    the irrigation of parcels have been developed. In (Diaz et al., 2011) a methodology
    to guide the development of applications for the agricultural domain based on
    WSNs is presented. This methodology divides the development of applications in
    agriculture in steps that gets an input, produces an output, and describes the
    procedures to be undertaken by a specific group of users. Specifically, the purpose
    of this methodology is to describe the life cycle of applications by identifying
    the responsibilities of the individual users. In (Stone et al., 1985), a computer-based
    monitoring system for continuous measurements of soil water potential is proposed
    and analyzed. This model measures the quantity of water during a period. The results
    are used to decide the quantity of water to be used for irrigation. Indirect estimates
    using direct measurements of the soil moisture are discussed in Zazueta and Smajstrla
    (1992). In this model the measurements of time in samples are used to estimate
    the quantity of water that is required for irrigation. Moreover, in Meron et al.
    (1995) a control system for apple tree irrigation management using densitometers
    is presented. In this model the water required for irrigation is measured using
    a soil sensor-actuated automatic irrigation system. Sensor actuation thresholds
    are optimized for high fruit yield and quality. In (Testezlaf et al., 1997) an
    automated irrigation control system for the management of greenhouse container
    plants is evaluated. The system consisted of soil moisture sensors, a hardware
    input/output interface, a computer with the relevant software and actuators. An
    evaluation of the control system is performed considering a greenhouse. The results
    show that the control system is reliable in applying water responding to the plant
    demands. Reliable measurements of the substrate water tension using sensors presented
    a major difficulty. In (Kim and Evans, 2009) the design of decision support software
    and its integration with an in-field WSN to implement site-specific sprinkler
    irrigation control via Bluetooth wireless communications is described. This model
    consists of machine conversion, localization, and mission planning. The first
    requirement is to convert a self-propelled irrigation machine from a conventional
    mechanical and hydraulic system to an electronically controllable system for individual
    sprinkler head control. Then, the geographic location of the irrigation machine
    is continuously monitored by a self-positioning system. Once the machine is controllable
    and accessible, mission planning decide the time to irrigate that each sprinkler
    head should apply at each location. In (Sudha et al., 2011), a TDMA-based medium
    access control (MAC) protocol is used to collect environmental data such as soil
    moisture and temperature of an irrigation system. The sensors are in the idle
    state and change to the active state to measure the temperature and the moisture
    level of the soil. The base station sends requests to nodes to collect the temperature
    and the moisture level of a particular area. A node responds to this request by
    sending back the present value of the moisture and the temperature of that region.
    The other nodes remain in the idle state. After sending the required data the
    node goes back to the idle state. This process is repeated for all the nodes.
    In using a direct communication method each sensor node sends its data directly
    to the base station. In addition to the above, there also exist some recent attempts
    to develop remote sensing and control systems for irrigation management using
    WSNs. In (Kim et al., 2008), a remote sensing and control of an irrigation system
    using a distributed WSN is described. The field conditions are monitored by sensor
    stations distributed across the field based on a soil property map, and they are
    periodically sampled and wirelessly transmitted to a base station. In (Xiaohong
    et al., 2009), a water-saving irrigation system based on fuzzy control technology
    and WSN is described. The node takes the soil moisture error and error change
    rate as its input and obtains the water demand amount of the crops under certain
    soil moisture conditions. In (Dubey et al.., 2011), a WSN based remote irrigation
    control system and automation using dual tone multi frequency (DTMF) code is described.
    The system uses signalling to control the water flow for sectored, sprinkler or
    drip section irrigation. In (Zhang et al., 2011), a calibration method for detecting
    soil water content based on information sharing is described. The system is an
    efficacious approach to determine the balance between the calibration accuracy
    of moisture sensor and the investment of agricultural production. All these attempts
    propose systems that are able to provide irrigation services to parcels without
    considering in depth the efficient management of the water used. 3. Overview of
    the proposed system The proposed system considers climate values, such as humidity,
    temperature and wind to calculate the quantity of water that is needed for proper
    irrigation. Also, when evaluating the climate parameters it considers past states
    and compares them to the current states to make efficient decisions. For example,
    if the value of the temperature in the previous day has decreased then less water
    is required. Based on the collected historical values the quantity required might
    be larger. Thus, water can be conserved in case of a high rate of change of these
    environmental values. The total complexity of the model is 2n + n, where n is
    the number of nodes in the cluster. The proposed automated irrigation management
    system, as mentioned above, aims at the automatic irrigation of parcels with possibly
    non-uniform composition like the one shown in Fig. 1, which comprises of five
    neighbouring parcels having different crops. Download : Download full-size image
    Fig. 1. Neighbouring parcels hosting different kinds of crops. The proposed automated
    irrigation management system comprises of two subsystems. The first subsystem
    concerns the WSN which collects the data from the cultivated fields, as shown
    in Fig. 2a. The second subsystem involves the decision making system, the flow
    chart of which is depicted in Fig. 2b. Download : Download full-size image Fig.
    2. (a) The proposed WSN architecture, (b) the flow chart of the proposed decision
    making system. The proposed WSN structure includes a set of sensors that monitor
    the humidity and the temperature of soil, the humidity, the temperature and the
    speed of air, and the duration of sunshine hours per day. The individual sensors
    are placed at appropriate locations in the parcels. The collected information
    is transmitted to a base station. More specifically, the sensors at the field
    scan the weather conditions periodically (for example every 10 s). The collected
    data are sent via wireless (for example, a ZigBee radio transmitter) to the base
    computer at the receiver. The sensors are self-powered by a battery. A set of
    sensors is used to measure air humidity and temperature. Also humidity sensors
    are used to measure soil moisture content and wind speed. Moreover, specialized
    sensors are used to measure the flooding water levels. The main application is
    based on the collected inputs it receives from the sensors. It then, acts based
    on the configuration that is applied to the system. This configuration is based
    on the requirements for the place that needs to be monitored. This is related
    to the type of crops that are planted in the field (corn, potatoes, etc.), the
    chemical soil components (i.e. sodium content) and the season of the year (i.e.
    winter, summer etc). This system can be used by growers, who want to monitor the
    status of soil moisture content and watch on their computer monitor the conditions
    at various locations, follow the weather information and monitor in detail the
    irrigation operation. During the irrigation, they may also want to see the current
    location of irrigation. For example, if a rain shower passes over the field, the
    software should be able to automatically adjust the amount of water being applied.
    In the proposed system, the routing protocol that is used to send traffic from
    the information sources to the destination assumes the coexistence of a base station
    and, without loss of generality, of a set of homogeneous sensor nodes. These nodes
    are randomly distributed within a delimited area of interest. The base station
    is located at a long distance away from the sensor field. Both the base station
    and the set of sensor nodes are considered stationary. The base station is able
    to transmit with high enough power to all the network nodes, due to its unlimited
    power supply. Moreover, the sensors are hierarchically organized into clusters.
    3.1. The irrigation and decision making system In agriculture, the efficient management
    of water should be considered. Therefore, the water required for irrigation has
    to be minimized. The proposed system based on the information sent from the sensors
    estimate the quantity of water needed. The sensors are used to send to the base
    station the humidity and the temperature of the soil, the humidity, the temperature
    and the speed of the air, and the duration of sunshine per day. The proposed system
    based on these values calculates the water quantity for irrigation. Moreover,
    to develop a more accurate system the historical data regarding the quantity of
    irrigation used in previous period are considered to adjust the quantity of water
    that is needed for irrigation. A comparison between current and past states is
    necessary to arrive at optimum decisions. The main parameters that affect the
    surface runoff are the following: the climate (rainfall intensity, moisture content,
    wind, evaporation) and the type of vegetation. An important factor for the implementation
    of an irrigation system is the knowledge of the soil moisture at the beginning
    of the growing season, which depends mainly on the weather conditions during the
    preceding winter. Additionally, the knowledge of the water quantity stored in
    underground aquifers, which is available for plants through the capillary rise,
    is critical. In order to reach a decision for the irrigation needs of a particular
    parcel, it is necessary to add up the useful water from the rain (Pe), the change
    in the stored moisture (SM) in the soil root zone at the beginning of the germination
    period, the crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and the water that by capillary elevation
    reaches the crop rooting zone from the ground (GW) – all these are measured in
    kg/m2 day. If the soil is cohesive, the water can easily rise above the ground
    level, but the rate of capillary rise is slow. On the contrary, if the soil is
    light, then the height of the capillary rise is limited, but the pace of growth
    is fast. If these rates are sufficient to meet the water needs of the plant there
    is a steady development of the crop and the following holds: (1) If these water
    sources cannot meet the water needs of the crops for normal growth, the water
    balance is in deficit. To achieve a smooth development and a normal yield, the
    crops should be provided with a quantity of water (IRn) equal to this deficit:
    (2) where ETc is expressed as follows: (3) kc is the crop coefficient and ETo
    is the reference evapotranspiration in kg/m2 day that is expressed as follows:
    (4) where Ra is the theoretical solar radiation expressed as equivalent depth
    of evaporated water in mm d−1, Tmean is the mean air temperature in °C and TD
    is the difference between maximum and minimum air temperature in °C. Pe is presented
    as follows: (5) where Pt is the total precipitation in kg/m2 day and D is the
    decline allowed in the soil moisture content until the next irrigation dose is
    applied. The function f(D) is an adaptation factor that equals 1 when D = 75 kg/m2
    day, whilst for every other value of D f(D) is expressed as follows: (6) The SM
    contribution is significant in a water balance model for net crop requirements.
    The soil moisture is controlled by a combination of climate properties, land surface
    model characteristics and land–atmosphere interaction. GW contributes to the partial
    coverage of net the crop water requirements, through capillary elevation. The
    extent of the capillary elevation depends on the soil characteristics and the
    distance to the water table. In this paper, the main focus is on the use of a
    WSN to collect data using sensors and to send the data to a database. Then the
    sensed data can be used by a system for the automated irrigation of the fields.
    Therefore, in this paper Pe, SM, GW are not further analyzed. It is assumed that
    their values are provided by appropriate tensiometer sensors. Therefore, Pe, SM,
    GW are considered to sum up to a value k as presented in the following: (7) In
    this framework we consider k to be equal to the total amount of rain in this area
    expressed in kg/m2 day. Nevertheless, the value of the evapotranspiration (ETc)
    that is used to describe the sum of evaporation and plant transpiration from the
    land surface to the atmosphere is calculated based on information provided by
    sensors located in the fields. Evaporation is related to the amount of water that
    is sent to the air from sources such as soil, canopy interception and waterbodies.
    Transpiration is the amount of water in a plant and the subsequent loss of water
    as vapor through the stomata in its leaves. The rate of evapotranspiration depends
    on climatic factors (i.e. on temperature, sunlight, wind speed, and humidity).
    Therefore, an increase in the temperature in the wind speed or in the amount of
    sunlight results to a corresponding increase of evapotranspiration. On the other
    hand, humidity has the opposite effect. The models used in the literature to estimate
    the water quantity are categorized in empirical, computational and combinational.
    The empirical relationships are based on air temperature (Hargreaves, 1974, Thornthwaite
    and Hare, 1965). They only require as input the value of the air temperature and
    calculate the water without using other parameters, such as moisture or wind speed.
    Moreover, they are based on the mean values of temperature and may provide limited
    results if the period of use is less than a month. The computational models are
    based on the solar radiation (Caprio, 1974, Idso et al., 1977). They use the value
    of the radiation during the day to estimate the water without considering other
    parameters as moisture or temperature. They may have limited performance if the
    parcels are on a hill. The computational models may provide more accurate results
    as they consider all the environmental parameters to estimate the water for irrigation.
    In (Monteith, 1965), a combination model for the water based on parameters as
    temperature, moisture and wind speed is proposed. This model is general and does
    not consider the kind of crops in the estimation process of the required water.
    In (Doorenbos and Pruitt, 1977), a model that is an improvement of the model in
    Monteith (1965) and it is based on the kind of crops is proposed. However, both
    models offer high complexity and are difficult to use in case of frequent changes
    on the parameters. Therefore, in Pristlet and Taylor (1972) a model that is based
    on the previously proposed models but is more flexible due to its low complexity
    is proposed. This model does not use the resistance of the surface to estimate
    the water. In this paper, the model proposed in Pristlet and Taylor (1972) for
    the calculation of evapotranspiration is used. The evapotranspiration according
    to this model is calculated as follows: (8) where αe is a fixed value and is considered
    to be equal to 1.3. Δ symbolizes the curve slope of the vapor saturation and is
    calculated based on the information from sensors on the air temperature and the
    saturation pressure of water as follows: (9) where T is the air temperature and
    es is the soil temperature expressed as follows: (10) γ represents the air cool
    factor that depends on the air speed at 2 m height and it is calculated by the
    sensor as follows: (11) where u2 is the air speed at 2 m height. Rn expresses
    the total net radiation energy that depends on microwave radiation that is sent
    from the sensor. (12) where Sn is the algebraic sum of the incoming minus the
    reflected microwave radiation and Ln is the net microware radiation. Both these
    values are based on the soil and air humidity values reported by the sensors.
    The parcels are categorized based on the geographical, topological and climate
    information as well as on the type of crops cultivated in them. In Fig. 1, we
    see an example where five different parcels with different crops are monitored.
    The parcels are then divided into clusters and the sensors are allocated in each
    cluster. For example, parcel A can be divided into two clusters. Then, based on
    the above mentioned characteristics of each cluster and on the real time data
    collected by the sensors the quantity of the water needed (QWi) at cluster i is
    calculated using the following equations: (13) (14) The values of the above equations
    are collected by the sensors that are located in the parcels. The proposed system
    to save water for irrigation makes an adjustment on the quantity of water as calculated
    in (14) based on the information reported by the sensors. The system considers
    the mean value of the humidity and the temperature of soil, the humidity, the
    temperature and the speed of air, as well as the duration of the sunshine hours
    per day for the specific geographical area in previous periods. Therefore, the
    mean value of the water quantity used in previous periods is calculated as follows:
    (15) where Δ′ symbolizes the curve slope of the vapor saturation and is calculated
    based on the information in previous periods of the air temperature and the saturation
    pressure of the water. γ′ represents the air cool factor that depends on the wind
    speed at 2 m height that is collected in the previous period. Rn′ expresses the
    total net radiation energy that depends on the microwave radiation that is sent
    from previous period. Moreover, the ratio of change on the values during the last
    days is calculated as follows: (16) where Δ″ symbolizes the curve slope of the
    vapor saturation and is calculated based on the information collected during the
    last days regarding the air temperature and the saturation pressure of the water.
    γ″ represents the air cool factor that depends on the wind speed at 2 m height
    during the previous days. Rn″ expresses the total net radiation energy that depends
    on microwave radiation during the previous days. Therefore, the quantity of water
    needed for irrigation (QWrequired) is calculated as follows: (17) If no historical
    values are available, the proposed system can be adjusted to use only the information
    provided by the real time values from sensors. 3.2. Case study It is important
    to consider the mean values of the humidity and the temperature of soil, the humidity,
    the temperature and the speed of air, and the duration of sunshine hours per day
    for the specific geographical area in previous periods. Therefore, their mean
    values for a specific area during the same month in previous years could provide
    indication on the environmental conditions. These mean values combined with the
    real time values collected by the sensors could provide better results for the
    water quantity required for irrigation. The proposed model is considered as an
    improvement to the one proposed in Pristlet and Taylor (1972) as it estimates
    the water for irrigation based on the previous values collected by sensors. An
    example that proves the efficient management of water by the system is the case
    that for a specific field the mean water required for irrigation based on (14)
    is 10 kg/m2 per day. This quantity of water can be minimized if historical data
    are considered. If historical data are used, then the mean value for irrigation
    could be less than the current measurements. If the value is 5 kg/m2 the water
    that will be used for irrigation will be less than the current amount (using (14))
    and it can be calculated as follows: (18) Therefore, there is no need for irrigation
    when historical data are used but there is a need to pump out water. Thus, water
    can be managed more efficiently. Moreover, in case that the mean ratio of change
    of the water required for irrigation the previous month is −1 and the current
    water required for irrigation is 10 kg/m2 then less water is required for irrigation
    (see Table 1, Table 2). Table 1. The detailed values of the quantity of water

    1 25 0.5 43 57 41 25 4. Performance evaluation of the proposed model In this section,
    the proposed model is evaluated using ECHERP, a protocol that pursues energy conservation
    (Nikolidakis et al., 2013). ECHERP is a scheme that is based on the appropriate
    selection of nodes as cluster heads. It models the network and the energy spent
    to transmit data from sensors to base station, as a linear system. Then, using
    the Gaussian elimination algorithm it selects the cluster heads of the network.
    Its main characteristic is that it elects as cluster head the node that minimizes
    the total energy consumption on the cluster. Based on the energy level and location
    information that the nodes send, each node sets up a neighbour information table
    and sends this table along with its corresponding information to its neighbours.
    This information is sent to the BS that runs a Gaussian elimination algorithm
    to compute the number of rounds at which every node can be a cluster head, trying
    to maximize the network lifetime. The BS broadcasts the unique IDs of the newly
    selected cluster heads and their cluster members and the nodes use this information
    to enter a cluster. The lower level cluster head aggregates the data and then
    transmits the compressed data to the upper lever cluster heads until the data
    reaches the base station. The sensor nodes placed in a WSN have the responsibility
    of the event detection, data processing and transmission of data. The energy spent
    on these actions has to be minimized as the nodes are battery equipped and thus
    have limited energy. The notation of rounds is used to describe the successful
    send of data from sensors to the BS. Therefore, one round is the one-time data
    send from all sensors to the BS. The energy ETx(k,d) that a node dissipates for
    the radio transmission of a message of k bits over a distance d is due to running
    both the transmitter circuitry ETx-elec(k) and the transmitter amplifier ETx-amp(k,d)
    and is given by the following: (21) where Eelec is the transmitter circuitry dissipation
    per bit, which is supposed to be equal to the corresponding receiver circuitry
    dissipation per bit and εamp is the transmit amplifier dissipation per bit per
    square meter. Moreover, in case that the node distance from the base station is
    d, it is more efficient to split this distance including a few nodes in the middle.
    In case that d = d1 + d2 + d3, then . Thus the ETx(k,d) reaches its minimum value.
    Similarly, the energy ERx(k) dissipated by a node for the reception of a k bit
    message is due to running the receiver circuitry ERx-elec(k) and is given by:
    (22) In order to evaluate the performance of ECHERP, simulations over 50 different
    100 m × 100 m network topologies were performed. The general network architecture
    considered is the following: • A fixed base station is located away from the sensor
    nodes. • The sensor nodes are energy constrained with a uniform initial energy
    allocation. • Each node senses the environment at a fixed rate and always has
    data to send to the base station. • The sensor nodes are immobile. • The network
    is homogeneous and all nodes are equivalent, i.e. they have the same computing
    and communication capacity. • The network is location unaware, i.e. the physical
    location of the nodes is not known in advance. • The transmitter can adjust its
    amplifier power based on the transmission distance. In all the simulation scenarios
    we examined 100 homogeneous nodes with an initial energy of 3 J, randomly scattered
    within a 100 × 100 m2 sensor field. The BS was positioned at point (0,150), so
    it is at least 100 m away from the centre of the field and the packets sent are
    36 bytes. The energy consumption due to communication is calculated using the
    first order energy model (Heinzelman et al., 2000). We assume that each sensor
    node generates one data packet per round to be transmitted to the BS. The sensor
    nodes were grouped into clusters consisting of cluster heads that send data to
    upper level cluster heads to finally reach the BS. Fig. 7 shows the number of
    nodes that remain alive when LEACH, ELCH and ECHERP are applied. More precisely,
    the depletion of all the network nodes in LEACH, ELCH and ECHERP takes place during
    the 800th, 980th and 995th rounds respectively. Download : Download full-size

    which are illustrated in Fig. 7, Fig. 8, concerning these metrics in the case
    of uniform energy distribution. Table 5. Comparison of ECHERP to LEACH and ELCH

    to evaluate the performance of the proposed model, a number of simulations using
    different values of time required for a round have been considered. In the simulation
    tests the trade-off between the time of a round and the water required is defined.
    The main objective of this model is to keep the energy consumption of the nodes
    in low level while having more accurate measurements from sensors on the water
    required. The total water required for irrigation is expressed as follows: (23)
    where Total Water represents the quantity of water required based on the irrigation
    model presented in (17). Mean Water represents the average value of the water
    required when different values of time for a round are considered. Moreover, the
    round represents the number of times that the exchange of data from sensors to
    base station is performed. The quantity of water required for irrigation is calculated
    as follows: (24) Based on the above formulas simulation tests were performed to
    calculate the quantity of water required and the lifetime of the network for various
    values of round time ranging from 10 to 230 s. In all the tests it was assumed
    that the duration of the network lifetime was equal to 995 rounds. The simulation
    results are summarized in Table 6. Therefore if a round in ECHERP is equal to
    110 s energy efficiency is provided while smaller quantities of water are consumed.
    5. Conclusions This paper focused on the issue of automated irrigation in agriculture
    and proposed a novel system for efficient irrigation using WSNs. The proposed
    system is based on a model which performs efficient irrigation management by finding
    the appropriate schemes for the rational utilization of water for irrigation.
    The automated irrigation system proposed is based on the use of a novel routing
    protocol named ECHERP. The utilization of this protocol offers remarkable energy
    efficiency. The development of novel systems, like the one proposed in this paper,
    which combines efficient irrigation models along with energy efficient utilization
    of WSNs shows to be a very promising and effective application of automation in
    agriculture. The proposed model can be further extended to consider the effect
    of the field characteristics on the quantity of water required for irrigation.

  description: 'Information of evapotranspiration (ET) at different spatial-temporal
    scales over croplands is the basis of high-efficient water consumption control
    and water-saving irrigation management. However, evapotranspiration theory or
    model parameter at certain scale is highly relied upon the scale. Due to the lack
    of knowledge of the multi-scale ET spatio-temporal coupling, an incomprehensive
    understanding to the agricultural water evaluation may lead to incorrect irrigation
    regime. Therefore, researches on conversion methods for ETs at various spatio-temporal
    scales are of significant importance for improving regional irrigation regime
    and maintain sustainable development of agricultural water resources. This study
    systematically reviewed the measurement and estimation methods for ETs at various
    spatio-temporal scales, and evaluated the applicability and pros/cons of each
    method. A further review of the conversion method for ETs at various spatio-temporal
    scales was given, presenting future study highlights, including the current research
    focuses such as cooperation & coupling response mechanism of crops for multi-factors,
    the integration technology of multi-source ET data from various methods at different
    spatio-temporal scales, the theoretic conversion model at various spatio-temporal
    scales, and spatio-temporal coupling scales and water-heat-carbon in a unified
    system. And the future research emphasises were detailed shown as follow: 1) Three
    aspects of research highlights on ET estimation method were listed below. Firstly,
    the research highlights on ET estimation model mainly focus on integrating the
    response mechanism of the crops to many factors such as water, fertilizer, air,
    heat, light, soil and living beings, building up a regulation & control equation
    for quantitative coupling and developing the ET estimation method of heterogeneous
    underlying surfaces in several combination modes including partial irrigation
    and film covering. On the other hand, the key research on ET measuring method
    comprises the methods for improving the performance and optimizing the layout
    of the sensors as well as promoting the ET precision of remote-sensing monitoring
    area, including the higher parameter precision of the characteristics of the underlying
    surface in remote-sensing inversion, inversion error analysis and quantitative
    attributes. Furthermore, the fusion technology of multi-source ET monitoring data
    at several methods and multi-time/space dimensions, and real-time water shortage
    diagnosis and precisely controlled irrigation for the crops based on ET information.
    2) For conversion methods for time-space dimensions of ET, the following research
    highlights needs to be paid more attention. Building up the theoretical formula
    for ET conversion between the dimensions with physical meaning including leaf,
    single plant, field block, farmland and region (irrigation area) are the key research
    focuses on conversions among space dimensions of ET. While, for conversion of
    time dimension of ET, the key researches mainly aims at quantizing the error and
    uncertainty of the conversion of time dimension of ET in different climates, different
    crop types, different irrigation systems and different managing modes, and optimizing
    and recommending the conversion function of time dimension for different regions.
    With regard to the coupled conversion of time and space dimensions of ET, the
    development of coupled conversion method for time and space dimensions of ET with
    physical meaning is the pivot in future. The last but not least, with regard to
    the expansion and application of the conversion of time and space dimensions for
    ET, the key research need focus on the evaluation of water utilization efficiency
    in agriculture at different time and space dimensions as well as the coordinated
    multi-dimension improvement mode for high-efficient water utilization in agriculture.
    Over all, the integration of water, heat and carbon in one unified system and
    the development of ET conversion systems at corresponding time and space dimensions
    will become the hot spot in this field.'

    Nearly one-fifth of rice production in the United States occurs in the Sacramento
    Valley of California according to the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service
    (NASS), making the region an important anthropogenic wetland landscape. The landscape
    necessitates intense water resource demands for multiple rice stages and managements
    such as seeding practice, straw decomposition and soil preparation, and waterfowl
    habitat. However, water is not an infinite resource in this region as regional
    rainfall patterns alone are not adequate for commercial scale rice production.
    Periodic drought, low seasonal accumulation, and population demands have created
    water restriction policies that include a fee based permit system. For example,
    the year 2008 was classified as a water restriction year by the California State
    Water Board and the US Bureau of Reclamation due to low total accumulated rainfall
    and water table targets not being met. This water restriction mostly impacted
    late fall and winter irrigation demands for wetland inundation maintenance, rice
    straw decomposition, and winter season crops. In addition, water transportation
    is costly to operate and maintain due the extensive, manmade network of canals
    and pump stations that push water hundreds of canal kilometers to support habitat
    management and rice production. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are becoming a
    driving factor that influence flood management decisions in the region. Policies
    (e.g., California Assembly Bill 32: Global Warming Solutions Act) and management
    practices are being investigated to abate emissions. Carbon trading and approaches
    to monetize ecosystem services such as the reduction of methane emissions through
    alternative managements are innovative techniques being evaluated. Alternative
    rice managements (ARM) - such as bailing rice residue, winter flooding practices,
    dry seeding, and early drainage prior to harvest- are all being considered as
    potential adaptation and mitigation strategies. Paddy hydroperiod, or flood frequency
    and duration, is arguably the most significant ARM because flood management has
    the greatest impact on methane emissions and carbon cycling in rice paddies (Li
    et al. 2005; Salas et al. 2007). Remote sensing tools are being evaluated as components
    of monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) protocol and mapping ARMs will
    be an integral part by providing low cost spatiotemporal records for accounting
    platforms (Lloyd et al. 2013). Another key driver of flood management is the large
    waterfowl population that utilize flooded paddies and inundated habitat as stopover,
    breeding, and feeding destinations. Land owners, conservation organizations, and
    gaming clubs have a long history of cooperating to provide habitat for waterfowl
    and related recreation. Recent outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza
    (HPAI) in Eurasia and concerns of a global pandemic have drawn attention to migratory
    waterfowl as a natural reservoir or, alternatively, a disease vector for the virus
    (Webster et al. 1992; Chen and McNairn 2006; Sturm-Ramirez et al. 2005; Takekawa
    et al. 2009). The Valley happens to be a key spatial link in the Pacific Flyway
    with millions of migratory waterfowl using flooded rice paddies each year. Recent
    research has shown that rice paddy hydroperiod plays a significant role in the
    risk of HPAI H5N1 subtype as these landscapes are where migratory waterfowl, humans,
    and domestic poultry tend to intermix (Fuller and Rothery 2013; Gilbert et al.
    2010; Loth et al. 2010; Martin et al. 2011; Newman et al. 2012). Therefore, monitoring
    paddy hydroperiod is one strategy to manage risk and model potential distribution
    pathways for HPAI outbreaks. For these reasons the mapping of rice and habitat
    conditions is needed to help guide flood management decisions and paddy monitoring.
    In preceding work, Torbick et al. (2010) successfully mapped rice paddy extent
    and winter flood conditions. The approach used dynamic indices generated from
    optical satellite remote sensing imagery that are sensitive to water and vegetative
    growth. Specifically, the technique delineated paddy flood status by observing
    the dynamic inversion of the Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and Enhanced Vegetative
    Index (EVI) generated from MODIS. LSWI is sensitive to equivalent water thickness
    or presence of water that is generated by ratioing remote sensing observations
    that are sensitivity to vegetation, moisture, and water properties; while EVI
    ratios observations sensitive to vegetative surface conditions and incorporates
    additional spectral information to normalize soil and background effects (Xiao
    et al. 2005; Huete et al. 2002). This approach has been effective for mapping
    rice paddies and hydroperiod across landscapes in California, China, India, Indonesia,
    and Southeast Asia (Biradar and Xiao 2011; Xiao et al. 2005, 2006; Torbick et
    al. 2011). To complement the optical indices in the previous effort we incorporated
    the use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR). SAR backscatter measurements have a
    well-established sensitivity to water, soil moisture, and rice stages dependent
    on incident angle, wavelength, and polarization (Kuenzer and Knauer 2012). We
    previously applied a simple thresholding approach to multitemporal SAR observations
    to extract dynamic range and presence of water to delineate rice extent and winter
    flood. The thresholding technique used Phased Array L-band Synthetic Aperture
    Radar (PALSAR) imagery and was found to have strong agreement with MODIS (MCD43A4)
    derived flood products based on dynamic indices. In this work we sought to evaluate
    the ability to distinguish rice paddy and habitat types to provide information
    for multiple end user communities. The technical objective was to compare and
    fuse fine-beam, dual-pol (HH, HV) PALSAR and Landsat indices to map agricultural
    wetlands and their inundation patterns across the Sacramento Valley of California.
    Methods Study area The study area (center ~121.5W, 38.25N) in this application
    covers 33,000 km2 across the entire northern and central Valley of California,
    USA. Figure 1 displays the Sacramento Valley region within central California
    with a color relief digital elevation model (DEM). Rice fields are shaded in yellow
    and GCID rice fields shaded in green. Rice area covers more than 250,000 ha typically
    with 220,000 in production in a given year and supports thousands of rice farming
    jobs with half billion dollars generated annually (Wong et al. 2003). The ecosystem
    serves as habitat for many species of migratory waterfowl and is a key geography
    along the Pacific Flyway (Elphick and Oring 1998; Elphick 2000). Tremendous investment
    in thousands of canal kilometers has developed an extensive network of cannels
    and pump stations to irrigate rice fields and transport water. According to the
    EPA’s 2011 national greenhouse gas inventory and California Air Resources Board,
    rice production in California is responsible for 0.6 million metric tons (MMT)
    of CO2 equivalent annually. Updated and more detailed estimates are currently
    being developed. The relationship between these ecosystem drivers and their interstices
    has created a very unique social ecological system with competing water resource
    demands. Fig. 1 Sacramento Valley region overlaid upon a color relief Digital
    Elevation Model with GCID rice fields shaded in green and remaining rice fields
    shaded in yellow and Landsat footprints Full size image Rice is cultivated in
    portions of 12 different subwatersheds and 17 counties covering more than 10 %
    of the landscape. Most paddies are clustered in the northern Valley region with
    some watersheds comprised of more than 50 % rice land use. Typically, upwards
    of 95 % of rice paddies in this region are wet seeded which means fields are flooded
    prior to seeding. Flooding and subsequent seeding is typically carried out in
    early to mid-May. Depending on management practices and water availability, additional
    irrigation maintenance applications are typically applied to keep fields inundated
    as the rice crop develops. Fallow or non-cultivated fields can also undergo flooding
    to support waterfowl habitat, enhance crop residue decomposition, or secure water
    rights. Dry seeding is an example alternative planting practice being evaluated
    in the region to offset greenhouse gas emissions and monetize ecosystem services.
    Fields are flooded weeks after dry seeding, thereby reducing the length of flooding
    during the crop season resulting in a reduction of methane emissions. Prior to
    harvest, rice fields are drained for drying. In an effort to improve management
    of rice straw after harvest, farmers will often re-flood the fields in November/December
    to enhance decomposition of rice straw. This “winter” flooding is often maintained
    for several months. According to USDA NASS Crop Data Layer (2012), open water
    and wetlands make up less than 1 % of the area; however, the classification scheme
    and definitions do not consider flooded paddies in the spring or winter as a potential
    wetland habitat class. Herbaceous grassland (30 %), developed (10 %), fallow fields
    (9 %), almonds (8 %), and alfalfa (6 %) are other dominant cover types in the
    study site. Climate varies across the Valley with the area classified as temperate
    with warm to hot (~28  C) summer months and cool winters (~6  C). Total surface
    precipitation in 2009 ranged from 325.14 to 1029.52 mm/year. Training data Training
    data in the form of GIS vector files from the Glenn-Colusa Irrigation District
    (GCID) were used to divide, test, and train the remote sensing imagery. The training
    data was collected from 2006–2010 and we matched training data to the same time
    period as the satellite imagery overpass. GCID is the largest irrigation district
    in the Sacramento Valley covering approximately 70,820 ha; of which 61,917 ha
    are deeded property and 55,846 are irrigable. There are 1,076 landowners in the
    District and an additional 300 tenant water users. The GCID categorizes the landscape
    into six major rice and wetland types, each with their own land use practices
    and irrigation management. Table 1 summarizes the potential combinations of rice
    fields land use land covers across the region. There are six primary wetland classes
    and each can have its own hydroperiod management. The six primary anthropogenic
    wetland classes are Rice, and rice fields being used as habitat wetland (HW),
    HW with 1 irrigation application (HW1), non-Crop with 1 irrigation application
    (NC1), non-Crop with irrigation maintenance applications (NCM), or non-crop fallow
    field with no irrigation (NCZ). Rice fields can be wet or dry seeded during late
    spring and/or undergo winter flooding conditions after harvest. Rice fields and/or
    wetland classes can have no irrigation, single irrigation applications, or continuous
    irrigation maintenance applications (Table 1). Table 1 Rice and wetland habitat

    ALOS PALSAR strips We used observations from the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency’s
    (JAXA) Advanced Land Observation Satellite (ALOS-1) that carries the PALSAR instrument.
    Slant (SLT) range fine-beam strips were obtained in single look complex (SLC)
    Level 1.1 format through JAXA’s Kyoto and Carbon Initiative. We used multitemporal,
    dual pol (HH, HV) observations from Referenced Path System (RSP) 222 during Day
    Of Year (DOY) 1, 183, and 276 for years 2010, 2009, and 2009 respectively. This
    provided snapshots of paddy and habitat conditions during early and midseason
    rice growth and the winter period. Each PALSAR strip is several hundred km in
    length north–south and span the width (east–west) of the Valley making large area
    mapping feasible. Polarization mode of observation on DOY 1, 183, and 276 was
    HH, HH:HV, and HH:HV, respectively. SLT strips were imported and co-registered
    using a cubic convolution cross-correlation routine considering shifts and range
    and azimuth dependency. A multitemporal de Grandi speckle filter was applied to
    remove multiplicative noise (De Grandi et al. 1997, 2003). Images were terrain
    geocoded using a digital elevation model (DEM) and followed the range-Doppler
    approach to generate ~75 m (ground resolution) pixels. Images were radiometrically
    calibrated and normalized by eliminating local incident angle effects to provide
    fully preprocessed (sigma nought σ° dB) images over the study area (Fig. 2). Fig.
    2 Image processing, analysis, and classification flow to map agricultural wetlands
    Full size image Landsat Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) and Landsat 7 Enhanced
    Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) observations were obtained across the study area (path/row:
    42–45/32–34). Landsat follows a sun-synchronous orbit at an altitude of 705 km
    with a 16-day repeat window; each sensor being offset to provide 8-day overpass
    repeats for a given foot print. These platforms capture observations in the visible
    (vis/0.45–69 μm), near-infrared (nir/0.75–0.90 μm), and shortwave-infrared (swir/1.55–1.75,
    2.08–2.35 μm) at 30 m spatial resolution while thermal wavelengths (TIR/10.4–12.5
    μm) are available at 120 and 60 m from TM and ETM+ , respectively (Table 2). Landsat
    (L1T) data were obtained from Glovis (glovis.usgs.gov) with standard radiometric
    and geometric terrain corrections applied using the best available ground control
    points and DEM inputs. Imagery were resampled using cubic convolution and an accompanying
    metadata file with all relevant information required for preprocessing. Initially,
    all cloud free imagery from 2009 to 2010 was used in the classification process
    until the most useful imagery was identified for distinguishing the wetland and
    rice classes. Table 2 Characteristics for Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced
    Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), and PALSAR Fine Beam (FB) strips Full size table
    Landsat data were preprocessed from digital number (DN) to atmospherically corrected
    surface reflectance using the Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the
    Solar Spectrum (6S) model (Vermote et al. 1997). We used daily MODIS Aerosol Optical
    Depth (Level 3 MOD08_D3) to determine the aerosol parameterization within 6S.
    Thermal bands were preprocessed using MODTRAN version 5.3 with atmospheric profiles
    obtained from MERRA to provide corrected surface temperature imagery. We evaluated
    a suite of well-established indices generated from the preprocessed Landsat imagery.
    The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI; Eq. 1) (Rouse 1974; Tucker 1979)
    is a useful metric of greenness and vigor across a landscape and is one of the
    most applied indices for land surface monitoring. The enhanced vegetation index
    (EVI; Eq. 2) (Huete et al. 2002) builds upon NDVI by using additional bands and
    coefficients to reduce noise from atmospheric conditions and background to improve
    sensitivity to canopy conditions. The Land Surface Water Index (LSWI; Eq. 3) is
    sensitive to water or equivalent water thickness and leaf moisture and has been
    successfully applied to map rice paddy status in multiple regions (Torbick et
    al. 2011; Xiao et al. 2002). The Normalized Difference Senescent Vegetation Index
    (NDSVI) using ratios a SWIR band that is sensitive to water moisture and senescent
    residue cover (Qi et al. 2002). The Soil-Adjusted Total Vegetation Index (SATVI;
    Eq. 4) has demonstrated utility in mapping senescent biomass, ground residue and
    plant litter, and surface conditions while compensating for varying soil brightness
    and background artifacts (Marsett et al. 2006; Hagen et al. 2012). Lastly, we
    applied the Tasseled Cap (TC) transformation (Kauth and Thomas 1976) which equates
    measures of greenness, wetness, and brightness by compressing the spectral channels
    into a few relatively unique components. All images were examined for georegistration
    inconsistencies using 1 m, true-color National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP)
    data (high resolution digital air photos) and no georectification adjustments
    were required. $$NDVI = \\frac{\\rho nir - \\rho red }{\\rho nir + \\rho red}$$
    (1) $$NDVIEVI = 2.5 X \\frac{{\\rho_{nir} - \\rho_{red} }}{{\\rho_{nir} + 6 \\rho_{red}
    - 7.5 \\rho_{blue} + 1 }}$$ (2) $$LSWI = \\frac{\\rho nir - \\rho swir }{\\rho

    \\rho red}$$ (4) $$SATVI = \\frac{\\rho swir - \\rho red }{\\rho swir + \\rho
    red + 0.1}*\\left(1.1 - \\left(\\frac{swir}{2}\\right)\\right)$$ (5) Approach
    The PALSAR and Landsat imagery were fully preprocessed to use as input in a classifier
    to delineate rice and wetland habitat classes along with hydroperiod. GIS data
    from the GCID was used to train the imagery (Fig. 2). Figure 2 details the image
    processing, analyses, and mapping flow. Box and whisker plots were used to examine
    the distribution of the remote sensing indices among the six wetland classes.
    These results helped determine optimal indices and temporal periods to use as
    inputs into the classifier to maximize separation between the six classes. Concordantly,
    PALSAR and Landsat images were fused by combing the remote sensing indices as
    well as running a data reduction routine to isolate the most unique information
    as one set of inputs into the classifier. Using these remote sensing inputs, a
    series of systematic classifications were run on the PALSAR, Landsat, and fused
    image products to evaluate the ability of each input for accurately delineating
    the six agricultural wetland classes. Maps of wetland types and flood patterns
    were generated based on the optimal remote sensing metrics for a final set of
    information products and study area statistics. Principal components analysis
    (PCA) A PCA was applied to the remotely sensed data as one approach to fuse the
    PALSAR and Landsat imagery and reduce dimensionality. PCA is a popular method
    in which original data are transformed into a new coordinate system, which acts
    to condense the information found in the original inter-correlated variables into
    a few uncorrelated variables, called principal components. With respect to PALSAR
    and L1T imagery, PCA transforms large data sets (many bands) into a relatively
    few meaningful uncorrelated orthogonal dimensions (i.e., the principal components)
    that represent most of the information present in the original dataset. In any
    principal components rotation, the first component or dimension accounts for the
    maximum proportion of the variance of the original image, and subsequent components
    account for maximum proportion of the remaining variance (Torbick and Becker 2009).
    We applied a PCA to a stack of multitemporal Landsat and PALSAR imagery to isolate
    the most unique information and tested the accuracy of these new dimensions in
    the classifier. Box and whisker plots A comprehensive set of box and whisker plots
    were generated for the rice and wetland classes using PALSAR and Landsat as inputs.
    Box and whisker plots can be used to identify the distribution of image bands
    and indices across categories, such as wetland types, to help identify useful
    bands, indices, or temporal periods for separating classes (Torbick et al. 2012).
    The boxes summarize quartiles and medians while the whiskers detail the upper
    and lower quartiles along with dots showing outliers. PALSAR backscatter and Landsat
    indices across seasonal phenologies were assessed for separability by wetland
    type according to the training data. These plots help guide what remote sensing
    inputs and what temporal windows are effective at distinguishing rice and wetland
    habitat classes. Based on these separation results, optimal indices and temporal
    periods were selected and fed into the classifier. Classification And Regression
    Tree (CART) We implemented a CART approach to classify the remote sensing imagery.
    CART algorithms utilize rule-based models for prediction of variables based on
    training data. CART techniques have substantial advantages for remote sensing
    problems because of their flexibility, intuitive simplicity, and computational
    efficiency. In this application a series of classifications was performed on strategic
    combinations of imagery to evaluate the accuracy for distinguishing rice and wetland
    habitat classes. We utilized the random forest (Breiman 2001) library available
    in the R open source software. Several recent studies have utilized random forest
    to characterize landscapes and ecosystem attributes and more details are available
    in Lawrence et al. (2006), Watts et al. (2009), Torbick et al. (2012). Summarizing,
    GCID polygons were used to train the Landsat and PALSAR remote sensing data. Samples
    were randomized in an out-of-sample bootstrap fashion using bagging (resampling
    with replacement). In other words, independent samples were randomly withheld
    to create many trees. The optimal number of trees depends on the ratio of observations
    between classes. Each tree was made up of a series of nodes or rules based on
    the input parameters for each observation period (i.e., PALSAR σ° DOY 183, Landsat
    NDVI DOY 127, Landsat NDSVI DOY 359, etc.…). The rules are designed to split the
    training data into sub-groups maximizing differentiation. The splitting stops
    when no further gain in differentiation can be made. In the end we ran every combination
    (n > 40) of remote sensing data to evaluate the optimal remote sensing input for
    delineating a particular wetland category. In other words, we ran several dozen
    classification scenarios where we tested the ability of different satellite remote
    sensing observations to accurately characterize different wetland classification
    schemes to determine what remotely sensed data were optimal for distinguishing
    rice, wetland habitat, and hydroperiod practices. This application can be considered
    an object oriented CART by the inclusion of hierarchical polygon training data.
    The integration of ancillary information, such as wetland type maps, has shown
    ability to increase accuracy and the level of information extractable from imagery.
    Watts et al. (2009) successfully executed a similar CART approach that integrated
    field boundary information to improve classifications of crops and tillage in
    Montana. The use of boundary information is advantageous as it enables field level
    classifications rather than pixel-based estimates. Results To identify actively
    cultivated rice crops the temporal dynamics of Landsat indices were used to characterize
    seeding practices, inundation pattern, and rice development. Landsat indices on
    DOY 144 have maximum separation between seeding practices with LSWI values of
    0.50 and −0.20 and SATVI values of 0.2 and −0.2 for wet and dry seeding, respectively.
    In this region rice is typically planted during May (DOY 121–151) with canopy
    closure and crop biomass development underway after 30 days. This growth stage
    corresponds to a sharp rise in NDVI independent of seeding practice and continues
    to rise through tillering until NDVI peaks near DOY 208 with values of 0.8–0.85.
    This pattern was relatively consistent independent of seeding practice as shown
    in Fig. 3. PALSAR HH on DOY 182 had largely overlapping box and whisker plots
    for the different seeding practices indicating low ability to separate seeding
    practice with PALSAR on this DOY (Fig. 4). By DOY 182 both seeding practices have
    had irrigation applications so this result is not surprising. The dynamic range
    of NDVI (0.35–0.65) during the key planting (DOY 127–160) and growth (DOY 176–244)
    temporal windows was used to delineate actively cultivated rice paddies. Fig.

    for wet and dry seeding practices for DOY 127 and 183 are highlighted in box and
    whisker plots (Fig. 5). LSWI and TIR on DOY 127 show the most separation between
    seeding practices as opposed to further into the growing season when separation
    between seeding practices with optical indices diminishes. Using Landsat LSWI
    and SATVI on DOY 127 and 144, a total of 185,494 ha were classified as inundated
    due to wet seeding practices during the spring planting period. Mean skin temperature
    on DOY 127 as observed by Landsat TIR was ~21 °C for wet seeded and ~37 °C for
    dry seeded. The inclusion of thermal imagery did not significantly change the
    total acreage or accuracy outcomes of the CART. There was more than 10 dB difference
    between Winter Flood (−22.5 dB) vs Not Flooded (−10.5 dB) using the PALSAR HH
    observation from DOY 1 (2010) (Fig. 4). Fig. 5 Landsat NDVI, LSWI, and TIR for

    Table 3 summarizes a 2 × 2 error matrix which highlights correctly mapped samples
    diagonally between the remote sensing predictions and the reference ground truth
    data using the withheld sampling technique. The classification approach achieved
    a very high overall accuracy and kappa of 95 and 89 %, respectively. This particular
    table illustrates the strong agreement between the satellite remote sensing imagery
    and ground truth data as to whether or not a rice field was inundated after harvest
    during the ‘winter’ period. Of the 5,490 validation samples, 5,192 were correctly
    classified and 298 were misclassified. In this application we used LSWI DOY 359
    and PALSAR HH DOY 1 to identify a total of 90,168 ha (48.8 %) of actively cultivated
    paddies that underwent post-harvest flooding (“winter flooding”) with the remaining
    51.2 % receiving no irrigation applications during the winter period. We note
    that the total area of inundation is for rice areas only and does not include
    open water, natural wetlands, or reservoirs that are dispersed across this landscape.

    1 Full size table Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the spectral similarity of the six
    agricultural wetland types using bands and indices sensitive to rice attributes.
    Evident is that separation for a given class depends on index used, DOY phenology,
    and management. For example, the classes HW and HW1 are not separable using NDVI
    on DOY 127; however, separation between these classes increases on DOY 359 by
    using NDSVI and LSWI. The combined multi-temporal PALSAR sigma nought and Landsat
    reflectance bands had the highest overall accuracy for distinguishing the six
    rice and wetland types with 84 % overall accuracy (Table 4). Landsat reflectance
    and TIR bands had the next highest overall accuracy with 81 %. The first four
    PCA inputs that captured the majority of unique information from a fused Landsat
    and PALSAR dataset were not able to achieve overall accuracy above 74 % for any
    combination of wetland types. Dual pol PALSAR collected later in the growing season
    outperformed single mode early in the crop season when trying to separate any
    combination of wetland types. Fig. 6 Box and whisker plots for selected Landsat

    fields undergoing inundation for wet seeding practices in spring and 49 % (90,168
    ha) of fields undergoing inundation in winter. Approximately twelve percent of
    rice area (24,603 ha) was mapped as one of the five agricultural wetland habitat
    classes (HW, HW1, NC1, NCM, or NCZ). Table 5 Classified rice habitat area and
    percentage Full size table Discussion Accurate knowledge of rice cultivation and
    hydroperiod activity are fundamental informational needs for rice and wetland
    habitat decision making. A current policy being evaluated under AB32 for adapting
    and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions is changing hydroperiod management. This
    requires MRV platforms to know the status of a rice field along with cultivation
    and inundation history to gauge abatement. For example, was a rice crop cultivated
    four of the past 5 years and has winter flooding occurred each year a crop was
    grown? Then potential scenarios can be tested for altering inundation management
    and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. Cost efficient tools that can reliably
    map whether specific fields were planted in rice with wet or dry seeding and whether
    or not winter flooding was used historically and during an offset period will
    be valuable for successful and efficient MRV protocol and implementation. Paddies
    can be actively farmed, have a failed or fallow crop, remain dormant, or serve
    as designated wildlife habitat in the Sacramento Valley. These different rice
    land uses can also each have their own flood managements as well. To determine
    rice cultivation the use of NDVI dynamic range was an effective technique to map
    actively farmed rice fields in the Sacramento Valley. As shown in Fig. 3 all rice
    paddies that underwent cultivation had a NDVI increase of at least 0.3 if not
    greater. Figure 3 shows eight consecutive, 16-day Landsat derived indices for
    wet and dry seeding practice. We highlight the inversion of NDVI and LSWI during
    late spring for wet seeding (as opposed to dry seeding). The increase in NDVI
    by summer is independent of seeding practice or winter inundation management.
    By using satellite observations during key growth stages, dynamic range can be
    mapped with as little as two observations and delineate actively farmed rice paddies.
    Using three or more different overpass dates after DOY 160 when plants begin to
    develop crop biomass and before DOY 240 as plants complete heading and near harvest
    will provide a more rigorous measure of dynamic range and indication of active
    cultivation. Figure 3 illustrates temporal profiles with 8 consecutive 16-day
    observations between DOY 144 and 256 so it is feasible to have several unique
    observations from current moderate scale satellite platforms. Given scan line
    corrector (SLC) gaps of Landsat 7, ending of Landsat 5, potential clouds, and
    occasional lack of imagery availability, the use of automated cloud screening
    and ability overcome missing data can help operationalize this approach. Wet seeding
    is the primary practice in the Sacramento Valley with more than 90 % of paddies
    typically undergoing inundation starting late April and into May with seeding
    soon thereafter. ARMs such as dry seeding or more precise hydroperiod management
    are being evaluated as mitigation techniques to reduce GHG emissions with the
    potential to monetize these reductions through participation in voluntary or compliance
    offset programs. In short, less anaerobic conditions produces less methane emissions
    in these systems (Li et al. 2005; Salas et al. 2007) so the timing and duration
    of inundation are potential management tools that can be used to meet emissions
    targets. Therefore, tracking of inundation status will be important to assess
    production, emissions, and water resource demands as well as waterfowl population.
    LSWI, along with its relationship to NDVI, was a useful index that was shown to
    be capable of mapping seeding practice by distinguishing inundated from non-inundated
    fields during initial rice crop growth. Before canopy closure LSWI observations
    are effective at distinguishing inundation and the inversion of LSWI and NDVI
    (or EVI) can be used to denote a flooded or inundated paddy. This inversion and
    the dynamic relationship between these indices is a useful tool to gauge inundation
    and hydroperiod as the relative relationship between the indices (e.g., LSWI >
    NDVI) is less sensitive to varying viewing geometry, biomass, residue, or soil
    brightness levels compared to using absolute values of indices. Thus by using
    multitemporal imagery and tracking the overpass dates of satellite imagery, the
    frequency and duration of inundated conditions or management practice can be assessed
    for an individual rice field. This technique can provide near weekly reporting
    on inundation status for more than 250,000 ha of rice. Previous large-area rice
    mapping efforts have relied on high frequency optical imagery for regional to
    continental areas (Xiao et al. 2005; Sakamoto et al. 2008; Gumma et al. 2011;
    Torbick et al. 2010; Torbick et al. 2011); however, this research application
    represents one of the first operational mapping routines for field level inundation
    monitoring. While rice stalks are largely oriented in an erect manner, once plant
    biomass and canopy leaf area index begins to cover standing surface water the
    use of optical indices for distinguishing irrigation managements among agricultural
    wetlands becomes more challenging. It is feasible that microwave observations,
    such as C-, L- or X-band, can help overcome canopy and biomass obstacles (Inoue
    et al. 2002; Kuenzer and Knauer 2012; Torbick et al. 2011; Zhang et al. 2009).
    However, more research focused on this detailed question would need to be evaluated
    in this ecosystem. Historically, SAR platforms are less cost efficient and are
    not collecting imagery in an operational manner relative to Landsat. Potentially,
    this can begin to change as new SAR satellites are launched into orbit (e.g.,
    Sentinel-1, ALOS-2). In the Sacramento Valley, maintenance irrigation applications
    can continue well into the growing season for rice crops. The majority of variations
    in hydroperiod, for example dry versus wet seeding and winter flooding, can benefit
    from fused SAR and optical imagery for assessment in this region. Mapping rice
    inundation has relied on traditional indices. Here, flooded paddies were noted
    as having a dramatic difference in skin temperature observed from thermal remote
    sensing. Mean skin temperature difference between wet seeded (mean 21 °C) and
    dry seeded (mean 37 °C) on DOY 127 as observed by Landsat was greater than 10
    °C (Fig. 8). However, we chose not to use thermal imagery in our final CART as
    many satellites do not carry thermal bands while most moderate scale sensors can
    generate the common indices applied in this study such as NDVI. As evident in
    the box and whisker plots, ability to separate wet seeded and dry seeded after
    the crop begins to develop is similar among NDVI, LSWI, and TIR. Starting around
    DOY 208 peak NDVI (~0.85) begins to level out as rice crops approach heading.
    The NDVI signal then drops steadily corresponding to onset of grain filling. Genetic
    strains of medium grain rice in this region typically are around 130 days until
    harvest. Therefore, targeting NDVI and LSWI during these early rice growth stages
    and management periods can be used to map rice extent and seeding practice. Fig.
    8 Landsat mean skin temperature as observed from Landsat Full size image The PALSAR
    measurements during DOY 182 were not well timed for distinguishing seeding practices
    which highlights a limitation of the SAR collection strategy. With PALSAR observations
    on the order of one every 46 days the temporal overpass frequency is not adequate
    for operational mapping of rice seeding practice. L-band SAR has greater rice
    canopy penetration compared to C-band (Inoue et al. 2002; Le Toan et al. 1997;
    Kuenzer and Knauer 2012; Wang et al. 2009); however, by DOY 182 all rice fields
    independent of seeding practice are inundated. As evident in the box and whisker
    plots in Fig. 4, on DOY 1 the PALSAR HH observation has very strong ability to
    separate Winter Flood (−22.5 dB) vs Not Flooded (−10.5 dB) across rice fields.
    In general, these results show that both optical and SAR data are effective at
    separating flood classes when overpass dates occur during key temporal windows.
    Similar high accuracies (>95 %) for mapping winter inundation periods can be achieved
    with Landsat indices (LSWI and NDVI) or PALSAR observations if the time sensitive
    periods are observed. This allows for near weekly monitoring of inundation with
    current free moderate scale imagery. By using multi-temporal observations we generated
    winter flood duration attributes for every rice field in the Sacramento Valley.
    The ability of satellite imagery to distinguish between wetland types depends
    on the particular index, phenological stage, management, and overpass date. A
    combination of multitemporal indices was required to separate the wetland categories.
    Table 6 summarizes the optimal Landsat and PALSAR indices and temporal windows
    used to map rice and wetland habitat classes in the study region. While index
    sensitivity was important, the temporal window or overpass period was arguably
    more critical to accurate mapping of wetland classes and hydroperiod monitoring.
    For example, NDVI DOY 127, NDSVI DOY 359, and LSWI DOY 135 can be used to help
    identify rice (R), fallow fields (NCZ), and designated HW. Noteworthy was that
    the habitat classes had a higher NDVI compared to rice and non-crop areas before
    planting as evidence by NDVI on DOY 127, which can be used to map previously cultivated
    rice paddy conditions. Wetland types ‘Non-Crop with 1 irrigation’ (NC1) and ‘Non-Crop
    with irrigation and maintenance applications’ (NCM) were not able to be consistently
    separated with high accuracies using the Landsat indices. LSWI after harvest was
    examined at multiple time steps and some overlap between those two wetland categories
    was found at each interval. NCM was thought to be distinguishable based on time
    series LSWI; however, DOY 359 and DOY 66, 74, and 82 the following year had similar
    index response between the two classes. It is possible farmers kept irrigating
    or maintenance applications were low in number which could cause classification
    confusion. Table 6 Optimal combinations for delineating wetland categories Full
    size table The ability of PALSAR observations to separate wetland classes had
    a similar pattern emerge. Like the Landsat indices, results show that particular
    SAR polarizations during key temporal windows that correspond to rice phenology
    or management practices are needed for separating the wetland types. For example,
    a combination of HV DOY 183, HH DOY 274, and HH 1 were useful for delineating
    rice (R), NCZ, and HW1. In general, the PALSAR observations had less separation
    between wetland types relative to the Landsat indices. It is possible higher temporal
    frequency SAR observations corresponding to phenology and managements, or different
    wavelength or polarizations, would improve separation of the agricultural wetlands
    and hydroperiod managements. An instance the PALSAR observations outperformed
    Landsat indices was the separation of NC1 and NCM. The HH DOY 1 observation shows
    the NCM category has a lower mean backscatter compared to mean backscatter of
    NC1 likely indicating a stronger presence of water under NCM as NC1 areas begin
    to dry. The fused multi-temporal PALSAR and Landsat had the highest overall accuracy
    for distinguishing the wetland types showing that fused imagery outperformed individual
    sensors. Each sensor has particular strengths over the other and imagery fusion
    helps address the limitations of any one sensor. As a final classified we used
    the fused PALSAR and Landsat imagery to map the distribution across the landscape
    (Table 5). Figure 9 highlights cultivated rice fields and winter flooding across
    the Sacramento Valley and Fig. 10 shows a zoomed in snapshot of agricultural wetland
    classes. The integration of SAR and optical imagery for rice and wetlands mapping
    continues to grow as satellite platforms become more operational and algorithms
    get evaluated across platforms (i.e., wavelengths, viewing geometry, polarization,
    repeat frequency) and geography. Repeated and timely SAR observations of wetland
    landscapes that can support effective MRV tools will increase with the planned
    data collection strategies of Senitel-1 and ALOS-2. These results show that relatively
    accurate maps of rice habitat, paddy hydroperiod, and water management are feasible.
    These information products will continue to become an integral part of future
    MRV tools. It is expected that the level of information will continue to increase
    and make substantial contributions to rice decision making, waterfowl and habitat
    management, and MRV tools. Fig. 9 Actively farmed rice paddies and winter flood
    maps for rice fields across the Sacramento Valley, CA, USA Full size image Fig.
    10 Snapshot of classified agricultural wetland classes Full size image Conclusions
    Multitemporal observations from PALSAR and Landsat were investigated for determining
    the optimal remote sensing indices and temporal windows for monitoring the anthropogenic
    wetland landscape of the Sacramento Valley, USA. The choice of remote sensing
    index depends on the rice habitat type or flood management practice being mapped.
    Both radar and optical sensor types have strengths and limitations with temporal
    overpass being a key factor for distinguishing paddy managements and habitat types.
    Landsat indices NDVI and LSWI along with PALSAR HH sigma nought were the most
    useful for mapping hydroperiod across habitats. We found the CART approach to
    be advantageous for ingesting multiple remote sensing data types and distinguishing
    managements and habitats. Nearly 93 % (185,494 ha) of rice in the Sacramento Valley
    underwent wet seeding practices and nearly half (90,168 ha) of cultivated rice
    was flooded during the winter. Approximately 12 % of rice paddies (24,603 ha)
    were used as rice habitat classes with different inundation frequencies and durations.
    The ability of remote sensing tools to support Monitoring, Verification, and Reporting
    platforms for addressing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural wetlands will
    continue to grow as the amount of free, moderate resolution imagery continues
    to increase. The high overall accuracies (>95 %), systematic overpass repeats,
    and free distribution of Landsat imagery make this approach an effective tool
    for assessing hydroperiod mitigation potential and monitoring management practices.
    More operational SAR observations are expected to further improve the precision
    and accuracy of tools. This will be critical for implementing successful MRV protocol
    in a cost effective manner. These results emphasize the utility of satellite remote
    sensing for rice and wetlands decision making. Balancing the demands and resources
    of the unique social ecological system of the Sacramento Valley will remain a
    challenge in the years to come as stressors continue to increase. References Biradar

    Abstract: Depleting fresh water resources is threatening the sustainability of
    agriculture in many countries and it is becoming crucial to protect water stocks
    and its quality. We discuss new advances in the measurement of water fluxes in

  description: 'As a case study, this paper shows how a French cooperative seized
    on a new technology (capacitance sensors), tested it in real conditions (irrigation

    fourteen farmers over the last four years. Managing irrigation with capacitance
    probes has resulted in an increase in water efficiency: most of the time, there
    is a reduction in water supply (the average is 22% (range 4-44%) less water use
    than without the probes). Sometimes, only a yield increase is observed with the
    same water quantity (see 2010 trial - farmer 2). In 2012 Terrena conducted market
    research on 28 farmer members and 20 crop advisors. This showed that most farmers
    who irrigate do not use irrigation management tools. However with a tightening
    of regulations and an increase in irrigation costs, attitudes are changing. Thus,
    12 farmers questioned, said they were ready to pay for an irrigation management
    service based on capacitance probes (continuous real time monitoring of soil moisture).

    launch, a DST soft-launch was set-up in 2012 on ten experimental farms. The usual

  description: Irrigation has had a far-reaching effect on human civilization over
    the last 6000 years, not only for its provision of sustenance, but also because
    of its in¥uence on the integration of various elements from soil science, agronomy,
    hydraulics, and hydrology (Cuenca 1989), shaping institutions, cultures, politics,
    and regulatory policies (National Research Council 1996), and stabilizing rural
    areas (Playán and Mateos 2006). Irrigated agriculture is a vital component of
    agriculture and supplies many of the fruits, vegetables, and cereal foods consumed
    by humans; the grains fed to animals that are used as human food; and the feed
    to sustain animals that are used for work in many parts of the world (Howell 2001).
    Irrigation spawned an evolution of technology, ranging from the design and construction
    of dams and vast water distribution systems to the design of centrifugal pumps,
    gated pipe, siphon tubes, drip and sprinkler irrigation equipment, sensors and
    communications for improved irrigation management, and farming equipment to maximize
    the net returns from irrigated cropping systems In recent years, irrigated agriculture
    has become more efficient due to better irrigation scheduling by farmers and to
    the conversion of furrow or flood irrigation to pressurized systems.

    use efficiency (WUE) should be a priority for sustainable horticulture. This increased
    NUE, WUE, or both depend on the utilization of efficient irrigation technology,

    SMS regulates the frequency of irrigation and, possibly, the water dose by continuously
    monitoring volumetric water content (q) or matrix potential (ym) of the growing

    systems use large amounts of water and nutrients. Excess application of water
    and nutrients results in economic losses (higher fertilizers and pumping costs)
    and contributes to nutrient leaching and environmental degradation. Increasing
    nutrient use efficiency (NUE) and water use efficiency (WUE) should be a priority
    for sustainable horticulture. This increased NUE, WUE, or both depend on the utilization
    of efficient irrigation technology, including appropriate methods for irrigation
    scheduling (IS).Various methods are available for IS based on determination of
    crop water balance (weather-based method), soil/substrate moisture level, or plant
    water relations. Rather than discussing the physical and biological basis of irrigation
    management, this article focuses on currently available irrigation control devices
    for open-field and greenhouse production systems, with particular emphasis on
    soil moisture sensors (SMSs). SMS regulates the frequency of irrigation and, possibly,
    the water dose by continuously monitoring volumetric water content (θ) or matrix
    potential (ψm) of the growing media. A new generation of dielectric SMS has been
    developed to measure both θ and the electrical conductivity (EC) of pore water
    in soil and artificial media. This provides the possibility of controlled fertigation
    based on measured EC. Despite the development in IS, in most regions worldwide,
    especially in less developed countries, many growers still rely on personal experience
    for determining crop water requirements and the timing of irrigation. Therefore,
    the main constraints to the improvement of irrigation efficiency are related to

    The role of irrigation in ensuring food security is vital as about 40% of world
    food is produced by irrigated agriculture and horticulture according to Food and
    Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO, 2002). On the other hand,
    crop irrigation is the major user of fresh water accounting for over 70% of water
    use worldwide. Therefore, improving irrigation WUE, defined as the ratio of applied
    water to crop yield, is decisive to sustain the food demand due to the fast-growing
    world population (FAO, 2002). This goal may be achieved through the cultivation
    of plant species that are more efficient in water use (plant breeding and crop
    planning), through the utilization of efficient irrigation technology, including
    appropriate methods for IS, or both. IS is the process to determine the amount
    of water applied to the crop and the timing for application; as it determines
    seasonal irrigation volume and crop yield, IS has a remarkable effect on WUE.
    Apart from few examples of nonirrigated cropping systems [e.g., dry land bean
    (Phaseolus spp.), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), and potato (Solanum tuberosum)
    in Latin America; winter melon (Cucumis melo) in Mediterranean regions], in field-grown
    vegetable crops irrigation is essential to supplement rainfall during the growing
    season and is obligatory under greenhouse. Vegetables are generally high-value
    crops that make more profitable use of irrigation water than other agricultural
    commodities. In California, for instance, in 2003, field crops accounted for 56%
    of total irrigated area (≈3.5 million ha) consuming 63% of total water use and
    generating 17% of California''s crop revenue (Cooley et al., 2008). By contrast,
    vegetables covered 16% of irrigated land and consumed 19% of applied irrigation
    water while contributing to crop return by 39%. Irrigation scheduling is important
    in vegetable production. Under-irrigation generally results in yield loss and
    low produce quality. Conversely, overirrigation increases the crop''s susceptibility
    to diseases, energy cost for pumping, water loss, and environmental pollution
    due to nutrient leaching. Thompson et al. (2007) identified that poor management
    of drip irrigation was responsible for nitrate leaching in greenhouse tomato production
    in Almeria, in southeastern Spain (at present, the most concentrated greenhouse
    area in the world). A primary cause of this was that many growers base IS on experience
    rather than on actual crop water need. Since nutrient use and water relations
    are closely related, better WUE generally results in improved NUE. Moreover, precise
    scheduling is crucial for regulated deficit irrigation, which aims to induce a
    mild water stress to the plant to save water and improve crop yield and produce
    quality (FAO, 2000; Jones, 2004). Efficient IS aims to supply the crop with enough
    water to ensure optimum production while minimizing water loss and nutrient leaching.
    The amount of irrigation water needed is determined by using a criterion to trigger
    irrigation and a strategy to determine how much water has to be applied to a given
    crop at any time during the production cycle. In vegetable crops, the most common
    criterion is soil θ or ψm (also called tension or suction); the goal is to avoid
    crop damage and to ensure that all irrigation water is used by the crop. A schedule
    to maximize net economic return, which depends also on water price, is less common.
    Conventional methods for IS rely on determination of soil water balance (weather-based
    method) or on the direct measurement of soil moisture level. Other criteria may
    be used for IS in soilless cultures. For instance, the EC of the nutrient solution
    contained in or drained out from the substrate could be the irrigation decision-making
    variable (e.g., Saha et al., 2008; Stanghellini et al., 2003), as it will be discussed
    in detail later in this article. The progress in plant physiology research has
    allowed the design of innovative IS methods based on the monitoring of plant water
    relations. Water balance This method (also known as water balance method) consists
    of estimating the change in soil θ over a period as the difference between the
    inputs (irrigation and rainfall) and the losses [crop evapotranspiration (ET),
    drainage, and runoff]. The method follows three basic steps: 1) the available
    water (AW) in the root zone is estimated from soil texture and rooting depth;
    2) allowable water deficit (AWD) is selected depending on crop species, growth
    stage, soil water capacity, and the irrigation system''s pumping capacity [AWD
    is the portion (ranging from 40% to 60%) of AW that can be extracted without causing
    crop damage]; 3) soil water balance is computed each day to assess water deficit;
    irrigation is needed whenever AWD is exceeded. The water balance method lacks
    high accuracy, but it proved to be reliable and affordable in many conditions
    (Jones, 2004). The main difficulty is estimating ET. The classical “two-step”
    approach to calculation of ET [ET = ET0 × Kc (Allen et al., 1998)] needs the knowledge
    of crop coefficient (KC) and reference ET (ET0). The latter quantity can be calculated
    with Penman–Monteith (P–M) equation (Allen et al., 1998) or other formulas, such
    as the California Irrigation Management Information System (CIMIS) equation (CIMIS,
    2009b). The CIMIS formula uses a modified P–M equation with a wind function developed
    at the University of California, Davis (CIMIS, 2009b). There are no important
    differences between the values of ET0 determined with the two equations, at least
    in open-field crops (Vaughan et al., 2007). Alternatively, ET0 can be determined
    by evaporation pan (Brouwer and Heibloem, 1986). In commercial vegetable production,
    ET is commonly calculated using the data originated from weather stations manufactured
    for farm use (many companies worldwide sell these products) or managed by local
    authorities or growers'' organizations. Generally, these entities also provide
    simple irrigation advice through the Internet (e.g., CIMIS, 2009a) or by short
    messages to grower''s cellular phones (Singels and Smith, 2006). Crop coefficients
    are crop specific and depend on growth stage, climatic conditions, and management
    practices; hence, they must be determined experimentally. Several articles have
    reported KC values for vegetables crops that were determined in different growing
    conditions [e.g., for field-grown, drip-irrigated tomato (Amayreh and Al-Abed,
    2005; Hanson and May 2006; Rinaldi and Rana, 2004)]. Crop coefficient is related
    to the degree of soil cover by crop canopy and thus to leaf area index (LAI).
    Several authors attempted to model the evolution of KC and LAI during the growing
    season. For instance, simple KC models based on thermal time [i.e., cumulated
    growing degree day (GDD)] were designed and validated by Orgaz et al. (2005) for
    melon and pepper (Capsicum annuum) grown under greenhouse. Alternatively, Kc can
    be derived from measurement of crop LAI gathered in situ with hand-held ceptometer
    [several companies market these instruments (e.g., Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA;
    Delta-T Devices, Burwell, United Kingdom; LI-COR, Lincoln, NE)] or by remote sensing
    (for reviews see Jonckheere et al., 2004; Weiss et al., 2004). LAI could be determined
    by nondestructive measurement of leaf number, dimensions, or both (e.g., Carmassi
    et al., 2007a; Rouphael and Colla, 2004). Normalized difference vegetation index
    could be derived from aerial or satellite multispectral images of the fields to
    estimate crop canopy cover (for reviews see Courault et al., 2005; Neale et al.,
    2005), which is thus converted to KC. Compared with the “two-step” approach, “one-step”
    P–M equation is more accurate for estimating ET; however, its use is restricted
    by the lack of information on crop canopy resistance [rC (Katerji and Rana, 2006)].
    Lovelli et al. (2008) proposed a practical methodology to estimate rC from LAI
    (rC = 100/LAI) and thereby to estimate ET of crop canopy (ETC) with P–M formula.
    This method was tested successfully in field-grown melon. The application of “one-step”
    P–M approach seems less difficult under greenhouse, where growing conditions are
    more uniform. Assuming a homogenous crop canopy, Rouphael and Colla (2004) modeled
    ETC in greenhouse-grown zucchini (Cucurbita pepo) by estimating: 1) LAI on the
    basis of crop GDD, 2) the radiation intercepted by the canopy as a function of
    LAI and the light extinction coefficient (k), 3) leaf resistance (rS) as an exponential
    function of PAR, and 4) rC as the ratio of rS to LAI. Simplified (empirical) ETC
    models have been derived from the P–M equation for irrigation management of greenhouse
    crops (e.g., Carmassi et al., 2007b; Medrano et al., 2005). These models consider
    global solar radiation (I), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), LAI, and k. One example
    is the following equation proposed by Medrano et al. (2005) for greenhouse-grown
    cucumber (Cucumis sativus): View Expanded where “a” and “b” are the regression
    equation parameters. Historical ET data could be used for IS of crops that are
    conducted under fairly constant growing conditions, such as greenhouse crops.
    This was the conclusion of a work carried out by Bonachela and Gonzales (2006)
    using both simulation and original experiments with the major greenhouse crops
    in Almeria. Soil moisture sensors Soil moisture sensors could be used to regulate
    the frequency of irrigation and, possibly, the water dose by continuously monitoring
    θ or ψm of the growing media (Dukes et al., 2010; Pardossi et al., 2009). The
    relationship between ψm and θ (also known as water release curve) depends on the
    nature of the growing media. Water release curve is determined in the laboratory
    following standard methods, for instance: in soil, using Richard''s pressure plate
    apparatus (Klute, 1986) and in soilless media, using the method described by De
    Boodt et al. (1974). Expensive and complicated SMSs, such as neutron probe and
    time-domain reflectometry instrument, are available for soil and plant scientists,
    whereas low cost and practical devices are needed for irrigation control of commercial
    crops. Interesting possibilities have been opened up by new types of SMSs that
    measure soil dielectric properties (Dukes et al., 2010; Pardossi et al., 2009).
    Irrigation industry has recognized that SMSs are valuable tools for smart water
    application technology in agriculture and horticulture. The utilization of SMS
    technology for irrigation management in both soil and soilless culture has been
    documented by many researchers (e.g., Muňoz-Carpena et al., 2008; Zotarelli et
    al., 2009), and currently a variety of simple irrigation controllers are available
    on the market that are interfaced to one or more SMSs. For instance, some devices
    provide a “start-and-stop” control by using two or more SMSs buried in and underneath
    the root zone to monitor water movement into the deeper layers and thereby to
    minimize percolation losses. Threshold values for θ or ψm depend on crop species
    and growing media. Typical range for ψm is from –10 to –50 kPa in soil culture
    (Locascio, 2005) and from –4 to –10 kPa in substrate growing systems (Pardossi
    et al., 2009). Norrie et al. (1994) designed an automated fertigation device based
    on electronic tensiometer. In this system, both ψm threshold and the ion concentration
    (namely, EC) of nutrient solution were modulated according to ET, which was estimated
    using P–M equation. During periods of intense ET, irrigation was more frequent
    (i.e., the trigger ψm set point less negative) and EC was reduced as compared
    with periods with low ET. The system was tested successfully in peat-grown greenhouse
    tomato. New dielectric SMSs are cheaper and need much less maintenance and user''s
    expertise compared with traditional water-filled tensiometers (Pardossi et al.,
    2009). Granular matrix sensors, similar to gypsum block, are also available commercially
    (e.g., Watermark Irrometer, Riverside, CA). These sensors are inexpensive (a few
    tens of U.S. dollars each) and can be used over a wider range of ψm (0 to –200
    kPa) than tensiometers, which have a working range between 0 and –85 kPa. Whalley
    et al. (2009) designed and tested a porous-matrix sensor that determines soil
    ψm using a novel dielectric measurement principle and does not have inconveniences
    of water-filled tensiometers, including susceptibility to cavitation. Sensors,
    such as 5TE (Decagon Devices) or WET (Delta-T Device), have been also developed
    for simultaneous measurements of temperature, θ, and pore water EC in soil or
    soilless media (Pardossi et al., 2009). These sensors provide the possibility
    of controlled fertigation. For instance, the concentration of the nutrient solution
    could be adjusted on the basis of measured EC in the root zone. In a free drainage
    rockwool culture of greenhouse pepper, Stanghellini et al. (2003) controlled the
    frequency of irrigation and the nutrient concentration of irrigation water based
    on simultaneous measurements of θ and EC of the substrate; the drainage fraction
    was ≈10%, against more than 50% in the standard control system. In the FLOW-AID
    project, a new fertigation device was developed and tested successfully in container
    cultivation (Balendonck, 2010). The prototype was connected to WET sensors, and
    special algorithms were implemented to activate irrigation when a preset θ threshold
    was reached and to modulate irrigation dose, nutrient solution EC, or both to
    avoid salt accumulation in the substrate. Due to soil spatial variability, precision
    irrigation control requires a large number of sensors that are spread out on each
    plot of the farm and communicate with the irrigation system. The use of a wireless
    sensor network (WSN) could reduce the investment and maintenance costs of such
    control system (Balendonck, 2010). WSN systems for irrigation management are presently
    marketed by some companies worldwide (e.g., Crossbow, San Jose, CA; Netafim, Tel
    Aviv, Israel; Netsens, Sesto Fiorentino, Italy). However, these systems are still
    expensive and have high energy requirements. Some authors (e.g., van Tuijl et
    al., 2008; Vellidis et al., 2008) expressed the opinion that, at the current stage
    of development, WSNs are not enough reliable and affordable for wide commercial
    application. Several research groups (e.g., J. Balendonck''s team at Wageningen
    University and Research Center, Wageningen, The Netherlands) are working to design
    WSN with the following advantages: low cost, easy installation, reduced energy
    consumption, low maintenance, and ability to host a wide array of sensors and
    controllers connected to a central decision support system by radio transmitter
    or GSM modem. Plant-based irrigation scheduling A relatively novel approach to
    IS involves determination of plant water status (e.g., Rüger et al., 2010) or
    transpiration (e.g., Shelford et al., 2004). Applications of this approach to
    IS have been reviewed by Jones (2004) and, more recently, by Fernàndez and Cuevas
    (2010). According to the first author, these methods “have been offset by a number
    of practical difficulties of implementation that have thus far limited the development
    of commercially successful systems” and are “still at research/development state
    and little used yet for routine agronomy.” Nevertheless, some companies have developed
    irrigation controllers that exploit micromeasurements of stem diameter (e.g.,
    Delta International, Montfavet, France), leaf thickness (e.g., Leaf-Sen Irrigation
    System, Givat Hayim Ichud, Israel), or stem sap flow (e.g., Dynamax, Houston,
    TX). Other companies (e.g., Hortimax, Pijnacker, The Netherlands; PhyTech, Yad
    Mordechai, Israel) have integrated different kinds of sensors (including those
    for weather and leaf temperature) in a control system for the management of both
    irrigation and climate in greenhouse production systems. The application of plant-based
    IS seems more practical and affordable in greenhouse soilless growing systems,
    where climate and crop are generally more uniform compared with open field. In
    these systems, the growers can make use of small-size electronic weighing lysimeters
    to measure, on a minute-to-minute basis, ET and the volume and EC of drainage
    water. Examples of this kind of irrigation controller are marketed by Hortimax
    and Spagnol Greenhouse Technologies (Vidor, Italy). Conclusions Accurate IS is
    crucial to maximize WUE and reduce nutrient leaching in intensive vegetable production
    systems. Different approaches may be adopted for efficient irrigation management,
    each having both advantages and disadvantages (Table 1). Table 1. Principal advantages
    and disadvantages of the main methods available for irrigation scheduling. View
    Table Despite the development in IS, in most regions worldwide (especially in
    less developed countries), many growers still rely on personal experience for
    determining crop water requirements and the timing of irrigation. Rather than
    to the lack of consistent methods for IS and off-the-shelf irrigation controllers,
    the main constraints to the improvement of irrigation efficiency seem related
    to the overall cost of these technologies and to the policies adopted for their
    dissemination and transfer to professional growers. View Table Literature cited

  description: The past use of soil water sensors for irrigation management was variously
    hampered by high cost, onerous regulations in the case of the neutron probe (NP),
    difficulty of installation or maintenance, and poor accuracy. Although many sensors
    are now available, questions of their utility still abound. This study examined
    down-hole (access tube type) and insertion or burial type sensors for their ability
    to deliver volumetric water content data accurately enough for effective irrigation
    scheduling by the management allowed depletion (MAD) method. Down-hole sensors
    were compared with data from gravimetric sampling and field-calibrated neutron
    probe measurements. Insertion and burial type sensors were compared with a time
    domain reflectometry (TDR) system that was calibrated specifically for the soil;
    and temperature and bulk electrical conductivity measurements were also made to
    help elucidate sensor problems. The capacitance type down-hole sensors were inaccurate
    using factory calibrations, and soil-specific calibrations were not useful in
    a Central Valley California soil and a Great Plains soil. In both soils, these
    sensors exhibited spatial variability that did not exist at the scale of gravimetric
    and NP measurements or of irrigation management, resulting in errors too large
    for the MAD approach. Except for one, the point sensors that could be buried or
    inserted into the soil gave water contents larger than saturation using factory
    calibrations. The exception was also the least temperature sensitive, the others
    exhibiting daily water content variations due to temperature of >= 0.05 m3 m -3
    water content. Errors were related to bulk electrical conductivity of this non-saline
    but clayey soil.

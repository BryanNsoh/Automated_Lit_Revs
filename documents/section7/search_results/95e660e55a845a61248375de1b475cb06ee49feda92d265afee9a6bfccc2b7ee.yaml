  description: Soft array structure has the advantages of super redundancy, high fault-tolerance,
    high adaptability, and high reliability, and has a promising application in soft
    grasping, soft locomotion, and interface science. However, the variable stiffness
    of soft array structures has always been challenging. Inspired by the biological
    tube foot and water vascular system of starfish, we propose a fiber-reinforced
    soft fluidic tube-foot array with variable stiffness. The soft tube-foot array
    can be assembled on various shapes of surfaces and can be modularized, enabling
    the functions of self-adapting, cushioning, variable damping, and obstacle surmounting.
    Furthermore, we build a peak stiffness model for the bioinspired tube foot, and
    the theoretical and experimental comparison results show that the mean absolute
    percent error is &#x2264;9.3&#x0025;. Finally, we apply the soft tube-foot array
    to the soft grasping and amphibious wheels. The contribution of this work is to
    propose a novel soft array structure and a simple and universal method to control
    the stiffness of fluid-actuated soft array structures.

    of super redundancy, high fault-tolerance, high adaptability, and high reliability,
    and has a promising application in soft grasping, soft locomotion, and interface
    science. However, the variable stiffness of soft array structures has always been
    challenging. Inspired by the biological tube foot and water vascular system of
    starfish, we propose a fiber-reinforced soft fluidic tube-foot array with variable
    stiffness. The soft tube-foot array can be assembled on various shapes of surfaces
    and can be modularized, enabling the functions of self-adapting, cushioning, variable
    damping, and obstacle surmounting. Furthermore, we build a peak stiffness model
    for the bioinspired tube foot, and the theoretical and experimental comparison
    results show that the mean absolute percent error is ≤9.3%. Finally, we apply
    the soft tube-foot array to the soft grasping and amphibious wheels. The contribution
    of this work is to propose a novel soft array structure and a simple and universal
    method to control the stiffness of fluid-actuated soft array structures. Published

    Figures Review Reports Versions Notes Abstract Modeling and control theory applied
    to precision agriculture irrigation systems have been essential to reduce water
    consumption while growing healthy crops. Specifically, implementing closed-loop
    control irrigation based on soil moisture measurements is an effective approach
    for obtaining water savings in this resource-intensive activity. To enhance this
    strategy, the work presented in this paper proposed a new set of water management
    strategies for the case in which multiple irrigation areas share a single water
    supply source and compared them with heuristic approaches commonly used by farmers
    in practice. The proposed water allocation algorithms are based on techniques
    used in real-time computing, such as dynamic priority and feedback scheduling.
    Therefore, the multi-area irrigation system is presented as a resource allocation
    problem with availability constraints, where water consumption represents the
    main optimization parameter. The obtained results show that the data-driven water
    allocation strategies preserve the water savings for closed-loop control systems
    and avoid crop water stress due to the limited access to irrigation water. Keywords:

    feedback scheduling 1. Introduction According to the Food and Agriculture Organization
    (FAO) of the United Nations, it is estimated that around 70% of all water withdrawal
    worldwide is due to agricultural applications [1], contrasting the industrial
    sector at 20% with municipalities’ local infrastructure for services and domestic
    water use taking the remaining 10%. This seems a logical percentage distribution
    given that around 2000 to 3000 L of water are required to grow food per person
    daily [2]. Nonetheless, what is more concerning regarding this volume of water
    is that 93% never returns to its original source, signifying an apparent complete
    loss of the resource. Irrigation efficiency refers to the ratio of water the crop
    uses to the total amount of water extracted from the source [3]. Different factors
    affect irrigation efficiency, like water run-off, evaporation, and deep percolation.
    Water efficiency mostly depends on the hydraulic infrastructure and irrigation
    method, while surface irrigation has a water efficiency from 50% to 65%, sprinklers
    range from 60% to 85%, and drip irrigation from 80% to 90% [4]. Surface irrigation
    implies surface evaporation, which contributes to water loss. Sprinkler technology
    reduces water loss but, still, the applied water evaporates off the leaves of
    the crop canopy. In contrast, drip irrigation delivers water directly to the plant’s
    root zone, reducing losses due to run-off and evaporation [5]. In any case, water
    efficiency can be considerably improved when a sensor-based smart irrigation system
    is installed over the hydraulic infrastructure [6]. Notwithstanding, food production
    is stated to rise in the following ten years and for many decades to come. In
    [7], the author states that the demand for food and agricultural products is projected
    to further increase by up to 70% by 2050 in order to satisfy the requirements
    for an estimated 10 billion person population by then. That, in addition to the
    growing effect of climate change on water shortage worldwide, can have terrible
    consequences in the near future regarding resource allocation and availability
    for agricultural purposes. Vulnerable communities in arid regions would potentially
    suffer the consequences of water scarcity and global warming more [8]. Moreover,
    severe social conflicts have already occurred in rural communities due to the
    unfair assignation of water resources for agricultural activities [9]. Therefore,
    technology and data-driven solutions for water management are required to improve
    resource efficiency, reduce water waste, and contribute to sustainable agriculture
    practices [10]. The waste and overuse of water resources for crop irrigation is
    a relevant topic that has been addressed by precision agriculture from different
    perspectives [11]. In this sense, automatic irrigation systems aim to optimize
    water utilization while helping farmers to improve crop yields by providing the
    right amount of water, at the right time, in the right place in the field [12].
    To control the amount of water used during irrigation, typically these systems
    conduct measurements of soil moisture levels (volumetric water content), environmental
    parameters (solar radiation, wind speed, air temperature, air humidity), and crop
    conditions (canopy temperature, chlorophyll content, trunk diameter) [6]. Efficient
    water management is typically achieved by implementing closed-loop irrigation,
    where real-time soil moisture measurements gathered from large crop areas determine
    when to activate irrigation. Wireless sensor networks provide the communication
    infrastructure for the devices to transmit and receive data. A control device
    receives soil moisture data from sensors, executes a control algorithm, and activates
    or deactivates the irrigation valves to determine how much water to apply to the
    crops. In addition, the control unit may receive complementary information, such
    as environmental parameters and crop conditions, to improve algorithm accuracy
    using model-based estimations. The strategies to implement the algorithms are
    mostly based on classical and modern control theories like on-off control [13],
    PID (proportional-integral-derivative) control [14], and MPC (model predictive
    control) [15,16]; however, recently artificial intelligent approaches such as
    fuzzy logic [17,18,19], machine learning [20,21], and multi-agent systems [22,23]
    have gained the attention of the research community due to the initial promising
    results in the area of data-driven agriculture. However, most works on closed-loop
    irrigation consider one crop and a single irrigation area without water constraints.
    Therefore, they usually assume full water availability, which in practice is not
    always true, especially in arid regions where water management is a priority for
    sustainable and economically profitable crops. Real-time systems refer to computing
    devices that react within precise time constraints to events in the environment
    [24]. Around this concept, different algorithms have been developed mainly within
    the scope of operating systems theory, where multiple control tasks are simultaneously
    executed, sharing common resources [25]. In these systems, the allocation of resources
    is commonly formulated as a constrained optimization problem, where the aim is
    to maximize the benefits of control performance subject to efficient use of the
    available resources. Real-time computing for control systems has been deployed
    over various fields of industry and services like automotive systems, mobile robotics,
    smart grids, gas and water distribution, and food and petrochemical industries,
    among others [26]. The work presented in this paper integrated modeling and control
    theory with real-time computing to develop dynamic water allocation algorithms
    for precision agriculture, considering different irrigation areas with different
    characteristics, such as crop types, soil conditions, and water needs. Under this
    scenario, water availability is constrained and can only be supplied to one irrigation
    area at a time. Experimental data show that dynamic resource allocation in multiple
    irrigation areas avoids stressed crops and improves water utilization compared
    to the empirical approaches commonly used by farmers. 2. Materials and Methods
    2.1. Irrigation Dynamics An irrigation area can be modeled as a finite two-dimensional
    space where vegetation is to be raised, with water being the primary input resource
    for the system. Other relevant physical variables that can be considered in the
    analysis of the crop’s growth include, but are not limited to, soil physical characteristics
    (texture, structure, drainage), environmental parameters (temperature, air humidity,
    solar radiation, wind speed), and crop attributes (type of crop, development stage,
    plants health). A single variable that can show the irrigation’s overall performance
    concerning water usage is the soil moisture level 𝜃(𝑡) . As evidenced by its name,
    it measures the water in the soil. Soil moisture data are obtained by sensors
    that measure the volumetric water content 𝑉𝑊𝐶 , which is defined as the ratio
    of water volume 𝑉 𝑊 (𝑡) to the unit volume of soil 𝑉 𝑠 (𝑡) . Therefore, soil moisture
    can be defined as 𝜃(𝑡)= 𝑉 𝑤 (𝑡) 𝑉 𝑠 (𝑡) . (1) Even though irrigation dynamics
    present non-linear behavior, it is common to approximate the system as a linear
    model divided into three main operating zones according to normalized soil moisture
    levels [15]. As illustrated in Figure 1, these three areas are denoted as Figure
    1. Water content zones according to the soil moisture level, figure adapted from
    [27]. 1. Gravitational (water saturation zone); 2. Available (water available
    in the root crop zone); 3. Unavailable (hydric stress region). In the first workspace
    region, soil cannot retain water which is allowed to drain freely, provoking a
    significant amount of water waste. The second operating region consists of a state
    where the soil retains water and it is available for the crops. In the third area,
    there is not enough water available; at this point, visible damage can become
    apparent to the vegetation and, if not treated, can lead to crop loss. These three
    zones are exemplified in Figure 2, where it can be noticed that soil moisture
    dynamics are different for each region, and the two irrigation events rapidly
    raise the volumetric water content. Figure 2. Soil moisture dynamics for an irrigation
    system, figure adapted from [15]. Normalized soil moisture uses the maximum allowable
    depletion (MAD) as a reference level and is defined as 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)=𝜃(𝑡)−𝑀𝐴𝐷, (2) where
    MAD specifies the maximum soil water deficit that the crop may support without
    experiencing any water stress. Typically, the MAD level is located at 50% of the
    total available water capacity in the rooting zone [28]. Table 1 illustrates typical
    MAD values and maximum root zone depths for selected crops. As for the field capacity
    (FC), their volumetric water content percentage depends on the soil texture with
    values form 30% to 40% for silt loam, clay loam, and silty clay loam types of
    soil [27]. Table 1. Percentage values for maximum allowable depletion (MAD) and
    ranges of root depth for common crops. Data obtained from Allen et al. (1998)
    [29]. Closed loop irrigation aims to keep soil moisture above MAD and below FC
    level; this is an optimal spot for the stability of the crop’s growth since it
    avoids crop hydric stress and water waste. 2.2. Irrigation Model Based on the
    previous observations, a linearized model at the operating points is proposed;
    it is important to base the irrigation dynamics on experimentally-confirmed differential
    equations that allow for a proper realization of the input–output relationship
    for the system. A model solely based on irrigation as input is too ideal to execute
    according to the expected outcomes. Therefore, another humidity-related environmental
    factor must be added to the equation. This second time-dependent variable will
    be reference evapotranspiration 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡) . It can be inferred as the amalgamation
    of the evaporation and transpiration processes that the vegetation may suffer
    and it can be obtained using weather variables (solar radiation, wind speed, air
    temperature, and relative air humidity) according to the FAO Penman-Monteith method
    [29]. Thus, it accounts for the vaporization of the moisture from the soil surface
    through heat transfer mechanisms such as convection and radiation from the immediate
    environment and it also takes into consideration the loss of water from the plant
    tissues through the stomata. The model can be enhanced by recognizing the variations
    of soil moisture with respect to time. This new variable, 𝜃 ˙ (𝑡) , should be
    equivalent to the difference of humidity inlets minus the outputs of liquid matter,
    according to the law of conservation of matter. Although a realistic model could
    employ dozens of variables, the simplest of them all are sufficient in many cases,
    including the scenario in which the climate is dry with minimum rainfall (which
    is the circumstance in which the 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡) data were collected), a straightforward
    equation can take the following form via the work of [30]: 𝜃 ˙ (𝑡)= 𝑐 1 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)+
    𝑐 2 𝑟𝑓(𝑡)− 𝐾 𝑐 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡)−𝑑𝑝(𝑡), (3) where 𝑖𝑟(𝑡) and 𝑟𝑓(𝑡) represent water inflow
    from irrigation and rainfall since, in arid regions, rainfall does not have a
    significative impact, then coefficient 𝑐 2 is zero, while 𝑐 1 represents the irrigation
    efficiency which depends on the hydraulic infrastructure with values that range
    from 0.3 to 0.9 and may vary considerably from one irrigation area to another.
    Crop coefficient 𝐾 𝑐 in conjunction with the 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡) integrates the actual crop
    evapotranspiration, 𝐾 𝑐 depends on the crop type and crop growth stage, and the
    reference value of 1.0 corresponds to plain grass crop. Finally, 𝑑𝑝(𝑡) stands
    for the effects of deep percolation, which is the gradual descent of surface water
    to underground levels. It is important to remark that the effect of irrigation
    is not immediate and thus a time delay 𝜏 can be considered in the expression.
    This time delay depends on the depth location of the sensors but also soil compactness
    level. As for the deep percolation, as it can be inferred from the soil moisture
    levels in the ground, it can be defined as being proportional to 𝜃(𝑡) . Consequently,
    the soil water balance model can be re-written as 𝜃 ˙ (𝑡)= 𝑐 1 𝑖𝑟(𝑡−𝜏)− 𝐾 𝑐 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡)−
    𝑐 3 𝜃(𝑡), (4) where 𝑐 3 denotes the proportionality of the soil moisture to the
    deep percolation effect. Now, (4) can be represented as a second-order state space
    model in the form of 𝑥 ˙ (𝑡)=𝑨𝑥(𝑡)+𝑩𝑢(𝑡), (5) where 𝐀,𝐁∈ ℝ 2×2 are the state and
    input matrices, which incorporate coefficients 𝑐 1 , 𝑐 3 , and 𝐾 𝑐 , and they
    can be experimentally obtained from measurements per crop area. The state vector
    𝑥(𝑡) and the input vector 𝑢(𝑡) are respectively defined as 𝑥(𝑡)=[ 𝜃(𝑡) 𝛿(𝑡) ]
    (6) and 𝑢(𝑡)=[ 𝑖𝑟(𝑡−𝜏) 𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡) ], (7) where 𝛿(𝑡)= 𝜃 ˙ (𝑡) and denotes the dynamic
    of the soil moisture variations. 2.3. Model Validation Over 45 days, data were
    collected from four different irrigation areas with different crop types, irrigation
    systems, and soil characteristics, as denoted in Table 2. Table 2. Irrigation
    areas characteristics used for data collection. As depicted in Figure 3, the irrigation
    areas were monitored with a solar cell-powered data acquisition system that sensed
    the crop soil moisture level every minute from three volumetric water content
    sensors (10HS Sensor from Meter Group), solar radiation (PYR Sensor from Meter
    Group), wind speed (Davis Cup from Meter Group), air temperature and relative
    humidity (VP-4 Sensor from Meter Group), and water consumption (Flow-Sync from
    Hunter Industries) through a wireless sensor network as described in [31]. Figure
    3. Evaluated irrigation areas. Coefficients values for matrices 𝐀 and 𝐁 from Equation
    (5) were experimentally obtained to model the soil moisture dynamics for each
    evaluated area properly. The estimation algorithm proposed by [15] was used to
    create a linear dynamic state space model for each operating zone (gravitational,
    available, and unavailable). Figure 4 shows the correlation between the estimated
    normalized soil moisture values calculated from the model 𝜃 ̂  𝑁 (𝑡) and the normalized
    measured soil moisture values obtained from the sensor readings 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡) for a
    specific crop. Irrigation flow 𝑖𝑟(𝑡) is expressed in m 3 /mm and reference evapotranspiration
    𝑒𝑡𝑜(𝑡) in mm/day. Correlation results showed that the identified model adequately
    captured the irrigation dynamics for the crop. Figure 4. Validation results for
    the system identification. Once the proposed irrigation model was experimentally
    validated with four different crops, an optimization problem was formulated to
    evaluate the various water management strategies for a case where multiple irrigation
    areas share a water supply source. 2.4. Optimization Problem For real-time systems,
    control performance optimization and efficient use of the available resources
    are two key elements in the design of resource-constrained control applications
    [24]. This paper analyzed the scenario in which four irrigation areas with different
    crops compete for water supply. The proposed algorithms try to solve a water management
    optimization problem in order to minimize water consumption and crop hydric stress
    subject to the constraint of water availability, which can be defined as minimize
    𝐽= 1 𝑛 ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 ( 𝐽 𝑐 𝑖 + 𝐽 𝑠 𝑖 ) (8) subjectto ∑ 𝑖=1 𝑛 𝑐 𝑖 ℎ 𝑖 ≤ 𝑈 𝑟𝑒𝑓 , (9) where
    n is the number of irrigation areas, J is the cost function which integrates water
    consumption 𝐽 𝑐 and crop hydric stress 𝐽 𝑠 for the i area. Also, 𝑐 𝑖 is the irrigation
    time required to move soil moisture from the low threshold to the high threshold
    for each specific area and ℎ 𝑖 is the task period which represents the deadline
    before soil moisture reached stress levels. Finally, 𝑈 𝑟𝑒𝑓 is the required water
    utilization level for the entire group of n irrigation areas. Cost functions for
    water consumption and hydric stress are respectively defined as 𝐽 𝑐 = 1 𝑡 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠
    ∑ 𝑘=1 𝑡 𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙 𝑖 𝑟 𝑘 (10) 𝐽 𝑠 = 100 𝑡 𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙 ∑ 𝑘=1 𝑡 𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙 𝑠 𝑘 , (11) where 𝑡 𝑒𝑣𝑎𝑙
    is the total number of minutes for the 45 days evaluation period. 𝐽 𝑐 is the daily
    water consumption in m 3 /day, while 𝐽 𝑠 is the percentage of time that the crop
    suffers from hydric stress; hence, s corresponds to the total time the crop soil
    moisture level is under the maximum allowable depletion level, i.e., 𝜃 𝑁 <𝑀𝐴𝐷
    . Figure 5 shows the evaluated scenario, where a single water source supplies
    irrigation to only one area at a time by activating the electro-valves (actuators)
    while the sensors conduct periodic soil moisture and environmental measurements.
    The water management algorithm runs in the controller to schedule the irrigation
    events for the areas. Figure 5. Irrigation system for four areas. 2.5. Evaluated
    Algorithms A total of six algorithms were evaluated for a simulation time of 45
    days. The evaluation was conducted through a simulation implemented in the Python
    programming language. The first algorithm considers the ideal case where no water
    constraint is considered; each irrigation area receives water immediately when
    needed. Then, two heuristic irrigation algorithms based on time-partitioning schemes
    and three data-driven techniques based on real-time control were considered in
    the analysis. 1. Full-Satisfaction Irrigation (FSI): This ideal case was used
    as a reference, where no water constraint was applied. If the moisture level is
    found below some established level 𝑀𝐴𝐷 , it is time for irrigation. The input
    signal stops when the soil moisture reaches a certain ceiling 𝐹𝐶 . 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 represents
    the flow in m 3 /min provided by the hydraulic system when the electro-valve is
    activated. Therefore, 𝑖𝑟(𝑡) has only two possible values: {0,𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒} . The control
    law can be summarized as an on–off hysteresis controller with full water availability:
    𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0, 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)<𝑀𝐴𝐷 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)>𝐹𝐶. (12) 2. Time Partitioning Irrigation
    (TPI): In this heuristic algorithm, a time slot is assigned to each area; during
    this time period, the area is irrigated until field capacity is reached. Let 𝑇
    𝑖 be the period of time placed in the i-th order where area i can be irrigated.
    The irrigation cycle is formed by 𝑇=( 𝑇 0 ,…, 𝑇 𝑖 ,…, 𝑇 𝑘 ) . Once 𝑇 𝑘 is over,
    the circle repeats itself. Irrigation on area i cannot occur if, at time 𝑡,𝑡∉
    𝑇 𝑖 . Therefore, 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0, (𝑡∈ 𝑇 𝑖 )∧( 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)<𝑀𝐴𝐷) (𝑡∉ 𝑇 𝑖 )∨( 𝜃 𝑁
    (𝑡)>𝐹𝐶). (13) 3. Greedy Time Slotting (GTS): Like TPI, irrigation is divided into
    fixed time slots in a predetermined order. The main difference is that to recompense
    the expected stress during the periods of no irrigation, watering will be forced
    as long as 𝑡∈ 𝑇 𝑖 . Therefore, the proposed control law is 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0,
    𝑡∈ 𝑇 𝑖 𝑡∉ 𝑇 𝑖 . (14) 4. Mutual Exclusion Resource Locking (MERL): In this data-driven
    algorithm analog to a first-come, first-serve scheme, the first land lot under
    the 𝑀𝐴𝐷 level will gain access to water for irrigation. While it is being watered,
    no other crop can be irrigated. It deals with the scenarios of access collision
    like in the dining philosophers’ problem proposed by [32]. Different processes
    (irrigation areas) may require access to a shared resource (water supply) in this
    strategy. Then, to control concurrency and avoid deadlock, a mechanism (algorithm)
    allows access only if the resource is available; if not, the process will wait
    a random period of time to check if the resource is now available. It is not a
    perfect solution but, given a good random seed, the probability that different
    processes keep colliding becomes null in practice. The proposed control law is
    defined as 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0, ( 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)<𝑀𝐴𝐷)∧(𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟=𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒) ( 𝜃 𝑁 (𝑡)>𝐹𝐶)∨(𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟≠𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒).
    (15) 5. Earliest Estimated Deadline First (EEDF): Given that an available mathematical
    model is obtained through system identification techniques [33], an approximate
    behavior of the real plant can be estimated. To determine which irrigation area
    to give the most priority, one can compute which one has the sooner deadline and
    define a priority ranking among the competing areas. The deadline is calculated
    by estimating the time for the area to reach the 𝑀𝐴𝐷 threshold since, below this
    level, the crop will suffer from hydric stress. In this dynamic scheduling algorithm,
    the highest priority is assigned to the task with the earliest deadline to avoid
    water stress. Once the area has access to the water supply, no preemption is allowed
    until the irrigation area reaches the field capacity level. The proposed control
    law is defined as 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0, (ℎ∈𝑚𝑖𝑛{ ℎ 𝑖 })∧(𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟=𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒) (ℎ∉𝑚𝑖𝑛{
    ℎ 𝑖 })∨(𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟≠𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒). (16) 6. Dynamic Feedback Priority (DFP): This resource-aware
    algorithm is based on the feedback scheduling concept, where the resource manager
    continuously monitors the soil moisture level for all the areas. Similarly to
    the EEDF strategy, the water resource is assigned to the irrigation area based
    on how close the moisture level is with respect to the 𝑀𝐴𝐷 threshold to avoid
    water stress. Here, the difference is that the resource manager may preemptively
    interrupt the current irrigation area anytime if it is determined that another
    area is in a more critical stage, i.e., closer to the water stress limit. Unlike
    the previous scheduling technique, where the priority will be calculated after
    finishing the irrigation, in this new dynamic feedback algorithm, the priority
    is continuously estimated for each sample period, 𝑖𝑟(𝑡)={ 𝐼𝑟𝑟𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒, 0, ℎ∈𝑚𝑖𝑛{
    ℎ 𝑖 } ℎ∉𝑚𝑖𝑛{ ℎ 𝑖 }. (17) 3. Results and Discussion The evaluation results in terms
    of water stress percentage 𝐽 𝑠 and water consumed daily 𝐽 𝑐 are displayed in Figure
    6, with a legend to signal the four individual areas and their performances. The
    left side belongs to an ideal case and the empirical methods, while the right
    side stands for the proposed data-driven techniques. Figure 6. Numerical results
    of the 45-day simulation period for each irrigation area following the scheduling
    policies and the constraints imposed into the system. (a) Water stress on each
    area for the ideal case and the heuristic algorithms. (b) Water stress on each
    area for the data-driven algorithms. (c) Irrigation water consumed daily in m
    3 by area for the ideal case and the heuristic algorithms. (d) Irrigation water
    consumed daily in m 3 by area for the data-driven algorithms. The ideal scenario
    of unlimited water is present in the FSI algorithm. Under there, every time the
    sensed moisture goes below the permitted threshold, irrigation is activated regardless
    of the state of the other lots. When it surpasses the upper threshold, irrigation
    stops. Therefore, as expected, the crops spend practically no time under stress
    even though it may consume a surplus of water. Otherwise, TPI irrigates only when
    necessary during the selected time slots permitted periodically. One can infer
    that, although it will save a good amount of resources, the plant will be placed
    under constant stress for most of the study horizon. If one agrees to irrigate
    heedless of the state variables during the allowed period, the expected result
    is a reduced level of water stress due to the incoming stagnant water to alleviate
    the climate in the subsequent periods at the expense of an augmented degree of
    resource usage. GTS is a technique commonly used by farmers to reduce crop water
    stress, since they use the soil to store water for the future; however, soil capacity
    to store water is very limited and this considerably increases the water waste.
    MERL enables the capacity to emulate the limitless resource case’s response while
    setting boundaries on how much water can be used in practice. Hence, the overall
    performance under this algorithm is similar to FSI. Earliest deadline scheduling
    functions similarly to the time-division multiplexed algorithms, with a considerable
    upgrade. EEDF, by always following the then-closest area to moisture fulfillment,
    ensures that the periods between irrigation will always be the shortest ones possible.
    However, three crops suffered from water stress under this algorithm and only
    one avoided the hydric stress; this can be explained by the no preemption mechanism
    imposed by the algorithm. Finally, the DFP algorithm obtained similar results
    to the MERL approach. This is because it is essentially a straight line along
    the lower threshold of the moisture level percentage. Nonetheless, it is excellent
    yet surprising news. The only mode in which one can achieve this kind of constant
    response is by periodically placing marginal magnitudes of the input at a fast
    and constant rate. This sort of reaction is the same as in drip irrigation, where
    the water is placed drop by drop into the root area. This method minimizes the
    erosion and evaporation of water commonly found in sprinkler irrigation while
    saving up to 60% of the water used and increasing crop yield by over 50% (see
    [34]). At first sight, the data-driven approaches seem to improve the extent of
    hydric stress in submerged areas. Also, they present a more organized and fair
    way to distribute the resources with the correct constraints in a real land lot.
    For a deeper evaluation, Table 3 presents the obtained cost function results as
    defined by Equations (10) and (11). Table 3. Cost function results of the evaluated
    algorithms. It can be observed that, even though the heuristic approaches tend
    to the highest and lowest values in both categories, the ability of the data-driven
    methods is more balanced and they produce an overall better performance. It is
    clear that, with the exception of EEDF, the plant suffers from much less hydric
    stress than with the heuristic methods. Additionally, at most, MERL and DFP allowed
    just under 5% water stress, while TPI and GTS put the crop under stress for more
    than 20% the duration of its intended growth. Additionally, water consumption
    stays below the ideal scenario of FSI, whose only true competitor is time partitioning
    schemes that increment the water stress exponentially, making them unsuitable
    for actual applications even if they are already used in practice by most farmers
    due to their experience and background. Of all the above, the best irrigation
    strategies that one can and should implement are the mutual exclusion resource
    locking (MERL) and the dynamic feedback priority (DFP), since they provided a
    balance of avoiding water stress while reducing water consumption in comparison
    with the heuristic TPI and GTS approaches. The first one shows how arbitrarily
    blocking the access of some agents to the main hydration supply can diminish the
    expenses and protect the vital resources in play while at the same time keeping
    the areas in good condition. The latter has more rewards that safeguard water
    utilization in this sector and consider the conservation of the immediate environment.
    The obtained results have demonstrated that data-driven water management strategies
    reduce irrigation water consumption while avoiding water stress on crops in conditions
    where multiple crop areas share a water supply. However, the drawbacks of implementing
    these automated solutions reside in the installation and maintenance cost, which
    most farmers are unwilling to accept if the return on investment is not clearly
    defined. To illustrate this, just the acquisition cost and the proper installation
    and maintenance of soil moisture sensors have a high level of complexity [31]:
    sensors require individual off-line calibration for the specific soil texture
    to reach a reliable accuracy, then installation must be carefully conducted to
    avoid soil air gaps to obtain representative readings; also, at least three sensors
    are required for an irrigation area and it is a good practice to unearth sensors
    each year for re-calibration. Since soil moisture sensor is, so far, the element
    on which closed-loop irrigation is based, lowering costs and efforts must be a
    priority to make sensor-based automated irrigation a feasible option for farmers.
    4. Conclusions A set of dynamic water allocation algorithms was proposed to optimize
    water consumption and avoid hydric stress for an agricultural irrigation system
    composed of multiple areas and a single water source. The dynamics of each area
    were modeled to represent different crops with different soil properties. The
    water management algorithms were integrated with closed-loop controllers based
    on soil moisture measurements for each irrigation area. Simulation results based
    on experimental data showed that the proposed strategies obtained a similar performance
    regarding water savings and avoiding water-stressed crops to when total water
    is available. They provided superior results compared with the heuristic strategies
    commonly used by farmers in practice. The proposed data-driven algorithms were
    formulated as a real-time computing optimization problem with resource constraints.
    The results encourage looking for other data-driven techniques to be applied in
    irrigation management. Water management for agricultural activities may have different
    perspectives: environmental, social, and economic, and the use of data-driven
    solutions may positively impact sustainable agriculture practices. Therefore,
    future works consider implementation in vulnerable communities where farmers share
    common water resources. Author Contributions Conceptualization, C.L. and A.F.-C.;

    Water, one of the most valuable resources, is underutilized in irrigated rice
    production. The yield of rice, a staple food across the world, is highly dependent

    ranked food staple in the world, feeding one third (2.6 billion) of the population
    (7.8 billion). About 90% [1] of the world’s rice is produced in Asia, and it is
    the fastest growing staple food in Africa and Latin America [2] due to its ease
    of preparation compared to that of corn and wheat. It provides 21% of global human
    energy per capita and is the largest single source of energy [3]. A total of 75%
    of world rice is produced in 92 million hectares of irrigated lowland, and Asia
    occupies 56% of this land [4]. Irrigated rice uses up to 43% of the world’s irrigated
    water, which is two to three times more than other irrigated crops, and thus places
    an excessive demand on water usage compared to other staple crops. Bangladesh,
    an Asian country with a growing population and an increasing demand for rice,
    is playing an important role in rice research. According to the Bangladesh Rice
    Research Institute (BRRI), the main source of irrigation for rice is from ground
    water. However, the ground water is retrieved using shallow tube wells (STW) and
    deep tube wells (DTW), which is resulting in deteriorating ground water levels
    [5]. The production of 1 kg of rice requires 3000–5000 L of water [6], and Boro
    rice, which is generally grown in dry months, predominantly relies upon the groundwater.
    In order to address this situation, the International Rice Research Institute
    (IRRI) developed an irrigation method called alternate wetting and drying (AWD)
    that requires 30% less water than the traditional irrigation method used during
    the growing phase [7]. Studies presented in [8] have shown that, compared to the
    traditional method, AWD requires five fewer irrigation cycles and fewer pumps
    which saves about 40% of fuel. Besides minimizing the use of groundwater, AWD
    reduces irrigation cycles without affecting the yield [9]. Due to intermittent
    flooding in AWD, emission of the greenhouse gas methane (CH4) is reduced by 73%
    in the dry season and by 21% in the wet season [10], compared to the continuous
    flooding method. This also decreases arsenic concentration in the shoots of rice
    plants [11]. Unlike other countries adopting AWD, where water is charged based
    on volumetric usage, most of Bangladesh’s irrigation water is charged per hectare,
    without any incentives for the farmers to reduce their water usage. Sharing a
    single pump amongst the farmers often gives rise to conflicts that usually deter
    any collaborative effort [11], which is a key point of AWD. The lack of proper
    knowledge and information sharing are also limiting the adoption of the AWD method.
    Research has shown that there is a significant opportunity for AWD in Southeast
    Asian countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam [12]; however, due to social, economic,
    and technical challenges, the AWD method is not well perceived in these regions
    [13]. Besides the challenges of AWD described above, applying AWD to a wide area
    poses additional challenges, such as monitoring and controlling the complex mechanism,
    before it can become economically feasible. To achieve this, an automated IoT-connected
    wireless sensor network (WSN) is required. WSN is a network of sensors that accumulates
    monitoring data in centrally located storage, such as cloud storage. Most WSNs
    require three different types of network elements including the sensor node (SN),
    the cluster head (CH) and the data sink (DS), also called a base station, as shown
    in Figure 1a. All of the SNs are distributed into multiple, unequal clusters headed
    by a CH that sends sensor data to the DS. Functionally, the clustering process
    and data transfer protocol may vary depending on the nature of the application
    and the distribution of the SNs. Recent applications also require these WSNs to
    be connected with other networks through gateways and to the internet infrastructure
    [14], as shown in Figure 1a. Figure 1. (a) Network elements and functional layers
    of the IoT-connected wireless sensor network (WSN), and (b) Automated AWD-specific
    WSN with IoT connectivity. IoT is the network of various smart devices to facilitate
    information flow to the end-user through the existing internet. The exponential
    growth and distribution of IoT devices are giving rise to numerous innovative
    and real-life applications. COVID-SAFE [15] monitors and predicts the infection
    by monitoring social distancing with the help of wearable IoT devices. Various
    wearable IoT devices are used for human emotion recognition [16] to facilitate
    online communication. The growth of the IoT applications, such as smart health
    using wearable IoT devices and smart cities, results in security threats to the
    network itself. The authors [17] proposed an IoT Botnet Detection using salp swarm
    algorithm (SSA) and ant lion optimization (ALO) models to minimize security threats.
    Authors of [18] proposed an enhanced information-centric networking (ICN) for
    IoT using artificial intelligence (AI) and edge computing in the internet cloud.
    Studies are conducted on the design and fabrication technologies to utilize smart
    IoT devices [19]. The researchers focus on IoT nodes’ accurate and fast localization
    [20]. IoT connected to WSN has been implemented on a limited scale in agriculture
    as reported in [21,22,23,24]. Most WSN- and IoT-based irrigation automation systems
    utilize soil moisture content and other environmental variables to schedule irrigation
    without considering plant growth; however, this is insufficient for automating
    the AWD method and gaining the farmers’ trust. Besides monitoring and controlling
    the pumps, an effective water distribution system through pipes is also required,
    giving rise to the added complexity of having to both monitoring and controlling
    the distribution system. Moreover, present WSN technologies are optimized for
    applications with densely populated SN and small area coverage. Wide-area monitoring
    requires long-range and low-power wireless connectivity [25]. Therefore, wide-area
    AWD automation involves three different WSNs, dedicated for (1) field water-level
    and environmental monitoring; (2) irrigation system monitoring; and (3) irrigation
    system controlling, as shown in Figure 1b. Therefore, densely populated and widely
    distributed sensor and actuator nodes are required for these three different WSNs.
    These three WSNs will be interconnected virtually. Traditional WSN virtualization
    involves multilayer connectivity and control, which increases inter-layer WSN
    traffic [26] for the AWD application. Besides wide-area coverage, automated AWD
    also requires external parameters, such as real-time weather forecast data, plant
    physiological data, and the farmers’ input. These data can be used by connecting
    the WSNs with different servers throughout the IoT network, as shown in Figure
    1b. Literature shows that large-scale irrigation is required to limit water usage
    to provide more water for the growing industrial sectors and increasing urban
    population [27,28]. Large-scale multiple cropping can further limit water usage
    [29] using the automated irrigation framework proposed in this article. Despite
    the inherent advantages of the AWD, both small- and large-scale implementations
    are yet to achieve the expected success for lack of proper adaptation of technologies,
    namely IoT and WSN [30]. Moreover, the large-scale implementation of an irrigation
    system, such as AWD, involves multiple stakeholders and different technologies.
    That may require an effective dimensioning tool for a practical convergent solution.
    The research presented in this article has focused on automation through proper
    technology adoption by providing a mathematical model and addressing all the required
    systems. The proposed mathematical model considers the irrigation system as a
    distributed system. It separates its components into pipe networks, localized
    water control, and clustered pumps with centralized control, thus making the automation
    platform applicable to AWD and non-AWD irrigation systems. The pipe network will
    facilitate both micro- and macro-level irrigation control in a scalable manner.
    The distributed health monitoring of the pipe network and the clustered pumps
    will make the system more fault-tolerant. Various field-level sensors in an IoT-connected
    WSN will help build a long-term database enabling scientific research to study
    the impact of climate change on crop yield [31], physiological changes, greenhouse
    gas emissions for different crops, and the application of various irrigation models.
    The major contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows. (1) Develop
    a dimensioning model for large-scale implementation of AWD using pipes, actuator-based
    water distribution, and clustered pumps. (2) Design WSN architecture combining
    three different functionalities with IoT-based automation for scalability and
    effective control and operation of the overall system. (3) Develop a low-power
    and long-range (LoRa) sensor node and data sink using LoRa, 3G, and WiFi interfaces
    for field monitoring using an IoT network. (4) Sample automation algorithms for
    the closed-loop AWD control using various internal and external parameters that
    can be used in both the WSNs and the IoT connected network. (5) Provision for
    scientific research through the database of long-term sensor data and applying
    Machine Learning (ML) for future wide-area implementation. The rest of the paper
    is organized as follows. Section 2 reviews existing literature related to the
    automation of AWD. Section 3 discusses the problem formulation for the automation
    of large scale AWD while Section 4 provides the proposed solution. Section 5 describes
    the system design and integration of WSN with AWD. Section 6 provides a description
    of the related field trial and Section 7 describes the performance of the system.

    2. Related Work Irrigation automation is not a very recent phenomenon and, as
    a result, is usually performed by adopting existing mathematical models and optimization
    algorithms. These primarily control the irrigation pumps to maximize water utilization.
    Baki et al. [32] have proposed a numerical scheme that utilizes weather forecasts
    and the water flow in soils to determine the optimal irrigation depth on scheduled
    irrigation days for the highest irrigation efficiency and optimum crop yield.
    Shahdany et al. [33] developed a mathematical model to automate canal irrigation
    using both known and unknown water demands for different irrigation systems. Besides
    the model-based optimization approaches, machine learning is also used by [34]
    to predict crop irrigation requirements based on soil parameters. Linker et al.
    [35] proposed a real-time and sub-optimal irrigation scheduling system that utilizes
    weather data alongside the crop’s physiological state and soil water availability.
    However, users need to decide between yield and irrigation performance depending
    on their applications. To achieve better optimization, Munir et al. [36] included
    parameters such as the plant type, watering time, air humidity, light intensity,
    and soil type for their fuzzy logic-based irrigation scheduling system that uses
    low power sensor-nodes. In [37], the authors designed an irrigation controller
    prototype based on the fuzzy rule to inspect water wastage by providing an optimal
    irrigation environment for farming. An artificial neural network (ANN) is used
    by [38] to predict soil moisture changes and to schedule irrigation based on climatic
    information and rooting depth. This ANN method was compared with the established
    water stress (WS) method, which well predicted the soil moisture during the main
    growing season, but was error prone at lower soil moisture levels. ANN and non-linear
    regression (NLR) were used by [39] to find the distances between the emitters
    in order to achieve optimum drip irrigation in the wet areas. Human expertise
    is also used by [40] for their proposed online decision support system (DSS),
    which consists of a meteorological model for weather forecasts, and a computational
    model for soil water balance and irrigation scheduling. It generates an irrigation
    schedule for a week in advance based on the DSS data repository. Irrigation automation
    is further upgraded by utilizing various sensors, wireless links, and internet
    infrastructure due to the increasing availability and decreasing cost of these
    technologies. Water level-based scheduling was proposed by [41] and uses a low-cost
    water level sensor along with inputs from the local farmers through the IoT. In
    [42], the authors present a framework using an IoT-based water distribution and
    management system that utilizes water flow meters, ultrasonic sensors and motors.
    The over-usage of freshwater for flood irrigation is addressed by [43]. The author
    proposed an IoT-based intelligent decision support system to improve the farmer’s
    water utilization by using weather data and sensor data. A complete irrigation
    supervisory control and data acquisition ( SCADA) with WSN was implemented by
    [44] to compare seven different irrigation scheduling algorithms and found that
    soil-based approaches were not adequate in providing sufficient water for the
    plants. Recently, more irrigation research on automated AWD systems is being reported
    in the academic literature. Localized pump automation is achieved by sensing the
    water level lacking remote monitoring or IoT connectivity and using solar panels
    as the power source [45]. An IoT-based system integrates laser sensors for precise
    water level measurement for automation of the AWD technique [46]. The proposed
    system was implemented for different sizes of fields, from 0.7 acres to 55.8 acres.
    Besides these local and remote irrigation automations, performance optimization
    of the WSN platform is also focused on by [47]. They developed a 3D ray-launching
    (3D-RL) deterministic algorithm to characterize the radio channel of LoRa and
    LoRa wide area network (LoRaWAN) in order to provide better connectivity to transmit
    sensor data in obstacle filled scenarios for irrigation automation. Cardoso et
    al. [48] have proposed a narrow band IoT (NB-IoT) and LoRa-based system to monitor
    and schedule irrigation using machine learning. Unlike irrigation automation,
    AWD requires additional parameters such as plant physiological data in order to
    automate the irrigation system. As discussed in the previous paragraph, some irrigation
    automation utilizes weather data or plant physiological information from the farmer;
    however, this platform targeted only a single pump as the irrigation control unit.
    Most of these solutions are offline, of the open-loop type, and do not synthesize
    the data from all of the different sources. They lack wide-area considerations
    and do not focus on the complexity that comes with the integration of multiple
    physical and logical WSNs with the IoT. Proper dimensioning of pipe-based water
    distribution networks, pump clustering, irrigation depth, and plant lifecycle-specific
    schedule mapping is absent. Therefore, any one of them individually or in combination
    may not be suitable for the automation of the AWD method in wide area applications,
    which is highly required for the socio-economic success of the AWD implementation.
    3. Problem Formulation As one of the rice-producing countries of southwest Asia,
    Bangladesh produces three types of rice: Aus, Aman, and Boro. The north-west part
    of Bangladesh produces more than one-third of these three types of rice and 35%
    of Boro rice is produced in the country. Hence, the irrigated lowland of this
    part can be considered for the AWD implementation, as shown in Figure 2. Figure
    2a shows the annual Boro production areas in overall Bangladesh. Figure 2. Boro
    production and illustrative implementation of AWD in Bangladesh; (a) Total Boro
    cultivation (2015–2016), (b) Portion of the medium Boro production zone focused
    for AWD implementation as marked in (a) by the red box, and (c) closer view of
    an IoT-based AWD system. For implementation of the wide area AWD, a portion of
    the medium Boro production area that produces less than 16% Boro [49] and lacks
    adequate irrigation facilities, as marked by the yellow box in Figure 2b which
    was chosen as the test site. Figure 2c shows the land condition of this area.
    The AWD zone is 5 km by 20 km, covering more than 24 thousand acres of cultivable
    lands that suffers from lack of irrigation. The closest water source is a river
    which is at least 2 km away from the cultivable land. Therefore, traditional canal-based
    irrigation methods are inadequate as they can suffer from water seepage of about
    40% [50]. Furthermore, manual AWD is not able to provide efficient water level
    control over this large area of irrigated land. The proposed IoT-based automation
    system with pipe-based water transportation and distribution using the AWD system
    may reduce the seepage loss by up to 90% [51]. Local or centralized automation
    is not adequate in monitoring and controlling the large number of elements in
    the AWD system. Therefore, an intelligent layered IoT-based closed-loop automation
    system is required and is proposed for this project. 4. Proposed Solution The
    proposed automation of AWD is a closed-loop control system that uses an IoT based
    WSN, which is represented by a simplified block diagram as shown in Figure 3.
    This system has three different types of inputs, which are: (i) environmental
    inputs from the field and weather forecast server; (ii) irrigation inputs from
    a plant physiology database; and (iii) inputs from the users of the pumping network
    and water distribution system. Figure 3. Functional blocks of the IoT–WSN-based
    AWD automation control loop. The environmental parameters to be monitored are
    temperature, pressure, humidity, and the greenhouse gas methane ( 𝐶 𝐻 4 ) . Rice
    fields emit a considerable amount of methane, which can be reduced significantly
    by the intermittent flooding that occurs in the AWD method. The field temperature,
    pressure, and humidity data are required to calculate the evapotranspiration loss,
    seepage loss, and water level of the field, which are used to calculate the basic
    parameters used in the AWD method. Other environmental parameters, such as wind
    speed and daylight, can be collected from the weather forecast server through
    the IoT cloud. The wide area AWD requires an adequate number of pumping machines
    and a pipe-based water distribution system to meet the field irrigation requirement.
    To maintain uniform irrigation throughout the area, the water pressures of the
    pipes need to be monitored continuously. The actuators for the water outlets and
    pumps are controlled to maintain proper pressure and water flow during the wetting
    phase of the AWD method. Additionally, the pump power and mechanical parameters
    need to be monitored continually. The crop coefficient ( 𝐾 𝑐  ) determines the
    AWD stages and can be determined from plant physiological data stored in the database
    and from input entered by farmers. The external data obtained from sensors in
    the field, the weather forecast, the crop coefficient, and user input are combined
    and processed in the closed control loop by the cloud-based AWD server through
    the IoT network. The control logic generated by the cloud server is then sent
    to the actuators and pumps through the IoT network to control the irrigation processes.
    All of the sensor nodes (SN) and actuator nodes (AN) are grouped into clusters
    and connected with the base-station (BS) through the cluster head (CH) using a
    LoRa wireless interface. The BS connects the whole WSN to the IoT network through
    the general packet radio service (GPRS) or third generation (3G) cellular network
    as per availability and coverage. The BS also acts as the WSN to an IoT gateway
    that converts the SN/AN data packets to message query telemetry transport (MQTT)
    messages. 5. System Design and Integration The proposed AWD automation consists
    of two main parts: (a) design and dimensioning of the AWD system; and (b) design
    and integration of the WSN. The AWD method at its core is an irrigation schedule
    that depends on certain the water requirements which vary depending on soil condition
    and the growth stages of the crop. Automation of the AWD using the IoT and WSN
    requires the sensor and actuator networks to be designed together, integration
    of various service modules, and development of the software algorithm. These are
    described in the following sub-sections. 5.1. Irrigation Scheduling The water
    volume of the irrigated field changes due to evapotranspiration and percolation.
    Evapotranspiration is influenced by the crop’s growing stage, wind speed, solar
    radiation, temperature, humidity, and soil properties. The crop evapotranspiration
    (𝐸 𝑇 𝑐 ) [52] can be calculated as 𝐸 𝑇 𝑐 =𝐸 𝑇 0 × 𝐾 𝑐  (1) where ( 𝐾 𝑐 ) is the
    crop coefficient (potency of soil evaporation and crop transpiration), and (𝐸
    𝑇 0 ) is the reference evapotranspiration. Among the different methods, the Food
    and Agriculture Organization’s (FAO) Penman–Monteith method [52] is considered
    to be the best estimation for 𝐸 𝑇 0 , and can be expressed as 𝐸 𝑇 0 = 0.408Δ (
    𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺)+γ 900 𝑇+273 𝑢 2 ( 𝑒 𝑠 − 𝑒 𝑎 ) Δ+γ(1+0.34 𝑢 2 )   (2) where, 𝑅 𝑛 = net
    radiation at the crop surface ( MJ m −2 d −1 ) , G = soil heat flux density (
    MJ m −2 d −1 ) , T = mean air temperature (°C), Δ = slope of saturation vapor
    curve (kPa°C−1), 𝑢 2 = wind speed ( ms −1 ), 𝑒 𝑠 = saturation vapor pressure (kPa),
    and 𝑒 𝑎 = actual vapor pressure (kPa). Water requirements for rice (WRR) in cm/day
    is given in Equation (3), which measures the receding water level. 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 =(𝐸
    𝑇 𝑜 × 𝐾 𝑐 𝑗 )+𝑃𝐸𝑅𝐶 (3) where PERC is the percolation loss from water seeping into
    the ground through pores, and j is the growth-stage index (1 to 3). Figure 4 illustrates
    the irrigation scheduling for the AWD method. The irrigation frequency (lower
    row) changes along with the development stages of the crop. Three development
    stages (transplantation, flowering, and panicle initiation) along with a water
    level indicator (middle row) are shown to indicate where continuous standing water
    and irrigation scheduling is required. Figure 4. Irrigation scheduling in alternate
    wetting and drying (AWD) irrigation method. The different crop coefficients, including
    Kc of rice, for these three stages are shown in Figure 4 [53]. It is quite evident
    when AWD is initiated that, for approximately 5 to 8 days, depending on the soil
    type, no irrigation is required [54]. Continuous standing water is required at
    the beginning of all three stages which approximates to about 30 days in total;
    hence, utilization of the AWD method is suspended during these times. Therefore,
    depending on the stages and in accordance with the 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 , irrigation scheduling
    is applied. Irrigation scheduling is divided into two sections. The first section
    is for continuous standing water and the second section is for AWD period. Continuous
    Standing Water: For the three development stages, if the standing water level
    recedes to 2 cm from 5 cm as given in Equation (4), then the irrigation schedule
    or cycle 𝐼 1𝑗 is applied using Equation (5). 𝐼 1𝑗 represents the number of times
    the pump is turned on and is used to maintain a continuous water level of 5 cm
    above the ground. In this equation, TPFj is the total number of days related to
    the transplantation, panicle initiation, and flowering stages. 𝑖𝑓 ∑ 𝑡=1 𝑇 𝑊𝑅 𝑅
    𝑗 (𝑡)=3 cm 𝑖𝑛 𝑇 𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠, 𝑗∈{1,2,3}  (4) 𝐼 1𝑗 = 𝑇𝑃 𝐹 𝑗 𝑇 (5) Establishment of continuous
    standing water during these stages is necessary as rice is quite sensitive to
    fluctuation in water level. Alternate Wetting and Drying Method: For the AWD method,
    when the water level falls 5 cm from above the ground and reaches 15 cm below
    the surface as given in Equation (6), then irrigation 𝐼 2 , which is the number
    of times the pump is turned on, is implemented using Equation (7), where 𝑊 𝑗 is
    the total days for the AWD method, to bring the water level back to 5 cm above
    the surface. 𝑖𝑓 ∑ 𝑡=1 𝑇 1 𝑊𝑅 𝑅 𝑗 (𝑡)=5 cm 𝑖𝑛  𝑇 1  𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠  𝑎𝑏𝑜𝑣𝑒 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒  𝑎𝑛𝑑  𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑐𝑜𝑙𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛
    𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑠 =15 𝑐𝑚 𝑖𝑛  𝑇 2  𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠 𝑏𝑒𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑓𝑎𝑐𝑒     (6) 𝐼 2𝑗 = 𝑊 𝑗 𝑇 1 + 𝑇 2 𝑗∈{1,2,3}
    (7) The AWD method is utilized in three different stages of the plant development
    period: (i) 15 days after transplantation; (ii) then seven days before panicle
    initiation; and (iii) finally seven days after flowering. 5.2. Dimensioning of
    the AWD System Proper dimensioning of the water distribution network’s pipes is
    required for the implementation of a large-scale AWD system. Multiple pumps are
    used in several clusters for a field of 25,000 acres to reflood the field in the
    shortest time possible. Multiple clustered-pumps facilitate the multiple inlet
    rice irrigation (MIRI) option available with AWD which allows the water to flow
    into the fields from several inlets, flooding the field in the shortest amount
    of time. The capacities of the pumps are chosen to meet the recommended minimum
    swift flooding rate of 0.00126 m3/s per acre (20 gallons per minute per acre),
    which varies depending on the type of soil [55]. Equation (8) shows the total
    number of pumps required ( 𝑛 ), when operating for 𝑡 hours with pumping capacity
    ( c ) in m3/s. The available pumping capacities include 0.02524, 0.05047, 0.06309,
    0.1009, and 0.1262 m3/s, and are achieved with 400, 800, 1000, 1600, and 2000
    GPM (gallons per minute) pumps that cover an acre of area (A) with q (150/m for
    one cm per hour water delivery) amount of water. 𝑛= 𝐴 𝑐×𝑞×𝑡       (8) Figure 5a
    shows the number of pumps required to irrigate 100 acre-inches. Using our proposed
    area of 25,000 acre-inches, it will require a total of 250 pumps with 2000 GPM
    capacities. Figure 5. (a) Number of pumps required when operating for duration
    of time (b) Average power consumption between different water lifting devices
    (c) Efficacy of the water lifting devices. Beside the volume of water to be delivered,
    the selection of water pump depends on lifting head, water pressure, and parameters
    of the water sources. Depending on the lifting head and the source of the water,
    there are three different types of pumps used for irrigation in South-East Asian
    countries including Bangladesh. For the surface water on bodies of water such
    as rivers and lakes, low-lift pumps are used where the lifting head is between
    1 to 5 m. A shallow tube well (STW) is used for more than 73% of ground water
    irrigation [56]. The rest is performed by pumps with higher lifting capacities
    called deep tube wells (DTWs). Irrespective of the type of pump used, pumps with
    higher efficiencies must be selected [57]. Pumps with 70% efficiency (as commonly
    used) are chosen for better selection among different lifting capacities. Average
    energy consumption (Ea) is calculated using Equation (9). 𝐸𝑎=ℎ𝑝·𝜂· 𝑡  (9) where
    hp is the horsepower of the pumps, η is the pump efficiency, and t is the operating
    time of the pumps. The efficacy of the system is measured using Equation (10).
    𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑖𝑐𝑎𝑐𝑦=𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑤 𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒 ( m 3 /s)/ 𝐸𝑎  (10) The average power consumption and efficacy
    of different water lifting devices are shown in Figure 5b,c. The efficacy curves
    in Figure 5c assume 600 GPM, 400 GPM, and 1110 GPM capacities for the low-lift
    pumps (LLP), STW, and DTW pumps. Figure 5b,c shows that LLPs have greater efficacy
    and low energy consumption compared to the other two types. This is mainly due
    to less heads [58] and thus makes the LLP type an economically feasible solution.
    Therefore, multiple low lift pumps are to be used for the wide-area AWD implementation
    as it would allow for proper utilization of the surface water and help lessen
    the exploitation of groundwater irrigation. The proper dimensions of pipes are
    of paramount importance in carrying surface water to the field; therefore, pipes
    are chosen to ensure minimum friction loss while maintaining the recommended water
    flow velocity [59]. The pipes are placed on a downward slope, as shown in Figure
    6a, to overcome the loss of pressure that occurs when travelling larger horizontal
    distances. Moreover, due to multiple inlets for irrigation, the pressure of water
    may fall from one inlet to the other; hence, when needed, the inlets closer to
    the source can be closed, to ensure sufficient water pressure at the opposite
    end of the field. Figure 6. (a) Downward slope water pipe (b) In-field Automated
    AWD setup. According to Equation (8), 250 units of 0.1262 m3/s (2000 GPM) capacity
    pumps need to be formed into clusters to ensure that the field is reflooded within
    16 to 17 h of operating time. The frictional head loss for a steady pipe’s flow
    is calculated using the Hazen–Williams equation [59], which is given by Equation
    (11). ℎ 100𝑓𝑡 =(0.2083× ( 100 𝑐 ) 1.852 × 𝑞 1.852 )/ 𝑑 ℎ 4.8655 (11) where ℎ 100𝑓𝑡
    = friction head loss, in feet, of water per 100 feet of pipe, c = Hazen–Williams
    roughness constant, q = volume flow (gal/min) and 𝑑 ℎ = inside diameter of the
    pipe (inches). Subsequently, the friction loss in psi [59] can be calculated using
    the following Equation (12). 𝑓 100𝑓𝑡 =(1/2.31)× ℎ 100𝑓𝑡 (12) where, 𝑓 100𝑓𝑡 =
    friction loss in psi per 100 feet of pipe. Equations (11) and (12) are required
    to determine the diameter of pipes needed for specific applications. The holes
    of the inlet would need to be 0.0635 m in diameter to obtain a flow of 0.004732
    m3/s (75 GPM) from every inlet in order to fill the field in the shortest possible
    time [55]. Table 1 shows the proposed AWD system with the number of monitoring
    and driver nodes needed to ensure that water gets dispersed evenly throughout
    the field. Figure 6b shows the AWD setup of the field, designed to ensure that
    all farmers receive a fair share of irrigation water, thus resulting in greater
    acceptance of the AWD. Table 1. Proposed AWD system setup. 5.3. WSN and IoT Integration
    IoT-based automation of the AWD system requires different WSNs for sensors and
    actuators. All of these networks work independently with the same base station.
    A WSN collects field parameters such as water level, gas emissions ( 𝐶 𝐻 4 ),
    temperature, pressure, and humidity. These data are then transmitted at 15 min
    intervals. The other WSN monitors the pipe and pump health parameters, such as
    pipe pressure, flow rate of water in pipes, and pump electric power. Based on
    these data, it generates alarms to shut down the pump in emergency situations.
    There is continuous monitoring at the SN which allows for immediate action when
    needed. The actuator network operates the actuators of the pipe to control the
    water flow through the pipe and is updated every 15 min. Comparing the low-power
    wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies, LoRa was chosen for the WSN in order to
    achieve the wide area coverage needed at the monitoring area for the AWD automation.
    Table 2 summarizes the LPWAN technology features [14] including range, data rate,
    and power requirements. It shows that LoRa is the best suited technology in terms
    of range with higher data rates when compared to Sigfox. Table 2. Basic features
    of wireless technologies. LoRa employs chirp spread spectrum (CSS) modulation
    for better noise immunity and sensitivity in order to achieve low-power and long-range
    wireless connectivity. The LoRa data rate ( 𝑅 𝑏 ) depends on the channel bandwidth
    (BW), coding rate (CR), and the CSS spreading factor (SF), and can be calculated
    using Equation (13). Data Rate=SF [ 4 4+CR ] [ 2 SF BW ]  (13) For the proposed
    automated-AWD system, the LoRa physical layer was chosen instead of LoRaWAN in
    order to customize the channel access interval and achieve better channel utilization
    by implementing a custom MAC (Medium Access Control) layer. Furthermore, WSN coverage
    can be improved by increasing the CSS spreading factor of LoRa, without increasing
    transmission power or changing any network elements [14]. Table 3 summarizes the
    LoRa configuration parameters used for the SN where the data rate Rb is calculated
    using Equation (13). Table 3. LoRa parameters. The multi-purpose sensor node (SN),
    shown in Figure 7a, is designed for all WSNs in order to keep the network homogeneous.
    It consists of a LoRa transceiver module (SX1278) unit, main processor (ATMega
    328), and network specific sensors and actuator drivers. Depending on the specific
    application, the sensor node can be used to either drive actuators or collect
    and monitor sensor data. Figure 7 shows the hardware blocks of the SN with the
    power unit and the base station. Figure 7. Hardware block diagram showing (a)
    Sensor node consisting of sensors, actuator drivers, and power unit; (b) base
    station (BS) with LoRa and cellular data connectivity. The base station (BS) consists
    of a Raspberry Pi-4 which acts as a host computer to control the WSN, data communication,
    and gateway functionalities. It has both LoRa and Wi-Fi/3G/LTE to maintain the
    connection with the WSNs and IoT cloud. Figure 7b shows the hardware block diagram
    of the BS. 5.4. Communication Protocol and Automation Algorithm Data transmission
    from the SN is controlled by the BS. The BS initiates data request messages to
    a specific SN using their unique ID and sends an acknowledgement after successful
    reception of the sensor data. For the actuator node (AN), the BS sends the actuator
    control messages to the AN, and updates the actuator nodes in the server database
    after receiving the data and from the AN. All of these communications between
    the WSN and the BS are performed using LoRa with messages transferred as LoRa
    packets. The BS processes the LoRa data packets and sends them to the IoT server
    as MQTT messages. The commands used to control the pumps and actuator, sent from
    the IoT server, also use MQTT. On the user side, a smartphone app and web interface
    are connected with the IoT server through a cloud-implemented MQTT-hypertext transfer
    protocol (HTTP) gateway. All of the data communication and AWD automation processes
    are performed by the SN, BS, and cloud IoT server. Figure 8a,b show the possible
    software algorithms designed for the SN and AN, respectively. At first, it configures
    and initializes the sensors, LoRa module, and driver unit. It then starts reading
    the field, pipe, and pump sensors to monitor their condition continuously. The
    AN takes all necessary actions according to certain pump operating conditions
    and control logic defined by the user during the initialization phase. All the
    internal control variables are updated according to external parameters at regular
    intervals in a closed loop at node A. These external parameters, such as user
    input, plant-specific data, and weather forecasts, are collected through the IoT
    server. Figure 8c shows the AWD automation control logic performed by the IoT
    server. The SN algorithm, shown in Figure 8a, was used for the field trial (described
    in Section 6). The algorithms, shown in Figure 8b,c, intended for wide-area AWD
    automation, were not used in the field trial. Initially, the irrigation phase
    (TPF or AWD) is ascertained, at which point all of the phase specific decisions
    are taken. For example, the surface water level (SWL) is monitored in terms of
    TPF, and, for the AWD, the below surface water level (BSWL) is checked to determine
    whether to toggle the actuator nodes on or off. Subsequently, after toggling the
    actuators and pumps, the SWL is measured for both the TPF and AWD, and then, if
    the SWL reaches 5 cm above the surface, the actuators and pumps are switched off.

    actuator node algorithm, and (c) Control logic algorithm for the AWD server intended
    for wide-area AWD automation. 6. Field Trial A field trial was performed in two
    phases: (i) WSN formation and data collection at UIU (United International University),
    Bangladesh; and (ii) remote data collection using the IoT network in an AWD plot
    at the Bangladesh Rice Research Institute (BRRI). Figure 9a shows the location
    of the UIU campus fields and Figure 9b shows the BRRI’s research agricultural
    field on Google Maps. Figure 9. Field trial location: (a) On-campus trial at United
    International University. (b) Agricultural land trial at BRRI. Figure 10a shows
    the IoT-connected (wireless sensor and actuator network (WSAN) architecture which
    is comprised of two sensor networks (WSN1 and WSN2) and one wireless actuator
    network (WSN3), as described in Section 5.3. In phase one, four sensor nodes (SNs)
    were placed at each corner of a 500 m by 500 m field with the indoor base station
    (BS) located in a lab on the fifth floor of the campus building. The approximate
    distances between the SNs and the BS were 500 m to 750 m, as shown in Figure 10b.
    Figure 10. (a) IoT-connected WSAN architecture (b) On-campus trial setup with
    sensor devices connected to a base station IoT-connected WSAN architecture. Sensor
    data were collected on a round-robin basis to avoid the co-channel interference
    that occurs at high frequencies (30 s period), and to evaluate the data transfer
    performance of the WSN. The base station (BS) consisted of a Linux-based (Redhat
    7) Apache web server with Node.js, HTM, Python 3, and Maria Database. It also
    acted as a WSN-IoT gateway using the LoRa–WiFi interface. To collect real-life
    data and to evaluate the AWD algorithm’s performance, SNs were placed in the agricultural
    plots of BRRI in a Boro field. The field was divided into irrigation blocks of
    15 m by 15 m, and the SNs were placed 200 m apart from each other. The irrigation
    system was controlled using a central pump. Figure 11 shows the field setup. Figure
    11. Agricultural field level trial setup: (a) Top view of a sensor device in the
    field (b) The receiver base station setup. The BS located at BRRI acquired all
    the sensor data from the field and stored it in the IoT server in a lab at UIU
    through the 3G cellular network. To monitor and process the field data in real-time,
    a distributed application structure was designed, as shown in Figure 12c. Here,
    a smartphone app, web interface, and other automation applications were developed
    and primarily implemented within the central IoT server [60]. Figure 12a,b show
    the smartphone app and the web interface. Figure 12. (a) Mobile Application, (b)
    Web Application, and (c) client-server connectivity for user interface. The mobile
    and web applications were linked to a Node.js server. A mobile Android application
    was used to collect data, a server was used to store the data and generate notifications,
    and a web client was used as a dashboard to display all the AWD specific information.
    The mobile app and web dashboard used rESTful APIs, HTTP requests, and web sockets
    to interface with the server. Sensor data from the external sensor devices was
    recorded on the server, where it was reactively pushed to the mobile client and
    dashboard using web sockets. Web sockets were used to communicate between the
    server and the clients. Both the Android and web apps provided similar services,
    such as user registration, sensor data acquisition, warning generation based on
    sensor data, and data and AWD status reports on the dashboard. The end user, farmers,
    can reconfigure the AWD parameters, such as water level and pump operation time
    using either the smartphone app or web interface. 7. Performance Analysis In traditional
    irrigation systems, water distribution is performed using earthen canals [50]
    due to their low initial cost. However, these canals result in poor distribution
    efficiency, less area coverage, and, in the long run, results in high maintenance
    costs. The greatest concern in using earthen canals is the high water loss, which
    is expressed as water conveyance loss (S) [51] and can be calculated using Equation
    (14). 𝑆={( 𝑄 1 − 𝑄 2 )÷𝐿}×100 (14) where S = the rate of conveyance loss in the
    canal ( m 3  s −1 ) per 100 m distance, Q1 = rate of flow at the inlet ( m 3  s
    −1 ), Q2 = rate of flow at the outlet ( m 3  s −1 ), and L = distance between
    two points (m). The main factor causing this loss in the earthen canals is due
    to seepage loss. Studies have found that about 40% of the water is lost during
    the distribution time through the earthen canals [50]. The proposed automated
    AWD system using plastic pipes can overcome this conveyance loss, and help reduce
    the irrigation time, which in turn results in less energy (fuel or electricity)
    to operate the pumps. The conveyance loss rate for the proposed project derived
    from [51] is shown in Figure 13. It compares the conveyance loss between earthen
    canals and plastic piping when water is transported 5000 m from the water source
    to the field. Thus, the proposed design saves about 90.91% of water when transporting
    it from the source using plastic piping instead of earthen canals. Furthermore,
    studies conducted by [51] have found that the incorporation of the AWD method
    with plastic pipes has saved about 42% of water, and reduced energy consumption
    by 41.2% compared to the traditional method. Figure 13. Conveyance loss compensation
    between earthen canal and plastic pipe. Using Equations (5) and (7), the frequency
    of irrigations, 𝐼 1𝑗  and  𝐼 2𝑗 , can be used to determine the total energy consumption
    of the pumps. For instance, to reflood a 100-acre field with 3 cm of water while
    maintaining continuous water during TPFj, a single 2000-GPM capacity pump with
    70% efficiency and 12 hp, operating for 18 h, would be sufficient as seen in Figure
    5a. Then, using Equation (9), average power consumption of the pump is found to
    be 142.8 KWh. Similarly, the average energy consumption can be determined for
    the AWD method. Therefore, the total energy consumption for the whole season can
    be found by using Equation (15): 𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝐸𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 𝐶𝑜𝑛𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 (𝐾𝑊ℎ)= 𝐼 1𝑗 ∗𝐸𝑎(𝑇𝑃 𝐹
    𝑗 )+  𝐼 2𝑗 ∗𝐸𝑎(𝐴𝑊𝐷) (15) where 𝐸𝑎(𝑇𝑃 𝐹 𝑗 ) represents the energy consumption during
    the TPF stages in order to supply 3 cm of water to the field, and 𝐸𝑎(𝐴𝑊𝐷) denotes
    the energy required to supply water when water reaches 15 cm below ground during
    the AWD method. It can be observed that, compared to the traditional method which
    utilizes continuous water, the proposed automated system is expected to require
    less energy. Figure 14 shows the dimensioning steps and mathematical calculations
    that are used for the proposed AWD system. Figure 14. Required dimensioning and
    calculation steps for an IoT-based AWD system. Table 4 compares the automated
    AWD method with manual AWD systems. Manual AWD studies focused on limited field
    sizes, soil types, and water sources. Sharing a limited number of water-lifting
    devices amongst numerous farmers tended to cause conflicts among them. Furthermore,
    the number of farmers it supported was generally quite limited. However, in the
    proposed IoT- and WSN-based automated AWD system, large-scale implementation is
    possible using a pipe and actuator-based water distribution system with cluster
    pump operation and monitoring. In this proposed system, 10 clusters, each containing
    25 pumps with capacities of 0.1262 m 3 /s (2000 GPM), can cover an area of 25,000
    acres. In this system, the pumps have 12 hp with an average pumping efficiency
    of 70%, which can support a large number of farmers while still allowing each
    farmer to obtain a fair share of water. Table 4. Comparison between manual AWD
    and automated AWD. In manual AWD, due to manual inspection of water levels throughout
    the irrigation season, pumps may operate for more hours than necessary, resulting
    in the wastage of valuable resources. However, in automated systems, pumps are
    switched off as soon as the water level reaches a certain threshold level, resulting
    in water and energy savings. The experiments presented in [46] showed that the
    automated AWD saved between 13–20% of water, with a 25% decrease in irrigation
    energy cost, and an increase in rice yields by 2–11% over manual AWD. The AWD
    automation scheme proposed in this paper is expected to reduce irrigation costs
    further since it uses plastic pipes to carry water. Moreover, integration of weather
    forecast data will operate the pumps effectively (e.g., keeping pumps off when
    the forecast predicts precipitation). Research in [45,46] presented automation
    of the AWD process by using sensors to precisely measure the water level precisely.
    These studies focused on small areas compared to that of the system described
    in this paper. For large-scale automation of AWD, multiple WSNs need to be designed
    and implemented. While automated AWD systems offer certain advantages over the
    manual AWD, as described in Table 4, the dimensioning of the wide-area automated
    AWD system may face challenges during implementation. The plant physiological
    database for developing countries such as Bangladesh is not regularly updated
    and is not easily accessible. In Bangladesh, where farmers are largely not exposed
    to technology, their knowledge and experiences about rice and irrigation are not
    readily available. Moreover, one of the research constraints is that the weather
    forecast information is not based on the specific local territory. Rather, it
    is based on the general meteorological information of the whole region. 8. Conclusions
    This paper has presented an approach to automating a wide-area AWD system covering
    a total irrigation area of 25,000 acres. Implementation of AWD in such a large
    irrigation area has not been reported in the existing literature. It is imperative
    that such a large system uses automation instead of the traditional manual operation
    and monitoring approach. The automation can be achieved by integrating three essential
    and intricate wireless sensor networks (WSN): a mechanical subsystem comprised
    of pumps, actuator networks, and a water distribution network, and an IoT system
    that runs the automation algorithm and issues control commands. The data from
    the WSN, along with other operating parameters, are processed at a central server
    that decides whether to activate the pumps and the actuator valves. The system
    is scalable and the algorithm can be adjusted for irrigation areas with different
    sizes within a practical limit. The required set of equations to support the design
    and operation of the overall system is provided in this paper. The hardware for
    the system is presented and described in order to facilitate the implementation
    of the automation system. The communication protocol and automation algorithm
    have also been presented in sufficient detail. A sample study on a small-scale
    field trial is presented as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate the effectiveness
    of the proposed system. An analysis of the proposed system’s expected performance
    is discussed by comparing it with manual and automated AWD systems in the existing
    literature. The analysis highlights the large irrigation area and the complete
    automation aspect of the proposed system. Despite numerous advantages, such as
    reduced water consumption, and economic and environmental benefits, widespread
    adoption of AWD is yet to be materialized due to social, economic, and technical
    challenges. This paper demonstrates that, with the adoption of existing sensor
    networks and IoT-based technologies, wide area adoption [25] is feasible and economically
    viable. The proposed wide-area AWD system allows for continuous monitoring and
    real-time decision making along with a fair distribution of water amongst the
    farmers. The authors are optimistic that, with the adoption of the proposed system,
    wide area AWD will be implemented in rice-growing countries. These countries will
    then reap the full benefits of the technological advantages that AWD has to offer.
    For future expansion of the proposed system, long-term data can be collected and
    analyzed to improve the system further and to further control the greenhouse emissions
    more effectively. Since the proposed system enables the collection of data and
    creation of a large database, new models can be generated and advanced techniques,
    including machine learning and big data, can be applied for better performance.
    Furthermore, incorporating the farmer’s valuable input alongside previous data
    and algorithms will make it possible to accurately identify the different physiological
    stages of plants during the season, resulting in the improved development of plants
    and yields. Author Contributions Conceptualization, G.M.E.R. and R.M.; methodology,

    EN FR Recently, the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) prepared a Manual
    of Practice (MOP) on canal automation for irrigation systems. Formally referred

    technical aspects of modernizing irrigation systems through the use of automated

    Ltd. Background Canal automation always has had the potential to save water and
    improve efficiency of irrigation water supply projects or of irrigation district
    operations. Recently, there have been a number of technological and engineering
    advances in the field of canal automation. While these advances have been documented
    via conference proceedings and peer-reviewed journal articles, a comprehensive
    document outlining the state of the art in canal automation was lacking. The American
    Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) decided to fill this void by commissioning the
    development of the Manual of Practice (MOP) 131: Canal Automation for Irrigation
    Systems (Wahlin and Zimbelman, 2014). MOP 131 was developed by the Task Committee
    on Recent Advances in Canal Automation (TCRACA) which was formed under the Irrigation
    Delivery and Drainage Systems (IDDS) Committee under the Environmental and Water
    Resources Institute (EWRI) of ASCE. Note that EWRI is an entity within ASCE that
    focuses on water resources instead of civil engineering in general. The TCRACA
    members gathered information on canal automation research and practice from around
    the world in their efforts to document the application of new technology to the
    progress of designing and implementing irrigation canal automation. The TCRACA
    was a truly international effort with researchers and practitioners from the USA,
    the Netherlands, Australia, France, Spain, Portugal, China, and Mexico all participating
    in the development of MOP 131. MOP 131 is designed to provide guidance on how
    and when to implement canal automation within the context of canal modernization
    but not covering the full range of canal modernization issues. The manual also
    provides practical guidance on some of the more routine aspects of canal automation.
    Note that while MOP 131 was developed by the cooperative efforts of eight different
    countries, it has not been formally adopted by the administrations of those countries.
    Historical Perspective on Canal Automation In order to plan for a successful canal
    modernization program, with measurable goals and objectives, that provides water
    users (irrigators) with improved flexibility, it is not only interesting but also
    very helpful to review how the science of irrigation canal automation arrived
    at today''s technology. For purposes of this paper, a historic review will principally
    be from the perspective of the USA. A broader perspective would require more time
    and space than allowed herein. Then, as now, members of ASCE, working through
    committees of what was then the Irrigation and Drainage Division, which later
    merged into EWRI, paved the way for presenting and discussing improved operations
    of irrigation water supply systems. Their deliberations were published in 1968
    as Automation of Irrigation and Drainage Systems which contained papers from a
    conference held in Phoenix, Arizona, in the United States (ASCE, 1968). A paper
    by the Salt River Project (SRP), a United States Bureau of Reclamation (USBR)
    project, discussed efforts to develop a supervisory control system for distribution
    canal operations that relied on new technology to measure gate openings, compute
    gate flows, monitor water levels, transmit data to a centralized operations center,
    and remotely move gates. During the same general time period, the California Department
    of Water Resources (DWR) was in the process of designing the United States'' largest
    state-built water and power project to move water from northern California to
    cities and irrigators in water-short southern California. This project became
    known as the State Water Project (SWP). Power usage and power generation were
    to be key elements of the SWP along with the multibasin transfer of water. Optimizing
    power generation and movement of water, while minimizing power usage, required
    the development of an innovative canal operation strategy. The research developed
    from this project was presented in several publications from 1964 to 1976 and
    included topics such as hydraulic transients, check structure hydraulics, and
    computerized control. The research also resulted in the formulation of a computerized
    model of the aqueduct that simulated unsteady flow in the SWP. The USBR has the
    primary responsibility for the design and construction of water resource infrastructure
    for the purpose of providing irrigation water to irrigable lands in the western
    United States. As such, the USBR took the early lead in investigating ways of
    enhancing the operational efficiency of irrigation water supply districts (projects).
    While weirs, flumes, sluice gates, and radial gates were in common usage, the
    integration of electromechanical devices to make the task of water masters and
    ditch riders easier, more precise, and timelier, came about as a result of the
    USBR directing its researchers and design engineers to take a leadership role
    in the early development of canal automation equipment and procedures. Subsequently,
    the USBR published Water System Automation–a State of the Art Report (USBR, 1973).
    Concepts presented in this reference, for example that optimum operation will
    result only from proper control of the entire system, are still applicable today.
    ASCE''s Irrigation and Drainage Division moved the technology forward in 1987
    by organizing a conference in Portland, Oregon, called Planning, Operation, Rehabilitation
    and Automation of Irrigation Water Delivery Systems (ASCE, 1987). This included
    presentations by French engineers discussing their implementation of dynamic regulation
    in the system of Canal De Provence, NEYRTEC automatic equipment, and BIVAL for
    downstream control. Dr John Merriam introduced a definition for flexibility as
    being when the irrigator has control of the frequency, rate, and duration of flow.
    Only through maximizing flexibility can the irrigator maximize their productivity
    and economic return. Through the programs and projects of his employer, the World
    Bank, Herve Plusquellec was able to make presentations to many canal operators
    and water supply agencies throughout the world using a comprehensive state-of-the-art
    35-mm slide presentation (Plusquellec, 1988). Mr Plusquellec was instrumental
    in bringing the concepts of improved canal operations and modernization to many
    who had previously not been aware of such concepts and ideas. This was followed
    by USBR''s publication entitled Canal Systems Automation Manual (USBR, 1991).
    This publication was an update of previous USBR publications with discussions
    on the practical aspects of canal operation, control, and automation. The manual
    began with fundamentals and basic concepts, continued with more specific details,
    and finished with the more complex aspects of control theory analysis. The manual
    was divided into three parts that address three levels of readership: Volume 1–water
    users and operators, Volume 2–planning and design engineers, and Volume 3–research
    and development specialists. Understanding that to move the field of canal automation
    forward required that researchers and designers be able to model unsteady flow
    in a canal system, ASCE''s Irrigation and Drainage Division undertook the task
    of providing a definitive treatise on unsteady flow modeling of canals (ASCE,
    1993). Later, an EWRI task committee created a comprehensive and detailed review
    of canal control algorithms (Malaterre et al., 1998). Both of these task committee
    efforts provided for a meaningful advance in the formulation and verification
    of canal control theory and practice. Many of the ASCE/EWRI task committee members
    joined with EWRI in 1999 to organize and conduct a United States Commission on
    Irrigation and Drainage (USCID) workshop on the Modernization of Irrigation Water
    Delivery (USCID, 1999), with much of the focus being on current canal automation
    endeavours. While the above is certainly not an exhaustive presentation of canal
    automation research and development, it does provide a broad summary and a snapshot
    of how long water district managers have looked to technology to improve and enhance
    the delivery of irrigation water to their customers. It also provides a flavor
    of the approaches, technologies, and agencies that have contributed to the field
    of automatic canal operations. As pointed out earlier, the goal of MOP 131 is
    to bring all these past accomplishments together in a single publication that
    is up to date and useful to system operations personnel, planners, and design
    engineers. Overview of MOP 131 MOP 131 consists of eight chapters and a glossary.
    A brief summary of each chapter follows. Chapter 1: Modernization process, constraints,
    and concepts This first chapter in MOP 131 is probably the most important one.
    It provides a general overview of the potential benefits of irrigation canal modernization
    and discusses considerations for assessing whether or not an irrigation or water
    district should implement automation as it modernizes. If automation appears to
    be a viable component of modernization, then Chapter 1 describes how to proceed
    with the process of modernization. This chapter also provides a general overview
    of the potential benefits of canal automation. This chapter starts out by defining
    the concept of modernization. Modernization is a combination of technical, managerial,
    and organizational upgrading (as opposed to mere physical rehabilitation) of irrigation
    schemes with the objective of improving resource utilization (e.g., water, labor,
    economics, environment) and water delivery service to farms (Wolter and Burt,
    1997). Such modernization investment focuses on the details of the inner workings
    of an irrigation project. Planners and engineers for irrigation projects frequently
    equate modernization with practices such as canal lining, piping, and computerized
    automation; however, such investments are often of low initial priority if one
    examines the steps needed to improve overall performance. Computerized automation
    is typically implemented in later stages of modernization, after basic needs such
    as flow measurement and accounting procedures have already been completed. Modernization
    is a process that sets specific objectives and selects specific actions and tools
    to achieve them over an extended period of time. There are no ‘single answers’
    as to how and when to implement automation as part of modernization because of
    the complexity and variety of combinations of the water supplies (surface versus
    conjunctive use), water allocation policies, water quality, timing of flows, adequacy
    of the water supplies, topography, aquatic weed problems, soil types as related
    to seepage and bank stability, usage of return flows, types of existing structures,
    and so on. There are, however, some basic principles that should be followed to
    achieve a high level of success in designing, constructing, and implementing a
    canal automation project. Concepts discussed in this chapter include: Defining
    potential benefits of modernization and automation; Defining incentives for modernization;
    Defining realistic/evolving expectations and costs; Assessing the existing system;
    Defining institutional and operational constraints as related to automation; Selecting
    the appropriate canal operation strategy; Developing a plan for emergency response/safeguards;
    Defining where automation fits into a modernization plan; Defining the typical
    sequence of actions in the modernization process. Chapter 2: Physical infrastructure
    Chapter 2 provides an overview of the types of structures and devices used for
    flow or water level control in canal systems. For each structure or device included,
    there is a photograph along with a discussion on the advantages/disadvantages,
    the power requirements, and the serviceability of the structure. In addition,
    the presentation includes a discussion on what measurements need to be made while
    using the structure. Only structures or devices useful from an automation perspective
    are discussed. Concepts discussed in this chapter include: Working with an existing
    irrigation system. Decisions need to be made regarding whether to incorporate
    existing irrigation system infrastructure or to replace the existing infrastructure
    with new infrastructure; Conveyance system considerations. The type of canal automation
    that is physically possible and practical is dependent upon the physical characteristics
    of the existing canals and water allocation policies; Gates for check structures.
    A summary of widely available check structure configurations is provided, including
    programmable logic control (PLC)-based, electrically moved check structures and
    non-PLC controlled ‘automatic’ check structures; Instrumentation and measurement.
    A discussion is provided regarding instrument considerations that are common to
    canal automation including water level, gate position, and flow rate measurements;
    Pumps. Pumps are an integral part of many automation schemes that must supply
    or accept water at variable rates that can change from minute to minute without
    advance notice; Regulating (buffer) reservoirs within the irrigation system. Regulating
    reservoirs have been used successfully in the western United States to reduce
    canal spillage, simplify canal operation, and increase the flexibility of the
    water delivery systems. Chapter 3: SCADA systems Chapter 3 presents considerations
    regarding the design and implementation of a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
    (SCADA) system that will support the advanced automation of irrigation canals.
    This chapter includes discussion of design criteria, applicable technologies,
    installation, testing, and commissioning of the system. This section of MOP 131
    focuses on the SCADA infrastructure itself and not on the control algorithms in
    the SCADA system processors, which is left for a later chapter. Concepts discussed
    in this chapter include: Basic introduction to SCADA systems. SCADA refers to
    a broad and ever-changing spectrum of electronic hardware, computer software,
    and communications infrastructure that provides a platform for remote monitoring
    and control in a variety of industrial applications. In canal applications (or
    irrigation systems), SCADA system complexity ranges from simple systems that allow
    operators to monitor a few water levels or flow rates over a radio network, to
    large-scale, multiserver systems capable of automatically controlling large canal
    networks over fiber-optic and microwave communication networks. Whether small
    or large, SCADA systems can provide real-time monitoring; remote supervisory or
    automatic control; alert or emergency notifications; troubleshooting; and automatic
    data reporting and archiving capabilities; Basic SCADA system components and function.
    In simple terms, a SCADA system consists of a central base unit, which provides
    facilities for data storage, manipulation, and visualization. The base unit communicates
    with one or more remote units (e.g., at a canal check structure) through some
    communications infrastructure. The remote unit communicates with sensors and implements
    control instructions issued from the base unit; Control options in SCADA systems.
    Automatic control options for SCADA systems can be categorized into three basic
    groups: local control, central control, and distributed control; SCADA project
    considerations. A discussion is provided detailing considerations for SCADA projects
    such as system evaluation, building an integration team, system maintenance, and
    cost. Chapter 4: Control operation and control concepts Chapter 4 presents basic
    canal control methods and their intended operational goals. A brief discussion
    of concepts required for implementation is also provided. The limitations of each
    method are described in terms of the overall control strategy. It is important
    to note that the concepts discussed in this chapter are not necessarily mutually
    exclusive, because different concepts can often be used on different parts of
    the same canal network. Each concept has advantages and drawbacks and each fits
    better with certain overall strategies. Concepts discussed in this chapter include:
    Introduction to the control of irrigation canals. In general, control for irrigation
    canals can be grouped into two categories: supply-oriented and demand-oriented.
    It is important to note that most canal control strategies include aspects of
    both supply-oriented and demand-oriented systems; General strategies for control
    of irrigation canals. A common approach to canal automation is to make gate adjustments
    at each site successively and then return to each gate to make corrections depending
    on the observed situation. These initial changes and the later corrections can
    be interpreted as feedforward and feedback control actions, respectively. The
    initial changes in settings to provide the new flows downstream are feedforward
    actions, while the corrections based on the actual situation are feedback actions.
    Remote control, where observations are communicated to a central control room
    and, from there, gate adjustments can be remotely implemented, simply allows the
    users to perform these actions more quickly, more often, with better timing, and
    with the ability to see more of the canal conditions at once. Automatic controls
    allow these adjustments to be made automatically. Automation allows control actions
    to be made more often and, in theory, more precisely. But fundamentally, these
    different approaches (manual/local, manual/remote, automatic) use the same basic
    strategies. Chapter 5: Canal hydraulic properties Chapter 5 discusses the hydraulic
    properties of canal pools and structures, as they relate to needs for canal automation.
    Since this publication is geared toward modernization of existing canal networks
    or systems, detailed design considerations are not included. However, changes
    may be needed to the infrastructure to implement new technologies during modernization,
    so that the system will allow greater flexibility and thus potentially improve
    performance. This chapter also presents methods for describing the hydraulic response
    of canal pools, particularly how water levels respond to changes in flow rate.
    Concepts discussed in this chapter include: Design issues. Various design issues
    such as freeboard, canal lining, intermediate structures, and flow capacity are
    discussed; Canal structure hydraulics. Summary information regarding the hydraulics
    of typical weirs and gates used in irrigation canals is provided; Canal pool hydraulics.
    Each pool is unique in its response to changes in flows through control structures.
    Physical parameters that influence this behavior are longitudinal bed slope, cross
    section size and shape, length, and bed material. Concepts regarding flow conditions,
    changes in canal conveyance, pool volumes, and travel time of waves are also discussed;
    Resonance waves. Resonance waves and their influence on automatic control can
    be minimized using the filtering procedures discussed; Identification. Methods
    for determining important hydraulic properties of the canal pool are discussed.
    These parameters are crucial for controller design. Chapter 6: Control methods
    Chapter 6 presents control system fundamentals and control techniques that are
    used to develop controllers for water level or flow rate in irrigation canals.
    This chapter presents methods by which the control strategies discussed earlier
    in MOP 131 can be implemented via electronic devices such as PLCs, remote terminal
    units (RTUs), computers, etc. The intent of canal automation is to improve the
    operation of the water distribution system, which typically means better service
    to farmers. Canal automation is intended to improve some aspect of operations
    by performing controls that would be difficult to do manually and to enhance system
    monitoring and emergency responses. Concepts discussed in this chapter include:
    Introduction to control methods. Various control method concepts are defined including
    control variables and control-action variables; Implementation options. Automatic
    controls can be organized in a variety of ways: local control, centralized control,
    hierarchical control, and distributed coordination control; Decoupling pools and
    structures. To simplify the design of controllers (which are usually linear) and
    to simplify implementation, most canal controllers determine the flow rate change
    needed for a check structure and then the gate position change required to achieve
    the prescribed flow rate in separate computations (algorithms); Routing demand
    changes through a canal. Routing water through a canal, also called feedforward
    control, can be done by using the time it takes a flow rate change to travel from
    the head gate to turnouts (delay times). Various methods for routing water through
    a canal, an essential control function, are discussed; Feedback control. This
    section describes the mathematical procedures needed to tune controllers for the
    control of water levels, flow rates, and/or volumes within a canal. These methods
    use measurements of water level and/or flow rate to determine what control actions
    will bring the water level, flow rate, or canal pool volume to a set point value.
    Details on specific feedback control algorithms such as linear quadratic regulator
    (LQR), H-infinity, model predictive control (MPC), and proportional integral (PI)
    flow control are discussed. There is also a discussion on combining feedforward
    and feedback control. Chapter 7: Verification of controller performance The users
    of canal automation want to be sure that the automatic control system will function
    in a way that is useful for their operations. Two essential questions must be
    answered. First, are the right processes being controlled? Second, is the automatic
    control functioning in an acceptable manner? This chapter discusses the process
    that control system designers and integrators should go through so that they can
    document a successful automation implementation. Concepts discussed in this chapter
    include: Performance testing issues. This section deals with performance testing
    of automated canal structure logic; Performance testing with unsteady-flow simulation
    models. Simulation models are a useful tool for determining the potential performance
    of canal automation. Many canal automation developers routinely test control algorithm
    performance for even a single gate with unsteady-flow simulation. This allows
    the gate to be tested under a variety of flow and operating conditions; Performance
    measures. This section outlines concrete performance measures that can be used
    to evaluate how effectively a canal automation scheme is controlling the irrigation
    delivery system. Performance measures for both water level control and flow rate
    control are presented. Chapter 8: Implementation of control systems Chapter 8
    addresses the practical implementation of canal automation as a project within
    a wider modernization program. The automation of an entire lateral or whole canal
    system is described, rather than just a single check structure, because the challenges
    and benefits are much larger. This chapter describes the sequence of required
    tasks, including the customization of control software, the installation and commissioning
    of the field devices and central server software, the progressive activation of
    control throughout the canal system, the measurement of overall performance of
    the new system, and the training of operations staff. Ongoing operational tasks
    and system maintenance are also discussed. Concepts discussed in this chapter
    include: Project initiation. The first step in any automation project is to determine
    the project objectives. These might include the improvement of irrigator service
    levels, water savings, and better control of water levels, operational cost savings,
    or rate of return on investment. Clear, quantified objectives help ensure success
    by aligning the irrigation district and implementation team and allowing for objective
    measurement of performance; Configuration and customization of software. Discussions
    are provided regarding RTU/PLC software, communications software, SCADA software,
    water ordering and demand management software, and network representation software;
    Commissioning. Commissioning is the process by which equipment, a facility, or
    a plant is tested to verify if it functions according to its design objectives
    or specifications; Control rollout and tuning. Once the commissioning of the SCADA
    system is complete, the next step is to roll out or activate the control system.
    In this section, rollout of control refers to the control on a network scale as
    it encompasses the processes involved in rolling out control at each location.
    Sometimes the behavior of the actual system may differ from what has been modeled
    initially. Hence, fine tuning of controller(s) may be required at intermittent
    stages; Performance assessment and acceptance. As important as setting the overall
    project objective is the measurement of the performance of the canal system against
    those objectives; Postacceptance operation and maintenance. Postacceptance operations
    and maintenance are an important part of canal automation. It is the analog of
    a routine maintenance program that irrigation districts generally undertake anyway,
    but includes new equipment like the software and new operating procedures; Training.
    An automated canal system requires that operators learn a number of new computer
    skills and adapt to a new style of operation that involves reacting to operational
    problems rather than simply implementing routines. This is not dissimilar to the
    role of a pilot when an airplane is operating in autopilot. The pilot must vigilantly
    monitor instruments and correct for unforeseen circumstances or deal with alarms;
    Manuals. In addition to the training, the irrigation district must be supplied
    with manuals for every component that makes up its system. Conclusions Irrigation
    district managers as well as state and federal water resource management agencies
    have for more than 50 years looked to technology to increase their effectiveness,
    improve their operations, enhance water transmission and delivery, and make their
    canal systems safer and more responsive. As the technology provided by the development
    and enhanced performance of computers made quantum leaps in performance, it was
    logical for the computing power of these devices to be incorporated into the control
    of irrigation canals. Beyond the power provided by computer technology, was the
    requirement for an entire array of associate technology that needed to be developed
    and adapted for canal control. The associated technologies included equipment
    to measure water levels, flow rates, and gate movements digitally as well as radio
    and fiber-optic equipment to transmit and receive monitored data. As each of these
    technologies matured, the engineers and researchers responsible for the research
    and development of canal control adapted these new technologies into their designs.
    As such, canal control has matured and become more technically rigorous. In a
    parallel way, the software needed to control canals also matured through the incorporation
    of new theories or mathematical models into improved control algorithms. What
    started out as remote monitoring and control with much of the decision-making
    left in the hands of humans, has now been refined to the point that automatic
    control of irrigation canals is a reality. What was lacking was an up-to-date,
    comprehensive publication that would not only assist irrigation district personnel
    but also the consulting engineer community with a practical source of knowledge
    on the worldwide status of automatic canal control. The professionals who were
    active participants in the development and implementation of automatic canal control
    joined forces to collaborate on MOP 131 in order to bring their collective expertise
    together in ways that would be useful to water resources engineers and managers
    around the world. The professionals that contributed to the preparation, review,
    editing, and finalization of MOP 131 are hopeful that MOP 131 is adopted by the
    water resources community as the definitive publication on the state of the art
    of automatic canal control, and that automatic canal control will make a substantial
    contribution to the production of food and fiber for a world that is facing unrelenting
    increases in the demand for food production with limited water supplies, while
    at the same time meeting demands to preserve our environment. Acknowledgements

    in place. In this study, a precision irrigation system, which takes advantage

    the soil was measured via sensors that were placed on certain points of the area
    to be irrigated. These sensors were placed near the root of the product. Data

    working status of the irrigation system. Keywords: Mobile Control; irrigation
    system; closed-loop control 1. Introduction Turkey is an agricultural country.
    Turkey and many similarly agricultural countries have great problems in the irrigation
    process due to a scarcity of water resources. Although major changes and improvements
    have been seen in Turkey’s agricultural policies, the overconsumption of water
    resources exacerbates the problem. The export situation resulting from the plants
    grown and influencing the quality directly reveals the importance of water consumption
    [1]. The agriculture in Turkey needs more assistance for farms and farmers, more
    advanced research in recent available agricultural technologies, more automation,
    and more testing and applying new methods of study, analysis, and mechanization.
    The soil moisture sensor measures the amount of moisture in the soil. The measurement
    is done by immersing probes on the sensor. The depth of measurement may vary depending
    on the plant species. This means that the probes are close to the root of the
    plant. The working principle of the soil moisture sensors is that there is a voltage
    difference between the tips of the probes due to the resistance of the soil. Increasing
    the amount of moisture (wetness) in the ground increases its conductivity. Thus,
    the amount of moisture is measured according to the magnitude of the voltage difference.
    The requests to use information technology to a larger extent in irrigation systems
    are increasing by the day. Many technological methods are used in irrigation systems
    [2,3,4,5,6]. When these methods are considered, using smart phones and tablets
    has become widespread. Becoming a small computer system, wireless and portable
    structure, operating fast and having the wide memory capacity are important factors
    to spread the use of these devices. These factors make the use of mobile devices
    attractive for many applications such as environmental controls, health service
    monitoring, security, transportation and automation [7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25].
    This paper studies the application of Precision Irrigation (PI) using sensor network
    technology (SNT), which emerged as a management practice with the potential to
    increase profits by utilizing more precise information about agricultural resources
    through sensing and communication technology in Turkey and takes the crops as
    a specific example for investigating a possible PI solution using Sensor Network
    Technology (SNT) integrated with IOS/Android application. The application is an
    automated agricultural irrigation system, which is controlled on mobile devices
    based on IOS/Android and is capable of monitoring the irrigation levels. The mobile
    device software was defined as agRapp. The system measures the water quantity
    of the soil via sensors placed at different points near the roots of products
    and transmits the data via PLC to mobile devices. Thus, the operating status of
    the irrigation system is defined according to the water level inside the soil.
    The most important property of this study, which differentiates it from previous
    studies, is defining the required water level by product depending on growth stages.
    Initially, during crop development, mid-season and late season stages, the system
    defines the required water level through developed software. Moreover, alternative
    energy resources are used to meet the required energy level. It has already been
    known that solar power reduces the energy cost [26,27,28,29,30,31,32], therefore
    solar power was used in this study. Today, using water efficiently in agricultural
    irrigation systems is very important. Although this situation may lead to the
    development of different irrigation systems, it is still necessary to increase
    the efficiency. For this reason, the development of an irrigation system that
    takes into consideration the periodic water needs of the plants as well as the
    water condition of the soil gains great importance. In addition, the plant’s water
    need should be monitored continuously, not instantaneously. In this study, an
    automatic irrigation system was developed which can be monitored and controlled
    via mobile devices. In this system, in addition to the seasonal water needs of
    plants, irrigation is carried out by taking into account the continuous values
    taken from the humidity sensors. 2. Irrigation System The amount of water that
    needs to be used should be calculated as accurately as possible in order to make
    irrigation projects more effective. Essential for calculating the irrigation water
    requirement is knowledge of evapotranspiration [33,34]. The storage and capacity
    of the system transmission structure are projected and constructed according to
    this knowledge. The healthy way for calculating of evapotranspiration is to use
    one of the direct measurement methods. However, researchers have developed analytical
    equations that can be used to estimate the evapotranspiration due to the high
    cost and time demands of the direct measurement method. The United Nations Food
    and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recommends the Penman Monteith method to determine
    the crop water requirement for assisting the sizing of the irrigation projects
    in developing countries. It is aimed to calculate the healthy evapotranspiration
    with the crop coefficient (kc) determined by the climate and soil data of the
    irrigation area. The reference evapotranspiration (ETo) has been used, and required
    climate data has been obtained from the website of the Turkish State Meteorological
    Service (www.mgm.gov.tr) in order to use the FAO Penman Monteith method [33].
    𝐸 𝑇 𝑜 = 0.408×∆×( 𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺)+𝛾×( 900 𝑇+273 )× 𝑢 2 ×( 𝑒 𝑠 − 𝑒 𝑎 ) ∆+𝛾×(1+0.34× 𝑢 2
    ) (1) Here, ETo: Reference evapotranspiration (mm day−1), Rn: Net radiation (MJ
    m−2 day−1), G: Soil temperature flux density (MJ m−2 day−1), T: The average daily
    air temperature (°C), u2: 2 m height wind speed (m s−1), es: Saturated vapor pressure
    (kPa), ea: Actual steam pressure (kPa), Δ: The slope of the vapor pressure curve
    (kPa/°C−1), γ: Psychometric constant (kPa). Climate data obtained from the meteorological
    station 17084 belongs to Çorum/Center and is shown in Table 1 and Table 2. This
    data is used to define the water requirement necessary for crops to be grown.
    Table 1. Çorum/Center climate/ evapotranspiration (ETo) data. Table 2. Çorum/Center
    rain data. The reference plant is walnut for FAO Penman Monteith method. Evapotranspiration
    values for walnut have been calculated as follows [33,34]; Etc = kc × ETo (2)
    The kc value varies from plant to plant and refers to the plant’s water needs.
    The characteristics that determine the value of kc are plant species, height,
    growth phases, light reflectance value of the soil, and plant surfaces, climate
    and soil. In addition, while each plant’s kc values vary, the kc value in each
    phase of a plant’s growth process varies. Seasonal kc values obtained for walnuts
    are shown in Figure 1. As seen in Figure 1, if the planned date is chosen as 11
    April, the product is harvested approximately 173 days later. Figure 1. Çorum/Center
    crop kc values. Determination of seasonal plant water needs as well as physical
    properties of the soil in the cultivated areas are important. The values of soil
    type Red Sandy determined as a working area in this study are given in Figure
    2. Figure 2. Soil information belonging to area. Obtained climate data and the
    value of crop water requirements, depending on seasonal development and land property,
    are shown in Table 3. According to Table 3, the total water demand in the process
    of growing the product has been identified as 197 mm/dec. The cultivated plant
    is an adult walnut tree. The seasonal irrigation information of the walnut is
    shown in Figure 1. According to Figure 1, the product irrigation was started on
    11 April 2016 and the harvest was done on 30 September 2016. Figure 3 shows the
    need for seasonal water of walnut. Figure 3. Control system diagram. Table 3.
    Crop water requirements. 3. System Architecture The experiment was conducted in
    the walnut land with 600 m2 in Çorum. Water that was transferred from the well
    to the water tank with 5000 L by the booster was connected to irrigation laterals
    via a filter. Valves that were positioned in front of each lateral were the basis
    of the control field. Energy requirements of the system were met when the solar
    panels had 2.2 kW total power. The block diagram of the irrigation control system
    is presented in Figure 3. According to Figure 3, moisture values obtained from
    the sensors were transferred to the PLC via input components. This data received
    from the PLC was transferred to the smart phone via the IOS/Andriod server for
    monitoring and control purposes. In the system operation, the current water requirement
    of the plant was determined depending on the seasonal water requirement in previous
    years. If the water ratio is less than necessary, the water tank was operated
    via the PLC output, ensuring that the valves remain open until the desired amount
    of water is supplied. When the data from the sensors indicated that the required
    amount of water was reached, irrigation automatically ended. If the amount of
    water was excessive due to rainfall or other reasons, irrigation was not carried
    out. All numerical values of the above-mentioned operations can also be monitored
    via the mobile device. The irrigation system consists of five parallel side pipes
    with 20 m length connecting to the main pipe (Figure 4). The control of parallel
    pipes was separately ensured by valves that were placed in front of the side pipes.
    The amount of water in the soil was defined by sensors that were placed in regions
    close to the root portion of the product. This digital data was transferred to
    the PLC (control unit). Opening and closing conditions of valves on each lateral
    were set according to defined data. At this point, data was automatically saved
    to database columns consisting of the lateral number, sensor number, date and
    time. Also, a column was created in the database for adjusting the water requirement
    of cultivated plants depending on their stage. Device usage and their properties
    were given as follows Figure 4. (a) Sensors placement in the land; (b) Sensors
    map in the irrigation system. Five different laterals used in irrigation systems
    were 20 m long each and there were valves at their ends to provide irrigation.
    The most important disadvantage of these laterals is congestion caused by the
    accumulation of stones or sand. A filter system was used to remove this congestion
    and obtain more healthy data. 3.1. Water Booster The power of the booster (Sumak
    Pump Corporation ltd., Istanbul, Turkey) is 2.2 Kw monophonic. It has 4–5 bar
    working pressure and 5–6 m3/h water pumping. 3.2. Water Tank The water tank with
    5 tons was used for storing and resting of the water taken from water wells. 3.3.
    Filter The appropriate filter (Kalyon Filter Corporation Ltd., Izmir, Turkey),
    which is in the plastic filter groups from ¾′′ to 3′′ and 50 m3/s, was chosen
    to eliminate bottlenecks that can occur in the pipe system. The main features
    of this filter are easily removable for rinsing and there is a semi-automatic
    cleaning feature. 3.4. Valves Electro-valves were used for controlling the water
    amount going into the lateral drip system. Five laterals that normally have closed
    contacts and operate with 12 Vdc were used separately. 3.5. Soil Moisture Sensor
    Sixteen units DS 200 soil moisture sensor (Bejing Dingtek Tehnology Corporation
    Ltd., Beijing, China), were used to measure the amount of water in the soil. The
    Ht-1 type sensor has some advantages such as high stability, easy operation, and
    maintenance, and it can measure soil moisture and temperature at the same time.
    Also, it can be calibrated. Moreover, it has Tr-3100 type of tightness and protection
    rank ip68. It operates with 5–24 Vdc source. The output signal is 0–1 Vdc, 0–2.5
    Vdc, 0–5 Vdc, 0–10 Vdc, 4–20 ma and rs485. The DS200 humidity sensor is preferred
    because it is economical, leak-proof, long-term use, corrosion protection, and
    high transmission distance. The reason for our discussion of calibration is the
    presence of trimpot on some sensors and sensitivity adjustment here. However,
    the DS200 humidity sensor has an accuracy of ±2% which is a very good value. The
    reason we discuss this here is that we would advise to be careful when choosing
    a sensor for such work. 3.6. Solar Panel and Setup Solar panels have been used
    to meet AC and DC energy system requirements. The figure of established panels
    is given in Figure 5. Figure 5. Established solar panels. 3.7. Control Unit The
    power unit was formed into two separate sections—AC and DC—considering the amount
    of energy taken from solar panels. The block diagram of the power supply that
    is used in DC systems is given in Figure 6. Figure 6. Power supply block diagram.
    The infrastructure system was generated by bringing together hardware components
    to use the precision irrigation system in IOS/Android-based operating systems.
    A view of the developed infrastructure is illustrated in Figure 7. Figure 7. Block
    diagram of IOS/Android controlling unit. 3.8. Irrigation System Operation The
    flowchart of the software is given in Figure 8. Figure 8. The flowchart of the
    software. In the software that can operate in IOS/Android based systems, information
    belonging to sensors or lateral is given; at the same time, operating information
    belonging to the desired sensor appears on the screen. The main screen view is
    given in Figure 9, and the user should use the data input section to perform data
    entry belonging to the product. The pump menu should be used to control the pumps,
    the moisture menu should be used for sensor information, and the valve menu should
    be used for controlling the valves. Moreover, values depending on the stage of
    plant growth and water requirements could be watched in monitoring menu and software
    information could be followed in information menu. Figure 9. Smart phone monitoring
    page. (a) Home screen, (b) Sensor Menu, (c) Sensor 1’ e moisture value. 4. Discussion
    The precision irrigation system was designed as a closed-loop control system.
    In the designed control system, the data obtained with the reference data were
    compared and thus real-time monitoring is provided in addition to the water efficiency.
    Reference values in the study were determined according to Equations (1) and (2).
    This data indicates the seasonal water needs of the walnut tree. The amount of
    rainfall in previous years was used as data when water demand was determined.
    This data was taken from Turkish State Meteorological Center. At the same time,
    daily water needs were determined at a lower level. The obtained data were arranged
    in an algorithmic way into the PLC program. The data obtained from the sensors
    were compared with the periodical water requirement table and the working status
    of the system was revealed. While studies reported before in the literature mostly
    focus on the opening and closing operations of drip irrigation system, in this
    study, the opening and closing operations were determined according to the seasonal
    water need. In the studies shown in the references, especially those related to
    the drip irrigation system, only water irrigation was done from the sensors based
    on the humidity condition of the soil. Dating from October to harvest, average
    monthly moisture results obtained from 16 sensors in five different laterals are
    given in Figure 10. As can be seen in Figure 10, the moisture rate decreases especially
    during the summer season. When this situation is compared with climatic data,
    it is shown that these results are close to average values. Figure 10. Monthly
    average moisture. Moisture values that were obtained from sensors during the day
    and depend on four separate stages are given in Figure 11. Figure 11. The average
    moisture values are occurring in the sensor during the day (Mid. Stage). Values
    were obtained from equalities, which were used to define the amount of water needed
    in the product growth stage, and given daily in Figure 12, Figure 13, Figure 14
    and Figure 15 respectively. Figure 12. Int. Stage water requirement. Figure 13.
    Dev. Stage water requirement. Figure 14. Mid. Stage water requirement. Figure
    15. End stage water requirement. In Figure 16, a comparison was done between the
    total amount of water to be supplied and that which was actually supplied to plants.
    It can be seen in Figure 16 that plants’ water requirement especially increases
    after the development stage. Moreover, it is clear that calculated values and
    real values are close to each other and a precision irrigation process is achieved.
    Figure 16. Amount of water depending on the stage of plant growth and used amount
    of water. Resulting from the leveling of product growth area, it can be seen that
    average moisture values in each lateral are close together. This situation was
    effective in reducing energy and water consumption. 5. Conclusions This study
    shows that precision irrigation systems with moisture sensors are extremely advantageous
    for growing crops in agricultural systems. In the study, when equations used to
    determine the amount of water required in the plant growth stages and obtained
    climatic data are considered, it is identified that appropriately meeting the
    amount of water determined for each period is effective for agriculture growth.
    Thus, an important advantage is obtained by adjusting the amount of water needed
    in the plant growth stages and by consuming the water depending on the soil moisture
    with classic drip irrigation systems. When the total water demand is calculated
    as 197 mm/dec, it actualizes as 211 mm/dec in the application. This value can
    be obtained only with software changes in the system. Nowadays, important savings
    have been achieved in energy costs by using solar energy. When the installation
    costs are considered, it can be understood that the installation costs can be
    met in three harvest periods. When the technological point of view is taken into
    account, the system can be operated through integration with smart phones. Thence,
    all system can be controlled and tracked by these devices. Especially if one considers
    that smart phones are widely used, it is obvious that the system is highly accessible.
    Moreover, there is about a 60% decrease in the labor force with the precision
    irrigation system. A farmer’s daily work time in the field is taken into account
    while this value is calculated and is dramatically reduced by the methods illustrated
    above. Author Contributions Mehmet Fatih Işık, Cemal Yılmaz and Yusuf Sönmez conceived

  description: Traditionally, most irrigation practices in Southern Europe have been
    based on gravity-fed surface irrigation systems. Currently, these systems remain
    a relevant typology in the European Union (EU) member states of the Mediterranean
    areas, where it is often the only sustainable method for farmers due to the small
    size of agricultural holdings, their reduced capacity and readiness to invest
    and the low ratio between yield profits and irrigation costs. In the last several
    years, in response to European and national directives, surface irrigation has
    garnered increasing attention at the political and bureaucratic levels due to
    frequent criticisms of its postulated low efficiency and high water wastage. However,
    these systems commonly provide a number of ecosystem services and nature-based
    solutions that increase the positive externalities in different rural socio-ecological
    contexts and often have the potential to extend these services and provide solutions
    that are compatible with economical sustainability. This study aims to discuss
    the prospects for new practices and for the rehabilitation and modernization of
    the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in EU Mediterranean areas to enhance
    water efficiency, thus gaining both economic advantages and environmental benefits.
    The difficulties, stimuli for improvements and peculiarities of the irrigation
    water management of four rural environments located in Italy, Spain and Portugal
    were analyzed and compared to the current state of the gravity-fed surface irrigation
    systems with hypothetical future improvements achievable by innovative technologies
    and practices. In these different case studies, the current gravity-fed surface
    irrigation systems have an obsolete regulatory structure; water-use efficiency
    is not a driving criterion for the management of the conveyance and distribution
    canal network, and farmers are not yet adequately encouraged to adopt more efficient
    gravity-fed irrigation practices. A continuous knowledge exchange is thus necessary
    for the interaction of all irrigation water managers and farmers to improve their
    eco-efficiency and to preserve and promote their cultural heritage across the
    entire water supply and delivery chains. We argue that the best way forward will
    require precisely targeted rehabilitation measures of gravity-fed surface irrigation
    systems based on the integrated use of decision support services, gate automation,
    remote and feedback controls and real-time flow optimization.

    irrigated agriculture sustainability 1. Introduction Irrigation practices in Europe
    have traditionally consisted of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems. In these
    cases, the water is conveyed from surface sources (primarily rivers or reservoirs,
    both natural and artificial) and is distributed to individual fields through a
    network of canals of different sizes, relying on gravity as the driving force.
    In sizeable areas of the southern Member States, especially in Catalonia, Northern
    Italy and Portugal, gravity-fed surface irrigation remains the dominant form of
    irrigation, being used in 51%, 70% and 63% of farms, respectively [1]. The main
    cultivated crops are cereals, particularly maize and rice, which require approximately
    two to three times the amount of water compared with other extensive crops [2].
    The utilized agricultural area (UAA) in these states accounts for approximately
    40% of the total land area, resulting in an average size of 16.1 ha per agricultural
    holding. The mean field size is approximately 5 ha, with a high level of fragmentation
    that affects the labor decisions of farmers, and consequently, the performances
    of farms [3]. Since the Renaissance, the hectic development of a dense network
    of gravity-fed surface irrigation canals for water delivery to single agricultural
    fields has occurred, mainly due to the high level of land fragmentation and small
    field sizes [4]. However, the lack of coordination among water users caused redundancy
    in these canals, leading to a chaotic structure, complex layout, and a lack of
    a specific hierarchy [5]. Nevertheless, the complex system of reservoirs, rivers,
    and irrigation canals that is common in rural Southern European territories is
    an emblematic model of hydraulic infrastructures, and although it can be perceived
    as obsolete, in general, it is operationally efficient and helps to maintain the
    good environmental status of the natural resources in several ways [6,7,8]. The
    majority of the irrigation canals are unlined and resemble small natural rivers
    rather than artificial infrastructures that support agriculture; this facilitates
    their integration into the landscape and gives them an environmental value as
    well as a cultural heritage [9,10,11]. As the largest user of fresh water, agriculture
    sits at the interface between the environment and society, and any improvements
    in irrigation water management need to consider its multifunctional nature [12,13,14].
    The history of irrigation in these territories is inseparable from that of land
    management, and every change in the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems, even
    in a small area, can affect the hydrologic balance and agro-ecosystem characteristics
    on a large scale [15,16]. The neoclassical concept of irrigation efficiency (based
    on supply efficiency only) has been replaced by a modern formulation called “effective
    efficiency” of irrigation [17,18,19], which includes the abovementioned hydrological
    issues as well as environmental and ecological interactions. In light of these
    considerations, it is important to promote monitoring activities for accurately
    quantifying agro-environmental variables from climatic parameters to evaluate
    the flow into the irrigation canals (from the main canals to distribution ditches).
    In fact, the lack of data about the flow in rural canals is a central issue in
    planning and decision-making processes for the development of suitable water resource
    management strategies at the basin level [20,21,22,23]. This problem could also
    be exacerbated by an increase in the total global water withdrawals for irrigation,
    which are projected to increase by 10% by 2050 [24]. Strong competition between
    the irrigation water resources, energy, agriculture and food are looming, with
    unpredictable impacts on livelihoods and the environment [25]. Thus, cross-sectoral
    actions such as those oriented by the Water-Energy-Food Security nexus [26] or
    Water-Food-Energy-Ecosystem nexus [27] will also affect future irrigation system
    projects and water allocations to promote more efficient water distribution and
    prevent waste. This study analyzed the characteristics and the importance of the
    gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in four irrigation districts belonging
    to three states in southern Europe (the Est Ticino-Villoresi districts in Italy,
    the Baix Ter and the Urgell districts in Spain, and the Lis Valley district in
    Portugal). The prospects and difficulties around the possibility of improving
    the irrigation throughout these systems as well as their management and governance
    are compared and discussed. We argue that this study may form the basis for a
    discussion on the recommended improvements on gravity-fed surface irrigation systems
    that would preserve their agricultural heritage and continue to provide environmental
    benefits. 2. European Policies and Guidelines Gravity-fed surface irrigation systems
    remain the most common type of infrastructure for crop and pasture irrigation
    worldwide due to their low cost and low energy requirements [1]. However, these
    systems often use very high amounts of water to satisfy the irrigation requirements
    of the crops and are thought to be inherently inefficient [28]. Thus, in response
    to increasing conflicts among different water users and the need to safeguard
    the availability of water resources, many important policies have been introduced
    to reduce water wastage in agriculture settings and to promote the transformation
    of traditional irrigation systems into pressurized ones, which are often based
    on drip irrigation [29]. In Spain, with the modernization of the irrigation systems
    over the period of 2005–2015, the area under pressurized irrigation has increased
    by approximately 563,000 ha (87% with drip irrigation), while surface irrigation
    has been reduced to approximately 215,000 ha [30]. From 1990 to 2007, these policies
    have helped achieve an estimated increase of 15% in irrigation water use efficiency,
    but this came with an increase in the energy consumption per hectare of irrigated
    land by a factor of 8 and of the energy consumption per cubic meter of water by
    a factor of 10 [31]. This, in combination with the noticeable increase in the
    electricity price in recent years, has produced a certain alarm. In this context,
    some new pressurized irrigation facilities built with modern technology are not
    functioning due to high energy costs that render them non-profitable. Alarcon
    et al. [32] warns that some actions aimed at increasing irrigation efficiency
    may incur meager savings of water at a high cost and that many environmental impacts
    on the landscape are often underestimated. The management of water resources is
    a particularly challenging and difficult task, in which complexities inherent
    to the hydrological cycle and biological systems are combined with the multiple
    perspectives, needs, values and concerns associated with the use of water for
    human activities [33]. Accordingly, the need for a more sustainable and integrated
    approach to manage water resources in Europe is reflected not only in water-related
    legislation but also in social policies [34,35]. The Water Framework Directive
    (WFD) and more recent policies that are closely related to the EU 2020 strategies
    highlight the fact that improving water resource management for irrigation is
    one of the primary regional challenges, with strong socio-economic implications
    [36]. Indeed, Europe recognizes that there is an urgent need to enhance the knowledge
    of irrigation consumption and to develop systems for increasing the delivery efficiency
    and regulating water flow at the field and irrigation canal scales, respectively
    (DM 15/07/2015 No. 213, 2015). EU policy frameworks place great expectations on
    new technologies to improve water efficiency [37]. The European Commission emphasizes
    that technological innovation in the field of irrigation will be an increasingly
    important factor contributing to the competitiveness of small and medium enterprises
    that operate in this sector [38]. According to the European Parliament, solutions
    should be found in “clean technologies” that facilitate the efficient use of water
    without requiring non-renewable energies [39]. As reported in [40], water-efficient
    irrigation, irrigation on demand, and irrigation using brackish water are technologies
    that will enable the better management of scarce freshwater resources [41]. Technological
    developments for irrigation processes will encompass sensors and communication
    devices, intelligent watering systems and high-efficiency delivery mechanisms
    for water and nutrients as well as a method for incorporating all of these elements
    into irrigation “packages” [36]. Similarly, irrigation water efficiency can be
    enhanced by improvements in the use of current installations and/or by adopting
    new equipment that is economically supported by funds from the European Agricultural
    Fund for Rural Development [42]. These funds are specifically intended to be used
    for the development of more efficient irrigation systems at the farm and irrigation
    district scales using new technologies (e.g., soil moisture and canopy sensors)
    that better match irrigation with crop water requirements. These developments
    towards increased sustainability in agriculture also encourage good agricultural
    practices, such as conservation tillage, restoration of groundwater and the correct
    management of fertilizers [43]. As highlighted in the [44] report, the improvement
    of water-use efficiency and productivity depends on the introduction of better
    agricultural practices in synergy with new irrigation management systems. In fact,
    the efficiency of an irrigation system is determined more by system management
    than by any inherent characteristic of the system [45]. Improperly managed “hi-tech”
    irrigation systems can also be wasteful and unproductive, and they can cause damage
    to the ecosystem as well as investment losses to farmers. 3. Case Studies Many
    Southern European countries have vast experience in the use of scarce and degraded
    natural resources, such as water and land. The rural mosaic of these areas is
    based on a combination of traditional irrigation systems and areas with extensive
    agrarian dynamism characterized by modern irrigation projects that have been promoted
    in accordance with criteria for water efficiency and food security [46]. Countries
    such as Spain, Portugal and Italy largely symbolize the dominance of water resources
    in any economic activity in these territories [47]. In such contexts, hydraulic
    constructions have played a central role in the attempt to control water in the
    agrarian plains, leading to the development of remarkable irrigation systems [48].
    Consequently, the construction of irrigation canals has played a fundamental role
    in the management of natural and productive resources, land reclamation and ecosystem
    conservation [49]. In the following sections, we briefly discuss the characteristics
    and peculiarities of four rural irrigation consortia in Mediterranean Europe (Figure
    1), with the aim of analyzing the prospects and difficulties of improving gravity-fed
    surface irrigation systems in these contexts. Figure 1. The location of the four
    irrigation districts. 3.1. The Est Ticino-Villoresi District The Est Ticino-Villoresi
    district is located in the heart of the Padana plain and is the second largest
    irrigation district in Italy, supplying irrigation water to approximately 115,000
    ha. The entire study area is characterized by a high number of small land-holdings
    with intensive, livestock-oriented practices. The main crops are maize and rice
    (in descending order). Maize is generally intended as food for livestock, while
    rice is generally sold at market. The pedo-climatic conditions are favorable for
    extensive cropping, but farming is strongly dependent on irrigation due to the
    high water requirements of these crops. By studying twelve years of meteorological
    data (from 1993 to 2013) from 10 agro-meteorological stations located in the district,
    Cesari de Maria et al. [2] found that during the agricultural season (April to
    September), the average temperature was approximately 20.2 °C, while the total
    rainfall was approximately 360 mm, with marked variability from year to year.
    The relative humidity was always high (>80%) and implies the presence of foggy
    months during the winter and hot and muggy months in the summer. During the irrigation
    period (June to September), the average daily reference evapotranspiration values
    (calculated based on the FAO Penman–Monteith equation by [50]) for the months
    of June, July, August and September were 4.7, 4.6, 4.0 and 2.8 mm·day−1, respectively.
    The traditional irrigation techniques for the two crops consist of furrow irrigation
    for maize and flood irrigation for rice, with water depths from 5 to 20 cm from
    just prior to seeding (generally occurring in May) to approximately 3 weeks before
    harvesting (generally occurring in September) for rice. Approximately 400 m3·s−1
    water is conveyed by gravity to all district areas by five main artificial canals
    that divert water from the Ticino and Adda rivers (the main two tributaries of
    the Po river). The Naviglio Grande, located in the western part of the district,
    is the oldest canal, dating back to the XIII century. It conveys a flow of approximately
    64 m3·s−1 from the Sommo Lombardo (a city close to the outlet of Lake Maggiore)
    to Milan, where its residual flow gives rise to the Naviglio Bereguardo (with
    an average flow of 5 m3·s−1) and the Naviglio Pavese (with an average flow of
    10 m3·s−1). The latter was finished at the beginning of the XIX century to provide
    a navigable link from Milan to Pavia and then from the Po river to the Ticino
    river. It is also the main canal for supplying irrigation to the fertile lands
    south of Milan. The Naviglio Martesana, located in the eastern part of the Est-Ticino
    Villoresi district, was completed at the end of the XV century. In this district,
    it is the only canal originating from the Adda river, from which it diverts an
    average rate of 25 m3·s−1. Finally, the Villoresi Canal is the most recent. It
    was built at the end of the XIX century to supply irrigation water to the lands
    of the North part of Milan, diverting an average of 50 m3·s−1 from the Ticino
    river (Figure 2). Figure 2. Location of the Est Ticino-Villoresi district inside
    the Lombardy Region (a); and the GIS representation of a part of the dense gravity-fed
    surface irrigation network, which originates from the Villoresi Canal (b). From
    these main five canals, the water is conveyed to the individual fields through
    a dense network of unlined open canals that have a combined total length of more
    than 5000 km. The management of the main canals and of most of the irrigation
    network is entrusted to the Est Ticino Villoresi Consortium, which was established
    at the end of the XX century and represents the last heir of a long chain of historical
    Consortia. Along the canals (from main canals to tertiary ditches), the flow regulation
    is entrusted by Consortium workers who manually open and close weirs and gates
    to supply the correct amount of water to all areas of the irrigation district.
    The water supplied to the farms typically has a weekly rotation. The water delivery
    efficiency of the irrigation network (from the diversion point to the farm) is
    quite low, with an amount of seepage along the canals ranging from 5% to 40%.
    However, these seepages are essential for groundwater recharge and for maintaining
    the natural equilibrium of the hydrological cycle. From a hydrological perspective,
    the district is characterized by a strong interaction between groundwater and
    surface water. The water table of the unconfined aquifer ranges from a few meters
    to 30–50 m from the ground level, with a strong variability from zone to zone.
    In the district, more than 200 springs are in operation and supply water for irrigation
    to most of the rural areas. In many cases, groundwater directly supplies water
    for the irrigation of downstream fields and preserves the Minimum Flow Level in
    the rivers. The irrigation network is strongly integrated into the urban fabric
    of the Milan metropolis, thus playing a scenic role in addition to its hydraulic
    function. It also represents an important historical heritage and is widely used
    for recreational purposes. For example, the Canale Villoresi represents a blue-green
    corridor between the Ticino and Adda rivers and has been enhanced through a series
    of projects aimed to increase cycle-tourism and light-draft boat navigability.
    The lack of flow measures in the network canals makes it difficult to assess water
    balances on different spatial scales and control water use efficiency. Only the
    main canals and some secondary ditches are monitored daily by Consortium workers,
    who read the water level gauge inside the hydraulic structures. Modern flow meter
    devices have been installed only at a few points, and in these points the measure
    of the flow is continuous. 3.2. The Baix Ter Irrigation District The Baix Ter
    irrigation district is located in the north-eastern region of Catalonia (Spain)
    and is part of the internal basins of Catalonia region (Figure 3). The water administration
    (planning, management and control) of this area falls under the exclusive jurisdiction
    of the Autonomous Community of Catalonia through the Catalan Water Agency. Figure
    3. Location of the Baix Ter irrigation district and the Irrigation Communities
    (Catalonia, Spain). Crop distribution is also shown. The Baix Ter is an alluvial
    plain that represents the main agricultural area of the internal basins of the
    Catalonia region. The total water demand for different uses in this area is approximately
    100 hm3 per year, of which 70% is used to meet the water requirements of major
    crops, mainly summer cereals (maize and rice), fresh fruit (apple trees), fodder
    (lucerne and ryegrass), poplars and nurseries of ornamental ligneous plants (Figure
    3). The irrigation water comes mainly from surface water catchments through dams
    constructed along the river and to a lesser extent from wells (approximately 800),
    which use water from the low Ter aquifer. Several circumstances related to the
    management of water resources in the Baix Ter area must be considered. The first
    is competition for water use. The area has a Mediterranean climate, characterized
    by important variations in water availability. The water is needed not only for
    agriculture; a huge amount is also transferred from the Ter River towards the
    Barcelona metropolitan area (8 m3·s−1) for urban and industrial uses, which currently
    use 70% of the flow rate of the Ter River and take priority when there are water
    restrictions. The recreational uses of this water are also very important since
    the Baix Ter area is included in the Costa Brava, which is important for tourism
    and is therefore of significant economic interest (approximately one third of
    the economic value generated by tourism for all of Catalonia). This is especially
    true during the summer period, when the agricultural water demand is the highest.
    A second consideration is that this area is located over the Baix Ter aquifer,
    with an extension of 165 km2 and is at risk of contravening the limits set by
    the EU Water Framework Directive due to its high concentrations of chlorides,
    nitrates and sulfates at specific locations. There are also reductions in the
    groundwater levels in different locations and a risk of seawater intrusion into
    the coastal areas. A third consideration is the high environmental and landscape
    importance both for the tourism interest in the area as well as from inclusion
    in the Montgrí, Illes Medes and Baix Ter Natural Park, which is considered an
    area of special environmental protection by the Autonomous Government of Catalonia.
    The multifunctional role of the irrigation canals of the Baix Ter district has
    been highlighted by [51,52]. The irrigators of the Baix Ter area are organized
    into four Irrigation Communities (Sèquia Vinyals; Sèquia Cervià de Ter, Sant Jordi
    Desvalls i Colomers; Presa de Colomers Marge Esquerre del Riu Ter; Reg del Molí
    de Pals) and grouped into the Catalan Association of Irrigation Communities. The
    Irrigation Communities are public law corporations attached to the basin organizations.
    The irrigation district of the Baix Ter occupies approximately 10,000 ha and consists
    of approximately 2800 tax irrigators, of which approximately one quarter are professional
    farmers. The water uptake from the Ter River is conveyed to a system of canals
    and gravity ducts, which distribute water to the plots. The total length of the
    primary canals is approximately 120 km. In some communities, the water concession
    ranges from 0.8 to 5 m3·s−1 throughout the year, while in other communities it
    varies depending on the month. The channels date from several centuries ago and
    were originally earthen constructions with irregular sections or with dry stone
    masonry. In recent years, the Department of Agriculture of the Catalonian Government
    has planned and executed important improvement works in the irrigation network,
    which are basically the concrete lining of the channels or the piping canals.
    These are only partial actions aiming to reduce water loss along the distribution
    network. The investments have been partially subsidized due to their high costs.
    The irrigation system in the Baix Ter district is mostly located along the surface,
    despite governmental economic policies promoting the transformation to pressurized
    irrigation, especially drip irrigation (DOGC, Num. 6947, 1 September 2015, Ordre
    ARP (270/2015)). The behavior of the farmers and Irrigation Communities can be
    primarily explained because surface irrigation is supposed to be a low cost to
    the farmer in terms of installation, with zero energy requirements. In the future,
    the coexistence of surface and pressurized irrigation systems in this area is
    predicted. The type of water tariff paid by the farmers is for the irrigable surface
    area and is slightly variable according to the irrigation district, ranging from
    120 to 160 €·ha−1·year−1 (excluding the fee for improvement works). Assuming an
    irrigation amount of 7000 m3·ha−1, the price is equivalent to 0.017–0.023 €·m−3.
    In the irrigation districts with earthen canals, 60% of the fee goes towards clearing
    vegetation from the channels and cleaning the beds. Usually, the water is distributed
    on demand, although in shortage periods it is distributed on rotation. All the
    moving elements of the channels are governed manually. In the context of the geographical
    area (with a high competency for the inter-sectoral water use, and some periods
    of insufficient supply), the main concern of the irrigators is to have a guaranteed
    water supply. The request of the irrigators and broad social sectors at the Water
    Administration has resulted in a greater flow rate of the Ter River, reducing
    the water transfer to Barcelona metropolitan area. The implantation of markets
    for irrigation water in this irrigation area would guarantee the optimal reassignment
    of the resource during low-water periods to prevent conflicts; however, the irrigators
    would not accept this new tool and its associated transaction costs [53]. The
    Irrigation Communities are facing several problems. (i) There is a lack of knowledge
    regarding the irrigation water needs and discharge rates required by different
    crops due to the lack of technology and appropriate metering systems. This fact
    does not encourage irrigators to make the best use of their allocated water; (ii)
    The hydraulic infrastructure is based on existing manual controls and is managed
    only by pre-established schedules that do not allow for adjustment of the water
    plot deliveries to the changing irrigation requirements. Therefore, it would be
    necessary to have real-time and continuous control of the water levels in the
    canals in order to obtain optimal deliveries improving, thus, distribution and
    application efficiencies up to the field scale; (iii) It is challenging to operate
    a hydraulic control system based on a manual system that also produces losses
    of water and overflows within the hydraulic network; (iv) It is difficult to manage
    the irrigation plots. The lack of technical criteria to define input flow rates
    and cutting times on the plot scale affects not only the achieved efficiency in
    the field but also the optimal alterations to the main and secondary channels.
    An example of the potential that can be achieved under surface irrigation can
    be illustrated by the irrigation distribution uniformity of the low quarter and
    efficiency application achieving of 88 and 93%, respectively, as reported by Arbat
    et al. [54] in a commercial furrow irrigated ornamental orchard in the Sèquia
    Vinyals; (v) The price the irrigators pay for the water is not consistent with
    the pricing policy set forth in the EU Water Framework Directive. The progressive
    adaptation of pricing is expected to happen and will be important for consideration.
    Consequently, improving the efficiency of the surface irrigation in the Baix Ter
    irrigation district should be approached with the dual aims of improving the irrigation
    channel control and improving the irrigation at the field scale. The required
    technology is based on the control and automation from the plot supply to the
    main and secondary channels, thus solving several problems that the Irrigation
    Communities of the Baix Ter area are currently facing, giving them the right tools
    and considering economic criteria to achieve a good return on their investment.
    The surface irrigation system is deeply rooted in the culture and customs of the
    irrigator of the Baix Ter region. It is the most sustainable irrigation system,
    given both its lack of an operational energy consumption and its effects on life-cycle
    assessment of materials and carbon footprint. Furthermore, this system is fully
    integrated into the landscape in an attractive way. These values are particularly
    interesting in an area such as the Baix Ter, which is a strategic area in terms
    of the tourism and recreation economies. 3.3. Urgell District The Segre River
    originates in the Pyrenees mountain range and passes through the central valley
    of Catalonia (NE Spain), ultimately flowing into the Ebro river. The irrigation
    district of the Urgell canal is located in this depression (Figure 4). The irrigation
    area is served by two main canals and four secondary canals, which supply a total
    area of 70,000 ha. The main water use is agriculture, but this waterway also provides
    urban, livestock, industrial and environmental supplies. Alfalfa, cereals, and
    fruits are grown. Surface irrigation is mainly used (92%), but drip and sprinkler
    irrigation is also used to a lesser extent. Figure 4. General view of the main
    and secondary canals of the Urgell Canal district. The main canal was built in
    1861, but most of the irrigation network has been modified. Most main canals (191
    km), secondary canals (102 km) and tertiary canals have all been lined, although
    a few stretches remain unlined given their historical and scenic interest. Recent
    studies [55] have shown that the conveyance efficiency of the main canals considering
    evaporation and seepage losses is 94%. When considering operation losses, this
    efficiency decreases to 86%, indicating that operations could be improved. The
    water users association is currently increasing the canal height, which would
    allow for a higher water capacity as well as automation. The network has several
    remotely controlled gates. The irrigation network is organized in rotation, with
    the ability to distinguish two types of zones: one in which regulating reservoirs
    have been built, without the need to irrigate at night, and another that represents
    40% of the irrigation area, which must be irrigated at night. The latter system
    translates into an inconvenience for farmers and a decrease in water efficiency.
    A possible improvement in this area would be to automate irrigation. Irrigation
    assessments have been completed [56]. These suggest that efficiency is closely
    related to the soil characteristics. In soils developed on thin detrital materials,
    irrigation efficiencies typically range between 65% and 85%, while in soils developed
    on gravels with high infiltration rates, the efficiencies are between 20% and
    40%. Before 2000, Segre river regulation was quite low to assure an adequate supply
    to the irrigation area, resulting in many years of shortage. For this reason,
    small weirs were built in drainage ditches in the lower irrigation area to derive
    this excess water from the highlands. This factor increases the overall efficiency.
    Inside the irrigation area, there is an endorheic basin. This basin contains a
    swamp that has grown after the construction of the canal due to surplus irrigation
    water, becoming a 200 ha swamp with abundant wildlife and fishing. In 1951, they
    drained the swamp to allocate more land for agriculture. However, in 2005, it
    was decided to recover it to restore its ecological and landscape functions and
    make it a tourist resource for the area. Presently, the canal provides the same
    amount of water as agricultural land. 3.4. Lis Valley District The Lis Valley
    district, from the Lis Valley Irrigation Project, is a small yet important agricultural
    area of the Center of Portugal, with a total area of 2000 ha managed by the Lis
    Water Users Association (Figure 5). Its irrigation and drainage system dates back
    to 1957. An annual average of approximately 7.1 million m3 of water is used to
    grow corn grain, rice, and horticultural crops as well as for orchards, meadows
    and forage. Figure 5. Location of the Lis Valley Irrigation Project (Portugal).
    The water supply to the open channels conveyance network relies on weirs installed
    along the Lis River and tributaries. In the dry season, it also uses water pumped
    from drainage ditches. The irrigation network comprises 17 weirs, two of which
    are modern and automatic structures. The length of the primary irrigation network
    is 44.5 km; the secondary irrigation network consists of 180 km of small lined
    or earthen channels. In terms of water distribution, the most important problems
    are the water shortage and poor water quality in the summer (dry) period, and
    the absence of automation mechanisms to control water levels in the network channels,
    leading to malfunctions. Furthermore, there is not a monitoring system in the
    distribution network to support its efficient operation. At the on-farm level,
    there is a need to further develop the irrigation systems by improving the land
    levelling and the use of water distribution equipment to accurately control the
    inflow rates. Presently, the national government is planning for the rehabilitation
    of a significant part of the water distribution network that will reduce the water
    losses in the channels and simplify their management. It will also allow for increases
    in the cultivation of more profitable crops, namely, nurseries and horticultural
    crops. However, the study of different options for the automation of this network
    is of particular relevance to achieve optimized solutions of water distribution
    that better integrate farm irrigation. Challenges in developing surface irrigation
    at the levels of off-farm (responsibility of the water users associations) and
    on-farm (responsibility of the individual farmers) distribution networks include
    improving several factors: (i) the quality of hydraulic infrastructures to reduce
    water losses and control flow more accurately by installing automatic control
    equipment in the networks; (ii) the management of collective networks through
    the implementation of operational plans to adjust the demand for water in each
    irrigation season with the corresponding distribution, which requires the integration
    of diverse information in real time; (iii) system design quality related to the
    maintenance of the land leveling at the field plot scale; (iv) irrigation control
    and allocation through monitoring of soil saturation and vegetation in addition
    to the adjustment of application times, feed rates, and required allocations;
    (v) water application control using automated systems to optimize application
    efficiency and reduce hand labour consumption; and (vi) the re-use of excess flow
    at the downstream end of irrigated fields. 4. General Issues That Emerge from
    the Case Studies Analysis of the case studies has identified several water resource
    management issues that need to be taken into account for the improved implementation
    of gravity-fed surface irrigation practices and techniques in the future. (i)
    The high level of competition for water among agricultural, civil and industrial
    users, especially where rural areas are included in or strongly connected to the
    urban fabric is one such issue; as is (ii) the importance of environmental and
    recreational uses of water. For example, some agricultural areas—such as Baix
    Ter, which is included in the Costa Brava area—are included in regions with a
    high level of tourism and economic interest, especially during the summer when
    the water demand for agriculture is at its highest); (iii) The role of aquifer
    recharge due to irrigation in preventing the risks of seawater intrusion in coastal
    aquifers should also be considered; as well as (iv) the low efficiency in water
    conveyance and distribution due to the often precarious control of the infrastructure
    and a lack of flow regulation flexibility; (v) Irrigation scheduling decision
    support services that provide the farmer with information about “when” and “how
    much” irrigation are also lacking. In particular, specific problems that occur
    in study areas are (i) the lack of knowledge of crop water requirements as well
    as the delivered water volumes at the single farm or irrigation district scales
    (due in many cases to the absence of appropriate metering systems); (ii) the limitations
    of the existing hydraulic infrastructure based on manual controls and managed
    according to pre-established seasonal schedules that do not allow for shorter-term
    adjustments to the changing irrigation requirements; and (iii) the unmeasured
    seepage losses from the canal network. Reasons for These Limitations The lack
    of technically sound criteria to define the correct flow rate and cutting time
    of the gates strongly affects the water use efficiency at the field scale and
    the water delivery efficiency at the canal scale. Rijo and Almeida [57] showed
    that conveyance efficiencies for automatic systems of flow regulation, developed
    in the context of the Sorraia Irrigation project (Portugal), were more than 80%
    during the irrigation period. In contrast, Koech et al. [58] reported that the
    application of automatic gate irrigation systems in furrow-irrigated cotton fields
    in Australia has led to an application efficiency of up to 90%. It follows that
    the problem of increasing the efficiency of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems
    should be approached with two synergic objectives: improving the control of flow
    in the irrigation canals (district scale) and improving the water application
    at the field scale (farm scale). Although researchers have developed new devices
    and practical scheduling procedures to improve gravity-fed surface irrigation
    systems over the last decade [59,60], the adoption of these devices and procedures
    has been limited for many reasons. At the farm scale, the issue most frequently
    mentioned by growers is the lack of financial benefits for changing their current
    practices, which they consider to be adequate. In many cases, the initial investment
    to modernize the traditional pattern of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems
    with automatic and remote-controlled devices is about the same investment necessary
    to adopt a pressurized system for irrigation. Moreover, in contexts such as Northern
    Italy, where extensive cultivation is mainly intended for livestock food and connected
    to the milk production economy, this conversion is not profitable. Therefore,
    future gravity-fed surface irrigation technologies should merge net farmer incomes
    with water efficiency and productivity so that the farmers will be persuaded to
    adopt these new technologies for their own economic interests while increasing
    irrigation efficiency. Using a financial approach to incentivize increases in
    water efficiency rather than an engineering one appears to be prudent when assessing
    irrigation performance at the farm level because any managerial (e.g., scheduling)
    and operational (e.g., equipment) inefficiencies associated with irrigation are
    implicitly included in the assessment of profits [60]. In fact, given that the
    current gravity-fed surface irrigation systems are mainly manually managed, such
    inefficiencies lead to an amplification of the time and labor costs required for
    irrigation, which must be subtracted from the yielded profits. Another factor
    strongly limiting the modernization of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems
    is the perception that farmers have about the efficient use of water for irrigation.
    In Knox et al. [60], the questionnaire answered by growers belonging to eight
    samples of farmers in eastern England showed that most of the growers surveyed
    (63%) considered “irrigation efficiency” to be best defined as “applying the right
    amount of water at the right time in the right place”. A quarter of the respondents
    interpreted irrigation efficiency as “maximizing the value of the water applied
    (Money/Volume)” and 13% as “improving production per unit of water applied (Yield
    weight/Volume)”. The definitions relating to irrigation water use efficiency,
    including “improving the yield from the same amount of water” and “maximizing
    the proportion of water used by the plant”, were not selected by any farmers.
    In Mediterranean contexts, this problem is exacerbated by the lack of farmer knowledge
    about crop water requirements and the insufficient presence of organizations (either
    governmental or commercial) to provide irrigation scheduling advice for farmers
    that adopt gravity-fed irrigation methods. Although some research on the development
    of irrigation decision support systems has been funded by EU in the last 10 years
    [61], it has not always succeeded in converting research outputs into marketable
    products and commercial success stories. Research activities are often more research-driven
    than farmer-driven, and only two projects of the 10 quoted in the work of Giannakis
    et al. [59] had developed a business plan to commercialize their research innovation.
    Lastly, the human capital characteristics of the farm populations play a prominent
    role in the adoption of new irrigation management tools and technologies for gravity-fed
    irrigation systems. Lichtenberg et al. [62] found that farmers with a higher level
    of education are more likely to adopt sensor network irrigation technologies.
    In particular, farmers with a high school education are 23% less likely to adopt
    the new irrigation technology compared to those with a post-secondary degree.
    Genius et al. [63] recorded similar findings, i.e., farmers with a higher educational
    level (more than 9 years) are more likely to adopt new irrigation technology.
    Genius et al. [63] found also that farmers up to 60 years old are more likely
    to adopt new technology than farmers older than 60 years, highlighting the short
    planning horizon of the older farmers. However, in the Mediterranean European
    countries, approximately 57% of farmers are older than 55 years old; in Portugal,
    Italy and Spain, these percentages are 71%, 61% and 55%, respectively [59]. In
    this context, farmers exhibit substantial risk aversion and are skeptical of adopting
    new technologies. This uncertainty can be alleviated through on-farm testing and
    demonstrations, farmer-to-farmer communication and the active involvement of farmer
    advisory systems [61]. At the district scale, the irrigation water delivery by
    gravity-fed surface irrigation systems is not usually measured or is often not
    measured accurately, particularly at the secondary and tertiary levels. In addition,
    the flow rates at the intake of the delivery canals are not routinely recorded.
    The reasons for these failings are mainly due to the complexity that the gravity-fed
    surface irrigation system networks have developed over the centuries. Many canals
    have a mixed use and are important for both the delivery and drainage of water
    from the fields. In several cases, this network is convoluted and abstruse. The
    lack of water measurements and poor quality of district records discourage the
    irrigation Consortium and Association from the implementation of new irrigation
    technologies that aim to improve water conveyance efficiency and resource allocation
    [64]. Moreover, the lack of methodologies for assessing the water delivery performance
    of the open irrigation canals makes the quantification of the gap between the
    potential and actual performance of these irrigation systems challenging [65].
    5. What Can We Do? 5.1. Technical Advice To address the problems described above,
    we believe that a practicable requalification of gravity-fed surface irrigation
    systems in the context of rural Mediterranean Europe could be achieved through
    strategies that evolve from trinomial Measure-Model-Management (M3). In the following,
    we try to explain this concept in light of the literature results obtained in
    different world contexts. Measuring facilitates the analysis of gravity-fed irrigation
    delivery systems in terms of adequacy, efficiency, dependability, and equity of
    water delivery [66]. The measures could provide a quantitative assessment not
    only of the overall irrigation system performance but also of the contributions
    to the total performance from the structural and management components of the
    system. For example, in the works of [67,68,69], the adequacy, efficiency, dependability,
    and equity indexes of open canals in Mali, Turkey and Egypt ranged from 0.20 to
    0.90, demonstrating the high possibility of improving the performances of the
    delivery systems adopting automated and remote-controlled operational procedures.
    Despite this, many studies on the possibility of assessing the water delivery
    performance of gravity-fed irrigation systems are present in the literature in
    the rural contexts of the United States of America, Africa and Southeast Asia
    [64,70], whereas no research has currently been completed by authors in Mediterranean
    European contexts. This is due to the lack of flow measures and the necessity
    of building hydraulic structures for reliably measurements. However, modern technologies
    that are based on optical sensors and on open-hardware devices could be suitable
    for the continuous and real-time control of flows in complex situations or open-unlined
    irrigation canals [71,72,73]. The work of Luthi et al. [74] on a smartphone application
    that calculates the flow by analyzing a few seconds of a movie sequence that is
    recorded by the operator on-site is a good example of such research. The flow
    is calculated based on measurements of the water level, the surface velocity obtained
    from Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) technique and a priori knowledge on the
    canal geometry. In Mediterranean Europe, this application could have several advantages,
    such as reducing the work time of Consortium workers to take measurements and
    improving the ease of data collection, which could simply be sent via SMS to a
    dedicated database. Models can be subdivided into three main categories. The first
    category focuses on the hydraulic analysis of irrigation canal flow networks,
    while the second aims to assess crop water requirements at farm and district scales.
    The third category uses decision support systems for scheduling irrigation. The
    first two typologies of the models could be considered for the reasonable operation
    and planning with optimized irrigation and water allocation. For example, the
    study by Kim et al. [75] carried out in a paddy district of South Korea showed
    the good performance (in terms of calibration and validation) of the combined
    hydraulic-hydrologic Storm Water Management Model (SWMM) for providing hydraulic
    analysis of the irrigation network and water balance in the fields. In Mediterranean
    European contexts, this model could assist in promoting accurate irrigation scheduling
    on the district scale based on crop water requirements as well as optimizing the
    distribution of water in the irrigation network through sluice gate control. In
    addition, conjunctive modelling based on hydrological-economic features could
    investigate the interdependencies between gravity-fed surface irrigation systems,
    the district water balance and the economic impact of new irrigation decision
    strategies [5]. Simulations and scenarios of the optimized irrigation scheduling
    and water allocations could be produced, thus improving the irrigation planning
    processes from the farm to the district scale [76]. We believe that for a fast
    feedback effect on Mediterranean European rural territories of the M3 approach,
    the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems should be equipped with automatic and
    remote-controlled gates whenever possible as well as flow meters for the continuous
    measurement of the irrigation flow both in the canals and into the fields. At
    the farm scale, Australian experiences in the cotton fields have shown that the
    application of these automatic systems leads to the maximization of the application
    and distribution uniformity efficiencies (>85%), ensuring that the water reaches
    the end of the field with a uniform level in all points of the field [58]. Currently,
    only two experiments are running in Spain and Italy for providing the crop water
    requirements using automatic and remote controlled prototypes of bay-gates. In
    Spain, automatic furrow irrigation is tested on maize and grass using soil humidity
    probes at different depths in the field as the control of crop water needs (Figure
    6a), while in Italy, automatic sluices governed by water level sensors in the
    field maintain the correct flood state of flood in the paddy field, as shown in
    Figure 6b [77]. Figure 6. Prototypes of automatic and remote controlled-gates
    for gravity-fed surface irrigation of grass field in Northern Spain (a) and rice
    field in Northern Italy (b). At the district scale, the overview provided by Oakes
    et al. [78] on the collective experience gained over the last 20 years in the
    development and application of automation technology to the open channel irrigation
    sector, primarily in Australia but more recently in the USA, China, New Zealand,
    India, Vietnam, France and Italy, highlighted that the automation and remote control
    of gravity irrigation systems will be useful for improving the productivity of
    irrigated agriculture to reach food production goals over the next several years.
    However, they suggest that the key success factor for the modernization of the
    gravity-fed irrigation systems is a smooth transition to an automated irrigation
    system, implementing sound education/information/training programs for both the
    consortium staff and customers in the use and maintenance of these systems. 5.2.
    Economic Advice The European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development supports
    investments in irrigation scheduling infrastructure to provide economic and environmental
    benefits. Several measures can be used for the protection and maintenance of water
    resources in agriculture, namely, measure 6.1.01 (for the realization and modernization
    of agricultural holdings), measure 7.6.01 (for infrastructure related to the development
    and adaptation of agriculture and forestry), measure 1.2.01 (for the vocational
    training and information actions), measures 10 and 16 (for agri-environment payments
    and cooperation), and measure 4.4.02 (for non-productive investments for irrigation
    management). In total, approximately 50% of the budgets of Rural Development Programmes
    in EU member states has been allocated to measures that relate to a certain or
    limited extent to water for the 2014–2020 period. 5.3. Reviving Interest in Gravity-Fed
    Surface Irrigation Systems Finding solutions that safeguard the gravity-fed surface
    irrigation systems is necessary to maintain the environmental and ecological equilibrium
    of rural areas in Southern Europe and to preserve the cultural heritage of these
    irrigation systems. The multi-functional characteristics of the gravity-fed surface
    irrigation systems (Figure 7) could be safeguarded by the conservation and revitalization
    of these systems driven by historic, ethnological, educational, ecological and
    environmental interests [79,80]. Two major directions could serve as the foundation
    for future revival initiatives. On the one hand, the focus could be on the preservation
    of gravity-fed surface irrigation systems themselves as an agro-cultural heritage
    [81,82]. On the other hand, the focus could be on the nature conservation benefits
    that result from these systems [83,84]. Figure 7. Example of the multi-functionality
    character of the gravity-fed surface irrigation system in Northern Italy rural
    contexts. In the first case, the traditional structure and networks of gravity-fed
    surface irrigation systems could be considered as an “eco-museum”, in which their
    complexity and ancient origin could be investigated through historical and landscape
    studies and possibly explained in situ during educational visits. In fact, the
    risk of a potential demise of traditional gravity-fed surface irrigation systems
    is equivalent to the loss of traditional knowledge. Gravity-fed surface irrigation
    is a typical skill-oriented technology [85]. Currently, gravity-fed surface irrigation
    practitioners are able to combine their rich hands-on experience with the local
    traditional knowledge. Their skills may be implemented into the new automatic
    gravity-fed surface irrigation systems with specific irrigation scheduling management
    tools according to the crop requirements and agronomic practices. In the second
    case, the nature conservation benefits of the gravity-fed surface irrigation systems
    have been widely demonstrated in the case study areas, where the centuries-long
    development of this type of irrigation system has contributed to the development
    of their characteristic agro-natural environment [86,87]. For example, the prolonged
    presence and circulation of water due to the surface irrigation of paddy fields
    from sowing to harvest represents a distinguishing feature of some of these irrigated
    areas (e.g., in parts of the Northern Italy plains and in the Baix Ter irrigation
    districts) that has been included in the European ecological network NATURA 2000
    and is on the official list of the European Special Protected Areas. In addition
    to heritage preservation and nature conservation, additional environmental factors
    have emerged as driving forces for the preservation and restoration of gravity-fed
    surface irrigation systems, although the integrated landscape-ecological consequences
    of these systems require further research [88,89]. As highlighted in the previous
    paragraphs, gravity-fed surface irrigation schemes are thought to be generally
    of low water use efficiency or even to be “wasteful”. To establish whether an
    irrigation technique is efficient for a specific territory, it is necessary to
    quantify the water availability and the irrigation water demand for that area
    and then to evaluate the efficiency of the irrigation systems. However, the irrigation
    efficiency should be evaluated using a larger-scale approach (from the irrigation
    district to the basin), considering not only the hydraulic efficiency but also
    the secondary benefits [90]. Such secondary benefits range from recreational features,
    including the picturesque rural roads bordering the canals, to ecological functions,
    including the preservation of the traditional fauna and flora of the rural landscape.
    These factors improve the multi-functional character of the gravity-fed surface
    irrigation systems. In a case study in northern Portugal, Van den Dries and Portela
    [86] demonstrated how the conversion of a gravity-fed surface irrigation system
    into a pressurized system has paradoxically provoked a reduction in the deliveries
    at the farm level. In gravity-fed surface irrigation systems, the water excess
    on the fields was returned to the natural downstream waterway, thus representing
    the new (and in many cases, the majority) input for the irrigation of the downstream
    farms. These ‘losses’, which are generally due to drainage or percolations, are
    important for regional aquifer recharge and for maintaining the minimum flow and
    level in the rivers [91]. In addition, the water ‘losses’ along the unlined water
    conveyance and distribution systems represent a possibility for aquifer recharge
    management [92]. Interestingly, a recent study by Seraphin et al. [93] found that
    using isotopes for tracing the contributions to the groundwater recharge of the
    Cru aquifer in France, showing that about 69% ± 9% of the surface recharge is
    caused by irrigation return flow i.e., from specific irrigation practices and
    the presence of unlined canals. Moreover, many assumptions suggest that the quality
    of water that flow in the gravity-fed surface irrigation canals is comparable
    with that in the feeding rivers. In the light of this consideration, the seepage
    of water from unlined canals, in contrast to deep percolation at the fields, preserves
    groundwater from the chemical contamination of agronomic treatments, pursuant
    to the EU directives for water pollution reductions (i.e., “nitrate directive”
    91/676/CEE [94]). Lastly, the perfect integration found between gravity-fed surface
    irrigation canals and urban fabric in many situations such as in Milan metropolis,
    confers to these irrigation systems a new important role related to a “hydraulic
    protection of the territory” [95]. In fact, the huge increase of impervious areas
    as a consequence of the urban expansion, in the last decades, has caused an unexpected
    increase in the frequency and intensity of flood events. In these urban contexts,
    where the areas for flood storage are hard to find, an alternative solution for
    flood risk mitigation (in addition to the green infrastructure projects) could
    be the rehabilitation of interconnections between sewer and irrigation canals
    with spillways designed for allowing rainwater to be stored into the irrigation
    network. 6. Conclusions In the last decade, concerns about water scarcity have
    focused on the relationship between irrigation and other competing water uses.
    Especially in the countries of Southern Europe, where gravity-fed surface irrigation
    systems are the most common infrastructure type for crop and pasture irrigation,
    many policy guidelines have started to promote the transformation of these traditional
    systems into pressurized ones to avoid waste and increase the supply efficiency.
    However, as highlighted in this work, to face the complexity of irrigation water
    resource management conflicts and address the challenges in improving irrigation
    practices, “hard-path” approaches are not enough. In fact, case studies show that
    gravity-fed surface irrigation systems have important environmental and ecosystem
    functions in addition to their hydraulic role and are part of the cultural heritage
    of rural Southern Europe. Some of these benefits are connected with maintaining
    the riparian vegetation and habitats along the canals, recharging the groundwater
    supply, and providing areas for recreation activities and tourism. Thus, designing
    smart “soft-path” measures will be possible to increase the flexibility of the
    gravity-fed surface irrigation systems in response to the projected climate and
    changes in water availability. These designs should consider distributed and participatory
    irrigation managements, on-demand irrigation, low-cost and reversible infrastructural
    interventions, flow measures and automatic and real-time controls. A new Irrigation-Energy-Environmental-Landscape-Cultural
    Heritage nexus has been added to the more traditional Energy-Irrigation nexus
    and Food-Energy-Irrigation nexus [96], demonstrating that if the gravity-fed surface
    irrigation systems currently present and deeply-rooted in Mediterranean rural
    contexts are opportunely restored, they are preferred over “modern” systems (such
    as pressurized pipes) because they provide “efficiencies” in many fields beyond
    their hydraulic functions. In particular, in contrast to the scarce supply efficiency
    at the farm scale, the effective efficiency of these irrigation systems at the
    district or basin scale is emblematic, given their capacity to exchange water
    with the subsoil, reuse field runoff and feed the rivers. Hence, ecosystem functions
    and landscape characteristics of the rural environments are ensured, guaranteeing
    favorable outcomes for all agro-environmental aspects. In our opinion, a smart
    restoration of the gravity-fed surface irrigation system in Southern Europe areas
    could be obtained using the M3 approach described in Section 5.1, combining flow
    measures and soft infrastructural improvements with hydraulic-hydrological and
    decision-support models as well as matching multidisciplinary competences and
    water user needs. It has become increasingly clear that the analysis of irrigation
    system developments is necessary for managing these territories, and this requires
    considering the availability of natural resources to interpret the changing demands
    of users and address the existing and potential conflicts that will arise between
    consumptive and non-consumptive water uses. In conclusion, we wish that with this
    work, the awareness of the importance and uniqueness of some Southern Europe gravity-fed
    surface irrigation systems will increase. It is our hope that in the future, agricultural
    and environmental policies will be further safeguarded, encouraging additional
    research on their continued enhancement and rehabilitation. Acknowledgments This

  description: Automated control systems in irrigation have in recent years made considerable
    progress, offering a wide range of new options. In this experiment, drip irrigation
    system automatically governed irrigation in accordance with a water level sensing
    system in the mini-pan with the help of evaporation. Data acquisition was performed
    by an electronic circuit, which processed data and then sent the data to the microcontroller
    (Pic16f877). In the system, a closed loop control system based on sensing water
    level in the mini-pan was used to activate irrigation, thereby the system started
    irrigation whenever water level in the mini-pan dropped to the set level. The
    performance of the automated system can be increased as the irrigation timing
    in the software is adjusted according to plant growth stages.

  description: 'Fertigation is an irrigation technology of integration of water and
    fertilizer, and has been widely used in micro-irrigation systems, because of uniform
    fertilization, high utilization of water and fertilizer, and effectively reducing
    the pollution of soil and environment. The venturi fertilizer injector has become
    one of the main means and important equipment to achieve fertigation due to its
    simple structure, economy, and practicability, but the liquid fertilizer concentration
    could not be easily adjusted automatically. In order to realize variable rate
    fertilization with a venturi fertilizer injector, a variable fertilizer apparatus
    based on PWM (pulse width modulation) technology has been developed, but the apparatus
    belongs to open-loop control from the perspective of automatic control, and its
    accuracy and stability is difficult to guarantee. Therefore, a closed-loop control
    automatic fertilizer-mixing device was developed to improve the liquid fertilizer
    concentration mixing accuracy and stability, by improving the structure of the
    variable fertilizer apparatus and adding a conductivity meter that was employed
    to feedback the real-time fertilizer solution concentration indirectly. The conductivity
    meter was designed based on a conductivity electrode, and a square signal whose
    amplitude is ±3.5 V was determined as the excitation signal of the conductivity
    meter through experiments, to weaken or even eliminate polarization effects and
    capacitance effects of the conductivity electrode in the measuring process. In
    order to further improve measuring accuracy, temperature compensation had been
    applied to the conductivity meter, the measuring range had been divided into several
    small-scale ranges which could be switched by a multiplexer ADG1408 controlled
    by a microcontroller, and the corresponding divider resistor and square signal
    frequency of each small scale range were determined by experiments. By comparison
    with a standard conductivity meter, whose model is sension 156, the effective
    measuring range of the conductivity meter designed was 0-12.64 mS/cm, and the
    conductivity meter designed was calibrated according to the data measured in the
    effective measuring range. It was known that the conductivity of the fertilizer
    solution measured by the conductivity meter has a significant linear relationship
    (the coefficient of determination R2 is 0.997) with the fertilizer solution concentration,
    based on conductivity testing of a series of different concentration fertilizer
    solutions prepared in the range of 0.1%-1.0%. In order to improve the control
    performance of the automatic fertilizer mixing device, a kind of control strategy
    of two-step regulating with coarse adjustment and fine adjustment was employed:
    first, the device adjusted the duty cycle of PWM for controlling the solenoid
    valve to mix fertilizer automatically, by calling the corresponding function based
    on the detected inlet water pressure; then the device uses a fuzzy control algorithm
    to regulate the duty cycle of PWM finely, according to the real-time fertilizer
    solution concentration measured by the designed conductivity meter, in order to
    make the mixed fertilizer concentration get close to the target concentration

    PWM（pulse width modulation）控制的占空比进行混肥；然后以电导率测量仪实时反馈混肥浓度，并采用模糊控制算法进一步细调PWM的占空比，使混肥浓度尽量逼近目标浓度。试验结果表明，电导率测量仪的有效测量范围为0~12.64
    mS/cm，它所测量的电导率与肥液浓度呈显著的线性关系，其决定系数 R2为0.997。对混肥装置进行了实测验证，结果表明混肥时的最大浓度误差为0.04%，控制装置达到稳态的响应时间为7.8～10.4
    s，能满足实际应用的要求。 关键词： 肥料模糊控制自动混合液体肥液浓度电导率 分类号： S224.21(农业机械及农具) 资助基金： 现代农业产业技术体系建设专项

    problemas provenientes da obstrução de emissores têm se constituído como uma das
    principais limitações à implantação de sistemas de microirrigação, principalmente
    quando se trata de gotejamento. Quando a causa da obstrução é oriunda de características
    químicas da água de irrigação, tem-se como alternativa o tratamento da água por
    meio da correção do pH, pois este determina as condições para a precipitação de
    íons e consequentemente para a obstrução dos emissores. Diante do exposto, o objetivo
    deste trabalho foi avaliar a eficácia de três lógicas de controle com realimentação,
    aplicadas ao ajuste automatizado do pH da água de irrigação. Realizou-se a sintonização

    OF FEEDBACK CONTROL LOGIC FOR AUTOMATED ADJUSTMENT OF WATER  pH USED IN MICROIRRIGATION
    2  ABSTRACT Clogging problems in emitters have been the major limitations for
    adoption of microirrigation systems, mainly drip irrigation. When clogging is
    caused by chemical agents, the treatment intended for pH adjustment constitutes
    a feasible solution, as it determines the conditions for ion precipitation,  and
    therefore emitters clogging. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficiency
    of three feedback control logic   systems for automated adjustment of water pH
    in microirrigation systems. The following control logic was tuned and evaluated
    for water pH adjustment using a control system coupled with an   acid  injection
    device: proportional integral controller (PI),  modified proportional integral
    derivative (MPID) , proportional integral derivative (PID).  These control logic
    systems were efficient for adjusting water pH. Settling times of   PID, PI and
    MPID controllers were 19.0, 20.0 and 68.5s, respectively.   The Integral Time
    Absolute Error (ITAE) was 188.7 (PID), 239.4 (PI) and 3083.3 MPID, which shows
    that MPID controller had the highest instability for water pH control.   Keywords:

  description: In the face of limited water resources, better utilization and operation
    of irrigation networks is essential. Use of control systems is considered as one
    of the most assured ways to achieve the aim. In the course of the present study,
    two centralized controllers are applied to the west canal of Aghili irrigation
    district in I. R. Iran. The proposed control algorithms consist of a distant Downstream
    PI Feedback control (DPIF), and a distant Downstream PI Feedback along with Feedforward
    control (DPIFF). In the controllers, each water-level regulator is adjusted as
    based on water levels in all the pools of the canal. The test case canal and flow
    scenarios are simulated using SOBEK. The controllers are evaluated using the simulation
    results. The results indicated that both of the proposed controllers possess the
    considerable needed potential to closely match the discharge (at the cross regulators)
    with those ordered by water users while properly maintaining the water level throughout
    the length of the canals of the irrigation system. It is apparent that the DPIFF
    controller is more effective than DPIF controller in providing a desirable performance.
    Use of these algorithms makes demand oriented water distribution as well as a
    better performance of the system possible. The DPIFF controller as the main control
    system accompanied by a local controller as a backup system can be recommended
    to present an efficient robust control system for the canal.

  description: In the present study, a distant downstream proportional integral (PI)
    feedback control with decouplers and a local upstream PI feedback control were
    applied to the West main canal of the Dez irrigation system in Iran. The model
    of the proposed canal was formulated in the SOBEK simulation package. The control
    system was programmed in MATLAB. To evaluate the control system potential, simulations
    were done for two months of the real offtake schedule. The performance criteria
    of the maximum absolute error (MAE), the integral of absolute magnitude of error
    (IAE), and the steady state error (StE) were determined for each pool of the canal.
    The results indicated that the applied controllers have considerable potential
    to closely match the discharge at the downstream check structures with those ordered
    by water users while maintaining the water level throughout the length of the
    canal. The performance indicator values showed that the distant downstream feedback
    (FB) control as a centralized control with decouplers is a satisfactory controller
    for the Dez main canal. Hence, operational water management in the canal may be
    improved if a centralized controller is used rather than individual local controllers.
    It is strongly recommended to implement the distant downstream FB control with
    decouplers as a control system in the proposed canal. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley

    have considerable potential to closely match the discharge at the downstream check
    structures with those ordered by water users while maintaining the water level
    throughout the length of the canal. The performance indicator values showed that
    the distant downstream feedback (FB) control as a centralized control with decouplers
    is a satisfactory controller for the Dez main canal. Hence, operational water
    management in the canal may be improved if a centralized controller is used rather
    than individual local controllers. It is strongly recommended to implement the
    distant downstream FB control with decouplers as a control system in the proposed
    canal. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. INTRODUCTION Irrigated agriculture
    generally uses large volumes of water compared to municipalities and industry,
    and competition for good quality water is at an all-time high in many regions
    around the world. Thus it is recognized that improved water management practices
    in agriculture can lead to substantial benefits in terms of water availability
    for expanded agricultural activity and for other uses, and can directly address
    many environmental concerns. Intelligent management of open-channel conveyance
    and delivery systems is necessary to achieve higher water savings in irrigated
    agriculture. Nowadays use of control systems in irrigation networks in the world
    for improving efficiency in water distribution and water delivery to users is
    more applicable. The main purpose of a flow canal control system is to optimize
    water delivery based on specific operational objectives related to water levels
    or discharges, or both, which are subject to external perturbations (Mutua and
    Malano, 2001). Whereas the behaviour of each network associated with the crop
    pattern and climate of the region in which network is located is different, hence
    the operation of each network will be specific. Specific operational objectives
    need to design specific control systems for each irrigation system. Because of
    this the design of highly accurate control systems in the presence of significant
    system uncertainty requires the designer to seek a robust control system. A robust
    control system exhibits low sensitivities to unknown demands (disturbances) and
    is stable over a wide range of disturbance variations. Malaterre et al. in 1998
    classified different control algorithms for the regulation of irrigation canals
    based on several criteria. These criteria may include measured variables, operating
    conditions (e.g. predicted withdrawals) and objectives (e.g. hydraulic targets).
    All control systems are in common area in term of using design technique (Malaterre
    et al., 1998). In principle, two main control techniques can be distinguished:
    feedback and feed forward. Sometimes a combination algorithm of both is also used.
    In water system controllers, feedback control is the most important control method.
    This is because the control actions are directly based on the control objective
    that the controlled system has to achieve. This can be seen in the block diagram
    of this controller (Figure 1). Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Feedback
    PI controller The feedback controller uses the deviations, calculated from comparison
    between target and measured water levels, to determine the control action. The
    control action has a correcting influence on the controlled variable (water level),
    which is measured again and compared to the target level, etc. This control loop
    is repeated with a fixed control time step and, in the end, equalizes the measured
    water level to the set-point. The control techniques are used in control system
    structures. Control systems are generally divided into upstream and downstream
    control. In a system operated with upstream control, water is released from the
    intake according to the prediction of water demand in the system, and the adjustment
    of each gate is based on the information upstream from it. Due to the difficulty
    of predicting the actual water demand precisely, water users at the downstream
    end of the system often receive either excessive or insufficient water. However
    with downstream control, water release and demand are better matched, in which
    water is released in response to the actual water withdrawal from the system and
    the adjustment of each gate is based on the information downstream from it. Another
    advantage of this type of control is that users can take water whenever they need
    it. In a system operated with downstream control, a target water level is maintained
    at the downstream end of each pool, immediately on the upstream side of the next
    check structures in the canal. A number of control methods have been proposed
    for maintaining a constant water level at the downstream end of each pool. The
    BIVAL control method (Chevereau and Schwartz-Benezeth, 1987) attempts to maintain
    a constant water level near the middle of each pool. The Electronic Filter Level
    Offset (EL-FLO) control method (Buyalski and Serfozo, 1979) and the approach of
    Zimbelman and Bedworth (1983) determine the adjustment of each gate based on the
    water level measured at the downstream end of each pool. The method proposed by
    Burt (1983) uses several water levels in each pool to take into account the trend
    of the flow. These approaches require extensive simulations to tune the control
    parameters. The effectiveness of the control parameters largely depends on the
    experience of the designer. Balogun et al. (1988), and Reddy et al. (1992) proposed
    a centralized and local control method, respectively, using a linear quadratic
    optimization technique. The control parameters are derived from the initial steady-flow
    condition; hence, further study is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of the
    control when the variation of the flow is large. Rodellar et al. (1989) proposed
    a predictive control method based on the Muskingum model, which describes a simplified
    relationship between flow rates at the upstream and downstream ends of the pool.
    This method is quite straightforward. However, the target of the control is flow
    rate rather than water level, which makes it less convenient to apply. An example
    of the designed control method of combined technique is the downstream proportional-integral
    (PI) feedback controller with feed forward control and decouplers for the Narmada
    main canal in India (Montazar et al., 2005). Also, Weyer (2002) proposed a decentralized
    PI control for irrigation systems. The controllers were tested at the Haughton
    main channel in Queensland, Australia. In the present study, two control algorithms
    are designed and evaluated for the Dez main canal in Iran. We applied a linear
    control theory for designing local upstream PI and distant downstream PI with
    first-order low-pass filter (PIF) feedback control with decouplers for the proposed
    canal. MATERIALS AND METHODS Proposed canal The Dez irrigation network is located
    in the south-west of Iran in the north of Khuzestan province. This main canal
    was designed for the conveyance of irrigation water from the Dez river to the
    irrigated areas in the north of Khuzestan province. The Dez irrigation network
    includes three large main canals. This study has focused on the West main canal
    of the Dez irrigation network. Total length of the West main canal is 93 km, of
    which in this study the first 45 km (13 pools) of main canal are considered. The
    West main canal design discharge capacity at the beginning of the canal is 157 m3 s−1.
    There are 14 in-line check structures along the length of this part of the canal.
    All the check structures are radial gates. There are 71 offtake structures and
    15 cross-structures like inverted siphons, culverts and check siphons on the main
    canal. The laterals are used for delivery of water for farmers and other users.
    Figure 2 shows the longitudinal profile of the West main canal of the Dez irrigation
    system. Up to now, the canal is manually controlled. The operators deliver the
    demands of water users according to their requests. As the demands of the water
    users, in terms of flexible delivery, are increasing, there is an urgent need
    to support the operators by automating (parts of) the structure operations3. Figure

    at wileyonlinelibrary.com Model set-up and calibration The model of the West main
    canal of the Dez irrigation network is simulated with SOBEK simulation package.
    SOBEK uses the WL|Delft Hydraulics (2000) implicit finite difference scheme. In
    this study, the hydrodynamic and real-time control modules are used. Real-time
    control is used to adjust the control structures depending on the actual situation.
    The set-up preparation for the SOBEK model involves specifications of canal path,
    cross-sections, layout of the canal network, regulators, upstream and downstream
    boundary conditions. Data on geometry of the canal and hydraulic structures were
    collected from the water authority of Khuzestan province. The geometry of structures
    which is necessary for the model includes type of gate, number and width of gate,
    crest levels and discharge coefficients. Based on real conditions in the Dez main
    canal, the boundary condition at the system source is a constant water level at
    the upstream side of the head gate. For hydraulic calibration of the model presented,
    we used two months of six months'' daily gathered real operation data. The comparisons
    between observed and simulated values were made using the following criteria proposed
    by Jabro et al. (1998): (1) (2) (3) (4) where Si, Mi and M are the simulated,
    measured (observed) and average of measured values, respectively. The maximum
    error (ME) is a measure of the maximum error between any pair of simulated and
    measured values. The lower limit and the best value of ME is zero. The root mean
    square error (RMSE) provides a percentage for the total difference between simulated
    and measured values proportioned against the mean observed values. The lower limit
    for RMSE is zero and indicates a more accurate simulation. The modelling efficiency
    (EF) is a measure for assessing the accuracy of simulations. The maximum value
    for EF is one, which occurs when the simulated values match the measured values
    perfectly. The coefficient of residual mass (CRM) is an indication of the consistent
    errors in the distribution of all simulated values across all measurements with
    no consideration of the order of the measurements. A CRM value of zero denotes
    no bias in the distribution of simulated values with respect to measured values.
    The other important parameter for comparing the estimated and measured values
    is the mean absolute error of estimation: (5) MAE is the mean absolute error of
    estimation, which is better to be close to zero. In the present study on the Dez
    main canal, the constant water level at the source and the real flow hydrographs
    at the downstream end of the canal and each offtake were chosen as upstream and
    downstream boundary conditions. Manning''s roughness coefficient and discharge
    coefficients were used for calibration of the model. Two sets of measured data
    were used for model calibration and validation. These data include measured discharge
    and water surface elevation at various locations along the canal. After the model
    was calibrated and validated, it was used for simulation of other desired conditions
    and design of control algorithms. To calibrate the model, an initial run was made
    with default global values of Manning''s roughness coefficient n and gate discharge
    coefficients. Later these parameters were adjusted manually and the model was
    rerun. Based on the comparison, the model parameters were adjusted. This process
    was continued until the observed and simulated values were in close agreement.
    To validate the calibrated model, the second set of discharges and water levels
    along this canal (four months of six months'' daily gathered real operation data)
    was used. If the observed and simulated values were still in close agreement without
    any changes in model calibration parameters, it could be concluded that the model
    was valid for the intended purpose. Designing control algorithms Proportional
    integral controllers (PI controllers) are the simplest and most widespread controllers;
    see Litrico et al. (2006), Montazar et al. (2005) and van Overloop (2005) for
    an overview. The calculated control action is proportional to the magnitude of
    the output water level error (with a factor Kp), proportional to the magnitude
    of the integral of the output error (with a factor Ki). In continuous time, this
    is represented by (6) where u = control action, e = error, Kp = proportional gain
    factor and Ki = integral gain factor. The controller parameters can be changed
    to improve the settling time, to reduce the maximum error or to minimize a given
    performance criterion. A filter can be necessary to control a canal which is influenced
    by resonance behaviour. In the proposed control algorithm, we added first-order
    low-pass filter thorough the designed controllers to remove the resonance waves
    which play a dominant role in water movements. Hence a PIF controller is a PI
    controller applied in series with a first-order low-pass filter. Besides the proportional
    and integral gain factor, a filter constant also has to be determined, which is
    used to filter out the effect of resonance waves on the measured water level.
    In an open canal system with different pools like the Dez irrigation system under
    distant downstream control, a control action not only influences the downstream
    water level but also has a direct unintended effect on the water level just upstream
    of the control structure. When the series of canal pools is controlled by a centralized
    controller, this effect can be taken into account. We consider this effect by
    adding decouplers to the controller structure. Figure 4 shows the scheme of the
    proposed controller. The control actions as output are calculated based on the
    magnitude of the water level deviation which is as input to the controller. The
    calculated value is added to the upstream gate directly to make a centralized
    controller. In the case of distant downstream feedback control, the water level
    at the downstream side of a reach is controlled by adjusting the gate at the upstream
    end of the reach, in reaction to deviation from the set-point. This type of control
    is called demand driven, because a drop in the downstream water level will cause
    the gate upstream to open and thus restore the water level, not taking into account
    the available water in the upstream reach. Figure 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Block diagram of local upstream PI feedback control. This figure is available
    in colour online at wileyonlinelibrary.com Figure 5 shows the scheme of proposed
    local upstream control for the Dez irrigation system. In a system operated with
    upstream control (most applied operation in irrigation systems) water is delivered
    to the users based on the prediction of demand in the system. Because of the difficulty
    of predicting the actual water demand precisely, upstream control has problems
    at the downstream end of system where the users receive more or less water than
    they need. This problem can be partly solved by applying automated local upstream
    control. Figure 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Offtake flow changes schedule
    In the present study, four robust control systems for the Dez main canal are programmed
    in MATLAB. Evaluation of the proposed controllers was done based on the real offtake
    schedule of two months. The data are gathered from the site for two months of
    2006 from 21 March to 21 May. Based on the Dez irrigation system behaviour, the
    offtake schedule during the first month of simulation is variable. The controllers
    maintain the water level at target level (set- point) at the downstream end of
    the canal pools. Due to scheduled variation of offtake for operational purposes,
    the set-point deviations take place at the end of each pool. The distant downstream
    PIF controller calculates a desired flow change for the check structures on the
    upstream side of the canal pools on the basis of the magnitude of water level
    deviation in the downside of check structures which occurs due to schedule variation
    and controller gains. But the local upstream PIF controller calculates a desired
    flow change for check structures on the downstream side of canal pools to control
    the water level at the upstream side of check structures. The check structure
    flow controller adjusts the gate setting to provide the desired flow using the
    formula of the structure''s depth–discharge relation. The parameters of the PIF
    controllers are tuned according to the tuning rules for open channels (Schuurmans,
    1997). The decouplers on the distant downstream PIF controller pass the desired
    flow to the next check structure upstream in order to decouple the upstream pool
    from the disturbance caused by the control action. We used the proposed multiple-model
    optimization of PI controllers on canals by Overloop et al. (2005) to tune the
    local upstream FB control. In this technique, a linear controller is tuned in
    such a way that it stabilizes all models (for all sets of flows) and optimizes
    an objective function that is a sum of individual objective functions, each valid
    for one of the models from the set. By applying a multiple model optimization
    that minimizes the water-level deviations from the target level in all pools,
    the tuning of decentralized PIF controllers on canals may be done in one design
    step, without an extensive trial-and-error procedure. The tuning rules provide
    parameters for PI control, valid for various ID model parameters corresponding
    to different flow regimes. Table I shows the PI parameters for the controllers.

    Performance indicators In order to assess the performance of the controllers and
    to have a quantitative comparison, the performance indicators are computed for
    each controller. Clemmens et al. (1998) presented several performance indicators
    to judge the overall effectiveness of controllers. Calculated indicators for controlled
    variables are: the maximum absolute error (MAE), the integral of absolute magnitude
    of error (IAE) and the steady state error (STE). These indicators are defined
    as (7) where yt is computed water depth from model at time (t) and ysetpoint is
    target water depth at the end of each pool. The integral of absolute magnitude
    of error is (8) where Δt regulation time step and T is time period for simulation
    and STE is (9) where t0 is 2 h. These indicators are calculated for controllers
    for each pool in the Dez irrigation system in the same period of simulation. The
    steady state error indicates the ability of the controller in damping perturbations
    which occur in pools due to the operation of check structures. To calculate this
    index for each pool the last 2 h of simulation are considered. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
    Table II shows the statistical parameters used for model calibration and validation.
    High values of EF and low values of ME, MAE, CRM and RMSE show that the model
    was calibrated accurately and is valid for the simulations. Table II. Statistical

    MAE (%) 1.589 0.894 There are 70 offtakes on the West main canal. Figure 5 presents
    the discharge schedule of six offtakes on the Dez canal. The offtakes of W2 and
    W1L13 have the highest and lowest discharge and flow change values, respectively.
    Daily operation of the Dez canal to deliver the water demand for users is accomplished
    during the cropping period. The real gathered offtake schedule is programmed to
    simulate a real flow delivery by the controller. Figures 6 and 7 show the discharge
    of check structures for distant downstream FB control and local upstream FB control,
    respectively. As can be seen in the figures, offtake W2 which has the highest
    change in flow has more effect on the discharge of check structures. The discharge
    of check structures is similar to discharge variation of W2, which controller
    tried to deliver the demands of offtake schedule more sufficient. Figure 6 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Discharge of check structures for remote downstream
    FB control (first month of simulation) Figure 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Discharge of check structures for local upstream FB control (first month of simulation)
    The water level on the upstream side of check structures for controllers is presented
    in Figures 8 and 9. The figures clearly show that both controllers try to achieve
    the desired water levels as quickly as possible. The desired flow rates of offtakes
    can be provided when the desired water level in the canal is achieved sufficiently.
    Based on the operational behaviour of the Dez canal, the offtake flow for the
    simulated month has more changes. The discharge of W2 changes from 43 to 1.7 m3 s−1.
    This flow change in offtake schedule caused a large disturbance on the upstream
    side of check structure D2. It can be seen that local upstream control has more
    influence on both upstream and downstream pools since in this controller the interactions
    between the pools are not taken into account. The water level on the upstream
    side of check structures, for distant downstream feedback control with decouplers
    (Figure 9), has a smooth change in water level. The effect of decoupling can be
    clearly seen in this figure. By visual comparison of these controllers, it is
    apparent that distant downstream feedback control with decouplers is more effective
    than local upstream control and on the other hand it is a robust controller. But
    from the implementation viewpoint this controller has more costs since because
    of using decouplers between the pools it will need transmission lines or wireless
    connection devices along the canal. Local upstream control is the automated form
    of the current operation in the Dez irrigation system. It can be mentioned that
    this controller also has more benefits in relation to manual operation. Figure

    Water levels on the upstream side of check structures for local upstream feedback
    control. Table III presents the calculated performance indicators for the designed
    controllers. These values demonstrate that the controllers result in a robust
    control system which during the worst scenario of simulation could control the
    water level at the set-point with relatively small deviation from the desired
    set-point. The quantitative comparison based on the calculated indicators also
    shows that distant downstream FB control with decouplers is an effective control
    method for this canal. For pool no. 4 the value of MAE and IAE for both control
    methods is a maximum value. Due to the branching large offtake from this pool,
    significantly greater oscillations occur in water levels which cause the increase
    in these indicators. The STE index is calculated for the last remaining 2 h of
    simulation for each pool. This index presents the ability of controllers to bring
    the controlled variables back to the set-point fast and without constantly overshooting.
    These values show that both controllers could bring the water level to the set-point.
    The average value of MAE, IAE and STE for distant downstream FB control is 0.071,
    0.003 and 0.001, respectively, while these indicators for local upstream FB control
    are 0.229, 0.016 and 0.005, respectively. Table III. Performance indicators for

    two control methods on the West main canal of the Dez irrigation system in Iran.
    In the design of centralized canal control on an open-water system, local controllers
    should be considered as an option, either as the main control system or as the
    backup system. Successful implementation of water-level controllers with these
    structures using local PI controllers depends greatly on the tuning of the control
    parameters. The results of designing and tuning of these controllers show that
    the proposed controllers have significant potential to closely match the discharge
    at the downstream check structures with those ordered by water users while maintaining
    the water level throughout the length of the canal. Comparison of performance
    indicators shows that the distant downstream FB control as a centralized control
    with decouplers is a satisfactory controller for the Dez main canal. Moreover,
    according to the canal dimensions and its design capacity, it is suggested that
    a centralized controller can provide high performance, and control performance
    is improved if a more centralized controller is used rather than individual local
    controllers. So it is strongly recommended to policy makers to implement distant
    downstream FB control with decouplers as a control system in this canal. REFERENCES

  description: A downstream controller is designed for an irrigation canal reach using
    a design technique called quantitative feedback control theory (QFT). The performance
    of this controller is compared to a proportional, integral, derivative (PID) controller
    and a linear quadratic regulator (LQR) controller. In this study, the QFT controller
    is designed for a single canal reach because it best demonstrates how a controller

    For the operating conditions that are defined in this paper, the QFT controller
    is shown to have slightly better performance than the PID controller and better
    performance than the LQR controller. When the canal hydraulic roughness is increased,

    is designed for an irrigation canal reach using a design technique called quantitative
    feedback control theory (QFT). The performance of this controller is compared
    to a proportional, integral, derivative (PID) controller and a linear quadratic
    regulator (LQR) controller. In this study, the QFT controller is designed for
    a single canal reach because it best demonstrates how a controller is designed.
    Previous research for this canal model provided data for comparison. For the operating
    conditions that are defined in this paper, the QFT controller is shown to have
    slightly better performance than the PID controller and better performance than
    the LQR controller. When the canal hydraulic roughness is increased, the QFT controller
    still performed better than the PID controller. Introduction Throughout the world,
    there is an increasing demand for fresh water. As rural, environmental, and urban
    demands increase, new approaches must be investigated to stretch the limited water
    supply. In some areas, people have limited water allocations and they have learned
    to conserve and achieve the greatest benefit from a limited supply. Through improved
    knowledge and skills, farmers with limited water supplies have improved crop yields.
    As farmers’ knowledge and skill improve, more timely and accurate water deliveries
    are required. Water supply companies and irrigation districts are also learning
    to conserve water through improved management methods. In some cases, water is
    conserved by upgrading the delivery system, while in other cases, water is conserved
    by automating existing canal gates (Walker and Stringam 1999). This paper discusses
    the design and testing of a downstream controller for a single reach (local controller).
    This controller is designed using a technique called quantitative feedback control
    theory (QFT). The controller is designed for a single reach because it serves
    as an example that best explains the design methods. This paper does not use the
    multiple reach examples defined by the ASCE test cases (Clemmens et al. 1998)
    because these cases are for multiple reaches in series. The QFT method is demonstrated
    for a canal model that is reported by Reddy (1990). This model is used because
    data are provided to make comparisons. A description of a QFT design for a single
    reach is required before a multireach design can be explained. QFT controllers
    can be designed to operate multiple reaches (global system or global controller)
    but the basic design techniques have to first be explained for a single reach.
    A global QFT controller will be reported in a subsequent paper. Background On
    the majority of canal systems, flow rates and water control depths are varied
    throughout the irrigation season. In addition, canal hydraulic parameters change
    over time. In control terms, the system is time varying. This is especially true
    for earthen canals because weeds grow throughout the year, embankments degrade,
    sediment collects in various places, and seepage changes throughout the season.
    Even concrete-lined canals experience changes (Rogers 1997). In addition, it is
    virtually impossible to determine exact canal parameters for many earthen canals.
    If the canal was constructed several years ago, the original design specifications
    may have been lost or misplaced. Even if the specifications were available, the
    canal system is not likely to be in the same condition as the day it was constructed.
    For these reasons, a control system that operates optimally must be sensitive
    to changes in canal system parameters and handle varied operational control-depth
    set points. The various automation methods that have been developed for canal
    automation are diverse in their design and implementation. The control methods
    that have been studied may be categorized into three areas: process control, heuristic
    control, and analytical methods. A simple mathematical model that simulates canal
    hydraulics may be used in process control design. However, canal hydraulics can
    be difficult to accurately model. This is especially true with earthen canals.
    Heuristic Control Heuristic methods (trial and error designs coupled with canal
    operations experience) were developed because of the difficulty of deriving an
    accurate canal model. Examples of heuristic canal controllers are the CARDD (Burt
    1983), BIVAL (Chevereau and Schwartz-Benezeth 1987), and UMA (UMA Engineering
    Ltd. 1989) methods. Parrish (1994) proposed a method similar to the UMA and CARDD
    methods. Analytical Control Analytical methods develop control algorithms based
    on hydraulic equations. Technically, the analytical methods described by Wylie
    (1969), Falvey and Luning (1979), and Liu et al. (1992) are feed-forward methods.
    Even though this paper describes a downstream feedback controller, the feed forward
    control method is mentioned because the desired outcome is to control a downstream
    water level. Process Control Methods Several process control methods have been
    developed over the past 50 years. The most prevalent and successful is proportional,
    integral, derivative (PID) control. This method is a subclass of the frequency
    design control method (Dorf 1992; Phillips and Harbor 1991; and Stephanopoulos
    1984). PID control has demonstrated a great degree of robustness in many applications.
    It is used extensively in industrial applications because of its robust nature.
    The Laplace form (Phillips and Harbor 1991) of this control equation is shown
    below G ( s ) = K d s 2 + K p s + K i s (1) where G ( s ) represents the controller
    or compensator transfer function; K p = proportional gain; K i = integral gain;
    K d = derivative gain; and s = Laplace operator term. A control algorithm may
    include all three components or some of these components. The majority of downstream
    controllers do not use the derivative component because it is hard to tune for
    long time delays. This controller can be designed/tuned using a system model equation
    and frequency design techniques. A controller can also be developed using an empirical
    design method such as the Ziegler-Nichols tuning method (Stephanopoulos 1984).
    El-Flo (Ploss 1987) used a simplified form of the PID controller where the derivative
    component is not used, but the proportional component and, to some extent, the
    integral component are used. Wahlin and Clemmens (2002) also used a proportional
    integral (PI) controller to operate a series of canal reaches. The PI controller
    was tuned by trial and error for one reach, then an additional reach was added
    to the system and the system was retuned. Wahlin (2004) developed a downstream
    controller with a feed-forward component. Litrico and Fromion (2006) used an analytical
    design method to develop a downstream PI controller. The PID equation has an additional
    “ s ” term [Eq. (1)] in the numerator, indicating that there is an excess of zeros
    (numerator roots) over poles (denominator roots). Thus, there is a potential for
    instability. A stable controller design will have equal poles and zeros or more
    poles than zeros. This makes tuning or selecting gains very important because
    poorly selected gains can create a controller that has ranges of instability.
    Often, systems exhibit varied responses throughout the entire operation range
    and multiple gains or gain scheduling (Stephanopoulos 1984) may be needed. State-space
    design is another process control method that has been used to develop canal controllers
    (Balogun et al. 1988; Reddy 1990; Clemmens et al. 1997; Schuurmans 1997). Reddy
    (1990) developed a single pool controller while the other researchers focused
    on multireach control systems. Reddy used linear quadratic regulator (LQR) theory
    to design the controller for a single research. State-space methods require a
    reasonable system model for controller design. Defining a reasonable model is
    as difficult for state-space design as it is for frequency design control methods.
    The system model must be linearized and often simplified to determine the required
    control gains. In the case of a canal system, the control routine requires a linearized
    system for one control depth, roughness, and flow rate. If any of these parameters
    change significantly, a new set of gains is required to optimally control the
    canal gates. This problem can be dealt with using a technique called gain scheduling,
    but this technique can be complicated and difficult to properly program into the
    control code (Stephanopoulos 1984). QFT A process control method termed QFT can
    be used to design control algorithms for systems that have uncertain or time-varying
    parameters (Horowitz 1993). QFT is a frequency design control method that is used
    to develop a feedback controller/compensator. This design method incorporates
    differential, integral, and proportional control components similar to PID, but
    these components are balanced to insure stability. This method was developed with
    the understanding that it is impossible to develop a mathematical relationship
    that exactly models a real system. This design method can be used to design a
    canal controller, but the variability in canal parameters must be determined for
    the entire operational range. These parameters are then used to construct a design
    region/boundary on a Nichols chart (Horowitz 1993). If the designer does not cross
    this boundary, the controller is guaranteed to be stable through the entire operation
    range. System Model QFT requires a system model or extensive testing to determine
    the design boundary. Schuurmans (1997) conducted extensive research to develop
    a simplified process model that can be used for canal controller design. The model
    is simpler than the St. Venant equations and takes the following form: P u ( s
    ) = e − T s A s (2) where P u ( s ) = variable that represents the “plant” or
    in this case the canal; e − T s = time -delay function; T = time delay (s); A
    = surface area of the backwater curve ( m 2 ) ; and s = Laplace operator. Schuurmans
    et al. (1999) described how values can be determined for A and T . Canal Model
    The canal dimensions that are used to design a downstream controller were taken
    from Reddy (1990). Reddy used a state-space method to design a local downstream
    controller. The canal has a length of 5,000 m, a longitudinal channel slope of
    0.0003, a side slope of 1.0, a bottom width of 1.70 m, a Manning roughness of
    0.016, an upstream reservoir elevation of 103.2 m, a downstream reservoir elevation
    of 101.14 m, an upstream canal invert of 102 m, a downstream canal invert of 99.94
    m, and a downstream target depth of 1.2 m. The canal model is initially operated
    with a constant flow rate of 3.02 m 3 / s . The turnout flow at the end of this
    canal is 2.50 m 3 / s and the flow at the end of the canal is 0.52 m 3 / s . QFT
    Controller Design While QFT can be used to design a global control system, the
    design of a local controller must first be understood. The remainder of this paper
    will describe the design of a local downstream controller for a single canal reach.
    A nonlinear model that numerically solves the St. Venant equations (Stringam 1998)
    was used to develop model parameters for A and T . The values were determined
    using a method described by Schuurmans (1997). Values ranging from 9,197 to 9,290
    m 2 were obtained for A and 1,200–1,300 s for T . These values where inserted
    into Eq. (2) and the frequency response of each equation was plotted on a Bode
    plot (Fig. 1). From the values for area and time, crossover frequencies of 1.01
    × 10 − 5 and 9.09 × 10 − 6 rad / s were measured on a Bode plot (Fig. 1). Fig.
    1. Bode plot for A = 9 , 120 m 2 and T = 1 , 300 s This plot is obtained by placing
    a range of frequencies into the model equation and the resulting values are placed
    on the Bode plot. The point where the plot of the system equation model crosses
    over the 0-dB line on the Bode plot is termed the crossover frequency (Dorf 1992).
    This is a critical point because this is where the closed loop canal model is
    likely to pass from an unstable condition to a stable one. The values for A ,
    T , and a crossover frequency of 1.01 × 10 − 5 rad / s were used to calculate
    phase values ranging from −90.752° to −90.694° and magnitude values from 20.55
    to 20.64 dB. These values are determined by first converting the “ s ” term of
    Eq. (2) into corresponding imaginary and frequency components P ( j ω ) = e −
    j ω T A j ω (3) where j = imaginary number and ω = crossover frequency in rad/s.
    This equation can be broken up into magnitude and phase components as follows:
    | P ( j ω ) | = 1 A ω ; ∠ P ( j ω ) = ( − ω T − π / 2 ) (4) One of the magnitude
    values was generated as follows: | P ( j ω ) | = 1 A ω = 1 9197 ⋅ 1.01 × 10 −
    5 = 10.765 (5) This value is converted to dB in order to locate a point on the
    Nichols chart (Fig. 2) 20 ⋅ log ( 10.765 ) = 20.64 dB (6) The corresponding phase
    angle is determined through the following relationship: ∠ P ( j ω ) = ( − ω T
    − π / 2 ) = ( − 1.01 × 10 − 5 ⋅ 1200 − π / 2 ) = − 1.58 rads / s (7) The value
    is converted to degrees by performing the following operation: − 1.58 rads / s
    ( 180 π ) = − 90.692 ° (8) A detailed explanation of how these values are determined
    can be found in Houpis and Rasmussen (1999). The angles and magnitudes are used
    to define corners of a design template (Fig. 2). The values for magnitude and
    phase that were generated for the values of A and T are shown in Table 1. Once
    the values for all four corners are determined, a template can be plotted as shown
    in Fig. 2. This template defines a region of uncertainty because the canal parameters
    cannot be defined exactly. If the true canal parameters were known and the parameters
    did not vary, the template would be defined by a dot and not an area. All of the
    numbers that have been determined so far have been for a frequency of 1.01 × 10
    − 5 rad / s . These are the numbers that are used to design the template in Fig.
    2. A template was also constructed for the 9.09 × 10 − 6 rad / s frequency, but
    it was smaller than the template in Fig. 2. The worst-case scenario occurs for
    a frequency of 1.01 × 10 − 5 rad / s . Controller design is continued for the
    1.01 × 10 − 5 rad / s frequency because this is the worst case and will help to
    develop a more robust design. Fig. 2. Nichols plot showing system or “plant” template.
    The template is small for this example so it is magnified to show the template
    shape. Table 1. Magnitude and Phase Angles That Were Generated Using a Crossover

    20.55 −90.752° Once the template is constructed, it can be moved to the 3 dB contour.
    This template is then slid around the 3 dB contour (Houpis and Rasmussen 1999)
    on a Nichols chart (Fig. 3). The template has been duplicated at several positions
    around the 3-dB contour to illustrate how the template is slid around the contour.
    The template is also smaller in Fig. 3 because the scale of the chart has changed.
    The 3-dB contour is used because Horowitz (1993) has determined that if the system
    model plus the feedback controller can operate outside this contour, the system
    will be stable. The template must have the same vertical and horizontal orientations
    as it is moved all the way around the 3-dB contour (Fig. 3). As the template is
    slid around the 3-dB contour, a point of the template boundary should always touch
    the 3-dB contour, but the template cannot cross the contour. The contour is drawn
    by placing a pen in the corner of the template and tracing a boundary line. The
    corner in this design corresponds to a value of 1,300 s for T and 9 , 290 m 2
    for A or the corresponding 20.55 dB and −90.752°. This point is at the lower left
    corner of the template. This corner is selected for convenience and ease of plotting,
    but any other corner could be selected provided the template does not cross the
    3 dB boundary. By using the template in this manner, the variability of system
    parameters is taken into account in the resulting boundary. This boundary is called
    the “U-contour.” The right side of the U contour follows the 3-dB contour because
    the point of the pen and the corner of the template touch the contour. As the
    template is slid around the 3-dB contour, the template boundary forces the pen
    away from the 3-db contour on the bottom and to the left of the diagram. The U
    contour that is constructed with this template accounts for the variability in
    crossover frequency and the variability in A and T . If these parameters were
    exactly known, the U contour would be traced on the 3 dB contour. It should be
    noted that in most QFT designs, the U contour is shaped like the letter U. However,
    in this design, the shape is more oval in shape. Fig. 3. Nichols plot showing
    the U contour drawn using the system template. The template is drawn in multiple
    points around the 3-dB contour to demonstrate how it is slide around the contour
    without crossing the contour. Once the contour has been traced, the uncompensated
    system response is plotted on the Nichols chart (Fig. 4). Uncompensated means
    that there is no feedback controller that is trying to influence or change the
    system response. This plot is determined by entering multiple frequencies into
    to the model and measuring the change in phase and magnitude outputs from the
    model. These values are generated using Eqs. (5) - (8) for each frequency input.
    As the values are determined, they are plotted on the Nichols chart. The plot
    of the uncompensated model shows that it must be pulled closer to the U-contour.
    If plot of the model response can be pulled closer to the contour, it means that
    the model will respond faster to control changes. This is accomplished by adding
    an “ s ” term to the denominator of the system compensator (adding lag). This
    pulls the system to the left and closer to the U contour. The 75-dB point is selected
    as an appropriate place to start. This point is selected because it provides ample
    opportunity to pull the system response plot to the left and closer to the contour.
    The 75-dB point has a corresponding frequency of 2 × 10 − 8 rad / s . This frequency
    is determined by locating the 75-dB point on the Bode plot in Fig. 1 and finding
    the corresponding frequency for that point. The inverse of this frequency is determined
    to be 5 × 10 7 . This value is placed in the denominator (adding lag) of the controller/compensator
    equation G ( s ) = 1 5 × 10 7 s + 1 (9) The result is plotted as the dashed line
    (canal model with lag) in Fig. 4. This plot shows that the additional lag is forcing
    the system through the U contour. The goal of this design is to force the canal
    model close to the U contour without crossing the contour boundaries. As the design
    progresses, the canal model plus the compensator response will be forced around
    the right side of the U contour. The Nichols chart shows that the U contour reaches
    a maximum point on the right side of about −135°. The plot of the system response
    should be forced to the right to about −135° to obtain a good design. Fig. 4.
    Nichols chart showing the U contour and the system response with various compensator
    design stages If an s term is added to the numerator (adding lead) of the compensator,
    the system is pulled to the right. By studying the plot of the canal model with
    lag in Fig. 4, it was determined that the system response curve can be pulled
    to the right if lead is added in the −100- to −105-dB range. This range is used
    because this is where the plot of the system response curve bends more drastically
    to the left. In order to continue with this design, the −102-dB point is selected.
    The Bode plot of the canal model with lag in Fig. 5 indicates that a frequency
    of 5.4 × 10 − 4 rad / s corresponds to the −102-dB value. The resulting compensator
    equation is G ( s ) = 1 , 852 s + 1 5 × 10 7 s + 1 (10) The canal model plus the
    lead and lag compensator response is plotted as a dotted line in Fig. 4. The plot
    shows that it is not far enough to the right because the bend in the curve does
    not reach to the −135° point. Additional lead needs to be added to the compensator.
    The bend in the plot of the canal model with lead and lag in Fig. 4 is the best
    region to determine a value for additional lead. This region starts at about −110
    dB and ends at about −125 dB. Selecting a frequency for the −110-dB point would
    pull the system response to the right, but it would be pulled too far to the right.
    The −115-dB value is selected with a corresponding frequency of 7.0 × 10 − 4 rad
    / s . This frequency is again determined by creating a Bode plot of the canal
    model with the lead and lag compensator and finding the frequency that corresponds
    to the −115-dB point. This plot has been omitted because it is similar to Fig.
    5 and the procedure is the same for all Bode plots. Lead is added to the compensator
    and the resulting equation is G ( s ) = 2.65 × 10 6 s 2 + 3 , 281 s + 1 5 × 10
    7 s + 1 (11) The result is the plot of the dot-dashed line (additional lead added
    to the model and compensator). A gain must be added to the canal model and compensator
    to push the response up to the U contour. This is accomplished by adding a gain
    of 900,000 to the compensator. The value was determined by measuring the difference
    in dB between the bottom of the U contour and the horizontal portion of the plot
    of the compensator with additional lead line in Fig. 4. This difference was determined
    to be 119 dB. If Eq. (6) is solved backward, the following value is determined:
    gain = 10 119 / 20 ≈ 900 , 000 (12) Fig. 6 shows the plot of the system response
    with the compensator. More “zeros” and “poles” could be added to push the response
    closer to the U contour, but this paper focuses on the design process, which has
    been sufficiently demonstrated at this point. Presently, the compensator has an
    excess of “zeros” over “poles” and a system instability may exist. This is corrected
    by added lag at a frequency of 1.0 × 10 − 2 rad / s . This balances the poles
    and the zeros and helps make the compensator more stable. The addition of this
    pole has a small effect on the system and the resulting plot follows the same
    line as the previous compensator. Fig. 5. Bode plot for the canal model and the
    initial compensator of G ( s ) = 1 / ( 5 × 10 7 s + 1 ) . A frequency of 5.4 ×
    10 − 4 rads / s is read from the magnitude plot at about −102 dB. Fig. 6. Nichols
    plot showing the system response with the compensator in relationship to the U
    contour The resulting compensator in Laplace form is presented below: G ( s )
    = 2.38 × 10 12 s 2 + 2.95 × 10 9 s + 9.0 × 10 5 5 × 10 9 s 2 + 5 × 10 7 s + 1
    (13) The system model and compensator cross the U-contour, but this line is still
    close to the outside of the contour. In some cases, there may be a concern with
    this type of design, but test results below indicate that the compensator accomplishes
    the desired response. The Laplace form of this equation is hard to implement in
    a feedback control computer program. The equation must be converted to a digital
    form. If a control interval of 1 min is used, the compensator equation takes the
    following form: Δ q k = 1.549 Δ q k − 1 − 0.5488 Δ q k − 2 + 47.17 e k − 91.68
    e k − 1 + 44.56 e k − 2 (14) where Δ q k represents the flow rate change; Δ q
    k − 1 represents the last flow rate change; Δ q k − 2 represents the flow rate
    change prior to the last flow rate change; e k = difference between the water
    level set point and the present water level; e k − 1 is the last error that was
    measured between the set point and the water level; and e k − 2 = error that was
    measured prior to the last error. The method that is used to convert the Laplace
    compensator equation to the digital compensator equation can be found in Dorf
    (1992). The above equation is in the form that could be implemented in a computer
    control unit that is located at the canal gate control site. The equation indicates
    that the last two gate flow rate changes and the last two errors would have to
    be remembered in order to compute the required flow change. As indicated earlier,
    the control interval was 1 min, however, a control engineer may select an interval
    of 5 or 10 min. If this were true, the gains that are indicated in Eq. (13) would
    change. The controller/compensator has been designed considering the variations
    of the canal parameters. If all variations in system parameters are accounted
    for in the original template, the resulting controller will be stable. This is
    true even if the system parameters change, provided that the variations were accounted
    for in the original template. Results The previously designed QFT controller was
    tested on a nonlinear model (Stringam 1998) with the dimensions defined by Reddy
    (1990). Considering that the goal of designing a compensator is to control a canal,
    a nonlinear model that solves the St. Venant equations would give a more realistic
    response. A PID controller was also designed to control this nonlinear model using
    the Ziegler-Nichols tuning method (Stephanopoulos 1984). The PID controller is
    used for comparison because there are differential, integral, and proportional
    components contained within the QFT compensator design. The results from these
    two controllers were compared to one of the tests for the LQR controller reported
    by Reddy (1990) where an additional flow rate of 0.25 m 3 / s is taken at the
    downstream end of the reach. This would tend to bias the results toward the LQR
    controller because it was tested on a linear model. The results of all three controllers
    can be observed in Fig. 7. This graph shows the resulting downstream depths when
    the outflow is increased. Fig. 7. Plot of the downstream depth for the QFT, PID,
    and LQR controllers. A flow rate of 0.25 m 3 / s is taken at the downstream end
    of the reach. The graph of the response of all three methods indicates that the
    PID method and the QFT method have similar responses. It may be difficult to argue
    that one method is better than the other, except that the QFT method has less
    overshoot and settles into the set point sooner. Fig. 7 indicates that the LQR
    controller does not bring the system back to the set point as quickly as the PID
    and QFT methods. In addition, after the system reaches its minimum, the LQR controller
    has a slower initial rate of recovery than the other two controllers. A final
    test was conducted by changing the channel roughness from 0.016 to 0.019. All
    the other parameters, which were previously defined, were kept the same. The demand
    at the downstream end of the reach was increased an additional 0.25 m 3 / s .
    Fig. 8 shows that the PID controller had more of an oscillatory response than
    the QFT controller. Though the QFT method had more overshoot than the previous
    test, it was less than the PID method. The QFT controller again settled into the
    set point sooner. Fig. 8. Plot of the downstream depth for the QFT and PID controllers.
    An additional flow rate of 0.25 m 3 / s is taken at the downstream end of the
    reach. The canal roughness has been increased to 0.019. Conclusions It could be
    argued that there is little advantage of a QFT controller over a PID controller.
    The results of this paper indicate that both methods have similar responses. However,
    there are several factors that should be considered before drawing this conclusion.
    First, the PID controller equation has an excess of s terms in the numerator.
    This means that there is the possibility of instability in the control system.
    Experienced control engineers and technicians will often say that they have had
    instances where seemingly stable PID controllers suddenly became unstable and
    the controller had to be shut down before there were disastrous results (Phillips
    and Harbor 1991). An additional concern is the fact that PID controllers have
    narrower operational ranges than QFT controllers. This can be corrected with gain
    scheduling (Stephanopoulos 1984), but this makes the controller code more complicated
    than QFT controller code. As mentioned previously, canals are operated at different
    levels, weeds grow in the canal, silt collects, and seepage changes throughout
    the irrigation season. A QFT controller can be designed with a wider operation
    range to account for these changes. This wider range was demonstrated in Fig.
    8. When the results from the PID and QFT controller were compared to the LQR controller,
    they performed better than the LQR method. In this case, the LQR controller had
    a slower response than the PID and QFT controllers. The final and most important
    reason for considering QFT is that it can be applied to global control systems.
    A controller for a canal system seldom functions well if it is made up of several
    local controllers. On the other hand, a global controller will minimize the interference
    that the different reaches have on each other and arrive at the control solution
    that will best operate the entire system. A global QFT controller will be reported
    in a subsequent paper. References Balogun, O. S., Hubbard, M., and DeVries, J.

  description: Automated control systems in irrigation have in recent years made considerable
    progress, offering a wide range of new options. In this experiment, a closed loop
    control system based on the relationship of electrical resistance and soil moisture
    was used to test the performence of the automated drip irrigation system for pepper
    (Capsicum annuum L.) growth. A main strategy for irrigation was determined before
    irrigation events and the pot (100kω) in the circuit was adjusted to the strategy
    determined before, thereafter a signal was produced by the electrodes embedded
    in the substrate whenever soil moisture reached to the threshold level. Therefore,
    the system took over irrigation events, started and stopped the irrigations throughout
    the entire growing season. The irrigation times and amounts of irrigation water
    applied by the system was not suitable for uniform crop production, because irrigation
    throuhout the whole growing season was commenced as almost 55% of the available
    soil moisture was depleted from field capacity (FC).

    Introduction Common variations in soil properties and soil water availability
    over large fields are appropriate for site-specific irrigation management. Development
    of automated site-specific sprinkler irrigation systems allow producers to maximize
    irrigation efficiency, simultaneously minimizing negative effects on their productivity.
    A distributed in-field wireless sensor network (WSN) and a variable-rate irrigation
    controller offer a potential means to support automated closed-loop irrigation
    control, but the seamless integration of the WSN and irrigation controller can
    be challenging. The spatial variability of soils and other characteristics in
    agricultural fields has been addressed in the precision agriculture literature
    (Irmak et al. 2002; Ahmad et al. 1999). However, optimizing configurations for
    site-specific management in each field remains a difficult task. Apparent soil
    electrical conductivity (EC) mapping has been widely used as one way to characterize
    soil variability of agricultural fields (Farahani and Buchleiter 2004; Drummond
    et al. 2000; Jabro et al. 2006). In-field wireless sensing systems and variable-rate
    irrigation systems have also been studied by many researchers (Shock et al. 1999;
    King et al. 2000; Marinda et al. 2003; Wall and King 2004; Perry et al. 2004;
    Kim et al. 2006a). However, few have fully integrated these systems into closed-loop
    wireless irrigation control and monitoring systems. A wireless irrigation control
    system was developed and evaluated for real-time variable-rate irrigation control
    and monitoring (Kim et al. 2006a), and a distributed WSN was designed for in-field
    wireless sensing of soil water conditions (Kim et al. 2007b). The objective of
    this paper is to evaluate the integration of the irrigation control system with
    the in-field WSN for automated closed-loop variable-rate sprinkler irrigation.
    This research is part of a project that was established in early 2004 to develop
    integrated wireless networks of in-field sensing and irrigation control systems
    for real-time irrigation decision support by USDA-ARS, Northern Plains Agricultural
    Research Laboratory near Sidney, Mont. Materials and Methods Site-Specific Field
    Configuration Mapping of soil EC was used to provide a measure of the spatial
    variation of an experimental field so that a minimum number of in-field sensor
    systems could be placed with maximum impact for characterizing the scope of field
    information. The soil EC was used primarily as an indicator of water holding capacity
    as well as soil salinity. The distribution of the in-field sensing stations was
    determined from analysis of these maps (Kim et al. 2005). The apparent soil EC
    was mapped by a soil EC mapping system (3100, Veris Technologies, Salina, Kan.)
    at approximately 2.8 m ∕ s travel speed (a sample per second) using a 2.4 - m
    parallel swathing monitored with geo-referenced points using a differential GPS
    (Ag132, Trimble, Sunnyvale, Calif. with Omnistar correction) on an experimental
    field [Fig. 1(a)]. Geostatistical analysis was performed using geographic information
    system software (ArcGIS ver. 9.1, ESRI, Redlands, Calif.) with a Kriging model
    to interpolate data and create spatial maps with five classifications by a quantile
    method. Fig. 1(b) shows a WSN topology based on soil EC variations from 38.2 to
    128 mS ∕ m with five different zones. One sensing station was placed in each zone,
    and the five station numbers were labeled the same way as soil zone numbers in
    descending order of EC values. The map was converted into a mosaic map [Fig. 1(c)]
    by switching filled-contour to 6 × 15 grid using software (ArcGIS ver. 9.1, ESRI,
    Redlands, Calif.) to match the layout of the irrigation sprinkler banks which
    had total 15 groups of nozzle banks on five spans spaced 15 m ∕ bank and 3 banks/span.
    Four plot strips at the third, fourth, sixth, and ninth rows were used for the
    variable-rate irrigation. The rest of rows were treated as conventional irrigation
    with 100% water application. The 4th row in shade contained all five different
    soil zones and was used for a field test using catch cans. Fig. 1. Site-specific
    field configuration: (a) Veris soil electrical conductivity (EC) mapping system;
    (b) WSN topology of five classified zones based on soil EC map; and (c) mosaic
    map with 6 columns and 15 rows to match the irrigation sprinkler layout, where
    four rows were used for variable-rate irrigation and a shaded area at the fourth
    row was used for a field test using catch cans Wireless Sensor Network A distributed
    WSN was developed for real-time in-field soil sensing. The network consisted of
    five sensing stations and a weather station. Each of the sensing stations contained
    a data logger (CR10, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah), two soil water reflectometers
    (CS616, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah), horizontally one at the 30 cm
    and the other at the 61 - cm soil depth, and a soil temperature sensor (107, Campbell
    Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah) at the 15 - cm soil depth. The weather station measured
    precipitation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, wind direction,
    and solar radiation. Sensors at the in-field sensing and weather stations were
    scanned every 10 s , and averaged data were stored and wirelessly transmitted
    every 15 min via a Bluetooth radio transmitter (SD202, Initium Co., Korea) back
    to a base computer. All components at each station are self-powered by a 12 -
    V battery recharged by a solar panel (SX5, Solarex, Sacramento, Calif.). The design
    for power management and wireless communication for the WSN was detailed by Kim
    et al. (2007b). Wireless Variable-Rate Irrigation A self-propelled Valley (Valmont
    Industries, Inc., Valley, Neb.) linear sprinkler irrigation system was used. Site-specific
    operation was controlled by a programmable logic controller (PLC) (S7-226, Siemens
    AG, Germany) located on the cart. The PLC managed the activation of electric over
    pneumatic solenoids to control 30 banks of 5–10 sprinklers each. Variable-rate
    applications were implemented by controlling the on/off times for groups of spray
    nozzles based on information from the site-specific field monitoring obtained
    by the WSN. As the linear sprinkler system moved across the field, a low-cost
    WAAS-enabled global positioning system (GPS) receiver (17-HVS, Garmin International
    Inc., Olathe, Kan.) mounted on the top of the linear cart continuously updated
    the position of the sprinkler nozzles. The GPS receiver was tied directly to the
    PLC controller, and a radio signal of the GPS position was continuously transmitted
    to the computer in a base station over the wireless link. The irrigation application
    depths were adjusted by pulsing sprinkler heads on and off to achieve a target
    depth based on a digital map of depths for each nozzle location as the machine
    moved down the field. Signal interface and software design for the PLC were detailed
    by Kim et al. (2006b). Two types of sprinkler heads were used: midelevation spray
    application (MESA) and low energy precision application (LEPA) (Evans and Iversen
    2005). MESA sprinkler heads were a spinning sprinkler (S3000, Nelson Irrigation
    Corp., Walla Walla, Wash.) with 103 kPa ( 15 psi ) regulators and wetted diameters
    ranging from 6 to 10 m and spaced every 32 m at about 1 m above the ground, where
    as LEPA heads were a bubble spray (Quad-Spray, Senninger Irrigation Corp., Clermont,
    Fla.) with 69 kPa ( 10 psi ) regulators and spaced every 1.2 m along submanifolds
    suspended from the truss rods at about 15 cm above the furrow surface. Nominal
    operating pressure of the pump was about 248 kPa ( 36 psi ). When LEPA sprinklers
    are turned off, the LEPA heads are pulled up by a pneumatic cylinder that is activated
    by the solenoid. Closed-Loop Irrigation Control A closed-loop irrigation control
    system was developed by integrating in-field sensor stations with the irrigation
    control station through a base computer station. Prior to inclusion in the closed-loop
    irrigation control system, each system component was independently tested and
    validated over the entire 2006 growing season. The base station wirelessly communicated
    with both the in-field sensing stations and the irrigation control station in
    real-time mode. It continuously received in-field sensory data to monitor soil
    water conditions. A decision support aid was developed on the base computer that
    determined when to irrigate and how much to apply to each of five classified zones.
    The base station was located about 700 m away from the field. A patch radio antenna
    was mounted on the east side of the rooftop and connected to a Bluetooth radio
    receiver (MSP-102a, Initium Co., Sungnam, Korea) inside the rooftop. The receiver
    was a multi-serial Bluetooth server and wired to a host computer via TCP/IP ethernet.
    A graphical user interface (GUI)-based irrigation software was developed and used
    for closed-loop irrigation control by integrating all input and output components
    of the system. The software allows real-time wireless communication with the PLC
    on the irrigation cart to receive GPS locations of the cart and send control signals
    for all sprinkler nozzle banks every second either automatically or manually after
    processing data for decision making. The software also allows a user to read an
    irrigation map at the beginning of the irrigation operation and save actual amount
    of water applied at each plot with GPS-referenced time and locations during the
    operation (Kim et al. 2007a). Sensor Calibrations The water content reflectometer
    was used to monitor soil water status. The reflectometer measures the volumetric
    water contents by using a time-domain reflectometry (TDR) method based on the
    dielectric constant of the soil (CS616, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, Utah).
    Two probe rods act as wave guides, and the dielectric constant of the soil surrounding
    the rods varies with the amount of water in the soil. The quality of soil moisture
    measurements is also affected by several other factors, such as soil electrical
    conductivity, clay content, and soil compaction, and thus the calibration has
    to be modified locally (Campbell Scientific Inc. 2004). The TDR sensors were calibrated
    with a neutron probe (N-probe) (503D Hydroprobe Moisture Gauge, CPN International,
    Inc., Martinez, Calif.) that measures soil water status (factory calibration)
    at six different soil depths (23, 46, 61,76, 91, and 107 cm ). Both TDR sensors
    and N-probe tubes were installed approximately 50 cm apart and monitored at five
    different locations on the soil EC field map (Fig. 1) during the 2006 growing
    season. A malting-barley (cv. Legacy) crop was planted on April 14 with 67 - kg
    ∕ ha nitrogen (N), 50 - kg ∕ ha phosphorus ( P 2 O 5 ) and 11 - kg ∕ ha potassium
    ( K 2 O ) , and harvested on August 3. The field soil is a Savage silty clay loam
    (fine, smectitic, frigid Vertic Argiustolls) with 17% wilting point, 35% field
    water capacity, and 1.34 - g ∕ cm 3 bulk density. Measurements of the N-probe
    were conducted seven times (June 1, June 7, June 19, June 30, July 5, July 13,
    and July 18). Volumetric water contents of the TDR sensor were compared to the
    N-probe (factory calibration) at the 23 - cm (Table 1) 60 - cm soil depths. The
    TDRs were read every 15 min. , whereas the N-probe readings were measured about
    once a week. Data comparisons were made with the TDR readings measured at the
    same times as the N-probe readings. Table 1. Volumetric Water Content of the Time-Domain

    Fig. 2 illustrates volumetric water contents of both sensors at two soil depths
    at Station 1 under malting-barley and indicates a linear regression equation and
    correlation of the TDR and N probe. Linear regression analysis was repeated for
    the other four stations to derive calibration equations. Fig. 2. TDR sensor readings
    compared to the neutron probe readings at two soil depths at Station 1 in 2006.
    Sensors at other four stations repeat the regression analysis. Decision Making
    Irrigation decisions were made based on the closed-loop feedback of soil water
    status with depth from the TDR sensors at all five sensor stations. The calibrated
    TDR response to water supply of rain ( 9.93 cm ) and irrigation ( 6.63 cm ) is
    illustrated in Fig. 3 during the entire growing season of 2006 (May 1–July 27)
    on the malting-barley crop. Each TDR sensor showed a different response range
    from dry to wet soil conditions. For instance, the TDR sensor in 30 cm at Station
    1 has a response range of about 10% (varying from 27 to 37%), whereas the sensor
    in 61 cm has a response range of about 6% (varying from 29 to 35%), as shown in
    Fig. 3. High peaks on June 10 and June 27 were not included in the response range,
    because their readings were outliers caused by excessive amounts of water. Response
    ranges of sensors at the other four stations varied from a minimum of 3% to a
    maximum of 10%. The difference of the sensor’s response range was caused by different
    levels of soil EC, clay, compaction, and imperfect installation. The response
    range of each sensor was assumed to remain from 2006 to 2007 experiment, because
    each sensor was used in the same soil depth at the same soil EC zone over two
    years. A slight response offset is expected, however, if the sensor is reinstalled
    into a different spot even in the same depth and at the same soil EC zone. Fig.
    3. Volumetric water contents of the calibrated TDR sensors in two soil depths
    at Station 1 during the entire growing season of 2006 (May 1–July 27) on malting-barley
    crop The response range of each sensor was monitored during the 2007 experiment
    and adjusted with an offset observed from 2006 data. Fig. 4 illustrates the TDR
    response to water supply of rain ( 9.80 cm ) and irrigation ( 1.37 cm ) for early
    growing season of 2007 (May 1–27). Irrigation on May 18 was applied on all five
    stations at the same rate of 1.37 cm water. The TDR response ranges in 30 and
    61 cm show 4% (varying from 39 to 43%) and 7% (varying from 42 to 49%), respectively.
    As rain amount received for the month of May in 2007 was close to the total rain
    amount of the entire growing season of 2006, field soils were assumed to reach
    to the maximum wet condition, i.e., the upper limit of the response range. Thus,
    the highest reading of each TDR sensor at all five stations during May 2007 was
    selected for the upper limit of the response range and followed by the lower limit’s
    adjustment in order to keep the response range obtained in 2006, as shown in Table
    2. Fig. 4. Volumetric water contents of the calibrated TDR sensors in two soil

    The decision rule base for variable-rate irrigation was limited by a duty cycle
    of each sprinkler nozzle, i.e., on/off operations in a period of 60 s . For example,
    100% water application turns on the nozzle for a full 60 s , whereas 40% water
    application turns it on only for 24 s , turning it off for the remaining 36 s
    . The manually selected travel speed of the linear move sprinkler system determined
    the maximum application depth. The output of the percentage of nozzle operation
    was determined by the deficit of the current TDR reading from the upper limit
    value of the range of each sensor to apply a percentage of maximum. Because the
    lower limit of the range indicates the driest soil condition, the desired soil
    moisture condition is selected as above the midrange of each sensor. When the
    deficit at any of five stations first reaches its midrange, the irrigation is
    triggered to apply for 100% water application and accompanied with irrigation
    on the rest of zones proportionally applied according to the deficit of their
    sensors. If the deficit falls below the midrange, the irrigation controller sends
    a signal for 100% water, whereas no water is applied if it reaches to the maximum,
    i.e., the wettest soil condition. Experiments and Results The closed-loop irrigation
    control system was implemented and tested on an experimental field at the USDA-ARS-Northern
    Plains Agricultural Research Laboratory in Sidney, Mont. The 1.5 - ha field was
    laid out in 15 strips in the direction of travel. Each strip was planted to malting
    barley. There are a total of 90 plots with the individual plots being 15 m wide
    and 9 m long. Each strip was divided into six plots [Fig. 1(c)]. All plots were
    irrigated with MESA sprinklers and blocked for replication. Four catch cans were
    installed in the middle of each soil zone and aligned between two MESA sprinkler
    heads, spaced 3 m apart, and 0.8 m above the ground. Five sets of catch cans were
    installed across a strip that contained all five soil zones [Fig. 5(a)]. Each
    soil zone was labeled the same way as the station number and located at a plot
    numbered 5, 6, 7, 9, and 10 from front to back in Fig. 5(a). The total of 30 sprinkler
    banks were individually controlled by wireless signals transmitted from the base
    computer. Wireless radio signal stability and individual nozzle controllability
    for all 30 sprinkler banks were tested in a manual mode and visually identified
    before irrigation for catch can study. There was about 1 s . time lag in response
    of the PLC from the base computer via Bluetooth wireless communication and additional
    maximum 3 s delay in nozzle activation due to hydraulic power transition. The
    amount of variable-rate irrigation was applied by the percentage of full irrigation
    based on the ratio of the real-time update of TDR volumetric water content to
    its half range ( = max –midpoint) of the sensor response at each soil zone (Table
    3). For instance, 52% of full ( 1 - cm ) irrigation in Zone 2 was calculated by
    subtracting a current TDR reading (44.4%) from the max point (47%) of the response
    range, then divided by its half response range ( 5 % = 47 - 42 % ) in Table 2.
    The experiment was to evaluate how the irrigation sprinklers perform sensor-based
    real-time wireless control throughout the irrigation operation. Fig. 5. Catch
    cans installed across a strip that contained all five soil zones and aligned between
    two MESA sprinkler heads. (a) Four cans were installed at each zone with 3 m apart
    and 0.8 m high. Each soil zone was located at a plot numbered 5, 6, 7, 9, and
    10 from front to back. (b) Catch can 4 was misplaced and affected by a neighboring
    sprinkler. Table 3. Variable-Rate Irrigation Amount Determined by the Feedback

    0.91 0.00 Catch cans data were collected on June 6, 2007. Catch cans at each soil
    zone were aligned from north to south and numbered from 1 to 4, respectively.
    Weather data were recorded at the weather station mounted on the downstream end
    of the lateral. The linear cart moved from plot 5 to plot 10 at less than 1 m
    ∕ min speed for 1 - cm irrigation at average wind speed range of 2.7 – 7.1 km
    ∕ h and average wind direction of 187° (from south). South-neighboring sprinklers
    that were treated as conventional 100% water applications affected water distribution
    by wind drift and resulted in more water in south-side cans than north-side cans
    at all five zones, because the south-neighboring sprinklers (Fig. 1). Especially,
    Catch Can 4 was directly affected by the adjacent sprinkler, as shown in Fig.
    5(b). Thus, data from Catch Can 4 were not included in further calculations. Fig.
    6 shows catch can readings compared to irrigation amount after taking data at
    Catch Can 4. Catch can data were correlated to the amount of variable-rate irrigation
    with 0.96 r 2 value, though catch cans collected average 0.23 cm of more water
    out of 1 - cm irrigation, caused by the wind drift effect. Fig. 6. Catch can readings
    compared to irrigation amount at wind speed of 10 – 15 km ∕ h on June 6, 2007
    when the linear irrigation cart moved from Plots 5–10 Signal multipath of the
    GPS was observed five times when a GPS signal error occurred during the entire
    operation of 82 min from 9:46 to 11:08 a.m. Three errors were caused by signal
    bouncing at a plot boundary: once between Plots 5 and 6, and twice between Plots
    7 and 8. Two errors were signal loss or bouncing out of experimental plots. Each
    occurrence was a single signal bouncing and took only a second to return to a
    correct GPS position. As signal strength of the GPS is affected by atmosphere
    and cloud, this is not unusual. This 1 - s signal change is inactivated in 3 -
    s hydraulic delay and does not affect the irrigation rate. Conclusions An automated
    closed-loop irrigation control system was developed and tested with a self-propelled
    lateral-move sprinkler irrigation system that was set up for site-specific variable-rate
    water applications. Real-time wireless communications were seamlessly interfaced
    between in-field sensing stations, a variable-rate irrigation control station,
    and the base station by using Bluetooth radio technology. An experimental field
    was mapped and configured into five separate control zones based on soil electrical
    conductivity for the distribution of the wireless sensor network. Soil water sensors
    were individually calibrated within each zone with a neutron probe for 30- and
    61 - cm soil depths. Variable-rate irrigation was determined by feedback of soil
    water status from sensor stations. User-friendly software was developed to interface
    the base station with a PLC irrigation controller and wireless in-field sensor
    network for GUI-based real-time irrigation control and monitoring. The software
    tracks GPS locations of the irrigation cart and sends individual control signals
    to the 30 sets of sprinkler nozzle banks every second either automatically or
    manually on request. The irrigation sprinklers successfully followed real-time
    wireless control signals throughout the irrigation operation without interruptions
    in wireless radio communication. Catch can data were highly correlated to the
    water amount applied with r 2 = 0.96 . The benefit of the closed-loop control
    for a site-specific irrigation system with wireless sensor network will extend
    to automation of agrochemical applications. Although While this technology was
    developed on a linear move irrigation system, it was designed to also work with
    center pivots. The next step is to extend this technology to a grower’s field
    for their evaluation and testing. References Ahmad, I. S., Reid, J. F., Noguchi,

  description: Automated site-specific sprinkler irrigation system can save water
    and maximize productivity, but implementing automated irrigation is challenging
    in system integration and decision making. A controllable irrigation system was
    integrated into a closed-loop control with a distributed wireless in-field sensor
    network for automated variable-rate irrigation. An experimental field was configured
    into five soil zones based on soil electrical conductivity. Micrometeorological
    sensors were installed on each zone of the distributed wireless sensor network
    and remotely monitored by a base station for decision making. Soil water sensors
    were calibrated with a neutron probe and individually identified for their response
    ranges at each zone. Irrigation decisions were site-specifically made based on
    feedback of soil water conditions from distributed in-field sensor stations. Variable-rate
    water application was remotely controlled by the base station to actuate solenoids
    to regulate the amount of time an individual group of sprinkler nozzles was irrigating
    in a 60-sec time period. The performance of the system was evaluated with the
    measurement of water usage and soil water status throughout the growing season.

    Introduction In the companion paper (Wahlin and Clemmens 2006), a state-space
    methodology was presented by which two existing automatic control algorithms can
    be modified to control a branching canal network instead of a single, in-line
    canal. Two types of controllers were used for this study: (1) linear quadratic
    regulator (LQR) and (2) model predictive control (MPC). The integrator-delay (ID)
    model was used as the underlying process model for the controllers. The conversion
    from a single in-line canal to a branching network was accomplished by modifying
    the state transition relationships, as reflected in the state-transition matrix.
    The same state-transition relationships were used for both control methods. The
    rest of the controller design procedure, for either method, did not change from
    that for a single, in-line canal. The LQR methodology is fully described by Clemmens
    and Schuurmans (2004), who refer to this implementation as a fully centralized
    proportional-integral (PI) controller. The MPC methodology is described by Wahlin
    (2004). In the companion paper (Wahlin and Clemmens 2006), the approach for controlling
    branching canal networks was demonstrated with a simple example. In this paper,
    these two control methods were applied to a large portion of the canal system
    operated by the Salt River Project (SRP), including two branch points. Because
    of the long delay times in this large system, feedback alone was not sufficient
    for effective control. Thus feedforward routing of known demand changes was necessary
    for these two control methods to effectively control the overall branching canal
    network. Background The SRP is actually two organizations: (1) the Salt River
    Project Agricultural Improvement and Power District (SRPAIPD, or the District,
    for short), a political subdivision of the state of Arizona, and (2) the Salt
    River Valley Water Users’ Association (SRVWUA, or the Association, for short),
    a private corporation (SRP 2002). The District provides electricity to retail
    customers in the Phoenix area [approximately 7,500 km 2 (2,900 mi 2 )] and operates
    or participates in seven major power plants and numerous other generating stations
    (SRP 2002). The Association delivers nearly 1.2 billion m 3 (1 million acre-ft)
    of water to a service area of about 970 km 2 (240,000 acres) in central Arizona
    (SRP 2002). The water delivery area for the Association is approximately 16% agricultural
    and 84% urban (SRP 2002), and is rapidly urbanizing. The Association also maintains
    and operates an extensive water delivery system, which includes dams, reservoirs,
    diversion structures, wells, canals, and laterals. Dams and Diversion Structures
    In addition to the canal system, this study is only concerned with that portion
    of the Salt River that runs from the Stewart Mountain Dam to the Granite Reef
    Diversion Structure. Stewart Mountain Dam is the last of the major dams on the
    Salt River (SRP 2002). The dam was constructed between 1928 and 1930, and modified
    in 1992. Stewart Mountain Dam is 63 m (208 ft) high and forms Saguaro Lake, which
    has a capacity of about 86 million m 3 (70,000 acre-ft) (see Fig. 1). Fig. 1.
    SRP canal system (Salt River Project 2002, with permission) Granite Reef Diversion
    Structure was built to divert the water in the Salt River into the canal system
    of the Association. Granite Reef Diversion Structure is located about 4.8 km (3
    mi) downstream from the confluence of the Verde and Salt Rivers. It was constructed
    between 1906 and 1908. Granite Reef is a diversion structure only; it was not
    designed to store water. Granite Reef Diversion Structure is 8.8 m (29 ft) tall
    and consists of a 300-m-long (1,000 ft) ogee-shaped crest. Canal System Water
    is released from the Stewart Mountain Dam and flows through the Salt River to
    Granite Reef Diversion Structure. At this point, the water is diverted into the
    Association’s canal system, which consists of about 2,100 km (1,300 mi) of canals,
    laterals, and ditches (see Fig. 1). The main canals include the Arizona Canal,
    the Crosscut Canal, the Grand Canal, the South Canal, the Eastern Canal, the Consolidated
    Canal, the Tempe Canal, and the Western Canal. The Association maintains and operates
    the canal system. This paper deals only with the Arizona Canal, the Grand Canal,
    the Crosscut Canal, and the South Canal. Water behind the Granite Reef Diversion
    Structure is diverted into the Arizona Canal to distribute water on the north
    side of the Salt River. The Grand Canal is the oldest remaining canal on the north
    side of the Salt River, built between 1877 and 1878. In 1889, the Arizona Improvement
    Company created the Crosscut Canal and Power Company to construct a canal connecting
    the Arizona Canal with the Grand Canal. This canal unified the north side canal
    system. In 1912, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (USBR) built a new Crosscut Canal
    with a small hydroelectric power plant placed at the 35-m (116-ft) drop in the
    canal. For simplification, the Grand and Crosscut Canals are referred to as the
    Grand Canal in this paper. The South Canal was built by the USBR between 1906
    and 1908. Just like the Arizona Canal, the head works of the South Canal are located
    at the Granite Reef Diversion Structure. The purpose of the South Canal is to
    connect the Tempe and Consolidated Canals to the Granite Reef Diversion Structure.
    Problem Definition To demonstrate that the methodology developed for branching
    canal networks can effectively control the SRP canal system, a large portion of
    the SRP canal system was numerically modeled and the controllability was tested
    through hydraulic simulations using the procedures outlined in Wahlin and Clemmens
    (2006). The portion of the canal system that was modeled and automatically controlled
    includes the Arizona Canal, the Grand Canal (Grand and Crosscut), and the South
    Canal. In addition, the model and automatic control system extends up the Salt
    River to Stewart Mountain Dam. As with Wahlin and Clemmens (2006), all of the
    simulations were performed with the hydrodynamic model SOBEK (Delft Hydraulics
    2000). These numerical simulations are a good start for the Association to develop
    an automatic control system for its entire branching canal system. Actual System
    Salt River The Salt River runs for 22 km (13.7 mi) after Stewart Mountain Dam
    until it reaches the Granite Reef Diversion Structure (see Fig. 1). After the
    Granite Reef Diversion Structure, the Salt River becomes a dry riverbed that flows
    only during flood periods. The Salt River has variable cross-sectional areas and
    variable slopes throughout its length from Stewart Mountain to Granite Reef. Visser
    (1998) developed a reasonable approximation of the river so that it could be modeled
    in SOBEK and its response characteristics could be determined. Canal System Geometric
    Characteristics The geometric and hydrodynamic characteristics of the Association’s
    canal system are well defined. For each pool, SRP has very detailed HEC-RAS files
    (HEC 2002), which include roughness estimates, cross-sectional geometries, and
    bridge and culvert locations. The Arizona Canal consists of 15 pools. The first
    five pools of the Arizona Canal are referred to as the Upper Arizona Canal, while
    the remaining pools are referred to as the Lower Arizona Canal. The Grand Canal,
    which includes the Crosscut Canal, is composed of 15 pools, only 14 of which were
    included in this study. Finally, the South Canal, which is a small connector canal
    between Granite Reef Diversion Structure and the Tempe and Consolidated Canals,
    consists of only two pools. Check Structures At the end of each pool is a check
    structure. These check structures typically consist of a number of radial gates
    and overflow weirs. The Association does not use standard methods to calculate
    the flow through a radial gate. Instead, they use a special relationship that
    was developed by SRP personnel [see Clemmens et al. (1997) for more details].
    SRP gives each check structure an address to let operators know where the check
    structure is located. For example, the address for the check structure at the
    end of the second pool on the Arizona Canal is 1-01.9. The first number (1) means
    the pool is on the Arizona Canal. A Number 2 refers to the Grand Canal and a Number
    3 to the South Canal. The second number of the address (the one after the dash)
    is the relative location of the pool along the canal, but does not necessarily
    correspond to the distance along the canal. The last number indicates the closest
    lateral or turnout to the check structure. Thus the check structure for the second
    pool on the Arizona Canal is located near Lateral 1.9. Water Deliveries Water
    is delivered to customers primarily through gravity-based offtakes. There may
    be many different offtakes along the canal. Operators adjust the check gates to
    maintain a constant water level in the forebay. The gravity-based offtakes have
    a constant discharge if the water levels in the forebays are kept constant. Setpoints
    The Association has a setpoint for each pool, depending on the season. These setpoints,
    shown in Table 1, were determined after years of operating the canal; they were
    not determined by an optimization study. The setpoints used for this study roughly
    correspond to the setpoint used during the summer months, with some exceptions,
    explained later. Table 1. Setpoints for SRP Canal System Address Setpoint depth

    Canal; 2=Grand Canal; and 3=South Canal. Operational Objectives Brouwer (1997)
    identified three main objectives that the Association has with regard to its operation
    of the canal system. These objectives can be defined as follows: • To deliver
    water to the correct place at the right time and in the correct amount; • To have
    no operational spills; and • To maintain the water levels at their setpoints,
    with little fluctuation, so the offtake deliveries are more constant. Operational
    Procedures Canal operators at SRP use supervisory manual control to operate the
    canal system. A Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system is used
    to gather all the pertinent data (e.g., water levels, gate positions, etc.) and
    display them in the control room. The watermaster uses this information to maintain
    water levels in the pools within the “safe” zone (referred to as the green zone)
    while routing flow changes through the system. The green zone is water level deviations
    less than ± 0.076 m (0.25 ft). The red zone is represented by water level deviations
    of more than ± 0.122 m (0.4 ft), with the yellow zone in between. Most of the
    time, the watermaster wants to operate the canal in the green zone. However, there
    are situations when the watermaster will intentionally operate the canals in the
    yellow zone (e.g., to keep the water down for maintenance or construction purposes
    or to act as a temporary buffer). SRP delivers 10% more water to each customer
    in order to assure that the customers’ orders are met. Also, canal operators always
    have a little more water flowing from Granite Reef than needed. This extra water
    is called carriage water and it is used to compensate for any unexpected losses
    in the system. Zanjeros, the local term for canal operators, operate the laterals
    and the offtakes manually. They drive up and down the secondary and tertiary canals
    in the system and make the necessary changes at the offtakes to satisfy the customers’
    demands. Water schedulers collect the water order for the next day. All of these
    water orders are then given to the watermaster, who makes up the canal system’s
    water schedule for the next day. Water is then routed through the canal system
    remotely from the control room based on the water schedule. Hydrodynamic Model
    of the System To perform the desired simulations, a mathematical model of the
    Association’s canal system was built in the hydrodynamic model SOBEK. Salt River
    Visser (1998) developed a model of the Salt River, simplified to have a uniform
    trapezoidal shape with a bottom width, b , equal to 11.9 m (39 ft) and side slopes,
    z , equal to 15.3. Manning n -value was estimated to be 0.032 for the entire length
    of the Salt River between Stewart Mountain Dam and the Granite Reef Diversion
    Structure. Visser (1998) divided the Salt River into four different sections with
    bottom slopes and section lengths shown in Table 2. Table 2. Geometric Properties

    SRP has a detailed HEC-RAS model of each pool in their canal system. If all of
    the detail in the HEC-RAS models were used for all the pools in the Arizona, Grand,
    and South Canals, the resulting model of the system would be enormous, and it
    would not be feasible to make timely hydraulic computations on the system. Thus
    several simplifications were made while building SRP’s canal system in SOBEK.
    First, all of the extra structures (e.g., bridges, culverts, etc.) were removed.
    Second, the detailed geometric data in the HEC-RAS files were averaged over long
    distances. The longitudinal plot of each pool was examined and divided into sections
    based on where there was an obvious break in the grade of the pool. Typically,
    this resulted in three to five sections per pool. Then, for each of these sections,
    the HEC-RAS data were length-averaged over the section to define the average bottom
    width and side slopes. There was some concern as to whether or not the simplification
    of the cross sections would significantly impact the predicted water surface elevations.
    As shown in Fig. 2, simplifying Pool 2-04.2 did not have a significant impact
    on the water surface elevations. The water surface elevations were also not significantly
    affected for the rest of the pools under consideration. Once all the geometric
    data had been determined, they were entered into SOBEK to develop the hydrodynamic
    model. The model included the Salt River, the Arizona Canal, the Grand Canal,
    and the South Canal. Models of each individual pool were also developed because
    they were needed to determine the hydraulic properties of the pools for the ID
    model. Fig. 2. Profile plot of Pool 2-04.2 Check Structure Characteristics The
    check structures in SRP’s canal system are mostly radial gates. At this time,
    SOBEK does not have a function that allows the user to model radial gates. Even
    if it did, it would be doubtful that SOBEK would use SRP’s custom rating curves.
    For this study, this was not considered a significant problem. Both the LQR and
    MPC controllers are used in tandem with a flow controller, or slave controller.
    The flow controller’s function is to force the check gates to deliver the desired
    flow during the times between the feedback calculations, which removes the complex
    gate hydraulics from the system. Thus it does not matter if the check structures
    are modeled as radial gates, sluice gates, or overshot gates because the flow
    controller makes the necessary adjustments to assure that the flow requested by
    the feedback controller is passing through the check structure. To guarantee that
    the check structure is passing the correct flow, the flow controller inverts the
    gate equation to solve for the proper gate position. Prior studies have shown
    that the inability to accurately model check structure hydraulics has a minor
    effect on the performance of these automatic controllers (Clemmens et al. 1997;
    Clemmens and Wahlin 2004). All of the check structures were modeled as sluice
    gates in SOBEK. The width of a sluice gate in a pool was approximately equal to
    the total width of all the radial gates in that pool. SOBEK has four possible
    flow regimes for the sluice gate:(1) free orifice flow; (2) submerged orifice
    flow; (3) free weir flow; and (4) submerged weir flow. The typical flow condition
    that one thinks about for a sluice gate is what SOBEK defines as orifice flow.
    Weir flow, according to SOBEK, occurs when the water depth upstream from the gate
    is less than 1.5 times the gate opening. This is because for larger gate openings,
    the gate opening actually exceeds the depth of critical flow and the flow passes
    under the gate as weir flow, assuming no downstream backwater effects. The equations
    used in SOBEK for both free and submerged weir flow do not contain the gate opening.
    In SOBEK, changes in gate hydraulic regime occur more suddenly than in real life,
    causing numerical oscillations and potential instability. For this study, it was
    necessary to stay away from the weir flow condition because control was not possible
    under this flow condition (i.e., the flow controller cannot determine the correct
    gate position because it does not appear in the discharge equation) and to avoid
    unrealistic hydraulic behavior and potential instability that might occur as SOBEK
    switches from one gate equation to another. To avoid this problem, which occurred
    in some extreme situations, some of the gate widths were doubled. In one case
    (Pool 1-03.0), doubling the gate width was not sufficient and the setpoint also
    had to be raised. Changing the gate widths should have no effect on the performance
    of the automatic controllers, as discussed earlier. Offtakes There are multiple
    offtakes on each of the pools in the SRP canal system. To simplify the model,
    these multiple offtakes were consolidated into one offtake located just upstream
    from each check structure. The offtakes were modeled as sluice gates with a short
    canal section downstream. A drop in this canal section assured that the offtakes
    would operate under free flow. The offtake-gate openings were set so the correct
    amount of water would flow through the offtake if the water levels were at their
    setpoints. These offtake gate openings were calculated in MATLAB (MathWorks 2000)
    based on SOBEK’s gate equations and then supplied to SOBEK for the simulations.
    It was recognized that these offtake relationships were a simplification of the
    real system. However, this simplification should have little impact on a controller’s
    ability to maintain water levels at their setpoints. Boundary Conditions Various
    boundary conditions need to be defined in the SOBEK model of the SRP canal system.
    Boundary conditions must be set at the upstream and downstream ends of the canal
    system. The available boundary conditions in SOBEK are either water surface elevations
    or flow rates. Downstream control was implemented on the SRP canal system which
    means the releases at Stewart Mountain Dam are in the control loop. Thus the water
    level in Saguaro Lake, immediately upstream from Stewart Mountain Dam, was used
    as the upstream boundary condition. The lake’s water surface elevation was set
    at a fixed value for these simulations. The other boundary conditions that must
    be determined are at the downstream end of the canals (Arizona, Grand, and South)
    and in the short canal reach downstream from each offtake gate. At each structure
    that represented a downstream boundary, a sharp 1-m (3-ft) drop was created downstream
    from the structure. The water depths in the sunken sections were fixed at 0.5
    m (1.6 ft). This procedure supplied SOBEK with the necessary boundary conditions
    while still allowing the water level and flow rates to fluctuate. Control System
    The control system includes the Salt River, the Arizona Canal, the Grand Canal,
    and the South Canal. Remote downstream feedback control logic was used to automatically
    control the water levels in the various pools of the system. The exception was
    for Pool 2-04.6. This is the location of the Crosscut power generating station.
    For this pool, a local upstream controller was placed on the check structure and
    the pool was removed from the control loop. Under this scenario, the water level
    errors at the downstream end of Pool 2-06.3 generated control actions for the
    check structure in Pool 2-04.2, not Pool 2-04.6. Also, Pool 2-23.9 at the downstream
    end of the Grand Canal was not included because there was no HEC-RAS model of
    this pool. Thus the control system consists of 31 pools under downstream control
    and one pool under local upstream control. Two different downstream feedback controllers
    were used: (1) the fully centralized PI controller developed with LQR techniques
    and (2) MPC. Summary of Tests Performed Clemmens et al. (1997) used a series of
    tests defined by SRP watermasters to evaluate automation of the Upper Arizona
    Canal. Wahlin (2002) adapted these tests for most of SRP’s branching canal network.
    For this paper, Test 4 from Wahlin (2002) was examined in detail. The conditions
    for this test were a relatively high initial flow rate and flow rate changes occurring
    simultaneously on the Arizona, Grand, and South Canals. Table 3 presents a summary
    of this test. SOBEK unsteady-flow simulations were used to evaluate both the LQR
    and MPC feedback-control algorithms. In addition, hydraulic simulations were performed
    with and without an anticipatory feedforward routine. The feedback controller
    time step was 30 min while the flow control, or slave controller, time step was
    10 min. Each simulation was run under tuned conditions only (i.e., it was assumed
    that the controllers had perfect knowledge of the gate hydraulics and the canal
    properties). Table 3. Schedule of Flow Changes for SRP Test 4 (Wahlin 2002) Address

    26.90 Note: 1=Arizona Canal; 2=Grand Canal; and 3=South Canal. For the LQR controller,
    the volume compensation (VC) method was used as the feedforward routine method.
    See Bautista et al. (2002) for more details on this method. MPC allows more options
    in applying feedforward routing than the LQR controller, since the known demands
    can be input into MPC and the feedforward response can be optimized along with
    the feedback response. However, this option was not utilized for this paper. Instead,
    the ID model was used to compute the necessary schedule of demand changes, and
    these changes were added to the MPC controller. More detailed discussions of the
    feedforward routines used in the simulations appear later in the paper. Hydraulic
    Pool Properties The hydraulic properties for the ID model were determined for
    all the pools using unsteady flow simulations with SOBEK, as outlined by Wahlin
    (2002). In this method, each pool in the canal system is analyzed individually.
    First, a hydraulic model of thepool is built within SOBEK. Next, the simulation
    program is run until the system reaches steady state at the design flow rate and
    the downstream water level is at the desired setpoint. Then, the inflow is increased
    over one time step by 20% from the steady state value while the outflow is kept
    constant. The water level at the downstream end of the pool rises when the wave
    reaches the end of the pool. Finally, the ID model parameters are graphically
    fit to the downstream water level response. These hydraulic properties were determined
    pool-by-pool based on the initial flow conditions for this test. The results are
    shown in Table 4. Table 4. Pool Properties for SRP Canal System Pool Q (cfs) Q

    1,110 19 48,027 Note: 1=Arizona Canal; 2=Grand Canal; and 3=South Canal. Design
    and Tuning Controller design and tuning were based on the ID model parameters.
    Unsteady flow simulations were used to evaluate the aggressiveness of the controllers
    and to set one remaining tuning constant, as discussed later in the paper. Process
    Model The first step in controller design for this system is to put the ID model
    into state-space form, properly accounting for the branching. This was done with
    the procedure described in Wahlin and Clemmens (2006). The resulting state-transition
    matrix was used for designing all feedback controllers evaluated here. Linear
    Quadratic Regulator Once the state-transition relationships have been determined,
    tuning for LQR controllers only requires values of the relative penalties for
    the water level errors and the gate movements. To simplify the tuning process,
    Clemmens and Schuurmans (2004) suggest giving the same weight to water level errors
    in all pools and scaling the penalty for gate flow changes by the gate or canal
    capacity. This leads to the need for only one tuning parameter, R 1 , to express
    the trade-off between errors in water level and changes in gate movements. Note
    that Wahlin (2002) called this parameter ρ . This parameter essentially determines
    the aggressiveness of the controller. A smaller value of R 1 results in more aggressive
    control, but a controller that is too aggressive or underdamped will tend to overshoot
    and oscillate. A controller that is overdamped or not very aggressive will return
    to the setpoint too slowly. For the Upper Arizona Canal, Clemmens et al. (1997)
    used values of R 1 in the range of 3–5. For the steep ASCE Test Canal 1, Clemmens
    and Wahlin (2004) used R 1 =20 [see Clemmens et al. (1998) for more details on
    the ASCE Test Canal 1]. There appears to be a tendency for larger systems to require
    a smaller value of R 1 . Wahlin (2002) used an R 1 value of 5; however, the response
    appeared overdamped. For this paper, R 1 was set equal to 1. This value appears
    to give good control of the entire canal system. Design of an optimal LQR feedback
    controller in MATLAB for this large network takes a matter of minutes using a
    computer with a 1.6 GHz Pentium IV processor and 1.5 GB of RAM. Once the controller
    is designed, a simulation of 9 days takes only about 30 min to complete. However,
    the LQR controller is designed for one set of conditions. How the controller performs
    over the full range of situations encountered needs to be examined. This task
    was beyond the scope of this paper. Feedforward with Volume Compensation Existing
    LQR controller design methods do not explicitly deal with feedforward routing
    of known demand changes. Bautista et al. (2002) discuss various aspects of routing
    known demand changes through a canal. Hydraulic routing methods can result in
    significant oscillations in the upstream inflow. Experience has shown that simpler
    methods based on simple delay times are sufficient. For this paper, the volume
    compensation (VC) method was used; this method sets the delay time based on satisfying
    the changes in pool volume associated with changes in flow rate. Pool volumes
    for initial and final flow rates were determined with a steady-flow analysis performed
    with HEC-RAS (2002). A more complete discussion on selection of delay times is
    provided in Bautista and Clemmens (2005). For these simulations, the feedforward
    schedule was computed ahead of time based on the demand changes and their timing.
    Model Predictive Control In contrast to the LQR optimization which assumes an
    infinite prediction horizon, MPC’s prediction horizon is finite and has to be
    defined by two parameters: (1) the prediction horizon, p , and (2) the control
    horizon, m . MPC also has an optimization penalty function that expresses the
    trade-off between the water level errors and the gate flow changes. The penalty
    function is similar to that used in the LQR method, except as implemented, the
    penalty terms are actually squared. Both LQR and MPC use quadratic performance
    criteria, but the coefficients are handled differently. So, an LQR penalty of
    R 1 = 16 should be similar to an MPC penalty of R 1 =4. However, the correspondence
    likely is not exact because of the differences in prediction horizon. For this
    paper, R 1 was set equal to 1, and the control horizon m was set equal to 25.
    With a 30-min time step, m =25 would correspond to 12.5 h. This is more than enough
    time for any disturbance created at Stewart Mountain Dam to reach the downstream
    end of the Arizona, Grand, or South Canals based on the delay times in Table 4.
    Typically, the prediction horizon should be about twice the control horizon. However,
    to reduce computation time, p was set equal to 40. Once the parameters R 1 , m
    , and p have been selected, no further work needs to be done to implement MPC.
    One benefit to MPC is that optimization can be done based on current conditions
    and adjusted as conditions change (i.e., different delay times and backwater surface
    areas). The drawback is that MPC performs an optimization routine every time step,
    so the simulations run much slower than the simulations performed with the LQR
    controllers. Typically, 9 days of simulation of MPC control took 10–12 h using
    a computer with a 1.6 GHz Pentium IV processor and 1.5 GB of RAM. As mentioned
    earlier, MPC has the ability to determine feedforward schedules through optimization.
    Unfortunately, when used in combination with a feedback controller in MPC, the
    feedforward control actions are penalized with quadratic performance criteria.
    This tends to smooth out the feedforward control actions, making them ramps rather
    than step changes. Also with MPC, the feedforward time step would be the same
    as the feedback time step, namely 30 min. The VC feedforward method is typically
    applied at the flow-control time step, or 10 min. Overall, Wahlin (2002) found
    that performance using the optimized feedforward controller within MPC was degraded
    from results with the LQR feedback controller and the VC feedforward controller.
    To overcome this problem, the feedforward and feedback optimizations were performed
    independently. Initially, it was thought that this could be accomplished by setting
    the penalty R 1 equal to zero when the feedforward optimization was performed.
    However, when this was done, there were huge oscillations in the flow rate. Thus
    some nonzero penalty is required in order for the optimization procedure to work
    correctly. Since the intent of this paper was not to examine optimization of feedforward
    methods, but rather to demonstrate the application of the existing technology
    to branching canal networks, a simpler approach was taken. Since the MPC approach
    is based on the ID model, use of the delay times from the ID model should result
    in perfect feedforward control when applied back to the ID modeled canal. Thus
    the ID model delay times were used to determine the feedforward control response
    for MPC. For example, if the demand change is 1 m 3 /s (35.3 cfs) at 12:00 p.m.,
    then a 1 m 3 /s (35.3 cfs) change is made at all upstream gates, all the way to
    Stewart Mountain Dam. The timing of the flow change is based on the delay time
    of the pools (see Table 4). If the pool where the change occurs has a delay time
    of 20 min, then the change at the gate on the upstream end of that pool occurs
    at 11:40 a.m. If the next pool upstream has a delay time of 60 min, then the next
    gate upstream is adjusted at 10:40 a.m., and so on. This is essentially inverting
    the ID model. For these tests, this ID model-based feedforward schedule is computed
    ahead of time for the scheduled demand changes. If the requested flow change had
    not been requested at or before the time of the feedforward control action, it
    was delayed until the next control action, 10 min later. Thus there could be a
    delay of up to 9.9 min in implementation of a requested check-gate flow change.
    Results Feedforward Schedules Fig. 3 shows the feedforward schedules for Test
    4 based on the VC method and on the inversion of the ID model. Clearly, the VC
    delay times are much longer than the ID delay times, thus the flow changes upstream
    occur much sooner. For the ID model, the first change occurs 550 min before the
    scheduled demand change, compared to 756 min for VC (roughly 1/3 longer).However,
    the total volume supplied by the two schedules after the transient period is similar:
    277,600 m 3 (225 acre-ft) and 276,600 m 3 (224 acre-ft) for the VC and ID methods,
    respectively. The difference is roughly 0.3%. However, in terms of the relative
    change from the initial flow, the changes are 5,700 m 3 (4.6 acre-ft) and 4,800
    m 3 (3.9 acre-ft), respectively, or a 20% difference in net volume change. Fig.

    Results The simulation results for each controller are presented in terms of deviation
    in water level from the setpoint. The water level errors for these 31 pools are
    displayed as five separate graphs: (a) pools in the upper part of the Arizona
    Canal, including the Salt River; (b) pools in the lower part of the Arizona Canal;
    (c) pools in the upper part of the Grand Canal; (d) pools in the lower part of
    the Grand Canal; and (e) pools in the South Canal. The results for the LQR controller
    with feedback only (LQR-FB) are shown in Fig. 4. For this test, the water levels
    are in the red zone as they deviate by more than 0.122 m (0.4 ft) for long periods
    of time. These water level deviations are clearly unacceptable from an operational
    standpoint. Deviations of up to 1 m (3.3 ft) are seen in the lower Grand Canal
    [see Fig. 4(d), note scale change]. It is also clear that it would literally take
    days to stabilize water levels in this branching canal system with feedback control
    for this simulation test. Since demand changes typically are made each day, it
    is understandable why these canals are always in a transient state during the
    main water-use season. Fig. 4. Test 4 simulation results for the fully centralized
    PI controller with feedback only (LQR-FB) Fig. 5 shows the results of the MPC
    controller under feedback only (MPC-FB). The results are very similar to the LQR
    results. There are a few minor differences in the maximum deviations of some of
    the curves, but this could be attributed to subtle differences in tuning. Overall,
    the response is very similar. This is reassuring since both methods optimize based
    on the same process model. Fig. 5. Test 4 simulation results for the MPC controller
    with feedback only (MPC-FB) Fig. 6 shows the results from applying the LQR feedback
    controller with the VC-based feedforward schedule (LQR-FB VC-FF). Here it can
    be seen that most water levels stay within the green zone [0.076 m (0.25 ft)].
    Those that deviate do so only for a very short time. Some of the pools on the
    upper portion of the Grand Canal deviate into the red zone for several hours [see
    Fig. 6(c)]. However, overall, this is reasonable performance. Fig. 6. Test 4 simulation
    results for the fully centralized PI controller with feedback and VC-based feedforward
    (LQR-FB VC-FF) The simulation results using MPC with feedback and ID-based feedforward
    (MPC-FB ID-FF) are shown in Fig. 7. Most water levels deviate from their target
    levels for only short periods of time and most do not cross into the red zone.
    A notable exception is again in the upper portion of the Grand Canal [see Fig.
    7(c)], where several pools deviate by 0.20 m (0.6 ft) for several hours. Overall,
    however, this is reasonable performance and would be acceptable in an operational
    setting. Fig. 7. Test 4 simulation results for the MPC controller with feedback
    and ID-based feedforward (MPC-FB ID-FF) Discussion Both the LQR controllers and
    MPC were able to effectively control a large portion of SRP’s canal system when
    known demands were accounted for with an anticipatory feedforward schedule (i.e.,
    demand changes were routed through canal). All of the controllers were able to
    bring the water levels back to their setpoints and keep them there. This is a
    promising result and indicates that both of these controllers can effectively
    control branching canal networks. Many simplifications have been made to the SRP
    canal network model (e.g., generalized cross sections, grouped offtakes, modified
    control structures, etc.). Although these simplifications create minor differences
    in the hydraulic model, they may lead to more significant differences in the field.
    Although the controller performance on this branched network is promising, further
    field studies are needed before the controllers’ performance can be judged under
    real operating conditions. Feedback Control and Tuning With similar tuning, the
    LQR and MPC techniques produced similar results. No attempts were made to evaluate
    the effects of differences between assumed and actual conditions on the performance
    of these controllers. That is the subject of future research. It is well known
    that ID model parameters for a given pool change with flow rate and with changes
    in flow resistance that can occur over the season. The VC method takes these changes
    into account since pool volumes are determined as a function of flow rate, Manning
    n , and downstream water level setpoint (Bautista and Clemmens 2005). Accounting
    for these differences with the LQR controller under feedback alone (LQR-FB) would
    require a different set of controller constants for each set of hydraulic conditions.
    Preliminary results suggest that the feedback controller performance is not as
    strongly influenced by pool properties as the feedforward control. Still, determining
    what range of conditions are appropriate for a given controller and rules for
    changing controller constants as hydraulic conditions change (gain scheduling)
    have not been fully evaluated. MPC offers some advantages in this regard since
    the optimization can be performed based on the current state of the system (e.g.,
    current flow rates, Manning n , downstream water levelsetpoint), assuming that
    the analysis has been done ahead of time to determine appropriate values for these
    parameters over a range of conditions. Efficient ways of determining these parameters
    is also the subject of future research. For the current study, it appears that
    the feedback controller tuning with R 1 =1 is appropriate for both controllers.
    In general, the curves in Figs. 4 and 5 show some minor overshoot in some cases
    and most of the water levels return to their setpoints without oscillating. Only
    a few pools show oscillations around the setpoint and these are likely caused
    by interference among the pools. In practice, the controllers would have additional
    damping since the conditions of the canal are generally not known with great accuracy.
    At the present time, selection of these tuning weights is done by trial and error.
    Anticipatory Feedforward Control These results demonstrate that it is very important
    to route known demand changes through a canal system. Feedback alone will never
    be able to do the job. It is also clear that the feedforward timing is not critical.
    The timing for upstream flow changes for the VC-based feedforward controller (VC-FF)
    was much sooner than for the ID-based feedforward controller (ID-FF), yet the
    results were not greatly different. Of interest is the upper portion of the Grand
    Canal. For the VC-based feedforward controller’s early flow changes, it can be
    seen from Fig. 6(c) that the water levels dropped. The negative flow changes in
    the lower portion of the Grand Canal (see Table 3) arrived too soon. In contrast,
    the water levels initially rise using the ID-based feedforward controller [see
    Fig. 7(c)], suggesting that the negative flow changes arrived too late. In this
    case, the timing of flow changes likely should have been in between the values
    computed by the two feedforward methods. Good timing will not necessarily get
    rid of these spikes all together because they are caused by the dispersion of
    the wave as it travels downstream (i.e., the flow wave arrives gradually at the
    downstream end of the pool). The best results are when the positive and negative
    magnitude of each spike has about the same absolute value. Overall this suggests
    that there is room for improvement in determining both the VC-based and the ID-based
    delay time. It also suggests the need to develop a common set of parameters useful
    for both feedback and feedforward models. Again, that is beyond the scope of this
    paper. Conclusions There are several important conclusions that can be made based
    on the various simulation results. These conclusions are summarized below. • In
    the simulation studies, the LQR and MPC feedback controllers were able to return
    the water levels to their setpoints for a large portion of SRP’s branching canal
    network, although the performance of both of these controllers would not be acceptable
    in an operational setting. Controller performance is greatly improved when known
    demand changes were routed with an anticipatory feedforward routing scheme; •
    For this network example of the Salt River Project, combined feedback-feedforward
    controllers were able to keep water levels within acceptable limits (green zone)
    except for a few short-duration spikes during transient conditions; • The LQR
    and MPC feedback controllers had similar results when tuned with equivalent tuning
    parameters and when the same process model was used for both controllers; • Feedforward
    routing with delays based on the volume compensation method performed somewhat
    better than when routing with delays based on the integrator-delay model; and
    • A more accurate process model may be able to improve both feedback and feedforward
    control. Notation The following symbols are used in this paper: A s = surface

  description: An integrated approach to the design of an automatic control system
    for canals using a Linear Quadratic Gaussian regulator based on recursive least
    squares estimation was developed. The one-dimensional partial differential equations
    describing open channel flow (Saint-Venant) equations are linearized about an
    average operating condition of the canal. The concept of optimal control theory
    is applied to drive a feedback control algorithm for constant-level control of
    an irrigation canal. The performance of state observers designed using the recursive
    least squares technique and the Kalman filtering technique is compared with the
    results obtained using a full-state feedback controller. An example problem with
    a multi-pool irrigation canal is considered for evaluating the techniques used
    to design an observer for the system. Considering the computational complexity
    and accuracy of the results obtained, the recursive least squares technique is
    found to be adequate for irrigation canals. In addition, the recursive least squares
    algorithm is simpler than the Kalman technique and provides an attractive alternative
    to the Kalman filtering. © Tübi̇tak.

    is applied to the regulation of irrigation canals. The Saint-Venant equations
    of open-channel flow are linearized using the Taylor series and a finite difference
    approximation of the original nonlinear, partial differential equations. The concepts
    of linear optimal control theory are applied to derive a feedback control algorithm
    for constant level control of art irrigation canal. Two-step linear quadratic
    update equations and a sequential gain updating scheme are used to drive a linear
    quadratic reliable formulation. An example problem with a single pool is considered
    for evaluating the performance of the reliable control technique used to design
    an optimal control for irrigation canals. The results from the 2-stage reliable
    control technique are compared to the results from a standard linear quadratic
    regulator (LQR). The 2-stage reliable control formulation provides both good stability
    and performance gain margins in the canal operation. The results of this study
    show that a 2-stage linear quadratic reliable control for irrigation canals offers
    an alternative to the standard optimal control formulation if there is a lack

  description: Spatial and temporal variation of infiltration rates make the management
    of surface irrigation systems a very complex process. Surge irrigation presents
    additional complications due to wetting and drying cycles and their effect on
    infiltration. In this study, we developed a model that incorporates feedback control
    for management of surge irrigation. The infiltration profile at the completion
    of the advance phase is represented by a specialized power function. A computer
    simulation using a range of inflow rates was evaluated to determine the constants
    in the power function. The model uses an analytical solution to calculate the
    infiltration profile for the post-advance phase. The infiltration rate during
    the post-advance phase is assumed to remain constant. The analytical solution
    to the kinematic wave formulation can simulate overlapping and nonoverlapping
    of surge waves which enhances the evaluation of surge irrigation performance.
    The model was verified using field data and found adequate for field application
    with feedback-controlled surge irrigation.

  description: Feedback-controlled surge irrigation systems require operating criteria
    to maximize application efficiency. Two observable pieces of information that
    can be used for feedback control are water advance and runoff. Unfortunately,
    due to its spatially dispersed nature, water advance data can be difficult, expensive,
    and time consuming to collect. With good infiltration data, existing surge irrigation
    models can simulate surge flow for many conditions and be used to study the effect
    of varying management and field variables on surge irrigation performance. However,
    the models do not automatically generate optimal solutions for management. We
    developed the operating criteria and control logic for the management of a feedback-controlled
    surge irrigation system that uses a minimal amount of water advance data and runoff
    data as feedback information. The equations necessary for application of the operating
    criteria in a feedback-controlled surge irrigation system with laterally varying
    infiltration are presented.

    but was substantially different for the other two tests. The quality of the control
    degraded as a result of errors in model parameters, particularly in cases with
    incorrect check gate calibrations and submerged gate flows. Results point out
    the importance of combining open- and closed-loop control measures to improve
    the overall effectiveness of the control.

    systems are reviewed. In particular, the results of the application of estimation/optimization
    feedback control on a basin-irrigation system are reported. It is shown that the

    of net infiltrated depth and application efficiency. In some cases, the potential

    to irrigation and from basin to basin. While basin-to-basin variation in infiltration
    shows a well-defined pattern, the other variations appear random and are not correlated
    with conditions at the time of irrigation. The implications of these results for
    feedback control of surface irrigation are discussed.© ASCE.

    A number of methods developed for feedback control of surface‐irrigation systems
    are reviewed. In particular, the results of the application of estimation/optimization
    feedback control on a basin‐irrigation system are reported. It is shown that the
    feedback control system did consistently better than the farm irrigators in terms
    of net infiltrated depth and application efficiency. In some cases, the potential
    application efficiencies predicted from theory are shown to be not attainable.
    Infiltration and roughness parameters show considerable variation from irrigation
    to irrigation and from basin to basin. While basin‐to‐basin variation in infiltration
    shows a well‐defined pattern, the other variations appear random and are not correlated
    with conditions at the time of irrigation. The implications of these results for
    feedback control of surface irrigation are discussed. Formats available You can

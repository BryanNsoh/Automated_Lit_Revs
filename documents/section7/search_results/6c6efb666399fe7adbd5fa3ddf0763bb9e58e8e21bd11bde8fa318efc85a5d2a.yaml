    Title:  Developing a cloud based Internet of Things (IoT) greenhouse monitoring

    Abstract:  The introduction of the greenhouse reduces the negative impact of difficult
    to control outdoor factors on crop production. The greenhouses offer a better
    environment in which to grow high quality agricultural products in large quantities,
    but in a small surface area. Factors including temperature, humidity and soil
    moisture each have a different impact on the quality of the crop. These factors
    contribute to how crops develop either directly or indirectly. Poor environmental
    conditions can damage crops or increase the likelihood of crop diseases. Hence,
    this study set out to develop a greenhouse monitoring system to assist farmers
    to monitor soil moisture, humidity and temperature. Internet of Things (IoT) and
    cloud-computing are the major components underlying the monitoring system. The
    reviewed literature reveals that there are minimal studies that have been conducted
    for the convergence of cloud computing and IoT in agriculture, particularly in
    greenhouse farming. Despite the researcherâ€™s best efforts, literature revealed
    very few studies that have successfully implemented these emerging technologies
    in innovative ways in the sector of agriculture. Studies are even sparser in relation
    to greenhouse applications. This study aimed to develop a cloud-based Internet
    of Things (IoT) greenhouse monitoring system that is cost effective and easily
    accessible and provides unlimited data storage to farmers for analysis. This aim
    is achieved by three key objectives, that is: by critically reviewing existing
    literature of IT based greenhouse monitoring systems supporting crop production;
    by developing a wireless cloud-based IoT greenhouse monitoring system; and by
    evaluating the performance of the developed system. The design science research
    methodology (DSRM) is applied as an overall methodology to conduct this study.
    DSRM is a popular methodology when research aims to develop innovative artefacts.
    This instance of DSRM followed five steps: awareness; suggestion; development;
    evaluation; and conclusion to design and implement and evaluate the artefact.
    DSRM allowed for a robust development process which promoted higher quality in
    monitoring the three main factors of the greenhouse environment, which are temperature,
    humidity and soil moisture. The results of the evaluation of the developed system
    indicates an efficient, cost- effective and easy to access monitoring system for
    three key environmental factors, namely, temperature, humidity, and soil moisture.

  description: In a time of resource reduction and climate variability, water conservation
    is critical to improve agroecosystem sustainability. Non-ionic surfactants were
    recently hypothesized as irrigation adjuvants, but so far researchers obtained
    contrasting results. The first objective of this work was to evaluate the capillary
    adsorption properties of organosilicone surfactants by providing two robust tests
    on standard porous media. Results showed smaller capillary mobility and higher
    wetting power (“superspreading”) compared to pure water. An innovative non-ionic
    surfactant formulation, the organosilicone PET (PolyEther-modified Trisiloxane),
    was then investigated as irrigation adjuvant in a pot trial on lettuce in absence
    of fertilization. Overall, the system was characterized by an improvement in the
    processes of resource acquisition, i.e. water and nutrients. Results indicated
    higher lettuce leaf area, reduced root dry weight and root:shoot ratio and a positive
    main effect on the uptake, availability and/or use efficiency of P, K and some
    micronutrients. The N use efficiency and recovery increased 3–15%, with higher
    N concentration and content against changes in plant weight. Fresh yield data
    showed a particularly high irrigation use efficiency (+77–60%), and the adjuvant
    productivity (variation of lettuce yield due to PET) increased by 12–26%. Our
    experimental findings can be explained by hypothesizing that PET affected both
    capillary and adsorption processes during water diffusion along concentration
    gradients, which constitute the main driving force for solutes movement towards
    the roots. A theoretical model is provided to explain how PET improved the thickening
    and interconnection of conductive adsorbed water film in soil.

    potentialSustainability 1. Introduction Globally, agriculture accounts for approximately
    70% of freshwater used, mainly for irrigation (FAO, 2016; Fischer et al., 2007).
    However, the water withdrawal for irrigation largely exceeds the crop requirements
    (FAO, 2016; Knox et al., 2012). In a time in which the demand for water is increasing
    at a rate twice that of population growth (FAO, 2016; Gil and Kamanda, 2015),
    agriculture is called to meet the economic and social challenges of increasing
    food demand and rising competition for scarce resources. Securing a more efficient
    use of irrigation water becomes essential to face the reduction in water resources
    and the extreme weather due to climate change (Elliott et al., 2014; Tilman et
    al., 2002; Wallace, 2000). Non-ionic surfactants (surface-active agents) have
    been recently hypothesized as potential adjuvants for improving irrigation efficiency
    and agroecosystem sustainability (Baratella et al., 2016; Chaichi et al., 2015;
    Lehrsch et al., 2011). Surfactants or wetting agents are essentially long chain
    polymers of varying complexity with a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail
    (amphiphilic structure), operating at air/water or water/solid interfaces by lowering
    the surface tension (Krogh et al., 2003). There are four basic groups of surfactants,
    according to the nature of their hydrophilic group: anionic, cationic, non-ionic,
    and amphoteric. Non-ionic surfactants, traditionally used as pesticide adjuvants,
    generally possess low potency to both terrestrial and aquatic organisms and are
    therefore preferred for agricultural applications (Bonnington, 2003; Krogh et
    al., 2003). Organosilicone surfactants fall within this category. Under aerobic
    conditions, non-ionic surfactants are easily biodegraded by microorganisms and
    are mineralised slowly in anaerobic conditions and when adsorbed to the soil minerals
    (Valoras et al., 1976; Ying, 2006). During adsorption to clays and organic materials,
    surfactants have direct effect on hydraulic soil properties, by weakening the
    cohesive forces and allowing water to easily penetrate and wet the soil (Kuhnt,
    1993; Wiel-Shafran et al., 2006). Therefore, their use as adjuvants for irrigation
    in agronomic production can potentially improve irrigation use efficiency and
    crop quality by requiring less water, capturing rainfall more effectively and
    reducing the nutrient losses through run-off erosion or leaching (Cooley et al.,
    2009; Karagunduz et al., 2001; Starr et al., 2005). Previous attempts of surfactants
    application on water-repellent soils, as a mean to improve water penetration and
    preferential flows, gave positive results (Feng et al., 2002; Müller and Deurer,
    2011; Oostindie et al., 2008). On the contrary, there are no clear findings on
    the potential improvement of water movements in hydrophilic soil. This debate
    dates back to the 60s, and researchers obtained contrasting results (Karagunduz
    et al., 2015; Krogh et al., 2003; Tumeo, 1997; Wiel-Shafran et al., 2006). Often
    these studies limited the experiments to a single application of the surfactant,
    and different results might have been achieved by repeated administrations to
    allow the adsorption of the surfactant in the matrix (Mobbs et al., 2012; Feng
    et al., 2002). From the agronomic perspective, the addition of wetting agents
    to irrigation water may ultimately affect the transport and availability of water
    and nutrients to crops. The potential effects of non-ionic surfactants on plant
    uptake and growth have been poorly investigated so far, with contrasting results.
    McCauley (1993) evaluated the effect of a non-ionic surfactant formulation on
    soybean (Glycine max L.) and found that both yields and irrigation efficiency
    increased with surfactant application. In Brumbaugh and Peterson (2001), non-ionic
    surfactants increased the growth of corn root. Inversely, Wolkowski et al. (1985)
    have reported no effects on plant growth after surfactant application to corn
    (Zea mays L.), soybean, wheat (Triticum aestivum L.), and potato (Solanum tuberosum
    L.). Banks et al. (2013) examined corn nutrient uptake in different soils, observing
    no consistent surfactant effects. Baratella et al. (2016) performed a first agronomic
    trial on lettuce, testing a non-ionic surfactant formulation (45% fatty acid ester,
    45% sorbitan sesquioctanoate and 10% propylene glycol) as irrigation adjuvant.
    The authors found a dose-related contrasting effect of the formulation, especially
    on roots growth, with a strong interaction with the mineral N fertilization (urea).
    The recent work of Chaichi et al. (2015) investigated the addition of a non-ionic
    surfactant to irrigation water in corn production under Mediterranean climate,
    observing an increase of the irrigation water use efficiency and, consequently,
    higher corn yield and dry matter. These few studies available about the effects
    of non-ionic surfactants on crop production give evidently contradictory information.
    Data are still lacking for assessing the potential of non-ionic surfactants to
    increase water and nutrient use efficiency, which would be of significant value
    in improving the sustainability of vegetable production systems. The present study
    aims to investigate the effects of an innovative non-ionic surfactant formulation,
    i.e. an organosilicone surfactant, on irrigation water use efficiency and nutrient
    uptake of lettuce in absence of fertilization. The first objective was to design
    a rapid and robust laboratory method for assessing the surfactant properties in
    relation to the capillary adsorption, which is of importance for comparative studies
    of surfactants in consideration of their use in soil. From a practical standpoint,
    there is still a lack of a feasible and rapid alternative to the costly, direct
    measurements of soil hydraulic properties, i.e. hydraulic conductivity, capillary
    rise and sorptivity (Mingorance et al., 2007). Common drawback of using direct
    soil measurements for studies on surfactants is that, since surfactants behave
    differently for any given soil types, using measures from one type of soil to
    predict response on another soil is often inappropriate (Mingorance et al., 2007;
    Mobbs et al., 2012). In the present study, potential changes in the capillary
    mobility of water in soil induced by surfactants were conceptualized and simulated
    in laboratory by means of two rapid tests of capillary adsorption on standard
    porous media. The second objective was to investigate the effect of non-ionic
    organosilicone surfactants on the irrigation water use efficiency of crops, and
    understand possible synergistic or antagonistic effects between the application
    of the surfactant and the nutrient uptake in absence of fertilization. To this
    end, a pot trial was carried out on lettuce, administering an innovative organosilicone
    surfactant formulation by irrigation. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Organosilicone
    surfactants properties For evaluating the variation of water capillary movements
    induced by different organosilicone surfactants, we tested four different eco-friendly
    formulations: i) composition of polyether-modified polysiloxanes (concentration
    75 ≤ % ≤ 100); ii) composition of polyether-modified trisiloxanes (75 ≤ % ≤ 100);
    iii) polyether siloxane (50 ≤ % ≤ 75; iv) composition of poly-dimethylsiloxanes
    (10 ≤ % ≤ 25). Data on their physicochemical properties are given in Table 1.

    testing, we selected and tested one surfactant formulation, the polyether-modified
    trisiloxane (concentration 75 ≤ % ≤ 100) composed by 80% (w/w) of heptamethyl-trisiloxane
    and about 20% (w/w) of polyether (mono-2-propenyl ether). This non-ionic surfactant,
    hereafter called PET, belongs to the class of the polyether-methyl-siloxanes,
    organosilicone polymers containing typically SiOSi bonds (siloxanes). Data on
    the different physicochemical properties of PET are given in Table 1. Other organosilicone
    classes are volatile methylsiloxanes (VMS) and polydimethylsiloxanes (PDMS). Organosilicone
    surfactants showed higher efficiency (Hill 2002) and lower environmental persistence
    and toxicity compared with other non-ionic formulations, indicating their higher
    potential for application to crop production (Bonnington, 2003; Fendinger et al.,
    1997; Stevens et al., 2001). Stevens (1995) indicated that organosilicone surfactants
    are rapidly adsorbed onto soil particles and then quickly inactivated by hydrolysis.
    Consequently, when entering the soil environment, these non-ionic surfactants
    are expected to be either adsorbed to the soil or degraded, not leaching to the
    groundwater (Krogh et al., 2003; Bonnington, 2003). 2.2. Capillary mobility Two
    rapid and robust tests on standard porous media were performed in the laboratory
    to assess potential changes in the capillary mobility of water in soil after application
    of organosilicone surfactants: a newly designed capillary mobility test, and a
    capillary rise test. Theoretical premise is that surfactants alter the capillary
    movement of water in soil with a magnitude that depends mainly on the fluid properties
    but that is affected to various extent by the specific physicochemical properties
    of the soil (Abu-Zreig et al., 2003; Karagunduz et al., 2001; Tumeo, 1997). Consequently,
    in evaluating the potential of a specific surfactant, it is unlikely that direct
    measurement of soil hydraulic properties will give reproducible values for comparative
    purposes (Mobbs et al., 2012). To overcome this drawback, we conceptualized at
    the laboratory scale the variation of water capillary movements induced by surfactant
    applications in soil, in order to attribute them a magnitude irrespective of the
    soil peculiarities and reproducible with a certain accuracy. Our conceptual model
    in this first phase, like many common models for water retention and matric potential
    in porous media, relied on a simplified picture of the soil pore space as a “bundle
    of cylindrical capillaries” (BCC models), in which no distinction was made between
    the various mechanisms affecting water in porous matrices (i.e. capillarity and
    surface adsorption). The variation in water capillary mobility was estimated by
    a fast and accurate test on silica gel plates (Merck Classical Silica 60 TLC Plates).
    The sample solutions were organosilicone surfactants, listed in Table 1, dissolved
    in deionized water at concentration of 1 mL L−1, stained with 0.5% methylene blue
    solution. The control was deionized water stained with 0.5% methylene blue solution.
    After placing the plate over a graph paper on a flat surface, a given volume of
    each solution was administered by dripping repeatedly with a pipette on a fixed
    point of the plate, in the centre of the graph paper. Each solution ran a certain
    horizontal distance from the dripping point, namely the distance of capillary
    adsorption. After 60 s, the stained outermost edge of the advancing liquid was
    marked and, using the graph paper divisions, the radius of the adsorption spot
    was measured with an accuracy of 0.1 cm, and recorded. Changes in the capillary
    distance were assessed by measuring the spots radii after administering 100 μL,
    250 μL and 500 μL of solution, in 3 replicates. The percentage decrease in capillary
    mobility (d) at the ith time is defined as where dc and ds are the mean radii
    of the control and the sample spots, respectively. Precision and uncertainty of
    the method were assessed through repeatability and within-laboratory reproducibility
    tests (EURACHEM, 1998; ISO 13528, 2005). Repeatability was evaluated by replicating
    the test (n = 3) on 1 mL L−1solutions of 4 different organo-modified polysiloxanes
    (N = 12). The intra-laboratory reproducibility was assessed by replicating the
    test in different days and with different operators (N = 24) (Hanneman, 2008;
    ISO 13528, 2005; ISO JCGM 100:2008, 2008, ISO JCGM 100:2008, 2008). To not account
    for the difference between samples as a component of the method precision, the
    pooled Relative Standard Deviation (pRSD%) was calculated for the decrease in
    capillary mobility, expressed as the radii of the control and the sample spots
    in mm (dc, and ds respectively) (ISO JCGM 100:2008, 2008, ISO JCGM 100:2008, 2008;
    Kessel, 2002; Magnusson et al., 2011). Uncertainty of these measurements was calculated
    by multiplying the standard deviation of the mean by Student’s t factor for the
    respective degrees of freedom at 95% confidence level (t95.11 = 2.201 and t95.23 = 2.069)
    (ISO JCGM 100:2008, 2008, ISO JCGM 100:2008, 2008; Kessel, 2002). The variation
    in capillary rise of the soil-surfactant system was estimated by a classic Thin-Layer
    Chromatography (TLC) on silica gel plates (Merck Classical Silica 60 TLC Plates),
    testing two concentrations of the organosilicone surfactants at 1 mL L−1 (S1.0)
    and 0.5 mL L−1 (S0.5) in deionized water, stained with 0.5% methylene blue solution.
    The control was deionized water stained with 0.5% methylene blue solution. The
    height of the mobile phase, namely the height of capillary rise (Capillary Height
    CH), was measured after a given time of 8 min ± 5 s in three replicates per each
    treatment. 2.3. Agronomic trial The agronomic testing was carried out by applying
    PET as the selected surfactant formulation. Treatments were set up in plastic
    pots of 1 L capacity. The pots were filled with a non-fertilized silty loam soil
    as growing medium in addition to a single layer of expanded clay at the base to
    improve drainage. The silty loam soil (silt 47.6%, sand 24.4%, loam 28%) was air
    dried for 24 h and passed through a 5 mm sieve before lightly packing the pots.
    Its main chemical-physical properties were determined according to the Italian
    Official Methods for Soil Analysis (1999) and presented in Table 2. Table 2. Physico-chemical
    properties of the soil used for the agronomic trial (Italian Official Methods
    for Soil Analysis 1999). Soil Parameter Silt (%) 47.60 K2O (mg kg−1) 598.10 Sand

    Iceberg) were grown in the same growing medium (non-fertilized silty loam soil)
    before being transplanted into the pots. The plantlets were transplanted (1 plant
    per pot) at about 6 cm high (3 fully expanded leaves), and then placed in a climate
    chamber under 12:12 LD photoperiod and 70–80% relative humidity at 24 °C and 18 °C
    (Light and Dark temperature, respectively), for 24 days. Lettuce plantlets were
    irrigated manually with 50 mL of water on alternate days, strictly avoiding subirrigation.
    To evaluate the effect of organosilicones as irrigation adjuvants, we assessed
    the lettuce ability to utilize water and soil nutrient sources, in relation to
    the addition of PET to irrigation water. To modulate its use for a sustainable
    crop production, we assessed the effectiveness of 2 different PET concentrations,
    spanning the range of probable agronomic doses (0.1–1.0 mL L−1 according to the
    literature). The adjuvant was therefore administered at 1 mL L−1 (S1.0) and 0.2 mL L−1
    (S0.2) in deionized water and in 2 applications, in order to: i) verify eventual
    phytotoxic effects of the higher dose (1 mL L−1); ii) identify a minimum effective
    dose at which the adjuvant application is still agronomically significant. The
    treatments were: control (deionized water), PET treatment at 0.2 mL L−1 (two applications
    at 0 and 10 days from transplanting) and PET treatment at 1 mL L−1 (two applications
    at 0 and 10 days from transplanting). The mineral composition of the PET solution
    is given in Table 3. Table 3. Mineral composition of the surfactant solution (PET)

    randomized block design in five replicates: 1 soil × (2 + 1 untreated) surfactant
    applications × 5 replicates. The pots were periodically randomly rotated to a
    different position within the block for the duration of the trial. Manual weeding
    was undertaken when required. At harvest, 24 days from transplanting, all the
    plants were collected and separated into epigeic fraction (stems and leaves) and
    ipogeic fraction (roots). The roots were separated from soil particles by manual
    washing with deionized water, providing adequate time for complete drying at room
    temperature prior to weighing. The following data were collected: fresh (FW) and
    dry (DW) weight (g plant−1), leaf area (LA, cm2 plant−1), specific leaf area (SLA = leaf
    area on leaf dry weight, cm2 g−1), dry matter (DM = total dry weight on fresh
    weight), number of leaves (N. leaves plant−1), specific leaf fresh (LFW) and dry
    (LDW) weight (leaf weight on leaf area, mg cm−2), root fresh (RF, g plant−1) and
    dry weight (RD, g plant−1) and root to shoot ratio (RS). Leaf area (LA) was measured
    using an electronic area meter (LI-COR Model 3100, Delta-T Devices Ltd., Cambridge,
    UK). Dry weights were recorded after drying tissues in a forced-air oven at 80 °C
    for 72 h. The irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE, g L−1) was calculated on
    both dry and fresh lettuce yields (IWUEd or IWUEf, respectively) as IWUE = Y/I
    where Y (Yield, g) is the epigeic dry or fresh matter and I is the amount of irrigation
    water applied (L). The adjuvant productivity index (IP, %) was calculated for
    the dry and fresh lettuce yields (IPd and IPf, respectively) as , where Yi is
    the yield of plants irrigated with PET, and Yr is the yield of plants irrigated
    with water (Howell 2003; Chaichi et al., 2015). To perform the nutrient analysis,
    the epigeic biomass of lettuce was dried at 80 °C for 48 h and ground in a Wiley
    mill to pass through a 20-mesh screen. The samples were prepared by dry ashing
    the grounded plant tissue at 400 °C for 24 h, then by dissolving 1 g of the ash
    in 1:25 HCl (Isaac et al., 1998). The samples were then analysed by an inductively
    coupled plasma emission spectrophotometer (ICP-AES Iris, Thermo Optek, Milano,
    Italy) for the determination of the following macro and micronutrients: P, K,
    Ca, Mg, Na, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, Al, B, Cd, Cr, Pb and Zn. The nitrogen content was
    determined on a dry-weight basis, using a LECO FP-528 nitrogen analyzer (FP-528,
    Leco Corp). The recovery of nitrogen (REC%) was assessed on the basis of the soil
    mineral allocation, considering the differential uptake between PET-treated and
    control lettuce (Benincasa et al., 2011; Trinchera et al., 2013): where Nu is
    the uptake of nitrogen (g plant−1) of PET-treated or control lettuce and Ns is
    the nitrogen supplied by the soil, calculated as Ns = NO3-N + NH3-N (g plant−1)
    (Table 2). To assess the ability of lettuce to utilize the soil mineral allocation,
    we calculated the nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) by considering the total crop
    dry weight (DW, g) accumulated per gram of absorbed N (Benincasa et al., 2011):
    NUE = DW/Nu 2.4. Statistical analysis All data were statistically analysed by
    analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey''s HSD post-hoc pair wise comparisons
    (SPSS, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY). Nutrient content data were further evaluated by
    bi-dimensional vector analysis, which allowed for simultaneous comparison of plant
    growth and nutrient content (Baratella et al., 2016; Sagel, 2003). The nutrients
    contents were compared after normalizing to the control treatment; ponderal weights
    are displayed in relation to the nutrient content of plant tissue, with curved
    content isoclines (giving constant content per unit of dry weight) included for

    Compared to pure water, the distance of capillary adsorption of organosilicones
    solutions decreased sharply (Table 4). All treatments (100 μL, 250 μL and 500 μL

    outliers (empty circle, not present). Same letters represent not significant differences
    among the treatments (p > 0.05). Differently from the control, surfactant solutions
    spread readily from the dripping point (the centre of the graph paper) outward,
    forming a distinctive innermost halo (inner radius in Table 4), which had a radius
    of 0.6–0.7 times the total distance of adsorption (Table 4). Repeatability, reproducibility,
    and uncertainty of the capillary mobility test are reported in Table 5. The coefficient
    of variations (pRSD) of surfactant solutions ranged from 1.42% to 5.60% for intra-day
    assays and from 3.56% to 5.87% for inter-day assays (Table 5). In both cases,
    the pRSD values decreased with increasing pipetting volumes of organosilicone
    solutions. Overall, the different organosilicone solutions, at the agronomic dose
    of 1 mL L−1, showed a reduction of the capillary adsorption 20–50% (p < 0.001
    HSD Tukey), with higher adsorption values for polyether-polysiloxanes (concentration
    75 ≤ % ≤ 100) and lower values for poly-dimethylsiloxanes (concentration 10 ≤ % ≤ 25).
    The intra-day pRSD of the control (solution of deionized water) varied from 2.02%
    to 5.92%, and inter-days pRSD varied from 5.58% to 5.87%, without a clear trend
    in relation to the pipetting volumes (Table 5). The uncertainty of measurements
    is presented in Table 5, results indicate a good accuracy. The uncertainty of
    repeatability was generally higher than the uncertainty of reproducibility, due
    to the subjectivity of the operators. Table 5. Repeatability, reproducibility

    the method. Regarding the vertical capillary mobility, the surfactant solutions
    showed a decrease of the capillary rise from 1.37% to 4.24% compared to pure water,
    proportionally to the surfactant concentration (Fig. 3). There were significant
    differences in the height of capillary rise (CR) between the control (CR CNT = 8.72 ± 0.07 cm)

    into a decrease of 40% on average (HSD Tukey) (Table 6). In PET-treated lettuce,

    Mg, and an increase of K, compared to the control. In the case of P and Mg, it
    is observed a decrease in concentration when PET is administered at the lower

    water at 0.2 mL L−1and 1.0 mL L−1, respectively. The vector analysis showed an
    enhanced nutrient availability and/or uptake for P and K (Fig. 4–A) and, at the
    higher dose of surfactant application, for the micronutrient B. We found a better
    nutrient use efficiency for Mg, Mn and Ca (Fig. 4–A), and for the micronutrients
    Cu, Zn, Ni (Fig. 4–B). Specifically, the concentration and the total content of
    Mg, Ca and, among micronutrients, Cu declined while plant weight increased, indicating
    a more efficient use of these nutrients in plants irrigated with the surfactant
    solution. The lower dose of PET (0.2 mL L−1) increased the use efficiency also
    for the micronutrients Zn and Ni. The concentration of Mn (both PET doses), B
    (lower PET dose) Zn and Ni (higher PET dose) declined, while the total content
    increased with a corresponding increasing of the plant weight. In this case, the
    uptake, or availability, is considered equal between plants irrigated with the
    surfactant solution and plants irrigated with water alone, since the differences
    in concentration and content were a result of the increased plant weight. As special
    case among micronutrients, the application of the higher dose of surfactant (1.0 mL L−1)
    enhanced strongly the availability and/or the uptake of Cr (Fig. 4–B). The nitrogen
    content (Ntot) and use efficiency (NUE) for the lettuce whole plant and for the
    aboveground biomass are reported in Table 9. The PET addition to irrigation water
    did not affect significantly the uptake of N (Table 9), leading to a weak increase
    of the nitrogen content both for the lettuce whole plant and the aboveground biomass.
    Nonetheless, data showed a significant trend towards higher NUE values in PET-treated
    lettuce, compared to the control (Table 9). Table 9. Total nitrogen content (Ntot)

    biomass of lettuce. Results, reported in Fig. 5, indicated a positive effect of
    the surfactant on the ability of lettuce to take up and translocate N from the
    soil. In fact, the application of PET increased the recovery of nitrogen in the
    epigeic biomass, from 7.45% of the control to 10.12% and 9.24% of PET treatments
    at 0.2 and 1.0 mL L−1, respectively (p < 0.05). In parallel, REC values decreased

    which was related proportionally to the increase of plant weight. Download : Download

    Disclosing the properties of a surfactant relative to capillarity and adsorption
    is fundamental for screening among different formulations in consideration of
    their use in soil. The first objective of the present study was to assess the
    potential effect of organosilicone surfactants as irrigation adjuvants in relation
    to the water capillary adsorption, by means of two rapid and robust tests on standard
    porous media: a newly designed capillary mobility test and a capillary rise test.
    The capillary mobility method we developed was found to be precise and with a
    good degree of reproducibility of results (Table 5), and it can be effectively
    applied to all surfactants as agricultural adjuvants: organosilicones, alcohol
    ethoxylates, sorbitans, etc. Results showed that the addition of organosilicones
    to water caused a reduction of the horizontal capillary mobility compared to pure
    water (Table 4). Likewise, TLC analysis showed a decrease of the capillary rise
    of surfactant solutions (Fig. 3). We found that the decrease in water capillary
    mobility was dependent on surfactant type and concentration and in no relation
    to the volume of solution administered to the porous medium (Fig. 2). This phenomenon
    was consistent with the surfactant-induced decrease of the surface tension, which
    appears to be a linear function of surfactant concentration until micelles begin
    to form: below the critical micelle concentration CMC, both the surface tension
    of water and the contact angle between solid and aqueous phases decrease with
    increasing surfactant concentration (Karagunduz et al., 2001). When idealizing
    the water penetration into unsaturated porous media (BCC models), the capillary-driven
    flow is expressed by the Young-Laplace Eq. (1), which relates the capillary pressure
    Pc or pressure difference Δp (air pressure Pa minus water pressure Pw) required
    for water entry into a characteristic pore radius R, to the interfacial tension
    liquid-gas γ and the contact angle liquid-solid θ: (1) where R/cosθ is the interfacial
    radius of curvature (meniscus) of the gas-liquid interface. As described by (1),
    in 3 phases gas/liquid/solid, when water comes in contact with a capillary the
    adhesive forces liquid-solid (short-range London–van der Waal’s forces that act
    over a few molecular layers) combined with the cohesive force among water molecules
    at the gas–liquid interface, creates a capillary pressure Pc (vacuum) between
    water and air, which causes the fluid to enter the pore network. This pressure
    difference produces a concave interfacial curvature at the gas–liquid interface
    with a lower water potential – or negative hydrostatic pressure- called matric
    potential μ that, when expressed per unit volume of water, can be considered equal
    to the water pressure Pc = −Pw = −μ. The surface tension of pure water (γ = 72.86 mN m−1
    at 20 °C) is inversely related to the temperature T (dy/dT = −0.138 mN M−1) and
    increases with decreasing liquid pressure, allowing capillary pressure to increase
    for a constant pore radius. If we neglect gravitation, the rate of capillary adsorption
    ν in meso and micropores (i.e. the soil capillary water) is theoretically given
    by Hagen-Poiseuille (2) where x = distance of adsorption, η = liquid viscosity.
    (2) At longer times, the capillary wetting process can be described by both the
    Poiseuille and Laplace equations by the Lucas–Washburn equation (3) that describes
    the liquid penetration into a horizontal capillary (Matthews et al., 2008; Smith
    and Gillham 1999). (3) The Eq. (3) was used by many researchers to describe wetting
    of porous media, even though it does not always apply to water penetration into
    porous networks (Matthews et al., 2008). The Bosanquet Eq. (4) describes the inertial
    flow of individual wetting events at short time intervals, with advancing wetting
    of small volume entering a capillary tube (equation is simplified as there is
    no applied external pressure at the entrance of the capillary tube). In this equation,
    in contrast to the Lucas-Washburn equation, the distance travelled by inertial
    flow is independent of viscosity, but inversely related to the radius of the pore
    and the fluid density ρ. (4) In simpler words, according to the equations above,
    the capillary pressure and the distance of adsorption are linear functions of
    the surface tension. In this simplified model, lowering the surface tension of
    a fluid will always lead to a proportional reduction of its capillary mobility,
    as verified by our laboratory tests. Some authors hypothesized that this mode
    of action should theoretically increase the hydraulic conductivity in a soil-water
    system (Karagunduz et al., 2001; Moore et al., 2010; Tumeo, 1997). Nonetheless,
    direct measurements of soil hydraulic properties often reported a decrease in
    hydraulic conductivity after the application of non-ionic surfactants (Karagunduz
    et al., 2015; Mobbs et al., 2012). In literature, when using direct measurements,
    both an increase and a decrease in soil water content are reported as the main
    effect of surfactant application (Karagunduz et al., 2001; Oostindie et al., 2008)
    and, similarly, the capillary rise in soil columns was found either to decrease
    significantly (Wiel-Shafran et al., 2006) or to not change at all (Mobbs et al.,
    2012). In agreement with Wiel-Shafran et al. (2006), in our idealized system organosilicones
    showed to decrease water capillary movements in porous media, but also spread
    readily outward from the dripping point, indicating a higher wetting power compared
    to the pure water (Fig. 7). The condition for water to wet and spread on a surface
    is that the adhesive forces exceed the cohesive forces within the bulk water.
    We can explain our results considering that surfactant hydrophilic head bonds
    strongly with water, while its tail adsorbs to surfaces such as silica, air molecules
    in pores, or, in soil, clay minerals and hydrophobic organic substances (Kuhnt,
    1993; Mobbs et al., 2012; Tumeo, 1997). The balance between adhesive and cohesive
    forces during adsorption of surfactant solutions most likely determined the degree
    of wetting and the effects on capillarity: the adsorption of organosilicones at
    the liquid–solid interface produced a decrease in the surfactant concentration
    at the wetting front of the advancing film, and this surface tension gradient
    enhanced the movement of water to the wetting front (Fig. 8). Rosen and Kunjappu
    (2012) reported this phenomenon as a “superspreading” or “superwetting” ability,
    verified for some trisiloxane surfactants. Similarly, the innermost adsorption
    spot, which was formed by dripping on silica plates (Fig. 7), was probably caused
    by transient drainage and rewetting events behind the leading edge of the wetting
    front (Henry and Smith, 2006): the greater water pressure in the system affected
    the hydraulic gradient, inducing water fluxes within the solute front from the
    source at higher surfactant concentration (lower surface tension, higher soil
    water pressure), toward “cleaner” regions (higher surface tension, lower soil
    water pressure) (Fig. 8). The rate of water movement should therefore increase
    with increasing difference in capillary pressures, i.e. linearly with surfactant
    concentration and not with the volume of solution administered, as verified in
    our experiments. The carrying of water energized by surface tension gradients
    is a phenomenon known as the Marangoni effect (Gibbs-Marangoni flow), a tangential
    force that arises from a momentum transfer and results in a faster, extensive
    desaturation of the porous medium than expected by standard continuum models of
    flow and transport. The Marangoni effect is often associated with temperature
    gradients (that alter the surface tension) and concentration gradients due to
    solute displacement, microbial growth, and/or biosurfactants production (Henry
    et al., 2002; Henry and Smith, 2006; Smith and Gillham, 1999). Download : Download

    adsorption of the surfactant at the solid–liquid than at the air–liquid interface
    (surfactant concentration C1 < C2) (from Rosen and Kunjappu, 2012, modified).
    Transferring these results to the field, it is presumable that the application
    of organosilicones as irrigation adjuvants can cause temporal changes in the diffusional
    capacity of the circulating solution and in the nutrients pathway, proportionally
    to the strength and concentration of the surfactant. As long as we refer to capillary
    water, organosilicones should reduce the upward capillary movements of water in
    soil, preventing evaporation loss, and improve the wetting and rewetting of soil
    (superspreading effect). Similarly to what hypothesized for rhizosphere biosurfactants
    (Read et al., 2003), the gradient of capillary pressure extending from the point
    of irrigation into the bulk soil may displace water and therefore nutrients, and
    draw them from smaller soil pores than would otherwise be not accessible to roots.
    4.2. Agronomic performances We performed an agronomic testing on one selected
    surfactant formulation, the PET (PolyEther-modified Trisiloxane). Biometric parameters
    of lettuce yield indicated a positive main effect of PET in terms of leaf area
    and dry weight, and a slight trend for higher aboveground biomass production compared
    to the control (Table 6). The application of PET caused a significant increase
    of SLA and a decrease of LDW of lettuce leaves, which are key variables related
    to the physiological processes of biomass production from freshly allocated assimilates
    (Hodgson et al., 2011; Poorter and De Jong, 1999). The reduction of LDW and the
    increase of SLA constitute per se a notable index of the surfactant positive effects
    on growth response and quality of lettuce. These parameters are in fact function
    of leaf dry matter and leaf thickness, and for this reason are often used as index
    of schlerophylly. In general, LDW and SLA are very sensitive to plant nitrogen
    status, light, climate and several other stresses. Species in permanently or temporarily
    resource-rich environments tend, on average, to have a lower LDW and a higher
    SLA than those in resource-poor environments. Similarly, high-LDW species generally
    have high values for DM, high concentrations of cell walls and secondary compounds
    and greater leaf and root longevity (conservation of acquired resources) (for
    review, see Poorter and De Jong, 1999; Vile et al., 2005). In our specific case,
    on the basis of the biometric and nutritional data obtained, we can safely interpret
    the decreasing of LDW and the increasing of SLA as the outcome of an improvement
    in the processes of resource acquisition from soil. The use of PET determined
    a significant decrease in the DM of the aboveground biomass. Given the negligible
    variation of the lettuce dry weight, this reduction of epigeic DM should be related
    to the marked increase of the fresh weight observed in the PET-treated lettuce.
    Results indicated also a slight trend for higher biomass production in PET-treated
    lettuce, compared to the untreated control, expressed as both fresh and dry weight
    (Table 6). Regarding the belowground biomass, a significant reduction of about
    40% was observed for both the root dry weight and the root:shoot ratio (Table
    6). Our results were in agreement with Parr and Norman (1964) but in contrast
    with the observation made by Brumbaugh and Peterson (2001). In literature, few
    reports of surfactant effects on plants dealt with root development and growth,
    since most works have focused only on aboveground vegetative development. Although
    the patterns of biomass allocation to roots can be sometimes contradictory, in
    our specific case the higher proportional distribution of biomass in lettuce leaves
    than in shoots, should directly translate to a higher uptake rate of soil resources,
    i.e. water and nutrients. Since this was a non-fertilized trial, the differential
    uptake of nutrients from the soil must be referred to the ability of the plant
    to utilize the soil as a limited nutrient source to grow and give yield. The nutrient
    analysis showed a general trend toward a reduction in the elemental concentration
    of lettuce epigeic tissue, significant for P, Mg and Ca, and for Cu and Zn among
    micronutrients (Table 8), with the only exception of K. However, these differences
    in the nutrient concentration were proportionally related to the increase of the
    lettuce biomass: after normalization, data showed higher uptake, availability
    and/or translocation for P, K and B in PET-treated lettuce, compared to the control
    (higher content and concentration, Fig. 4). This result is of particular value
    since the low availability and restricted transport of P commonly limit plant
    growth. The beneficial effect of surfactants on increasing the availability of
    phosphorus is further supported by considering that, among several mechanisms
    developed by plants to survive in phosphorus-deficient soils, there is also the
    exudation of biosurfactants via root mucigel. Read et al. (2003), in a study on
    maize, lupin and wheat root exudation, evaluated the effect of phospholipids naturally
    found in the mucilage on selected soil properties. Even at low concentration,
    the authors observed a considerable reduction of the surface tension of soil solution
    and reported a decrease of the amount of phosphate adsorbed in soil and a simultaneous
    increase of P concentration in solution by 10%. On the other hand, the increased
    assimilation of Cr in PET-treated lettuce highlights the uptake of unwanted elements
    from potentially contaminated soils as the possible main drawback (Baratella et
    al., 2016). The system was characterized by the increase of the nutrient use efficiency
    for Ca, Cu, Ni and Zn, which means a higher production with less nutritional adsorption
    (reduced content and concentration with increase in lettuce growth, Fig. 4). On
    the other hand, the uptake or availability of Fe, Mg and Mn can be considered
    equal between plants irrigated with PET and plants irrigated with water (Fig.
    4). These results are partially in line with Baratella et al. (2016), which, however,
    highlighted a dose-related detrimental effect of their non-ionic formulation in
    absence of N fertilization. Regarding nitrogen utilization, in our trial the application
    of PET led to a weak and not significant increase of the N content both for the
    lettuce whole plant and for the aboveground biomass (Table 9). However, to better
    highlight any synergistic or antagonistic effect of the surfactant on nitrogen,
    we analysed separately the two main components of the nutrient efficiency: the
    N uptake efficiency (REC), which is the ability of crops to take up N from the
    soil, and the N use efficiency (NUE), that is the efficiency with which crops
    use the absorbed N to grow and give yield (Benincasa et al., 2011). Despite the
    absence of fertilization, the application of PET led to higher concentration and
    content of nitrogen against changes in plant weight: the NUE values of PET-treated
    lettuce increased significantly 5–13 percentage points for the whole plant, and
    3–15 percentage points for the epigeic biomass (Table 9). The surfactant gave
    positive results also on the ability of lettuce to take up N from the soil, since
    the recovery of nitrogen in the epigeic biomass increased by 2.25% on average
    (Fig. 5). The increased uptake of soil N could be related to the higher relative
    growth rates and lower dry matter content of leaf tissues in PET-treated lettuce
    (Tittonell et al., 2000). So far, relatively little information was available
    on the effect of surfactants on crops N uptake and use. Our evidences are in agreement
    with Arriaga et al. (2009), which reported an improvement in the apparent N recovery
    for fertilized potatoes, given by the increase in tuber N uptake and in petiole
    NO3 concentrations. The authors measured also a consistently lower NO3-N concentration
    in soil and the trend toward a lower soil NH4-N concentration associated with
    a reduction in leaching, and speculated it was the result of an increase in plant
    N use. An alternative hypothesis is given by Read et al. (2003), which reported
    that lecithin, a phospholipid surfactant of the root mucigel, reduced the rate
    of N mineralisation in soil, possibly through a direct effect on the microbial
    population. We couldn’t carry out soil analysis at the end of the agronomic trial
    to shed light on this hypothesis, but nonetheless, similarly to P and K, our results
    on N may be indicative of a synergistic effect of the surfactant on plant nutrition,
    which, as previously reported, should be explicated through the enhancing of the
    availability in soil of these nutrients, of their uptake by the root, or both
    (Fig. 6). In this regard, the comparative analysis of REC between aboveground
    and belowground biomass gave us some insight into the probable effect of PET also
    on nitrogen translocation. In fact, following the application of PET, the recovery
    of nitrogen increased in the epigeic biomass and, in parallel, decreased in the
    root system (Fig. 5). The phenomenon observed suggested the existence of a possible
    augmenting mechanism also for the nutrient transport via xylematic flow, in need
    of verification by further experimental studies. Regarding the effect of PET on
    water uptakes, data on lettuce fresh yield showed a particularly high increase
    of the irrigation use efficiency (Table 7). The irrigation use efficiency, i.e.
    the ability of the plant to utilize water to grow, increased 77–60 percentage
    points. The adjuvant productivity, which express the variation of the lettuce
    yield due to the application of the surfactant, increased 12–26 percentage points
    with surfactant treatments at 0.2 mL L−1 and 1.0 mL L−1, respectively. These findings
    are consistent with our nutritional data, and can be explained considering that
    the driving forces for solute movement towards the roots are mainly the formation
    of a depleted zone at the roots interface and the diffusion of water and nutrients
    towards this zone (Jungk, 1996). In agreement with our results, Chaichi et al.
    (2015), which investigated the application of a non-ionic surfactant on corn under
    limited irrigation, reported the increase of the irrigation water use efficiency
    based on total dry matter and grain yield by 9.5 and 14.4% respectively. Additional
    data showing similar trends were obtained by few recent studies on deficit irrigation
    strategies implemented with the use of non-ionic surfactants to improve water
    use efficiency in arid and semi-arid regions (Chaichi et al., 2017; Madsen et
    al., 2016). 4.2.1. Effect on water and nutrient availability in soil In a soil
    profile, the dominant mechanisms of nutrient transport in soil are diffusion through
    water films at the micro-scale (a few pores), and convection through water flow
    at the macro-scale (from mm to m). On the base of our preliminary laboratory tests
    on standard porous media, we hypothesized that the application of PET, lowering
    the surface tension of the soil solution, can enhance the transport of solutes,
    especially of immobile elements such as P and K and trace nutrients, towards the
    root surface by affecting water flow and diffusion along the concentration gradient
    (Jungk, 1996). To improve our mechanistic understanding of the phenomenon, we
    should consider the physics behind the movement of an air–water interface in soil.
    The aggregation of particles and irregular mineral surfaces in soil results in
    angular pore spaces, which form a variety of air-water and solid-water configurations
    and show a peculiar liquid behaviour during water displacement, compared to the
    BCC model: the angular cross sections determine capillary processes, while adsorption
    processes dominate the internal surface areas (Tuller et al., 1999). Therefore,
    in unsaturated soils, water is held in corners and pits by capillary forces as
    small liquid bodies, and is adsorbed as thin films on solid surfaces by means
    of various types of long- and short-range surface forces. If the two phases water
    and air are in mutual equilibrium, adsorbed water films can occur when Δp > 2γ/R:
    under these conditions, the water retained by capillarity in angularities coexists
    with adsorbed films. At near-zero matric potentials, soil water distribution is
    dominated by capillary forces in pores, but at lower matric potentials, the water
    retained in angularities become discontinuous, and the hydraulic behaviour is
    controlled for a large extent by the network of interconnected adsorbed films
    (Tokunaga, 2009). Because of the relatively large surface area of soil, at low
    potentials practically all the hydraulic resistance resides within adsorbed films
    (Tokunaga, 2009) and therefore the interfacial forces are likely to play a larger
    role in solute transport and biological activity than predicted by the conventional
    BCC model (Tuller and Or, 2001). Several models have been developed for describing
    the hydraulic properties of soil capillary pores and interspersed thin films (Tokunaga,
    2011 and references therein). Tuller et al. (1999 and subsequent papers) considered
    both adsorptive and capillary mechanisms using a combination of the conventional
    Young-Laplace equation for the capillary pressure of water menisci in angular
    pores, and of the disjoining pressure (Derjaguin, 1987) for coexisting thin water
    films. In the approach of Tuller et al. (1999), the contribution of adsorptive
    forces, i.e. the thickness h(μ) of adsorbed films lining soil internal surfaces,
    and the contribution of capillary forces, i.e. the liquid elements with radius
    of interface curvature r(μ), are considered separately as functions of the matric
    potential μ. The meniscus radius r(μ) for the capillary water in unsaturated conditions
    is given by the Young– Laplace Eq. (1). The thickness h(μ) of the thin liquid
    films adsorbed on the surface of angular pores and confined by the vapor phase
    is calculated as (5) where Asvl is the Hamaker constant (it summarizes the interactions
    between solid surface and gas through a liquid film, Asvl = –6 · 10−20 J for water
    on silicate surfaces). Eq. (5) represents the simplest form of liquid adsorption
    on solid surfaces considering van der Waals forces only (Derjaguin, 1987), but
    the Hamaker effective value of −6.0 × 10−20 J, defined by Tuller et al. (1999)
    and widely accepted in the literature, accounts for both van der Waals and ionic
    electrostatic forces, as pointed out by Tokunaga (2011). Given the Eq. (5), the
    average film thickness is predicted to increase with the matric potential μ. At
    relatively wet conditions (the so-called “field capacity”, μ = −10 to −30 J kg−1),
    the thickness of water film on a smooth mineral surface is about 10 nm (Or et
    al., 2007). In unsaturated macropores, measurements on rough mineral surfaces
    showed significant surface film flows for near-zero matric potentials (≈−0.250 J kg−1),
    with an average film thicknesses from 2 to 70 μm, comparable to local surface
    roughness (Tokunaga, 2009). According to the model of Tuller et al. (1999) and
    Or et al. (2007), we can calculate the effective film thickness H(μ) available
    for water and nutrient transport, as the average cross-sectional amount of liquid
    associated with films adsorbed on flat mineral surfaces and films internal to
    angularities, by (6). (6) In Eq. (6), h(μ) is the thickness of the adsorbed film,
    expressed by Eq. (5), and r(μ) is the radius of interface curvature, given by
    Eq. (1); β, L and γ are geometric parameters of the surface modelling. It is now
    clear that the interaction of surfactants with the soil structure could affect
    the soil hydraulic behaviour by multiple possible mechanisms operating simultaneously
    and with counteracting effects. The scaling relations show that lowering the interfacial
    tension decreases the radius of curvature of liquid elements r(μ), increases the
    effective film thickness H(μ) and causes the existence of adsorbed films under
    lower-magnitude Δp, or higher magnitude μ. Conversely, the effect of the contact
    angle (decrease θ, or increase in wettability), leads to higher Δp values, though
    with lower magnitude of variation and greatest uncertainty (Kim et al., 2012).
    From Eq. (6), as the matric potential increases, the r(μ) and the film thickness
    h(μ) increase, with counteracting effects on H(μ). However, the increase of matric
    potential expressed by h(μ) dominates over meniscus changes in determining the
    final effect on the effective film thickness. The conceptual model proposed here
    is that, according to the Eqs. (1) and (5), the PET-induced reduction of the surface
    tension led to a combined effect of decreasing the liquid-air interfacial radii
    of curvature and thickening the adsorbed films. In simpler words, as the radius
    of curvature associated with capillarity in pores decreased, with liquid elements
    receding deeper into pores because of the reduction of the capillary pressure,
    the thickness and the connectivity of the water films adsorbed on all planar surfaces,
    i.e. the effective film thickness H(μ) expressed by Eq. (6), increased. The primary
    conceptual steps of our model are illustrated in Fig. 9. The μ-dependent thickness
    of these thin (nanometer to micrometer) conductive water films strongly affected
    water and chemical transport in soil at medium and low saturations over many orders
    of magnitude in length scale. Download : Download high-res image (309KB) Download

    organosilicone (trisiloxane) adjuvants on the complex network of adsorbed films
    and capillary menisci within soil pores: the reduction of surface tension causes
    the liquid menisci to recede deeper from the radius r(μ)1 to r(μ)2 along with
    the reduction of capillary pressure; at the same time, the increase of the matric
    potential μ lead to the thickening of the adsorbed films from h(μ)1 to h(μ)2.
    As final effect, the effective thickness H(μ) and the connectivity of soil water
    films increase, which are the key mechanisms for improving hydraulic continuity
    and diffusion rates in unsaturated conditions. The augmentative effect of PET
    on H(μ) was further enhanced by the peculiar “superspreading” ability of trisiloxanes,
    which showed a greater adsorption at the liquid–solid interface of the wetting
    front, especially on hydrophobic areas over soil particle surfaces (Fig. 7), and
    contributed to extend and improve the network of interconnected adsorbed films
    (Tokunaga, 2009). Then, the surfactant-induced capillary pressure gradient towards
    the wetting front increased the infiltration of water, i.e. the wettability, and
    the drainage and rewetting events in the immediate vicinity of the roots allowed
    a faster, continuous replenishment of nutrients in the depletion zone (Silber
    et al., 2003). 4.2.2. Effect on root uptake The improvement of the root uptake
    can be explained assuming that PET behaved on the surface area of the root hairs
    similarly to what already verified in studying non-ionic surfactants penetration
    at the foliar and cuticular level (Fernández and Eichert, 2009 and references
    therein). Specifically, organosilicones are generally reported to promote stomatal
    infiltration by significantly lowering the surface tension, but there is also
    evidence that they can also affect the diffusion of substances through the plasma
    membrane and the cuticle. It is now recognized that non-ionic surfactants and
    biosurfactants can form channels through lipid membranes (Schlieper and De Robertis,
    1977) and cause a more efficient uptake of chemicals than allowed by the facilitated
    stomatal diffusion (Read et al., 2003; Fernández and Eichert, 2009). One possible
    explanation is that non-ionic surfactants exert a concentration-dependent effect
    on cell permeability, increasing water diffusion and ion flow through the membrane
    lipid bilayer and, consequently, acting as absorption enhancers. In this regard,
    the identification of the optimal surfactant concentration, together with the
    choice of the formulation, are of paramount importance, in our opinion, to obtain
    nutrient solutions capable of enhancing ion transport while causing no side effects
    (Baratella et al., 2016). In fact, non-ionic surfactants, similarly to anionic
    and cationic surfactants, form molecular aggregates, or micelles, when the concentration
    exceeds a critical level in aqueous solutions (CMC, critical micelle concentration)
    so that their characteristic properties are markedly changed (Krogh et al., 2003).
    First found in 1970 on beet tissues (Haapala, 1970) and then widely confirmed
    in the literature, the micelles of a surfactant above the CMC can complex with
    the globular lipoprotein units of the outermost plasma layer of plant cells, and
    solubilize the plasmalemma with leakage of ions and sugars. Conversely, at concentrations
    lower than the CMC, there was an enhanced retention of solutes in vegetable tissue
    (Haapala, 1970; Fernández and Eichert, 2009). Failure to consider these factors
    may have led to the many inconsistencies currently found in the literature when
    studying the agronomic efficacy of these kind of adjuvants. 5. Conclusion The
    PETs seem to represent an advantageous agronomic innovation for irrigation in
    order to reduce water and nutritional inputs, at the same time guaranteeing adequate
    crop production and quality. When entering the soil environment at safe agronomic
    doses, organosilicones are expected to be adsorbed in the first centimetres of
    the soil thickness, not leaching to the groundwater, and to cause temporal changes
    in the diffusional capacity of soil water and nutrient, proportionally to their
    strength and concentration. Decreasing the capillary water movements, PETs would
    reduce both water evaporation loss (upwards movements), facilitate the wetting
    and rewetting of soil (superspreading effect), improving the water use efficiency
    and, finally, crops nutrient availability. According to the theoretical model
    provided, the administration of PET as irrigation adjuvant, reducing the interfacial
    tension, decreased the radius of curvature of liquid elements in soil pores. At
    the same time, increasing the matric potential, PET increased the thickness of
    the network of adsorbed liquid films, i.e. the effective film thickness H(μ).
    Furthermore, for a given pore space geometry, adsorbed films occurred under lower-magnitude
    Δp, or at less negative chemical potentials, i.e. in more wet conditions. Because
    of the relatively large surface area of soil, the contribution of liquid films
    dominates interfacial forces and can strongly affect water and chemical transport
    in soil at medium and low saturations over many orders of magnitude in length
    scale (Tokunaga, 2009). Therefore, the formation of thicker adsorbed water films,
    which were determined primarily by the increase of the matric potential, supported
    larger water diffusion rates and likely played a primary role in nutrient transport.
    We can reasonably infer that the augmentative effect of PET on H(μ) was further
    enhanced by the peculiar “superspreading” or “superwetting” ability of trisiloxanes,
    which improved the connectivity of water films along the gradient of capillary
    pressure from the point of irrigation into the depletion zone, also drawing water
    and therefore nutrients from smaller soil pores than would otherwise be not accessible
    to roots. Overall, our experiments provide a first evidence that organosilicones
    as irrigation adjuvant can significantly affect the chemical and physical environment
    of the rhizosphere and the ecophysiology of crops, modifying solutes availability
    and hydraulic conductivity and improving the uptake and use efficiency of water
    and nutrients. Organosilicone surfactants could therefore represent a valid agronomic
    innovation to reduce inputs and improve the sustainability of vegetable production
    systems. References Abu-Zreig et al., 2003 M. Abu-Zreig, R.P. Rudrak, W.T. Dickinson

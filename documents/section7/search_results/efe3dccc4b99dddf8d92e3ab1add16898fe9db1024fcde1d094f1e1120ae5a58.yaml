  description: 'The improvement of crop productivity under abiotic stress is one of
    the biggest challenges faced by the agricultural scientific community. Despite
    extensive research, the research-to-commercial transfer rate of abiotic stress-resistant
    crops remains very low. This is mainly due to the complexity of genotype × environment
    interactions and in particular, the ability to quantify the dynamic plant physiological
    response profile to a dynamic environment. Most existing phenotyping facilities

    However, their ability to directly measure the physiological properties of the

    system (HFPS) that enables comparing plants’ dynamic responses to different ambient
    conditions in dynamic environments due to its direct and simultaneous measurement
    of yield-related physiological traits of plants under several treatments. The
    system is designed as one-to-one (1:1) plant–[sensors+controller] units, i.e.,
    each individual plant has its own personalized sensor, controller and irrigation
    valves that enable (i) monitoring water-relation kinetics of each plant–environment
    response throughout the plant’s life cycle with high spatiotemporal resolution,
    (ii) a truly randomized experimental design due to multiple independent treatment
    scenarios for every plant, and (iii) reduction of artificial ambient perturbations

    two new resilience-quantifying-related traits that can also be phenotyped using
    the HFPS: transpiration recovery rate and night water reabsorption. We use the
    HFPS to screen the effects of two commercial biostimulants (a seaweed extract

    in investigating the effect of biostimulants on drought tolerance. We analyze
    and discuss plant behavior at different stages, and assess the penalty and trade-off
    between productivity and resilience. In this test case, we suggest a protocol

    of crop productivity under abiotic stress is one of the biggest challenges faced
    by the agricultural scientific community. Despite extensive research, the research-to-commercial
    transfer rate of abiotic stress-resistant crops remains very low. This is mainly
    due to the complexity of genotype × environment interactions and in particular,
    the ability to quantify the dynamic plant physiological response profile to a
    dynamic environment. Most existing phenotyping facilities collect information
    using robotics and automated image acquisition and analysis. However, their ability
    to directly measure the physiological properties of the whole plant is limited.
    We demonstrate a high-throughput functional phenotyping system (HFPS) that enables
    comparing plants’ dynamic responses to different ambient conditions in dynamic
    environments due to its direct and simultaneous measurement of yield-related physiological
    traits of plants under several treatments. The system is designed as one-to-one

    on Capsicum annuum under different irrigation regimes. Biostimulants are considered
    an alternative approach to improving crop productivity. However, their complex
    mode of action necessitates cost-effective pre-field phenotyping. The combination
    of two types of treatment (biostimulants and drought) enabled us to evaluate the
    precision and resolution of the system in investigating the effect of biostimulants
    on drought tolerance. We analyze and discuss plant behavior at different stages,
    and assess the penalty and trade-off between productivity and resilience. In this
    test case, we suggest a protocol for the screening of biostimulants’ physiological
    mechanisms of action. Introduction To meet the food-security demands of an increasing
    global population, crop yields must double by 2050 (Ray et al., 2013). Despite
    an increase in crop productivity in the last few decades, the increased rate is
    not expected to match the demand, mainly due to the negative effects of climate
    change (abiotic environmental stresses such as drought, temperature extremes and
    flooding) and degrading soil quality. In fact, commercially grown crops are expected
    to achieve, on average, only about 50% of their potential yield under field conditions
    (Hatfield and Walthall, 2015; Foyer et al., 2016). In the last three decades,
    vast research had been invested in improving plant responses to various stresses.
    Nevertheless, the bench-to-field transfer rate (ratio of patents to marketed commercial
    seeds) of abiotic stress-resistant crops is very low, due to the high complexity
    of dynamic plant–environment interactions (Graff et al., 2013; Dalal et al., 2017).
    Physiological Phenotyping for Crop Improvement The major gap between the successful
    breeding and yield improvement results from the unpredictable outcome of the complex
    genotype × environment interactions (Miflin, 2000; Moshelion and Altman, 2015).
    To date, the major obstacle to bridging this gap has been the lack of an efficient
    method for identifying and quantifying yield-related traits at early stages of
    plant growth across vast numbers of plants/genes (Moshelion and Altman, 2015,
    Negin and Moshelion, 2017). Another potential bottleneck is the genotype–phenotype
    gap. The availability of new molecular tools has enhanced the efficiency of classical
    breeding and crop improvement (Collard and Mackill, 2008; Spindel et al., 2015;
    Bhat et al., 2016; Gosa et al., 2018). To achieve meaningful results in drought
    tolerance, molecular approaches to crop improvement must be linked to suitable
    phenotyping protocols at all stages, such as the screening of germplasm collections,
    mutant libraries, mapping populations, transgenic lines and breeding materials,
    and the design of OMICs and quantitative trait locus experiments (Salekdeh et
    al., 2009). Thus, to improve crops and to meet the challenges ahead, the genotypic
    view and emphasis on genomics need to be balanced by a phenocentric approach with
    an emphasis on phenomics, to minimize the genotype–phenotype gap (Miflin, 2000).
    The development of a high-resolution, high-throughput diagnostic screening platform
    for the study of whole-plant physiological performance that serves for phenotypic
    screening might bridge this gap (Moshelion and Altman, 2015). Indeed, the number
    of phenotyping facilities has increased dramatically in the last decade. Most
    of these facilities collect information using robotics and automated image acquisition
    and analysis (White et al., 2012; Fiorani and Schurr, 2013; Fischer et al., 2014;
    Kumar et al., 2015; Ghanem et al., 2015; Gosa et al., 2018). Nevertheless, the
    quest for more detailed and in-depth phenotyping of the dynamic genotype × environment
    interactions and plant stress responses (in particular during drought) has put
    the capability of the existing methods into question (Li et al., 2014; Ghanem
    et al., 2015; Rahaman et al., 2015; Halperin et al., 2017; reviewed by Gosa et
    al., 2018). Herein, we demonstrate a high-throughput functional phenotyping system
    (HFPS) composed of gravimetric systems that enable us to compare plants’ dynamic
    responses to different ambient conditions in dynamic environments, due to its
    direct and simultaneous measurement of the yield-related physiological traits
    of all plants under several treatments. Phenotyping for Biostimulants in Drought
    Response Apart from the traditional strategies to improve crop productivity under
    an uncertain environment and abiotic stress, an alternative approach is evolving.
    This approach considers the use of organic molecules, externally applied to the
    plant at low concentrations, to stimulate many aspects of growth and development,
    pathogen defense, stress tolerance and reproductive development. These organic
    molecules, collectively termed biostimulants, have become more and more common
    in the global market in the last two and a half decades (reviewed by Yakhin et
    al., 2017). Biostimulants have been defined in many different ways. In the scientific
    literature, the term biostimulant was first defined by Kauffman et al. (2007)
    in a peer-reviewed paper, with modifications: “biostimulants are materials, other
    than fertilizers, that promote plant growth when applied in low quantities” (reviewed
    by du Jardin, 2015). However, the definition of biostimulants adopted by the European
    Biostimulants Industry Council specifies that these materials should not function
    by virtue of the presence of essential mineral elements, known plant hormones
    or disease-suppressive molecules (Brown and Saa, 2015). Recently, biostimulants
    were defined by Yakhin et al. (2017) as “a formulated product of biological origin
    that improves plant productivity as a consequence of the novel, or emergent properties
    of the complex of constituents, and not as a sole consequence of the presence
    of known essential plant nutrients, plant growth regulators, or plant protective
    compounds.” However, due to their complex composition and diversity, biostimulants
    are classified differently by different research groups. Many categorize biostimulants
    based on the natural raw materials used, the origin of their active ingredients
    and modes of action, inclusion or exclusion of microorganisms, and/or mode of
    action of the biostimulant (Ikrina and Kolbin, 2004; Basak, 2008; du Jardin, 2012;
    Bulgari et al., 2015; Yakhin et al., 2017). Biostimulants are used in all stages
    of agriculture, namely, in seed treatments, during plant growth, and postharvest.
    They are applied both as foliar sprays and through the soil. Biostimulants may
    function in various ways, as comprehensively summarized by Yakhin et al. (2017).
    Their mechanism of action may comprise activation of nitrogen metabolism or phosphorus
    release from soils, generic stimulation of soil microbial activity, or stimulation
    of root growth and enhanced plant establishment. They stimulate plant growth by
    enhancing plant metabolism, stimulating germination, improving photosynthesis,
    and/or increasing the absorption of nutrients from the soil, thus increasing plant
    productivity. Studies have shown a clear protective role of a diverse number of
    biostimulants against abiotic stress, as reviewed by Van Oosten et al. (2017).
    Nevertheless, and despite the extensive literature suggesting that biostimulants
    decrease the effects of abiotic stress (and in particular drought stress), information
    regarding their physiological mechanisms of action is limited. The large number
    of potential candidate biostimulants and the need to elucidate their particular
    modes of action, optimal concentrations, and types of application, create a substantial
    bottleneck in the research and development of new biostimulant products. High-throughput
    phenotyping technologies have been successfully employed in some aspects of plant
    breeding (Araus and Cairns, 2014; Tardieu et al., 2017), but their application
    to assess plant biostimulant action has been limited (Petrozza et al., 2014; reviewed
    by Rouphael et al., 2018), despite the potential benefits of using these technologies
    in biostimulant product screening (Rouphael et al., 2018). In this study, we tested
    the effectiveness of physiological phenotyping for understanding the physiological
    “mode of action” of biostimulant activity on the whole plant’s drought response.
    We chose a seaweed-based biostimulant (ICL-SW), and an additional biostimulant
    (ICL-NewFo1) from the same company. The reason for choosing seaweed-based biostimulant
    is that it has been widely used in agriculture for decades and its role in improving
    plant health both under stress and non-stress conditions was reported many times
    (Battacharyya et al., 2015; Ghosh et al., 2015; Anand et al., 2018; Hurtado and
    Critchley, 2018). We chose the other biostimulant as a representative of additional
    important groups that are widely used for their activity and/or anti-stress properties
    (amino acids and polyols), and are present in different combinations in various
    commercial biostimulants (Przybysz et al., 2014; Popko et al., 2018; Xu and Geelen,
    2018). We tested the impact of biostimulants on several quantitative yield-related
    physiological traits: transpiration rate, growth rate, and water-use efficiency
    (WUE). In this paper, we did not aim to look for the mechanistic effect of a certain
    product but to demonstrate the general concept of physiological screening involving
    drought treatment as well as biostimulants representing a general group, aiming
    to change the plant response profile relative to control pattern. Materials and
    Methods Plant Material The seeds of pepper (Capsicum annuum var. Rita) were obtained
    from Zeraim Gedera-Syngenta, Israel. For germination, the seeds were sown in a
    tray with 10-mL cones filled with commercial growing medium (Matza Gan, Shaham,
    Givat-Ada, Israel), composed of (w/w) 55% peat, 20% tuff and 25% puffed coconut
    coir fiber. The trays were well irrigated and kept in the same greenhouse (on
    side-tables) where the experiment was performed. When the seedlings were 4 weeks
    old, the growing medium was carefully washed off (to avoid root damage) the seedling
    roots and the seedlings were immediately transferred to 4-L pots filled with 20/30
    sand (Negev Industrial Minerals Ltd., Israel). The numbers 20/30 refer to the
    upper and lower size of the mesh screen through which the sand was passed (20
    = 20 squares across one linear inch of screen), resulting in a sand particle size
    of between 0.595 and 0.841 mm. The volumetric water content (VWC) of the freely
    drained substrate, noted as pot capacity, was ∼24% (for details, see section “Experimental
    Setup”). The Physiological Phenotyping Platform The experiment was conducted in
    June–July 2018 in a commercial-like greenhouse located at the Faculty of Agriculture,
    Food and Environment in Rehovot, Israel. The greenhouse temperature was controlled
    using fans that blow air through a moist mattress, keeping it below 38°C. The
    temperature and relative humidity (RH) were 21–38°C and 30–80%, respectively.
    The plants were grown under natural light (midday maximum of 1300 μmol s–1 m–2),
    representative values for natural conditions during the summer in the central
    part of Israel, including Rehovot. The temperature, RH, photosynthetically active
    radiation, barometric pressure and vapor pressure deficit in the greenhouse were
    continuously monitored by Plantarray meteorological station (Plant-Ditech Ltd.,
    Israel). The functional phenotyping system Plantarray 3.0 platform (Plant-Ditech)
    was used to monitor the plants’ performance during the entire experimental period
    by controlling the schedule and quantity of irrigation. This platform (Figure
    1A and Supplementary Figure 1), which enables performing high-throughput physiological
    functional phenotyping, includes 72 units of highly sensitive, temperature-compensated
    load cells that are used as weighing lysimeters. Each unit is connected to its
    personalized controller, which collects the data and controls the irrigation to
    each plant separately. An independent controller for each pot enables tight feedback
    irrigation, based on the plant’s transpiration rate. Each controller unit is connected
    to its neighbor for serial data collection and loading to a server. A pot with
    a single plant is placed on each load cell (for more details, see section “Experimental
    Setup”). The data were analyzed by SPAC-analytics (Plant-Ditech), a designated
    online web-based software that enables viewing and analyzing the real-time data
    collected from the Plantarray system. figure 1 Figure 1. Experimental setup. (A)

    well-irrigated plants; empty circles – plants subjected to the drought-recovery
    scenario. Green – ICL-SW-treated plants, orange – ICL-NewFo1-treated plants, blue

    reduce evaporation, and irrigation was injected into the soil via multi-outlet
    drippers to ensure even distribution of fertigation and biostimulants (see Supplementary
    Figure 1). Nutrition and Treatments The composition of the nutrients supplied
    to the plants by the irrigation system (fertigation) is provided in Table 1. Two
    different commercial biostimulants were used: seaweed extract of Ascophyllum nodosum
    (ICL-SW) and a metabolite extract formula which is a balanced combination of natural
    plant active substances (ICL-NewFo1) (both manufactured by ICL Specialty Fertilizers,
    Holland). ICL-NewFo1 is a low concentration (less than 1%) mixture of amino acids
    (involved in internal antioxidant production) and polyol sugars (osmoprotectant)
    dissolved in mineral fertilizer. The biostimulants were prepared in two different
    containers that were placed on two additional load cells to precisely track their
    application. The biostimulants were provided to the plants together with the nutrients
    via the controlled irrigation system (Supplementary Figure 1). The biostimulant
    concentration and dosage were as per the manufacturer’s instructions: ICL-NewFo1
    (3.53 mg/L) was provided daily and ICL-SW (0.133 mg/L) once a week. table 1 Table
    1. Nutrient composition of irrigation solution before 20% dilution. The experiment
    lasted 36 days and included two treatments: (i) ample irrigation (till pot reaches
    pot water capacity ∼0.25 cm3/cm3) that aimed to provide non-stressed conditions
    for the plants throughout the experiment (termed well-irrigated plants), (ii)
    controlled drought (days 13–30; for details, see section “Experimental Setup”
    below) preceded by a period of ample irrigation, noted as pretreatment (days 1–12),
    and followed by resumption of ample irrigation (recovery period) (see Figure 2B
    and section “Experimental Setup,” for details). The treatments included ICL-SW,
    ICL-NewFo1 or no biostimulants (control). Overall, we had six different experimental
    groups: three with ample irrigation (control–well irrigated, ICL-SW–well irrigated
    and ICL-NewFo1–well irrigated) and three groups subjected to drought (control–drought,
    ICL-SW–drought, and ICL-NewFo1–drought). Each of these groups consisted of 8–12
    repetitions (plants) that were arranged in a randomized fashion on the array to
    ensure uniform exposure of all groups, thereby overcoming the inherent variations
    in ambient conditions (Figure 1B). figure 2 Figure 2. Atmospheric conditions and
    experimental progress represented as system relative weight throughout the experiment.

    (PAR) during 36 consecutive days of experiment. (B) Raw data showing variation
    in the weight of the plants (relative to their respective initial weight) over
    the course of the experiment. Each line represents one plant/pot. During the day,
    the plant transpires and therefore the system loses weight, seen as a slope in
    the line curves. The pots were irrigated four times per night (each time to pot
    capacity), seen as peaks in the line curves. The irrigation was followed by drainage
    to reach water saturation (nighttime baseline). Note that there is no weight loss
    during the night. The increase in the nighttime baseline (dashed line) every day
    results from an increase in plant biomass. During pretreatment, all of the plants
    were well irrigated; from day 13, half of the plants were exposed to differential
    drought to reach a similar degree of stress, while the other half continued to
    be well-irrigated till the end of the experiment. On day 31, the water-deprived
    plants were recovered and continued to be well-irrigated till the end of the experiment.
    The three colored lines represent a single plant from each of the three groups:
    blue line – untreated (with biostimulants) control plants; green line – ICL-SW-treated
    plants; orange line – ICL-NewFo1-treated plants. Note the different drought-response
    behaviors of the different plants. The inset figure presents system relative weight
    change of one plant/pot for two consecutive days. Experimental Setup The experimental
    setup was generally similar to Halperin et al. (2017) with some modifications.
    Briefly, before the start of the experiment, all load-cell units were calibrated
    for reading accuracy and drift level under constant load weights (1 and 5 kg).
    Sand was used as the growing substrate because (i) it is an inert substance (sand
    is free of any nutrients, helping to precisely understand the effect of any chemical
    applied externally through irrigation), (ii) it is easily washed off the roots
    (helping to study the roots after the completion of the experiment), and (iii)
    pot capacity is reached rapidly with a repeatable pattern after each irrigation
    (at the end of free drainage), helping to study the plants’ short-term resilience
    trait, noted as “night water reabsorption” (see section “Measurement of Quantitative
    Physiological Traits” for details). The sand in all of the pots was washed thoroughly
    several times prior to transfer of the seedlings. Each pot was placed into a Plantarray
    plastic drainage container on a lysimeter. The container fit the pot size to prevent
    evaporation. The container has orifices on its side walls at different heights
    to enable different water levels after drainage of excess water following irrigation.
    Evaporation from the sand surface was prevented by a plastic cover with a circle
    cut out at its center through which the plants grew. Each pot was irrigated by
    multi-outlet dripper assemblies (Netafim, Israel) that were pushed into the soil
    to ensure that the medium in the pot was uniformly wetted at the end of the free
    drainage period following each irrigation event. Irrigations were programmed to
    run during the night in four consecutive pulses. A 2-h interval was maintained
    between the first irrigation pulse and the last three. This irrigation regime
    enabled determining the plants’ night water reabsorption, one of the traits indicating
    plant resilience (see section “Measurement of Quantitative Physiological Traits”).
    The amount of water left in the drainage containers underneath the pots at the
    end of the irrigation events was intended to provide water to the well-irrigated
    plants beyond the water volume at pot capacity. The associated monotonic weight
    decrease throughout the day hours was essential for the calculation of the different
    physiological traits by the data-analysis algorithms. The drought treatment started
    on day 13 and ended when the plants’ daily transpiration had reached ∼65 mL per
    day on an average, i.e., ∼30% of the daily transpiration before the start of drought.
    At this point the plants showed severe dehydration phenotype with drooping turgor-less
    leaves (Supplementary Figure 2) when the recovery phase started with ample irrigation.
    To prevent rapid depletion of the water during the drought phase, gradual deficit
    irrigation was implemented. The irrigation at any day was 80% of the transpiration
    during the previous day. This irrigation regime was feasible owing to the Plantarray’s
    automated feedback irrigation system (Figure 2B) that enables to control irrigation
    for each pot in the array. Measurement of Quantitative Physiological Traits The
    following water-relations kinetics and quantitative physiological traits of the
    plants were determined simultaneously, following Halperin et al.’s (2017) protocols
    and equations implemented in the SPAC-analytics software: daily transpiration,
    transpiration rate, normalized transpiration (E), transpiration rate vs. calculated
    VWC using a piecewise linear fit, and WUE. Cumulative daily transpiration was
    calculated as the sum of daily transpiration for all 36 days of the experiment.
    The VWC in the sand medium was calculated by a mass balance between the system
    weight at pot capacity when free drainage ceases and its concurrent weight. The
    estimated plant weight at the beginning of the experiment was calculated as the
    difference between the total system weight and the sum of the tare weight of pot
    + drainage container, weight of soil at pot capacity, and weight of water in the
    drainage container at the end of the free drainage. The plant weight at the end
    of a growth period (calculated plant weight) was calculated as the sum of the
    initial plant weight and the multiplication of the cumulative transpiration during
    the period by the WUE. The latter, determined as the ratio between the daily weight
    gain and the daily transpiration during that day, was calculated automatically
    on a daily basis by the SPAC-analytics software. Note that the WUE approached
    a constant value during the pretreatment period. The plant’s recovery from drought
    was described by the rate at which the plant gained weight following resumption
    of irrigation (recovery stage). The physiological trait representing the plant’s
    transpiration recovery from drought was determined as the ratio between the slope
    of the daily transpiration increase during the recovery phase (recovery slope)
    and the slope of the daily transpiration decrease during the drought period (stress
    degree). The night water reabsorption trait was determined as the difference in
    system weight between the end of the last and first irrigations of a given irrigation
    event (i.e., single night), representing the water absorbed by the plant during
    the very short period when transpiration is practically negligible. This calculation
    is based on the fact that the drainage of surplus water in sand is rapid and pot
    capacity is reached prior to the subsequent irrigation (Supplementary Figure 3).
    We considered the plants’ short-term water reabsorption capability during the
    recovery stage to be an additional physiological trait representing the plant’s
    resilience to drought. Note that the water reabsorption by the plant during the
    night hours was normalized to its weight. The recovery stage lasted 6 days, after
    which the experiment was stopped. As pepper is an indeterminate plant, it did
    not reach its full yield capacity. Consequently, the experiment was terminated
    at this stage as the treatment conducted to that point had a direct effect on
    the existing fruit. The shoots and fruit were harvested from ∼10-week-old plants,
    irrespective of their size, in the early morning hours. The fresh shoot weight
    was calculated by the system as the difference in actual gravimetric weight between
    the day of shoot harvest at 0400 h (at the end of the last irrigation) and the
    following day at the same time. The fruit were collected from the harvested shoot
    and counted. The fruit and shoots (without fruit) were weighed when a constant
    weight had been reached during drying in a hot air oven at 60°C. The roots were
    collected from the pots, washed thoroughly to remove the sand particles, and dried
    in a hot air oven at 60°C until no further reduction in weight was measured, and
    finally weighed. The total dry plant weight is the sum of dry shoot weight, dry
    root weight, and dry fruit weight. Statistical Analysis The distribution of data
    was checked using the Shapiro–Wilk test and was found that not all data were normally
    distributed. Kruskal–Wallis (Wilcoxon) test, Steel–Dwass test and Wilcoxon pairwise
    test were used to compare groups. Heteroscedasticity (White) test was done for
    the distribution of residuals. With p-value > 0.05, linear regression was performed,
    or else Spearman’s rank correlation. All analysis was done using JMP Pro 14, Excel,
    and XLSTAT software. P-value of < 0.05 was considered as statistical significance.
    Results A randomized experimental design was performed to quantitatively compare
    the impacts of two biostimulants (seaweed extract ICL-SW and metabolite formula
    ICL-NewFo1) on the plant’s key physiological traits. The effects of the two biostimulants
    were compared to controls (no biostimulant) under two irrigation scenarios: (i)
    well irrigated, and (ii) drought stress starting with a well-irrigated period,
    then a controlled drought phase and a successive recovery period (Figure 2B).
    Biostimulants Affect Plant Water Loss Daily transpiration increased gradually
    for all six groups during the well-irrigated period (pretreatment; Figure 3A).
    Conversely, daily transpiration and VWC in the pot gradually decreased throughout
    the drought period that started on day 13 of the experiment (Figures 3A,B, respectively).
    Daily transpiration and VWC increased sharply upon irrigation resumption on day
    31 of the experiment (recovery period) (Figures 3A,B, respectively). The physiological
    drought point (defined as the soil VWC value that begins to limit transpiration
    rate [critical VWC, θcritical (θc)]) was determined for the plants subjected to
    drought (Figure 3C). A θc = 0.15 was obtained for the control and two biostimulant
    treatments, but due to the different pattern of VWC decrease in the ICL-SW-treated
    plants compared to the other two groups (Figure 3B), they reached θc on different
    days. The θc for the control and ICL-NewFo1-treated plants was reached on day
    22.5, and on day 21 for the ICL-SW-treated plants (Figures 3B,C). The impact of
    drought on the daily transpiration rate pattern of the treated and untreated plants
    relative to that of the three well-irrigated groups is illustrated in Figure 3D
    for days 27–29, revealing that the ICL-SW-treated plants experienced a significantly
    lower midday (between 1200 and 1400 h) transpiration rate under drought but reached
    a significantly higher transpiration rate under full irrigation (Figure 3E). Under
    ample irrigation, the ICL-NewFo1-treated plants had intermediate transpiration
    rate between control and ICL-SW-treated plants, and a similar reduction in transpiration
    rate under drought (Figure 3E). figure 3 Figure 3. Effect of biostimulants on

    of A, B, D, the p-values from Steel–Dwass test are in the Supplementary Tables
    1–3, respectively. Each mean ± SE is from at least eight plants per group. Biostimulants
    Enhance Biomass and WUE Transpiration was normalized to biomass by using the calculated
    plant weight for the entire experimental period (36 days) for all six groups (Figure
    4A). The rate of plant weight gain during the well-irrigated period (pretreatment)
    was similar for all six groups, and decreased during the drought period for the
    three drought-stressed groups. The rate of weight gain for the latter groups began
    to increase again during the recovery period (Figure 4A). Nevertheless, the higher
    rate of weight gain for the ICL-SW-treated plants during this latter period resulted
    in significantly higher dry shoot biomass than for controls at the end of the
    experiment, probably due to the cumulative effect of this trend (Figure 4B). The
    correlation between shoot dry biomass and cumulative daily transpiration, which
    is, in fact, the dry-weight-related WUE, was relatively high (R2 > 0.8) for both
    the well-irrigated and water-deprived plants (Figure 4C). Despite the fact that
    the transpiration rate of ICL-SW-treated plants was higher, their transpiration
    normalized to plant weight, E (Figure 4D), was similar to that of the untreated
    controls under well-irrigated condition. Here again, the ICL-SW-treated plants
    showed significantly lowest midday E under drought (in accordance with the transpiration
    rate, Figure 3E). The higher measured transpiration rates (Figure 3E) and higher
    dry shoot biomass (Figure 4B) for the biostimulant-treated plants compared to
    the controls under ample irrigation indicate an improvement in fresh weight-related
    WUE. However, this improvement (increase of ∼18% for ICL-SW-treated and ∼14% for
    ICL-NewFo1-treated plants) was not significant (Figure 4E). figure 4 Figure 4.

    Heteroscedasticity (White) test was done (Supplementary Table 5) for the distribution
    of residuals in C. The test showed p-value > 0.05, therefore linear regression
    was performed. Biostimulant Effect on Plant Resilience The two considered traits
    for an estimation of the plants’ recovery from drought stress, i.e., resilience,
    were: (i) whole-plant transpiration recovery: the rate at which the daily transpiration
    increases following irrigation resumption was compared to the rate at which the
    daily transpiration decreases during the drought period. For the sake of simplicity,
    Figure 5A shows the data points for both rates, revealing that ICL-SW reduced
    plant resilience compared to control and ICL-NewFo1-treated plants (Figure 5B);
    (ii) the night water reabsorption (namely, regaining the water that was lost during
    the day; see Supplementary Figure 3) for the pretreatment and recovery periods,
    depicted in Figures 5C–F, respectively. The night water reabsorption during the
    pretreatment period was significantly higher for the biostimulant-treated plants
    compared to the control, with the highest values for the ICL-NewFo1-treated plants
    (Figure 5C). The drought stress reduced night water reabsorption capability during
    recovery for all three groups. Nevertheless, compared to the control, the biostimulants
    improved the reabsorption capability during recovery, with significantly highest
    capability for ICL-NewFo1-treated plants (Figure 5E). A similar trend was observed
    when the night water reabsorption was normalized to the plant weight, with significantly
    highest reabsorption capability in ICL-NewFo1-treated plants compared to the control
    (Figures 5D,F). figure 5 Figure 5. Effect of biostimulants on plant resilience

    Groups were compared using Kruskal–Wallis (Wilcoxon) and Steel–Dwass test within

    above bars represent significant differences. “*” indicates significant difference
    between a pair of groups compared using Wilcoxon pairwise analysis. Each mean
    ± SE is from at least eight plants per group. Biostimulant Effect on Fruit Number
    As pepper plants are indeterminate, we decided to terminate the experiment shortly
    after recovery, despite the fact that full fruit weight potential had not been
    reached. Nevertheless, at this stage, fruit set in all groups was assumed to reflect
    the treatment, as seen in the distribution of the three different fruit sizes
    (small, medium, and commercial) (Supplementary Figure 4). For the well-irrigated
    plants, 33% of the control fruit reached a commercial size, compared to only 19%
    of ICL-SW-treated and 14% of ICL-NewFo1-treated plants’ fruit. The total number
    of fruit was counted for all six groups and correlated to cumulative daily transpiration
    (Figure 6). ICL-SW enhanced the total fruit number under ample irrigation; however,
    the ICL-SW-treated plants were significantly affected by the drought relative
    to their well-irrigated condition (Figure 6A). As similar results were observed
    for the transpiration rate of these treated plants (Figure 3E), we calculated
    the correlation between total fruit number and cumulative daily transpiration.
    The correlation for well-irrigated plants was slightly better (R2 = 0.5) than
    that for plants subjected to drought (Figure 6B). figure 6 Figure 6. Effect of

    Discussion Advantages of the HFPS in Pre-field Screening for Promising Candidates
    and Effective Treatments Most high-throughput phenotyping facilities are based
    on remote sensing or imagers (Araus et al., 2018), and are expected to show improved
    temporal phenotypic resolution. However, their effective spatial resolution is
    still relatively limited to morphological and indirect physiological traits. In
    addition, measurements are not taken simultaneously; given the fact that the plant
    response to a dynamic environment is dynamic, simultaneous measurements are needed
    for comparative analyses. Thus, the selection of candidates and treatments for
    testing remains a challenge. High-throughput phenotyping platforms in greenhouses
    have the advantage of characterizing individual pot-grown plants without the constraints
    imposed by overlapping canopies from neighboring plants or variable climatic conditions
    that can hamper data-acquisition accuracy (Fernandez et al., 2017). Although an
    effective approach would be to screen biostimulants for their mode of action from
    “field to greenhouse,” the “greenhouse-to-field” approach is not only time- and
    cost-effective but also narrows the number of products to be tested later under
    field conditions (Rouphael et al., 2018). On the other hand, the accuracy of controlled
    growth environments in targeting genetically complex traits is questionable, as
    phenotypes from spaced pots and controlled conditions are poorly correlated with
    phenotypes in field environments, where plants compete with their neighbors (Nelissen
    et al., 2014; Poorter et al., 2016; Fernandez et al., 2017; Fischer and Rebetzke,
    2018; Rebetzke et al., 2018). We suggest that to better correlate a plant’s response
    to its environment, it is important to phenotype under conditions that are as
    similar as possible to those in the field. Thus, an efficient pre-field phenotype-screening
    experiment should offer the possibility to predict yield penalties in response
    to environmental adversity in the early stages of plant growth. Choice of the
    appropriate phenotyping method is one of the key components in pre-field screens
    (phenotyping) for complex traits under abiotic stress conditions (reviewed by
    Negin and Moshelion, 2017). This improves the chances of the selected candidates
    performing well under field conditions. The following principles, tested in this
    study, may contribute to this goal. (i) Conducting experiments under semi-controlled
    conditions that are typical of farmers’ growing facilities (see Figure 2A). The
    spaces between the pots were kept to a minimum to mimic commercial growth conditions.
    (ii) Using a truly randomized experimental design to mimic the biological variability,
    as well as the spatial and temporal variability in ambient conditions in the growth
    facility. Here, we used a randomized experimental design with one-to-one (1:1)
    plant–[sensors+controller] units which enabled running an independent feedback
    irrigation scenario for every plant (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1). Each
    controller was associated with a dual-valve system that allowed creating a specific
    combination of irrigation scenarios independently for each plant. Moreover, it
    overcame many of the experimental artifacts that could result from the “pot effect”
    (Gosa et al., 2018) by using controlled-deficit irrigation that reduced the irrigation
    levels every day to 80% of the previous day’s transpiration (for each plant separately
    and based on its individual performance), preventing rapid reduction in pot soil
    water content. This created a relatively homogeneous drought scenario for all
    plants (Figure 2). (iii) Conducting comparative and continuous measurements for
    all plants’ water-relations kinetics (direct physiological traits such as daily
    transpiration, transpiration rate, plant transpiration normalized to plant weight
    (E), calculated plant weight, water use efficiency, night water reabsorption,
    resilience, etc.) in response to the three-phase scenario (control–drought–recovery).
    This experimental approach offered several advantages in interpreting the plant’s
    interactions with the environment as it compared each plant’s profile to its own
    profile in the different phases (Figure 3A) as well as to all other plants’ profiles
    in the experiment, simultaneously. Moreover, clarity of the stress conditions,
    providing the ability to repeat the exact stress scenario in other experiments,
    is also important when studying a desired stress-related trait. The trait in question
    might respond differently in plants showing different types of drought tolerance
    under different drought conditions (Negin and Moshelion, 2017). Therefore, for
    better resolution of the drought response in pot experiments, the severity and
    strategy of the drought stress must be well defined. To achieve a quantitative
    and cooperative response of the plants to a combination of biostimulants and drought
    treatment, we divided the experiment into three phases: before drought (pretreatment),
    during drought which was defined by the physiological drought point (θc), and
    recovery immediately after drought (resilience). (iv) High temporal and spatial
    resolution of the plant–environment interactions. The ultimate trait, yield, is
    a cumulative trait, measured at the end of the experiment and reflecting the sum
    of all genetic and ambient parameters affecting the plant throughout the season.
    This calls for high temporal resolution and continuous measurement of the dynamic
    plant–environment response. The high-capacity data acquisition (480 measurements
    per day) of the HFPS enabled tight measurements of the plant’s response to the
    ambient conditions, and also comparing plant performances at different time points
    during the day (i.e., different ambient conditions), where the differences between
    the treatments became significant (Figures 3D,E). In this study, we show that
    the HFPS might be an efficient diagnostic tool for a better understanding of pre-field
    plant × environment interactions by studying water-related physiological mechanisms
    under different phases of control–drought–recovery scenarios. In this pursuit,
    we used biostimulants as a test case due to their reported impact on the plant
    stress response (Van Oosten et al., 2017). Nevertheless, information on the influence
    of biostimulants on physiological mechanisms of action is relatively scarce. Moreover,
    the use of biostimulants, as with other biotic and abiotic screening studies,
    is highly complex, and thus identification and characterization of their activity
    is time-consuming and expensive, as it requires large-scale field experiments.
    The combination of the two types of treatment (biostimulants and drought) enabled
    us to evaluate the benefits of the HFPS in investigating the mechanistic effect
    of biostimulants in drought tolerance. Quantitative Comparison to Understand the
    Interactions Between Key Physiological Traits and Their Trade-Offs Both biostimulants
    increased plant transpiration rate under ample irrigation compared to control
    plants (Figure 3). However, while the impact of ICL-SW translated to productive
    mechanisms (faster growth rate and later, higher fruit number), the impact of
    ICL-NewFo1 translated to resilience mechanisms (lower transpiration rate under
    drought and faster recovery – i.e., better resilience). Interestingly, the sensitivity
    of the plants to drought in terms of the critical VWC drought point (θc), at which
    a further reduction in water content reduces transpiration, remained the same,
    possibly due to similar root sizes (Supplementary Figure 5). This is because under
    water-deficit conditions, when water becomes less available to the roots, plants
    with smaller roots will be limited more quickly (early θc) than plants with larger
    roots (reviewed by Gosa et al., 2018). Thus θc might be useful in predicting root
    phenotype. Nevertheless, as soon as the plants were exposed to drought, the two
    biostimulants induced different response patterns (beyond θc): ICL-NewFo1 treatment
    resulted in a gradual reduction in transpiration rate, reaching a minimum at a
    relatively lower VWC than the control and ICL-SW-treated plants (Figure 3C). Again,
    this type of behavior could explain the better resilience of the ICL-NewFo1-treated
    plants during the drought period. In addition, the functional phenotyping approach
    revealed good correlations among key agronomical traits within the short study
    period. For example, our results revealed a high correlation between plant total
    dry weight and plant weight calculated by the system (Supplementary Figure 6).
    The fact that the system can calculate the plant biomass throughout the experiment
    is highly beneficial as it enables a direct measurement of the whole-plant biomass
    gain, in real-time and in a non-destructive manner. In addition, key agronomic
    traits (such as grain yield) are linearly correlated to water consumption (WUE,
    reviewed by Gosa et al., 2018). Indeed the plant agronomic WUE (slope of dry biomass
    versus the cumulative transpiration, both from the end of the experiment; Figure
    4C) was similar to the fresh-weight WUE calculated from the first few days of
    the experiment (Figure 4E). Namely, ∼0.003 g of plant dry weight per 1 mL of transpired
    water vs. ∼0.035 g of plant fresh weight per 1 mL of transpired water, respectively,
    showing a ratio of ∼1:10, which is similar to the ratio between the fresh and
    dry shoot weight (Supplementary Figure 7). This trait is highly beneficial as
    it enables use of the fresh-weight WUE (determined on the first few days of the
    experiment), which is calculated for the entire growth period rather than the
    dry-weight WUE. Interestingly, these results also indicate that WUE is nearly
    constant throughout the growth period. Phenotyping Resilience Resilience is one
    of the key stress-response traits. Nevertheless, the term “resilience” is being
    used more and more freely, and with popularity comes confusion; thus, it must
    assume its broadest definition. Although resilience can be explained in many different
    ways, resilience is commonly used to represent resistance, or recovery, or both
    (Hodgson et al., 2015). Plant stress resilience indicates plant survival and productivity
    after stress. In this study, we chose new approaches and introduced two functional
    traits to quantify resilience: (i) Transpiration recovery rate that follows stress
    (return of irrigation), namely, transpiration resilience. (ii) The plants’ ability
    to reabsorb water at night during recovery from drought–short term resilience.
    Both the traits are strongly related to the plants’ functional integrity status,
    as any tissue damage (e.g., leaf or root desiccation, embolism, necrosis, etc.)
    will reduce the functionality of these traits. In addition, it should be noted
    that the plants with lower transpiration rate will face lower stress degree during
    the drought phase which will also contribute to their resilience, even in the
    absence of any difference in transpiration during the recovery period. To the
    best of our knowledge, this is the first time these resilience traits have been
    studied on the basis of the comparison of many plants, and might be adopted in
    the future. We found that while the biostimulants did not affect the transpiration
    recovery rate, they did increase the nighttime water reabsorption ability of both
    the well-irrigated and recovering plants, compared to the non-treated controls
    (Figures 5C,E). This phenomenon cannot be explained by the positive impact on
    the fresh biomass (Figure 4A), as normalizing the water reabsorption volume to
    the plant biomass still resulted in higher values of both biostimulant-treated
    plants compared to the non-treated control (Figures 5E,F). The difference between
    the water reabsorption of well-irrigated and recovering plants within the same
    group (i.e., control, ICL-SW, or ICL-NewFo1) indicated drought-inflicted tissue
    damage, thus the night water reabsorption trait can be used as a tool to estimate
    tissue damage due to stress. Conclusion A comparison of the effects of two biostimulants
    on drought tolerance of pepper plants using a HFPS revealed known and new relationships
    between physiological traits. The two studied biostimulants (ICL-SW and ICL-NewFo1)
    improved the overall transpiration and biomass gain compared to control plants.
    However, only ICL-SW improved fruit number (Figure 6A) under ample irrigation,
    which was significantly reduced when the plants were exposed to drought. This
    might be explained by the shift in resource allocation from the reproductive to
    non-reproductive or vegetative biomass, for survival. A schematic depiction of
    the behavior of pepper plants treated with biostimulants is given in Figure 7.
    The behavior can be explained in terms of risk-taking and non-risk-taking behavior.
    Under optimal conditions, ICL-SW-treated plants (risk-taking) sustained a longer
    period of higher transpiration rate and thus a longer period of substantial CO2
    assimilation, resulting in increased productivity (Figure 7A) compared to the
    ICL-NewFo1-treated plants. This behavior is advantageous only under well-irrigated
    conditions or during mild stress, but there is a risk of losing water faster during
    severe stress (Lin et al., 2007; Peng et al., 2007; McDowell et al., 2008; Sade
    et al., 2009; Moshelion et al., 2015). On the other hand, ICL-NewFo1-treated plants
    (non-risk-taking) maintain a moderate transpiration rate under optimal conditions,
    thus not contributing much to their productivity, but resulting in more gradual
    water loss under drought conditions, thereby reaching the minimal VWC (desiccation)
    later than the ICL-SW-treated plants, resulting in increased resilience. Thus
    there is a trade-off between productivity and resilience for the ICL-SW- and ICL-NewFo1-treated
    plants, respectively, as depicted in Figure 7B (Moshelion et al., 2015). figure
    7 Figure 7. Schematic model of plant responses to biostimulants (ICL-NewFo1 –
    orange line, ICL-SW – green line, untreated – blue line) under drought and recovery
    (modified from Moshelion et al., 2015). (A) Plant productivity vs. intensity and
    duration of stress. Under conditions characterized by an ample water supply, ICL-SW-treated
    plants have a higher transpiration level than ICL-NewFo1-treated and control plants,
    and thus higher levels of productivity (e.g., photosynthesis) (Phase I). As mild
    water stress develops (Phase II), ICL-SW-treated and control plants reduce transpiration
    steeply with decreasing water availability, limiting productivity. In contrast,
    ICL-NewFo1-treated plants show a relatively gradual decrease in transpiration
    and productivity as a trade-off to the decline in leaf water potential and relative
    water content. Nevertheless, after the initial drought (Phase II), their productivity
    may still be higher than that of ICL-SW-treated and control plants which have
    already reached minimal productivity. As drought stress becomes more severe (Phase
    III), the transpiration values and productivity of ICL-NewFo1-treated plants continue
    to decline to their minimum. (B) Evaluation of recovery from drought is an important
    step in assessing drought resilience. It reveals the plant’s resistance to severe
    dehydration and ability to recover its pre-stress productivity, reflecting the
    extent of the damage caused by severe drought, such as cavitation or leaf/root
    loss. Both the ICL-SW-treated and control plants recover slowly compared to the
    ICL-NewFo1-treated plants. ICL-NewFo1 contributes to drought resistance by inducing
    more gradual water loss and resilience, thus contributing less to plant productivity
    and more to plant resilience. However, ICL-SW induces relatively faster water
    loss, and only increases productivity under optimal conditions while having no
    effect on the resilience of the plants under drought. We suggest that these two
    different stimulation approaches should be implemented in different agricultural
    practices. As the biostimulants have been tested only for pepper plants, pre-field
    phenotyping of any plant/crop with these biostimulants prior to field use might
    be advantageous. Thus, the beneficial stimuli of ICL-SW may be implemented in
    controlled-irrigated crops, while the resilience impact of ICL-NewFo1 may be implemented
    for non-irrigated crops that are naturally subjected to the uncertainty of the
    environment. This resilience trait may also be very beneficial for annual crops
    (e.g., vines, turfs, and silviculture) which need to overcome longer stress periods
    between seasons. Author Contributions RW and MM conceived the original research

    The land use and land cover map plays a significant role in agricultural, water
    resources planning, management, and monitoring programs at regional and national
    levels and is an input to various hydrological models. Land use and land cover
    maps prepared using satellite remote sensing techniques in conjunction with landform-soil-vegetation
    relationships and ground truth are popular for locating suitable sites for the
    construction of water harvesting structures, soil and water conservation measures,
    runoff computations, irrigation planning and agricultural management, analyzing
    socio-ecological concerns, flood controlling, and overall watershed management.
    Here we use a novel approach to analyze Sentinel–2 multispectral satellite data
    using traditional and principal component analysis based approaches to evaluate
    the effectiveness of maximum likelihood estimation, random forest tree, and support
    vector machine classifiers to improve land use and land cover categorization for
    Soil Conservation Service Curve Number model. Additionally, we use stratified
    random sampling to evaluate the accuracies of resulted land use and land cover
    maps in terms of kappa coefficient, overall accuracy, producer''s accuracy, and
    user''s accuracy. The classifiers were used for classifying the data into seven
    major land use and land cover classes namely water, built-up, mixed forest, cultivated
    land, barren land, fallow land with vertisols dominance, and fallow land with
    inceptisols dominance for the Vishwamitri watershed. We find that principal component
    analysis with support vector machine is able to produce highly accurate land use
    and land cover classified maps. Principal component analysis extracts the useful
    spectral information by compressing redundant data embedded in each spectral channel.
    The study highlights the use of principal component analysis with support vector
    machine classifier to improve land use and land cover classification from which
    policymakers can make better decisions and extract basic information for policy
    amendments. Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Multivariate

    on land use and land cover (LULC) plays a key role in analyzing earth information
    for human development. It plays a significant role in planning, management, and
    monitoring programs at the local, regional, and national levels. This type of
    information, on one hand, provides a better understanding of land utilization
    aspects and on the other hand, it plays an important role in the formation of
    policies and programs required for development planning. Researchers, policymakers,
    and planners utilize land use and land cover information to determine changes
    in natural resources, including evaluating growth patterns Adeel (2010). 1.1.
    Machine-learning classification methods Empirical studies by researchers from
    diverse disciplines proved that land use and land cover information is key to
    various applications such as hydrology, agriculture, forest, environment, geology,
    and ecology Weng (2001); Hassan et al. (2016). Decades of scientific research
    have shown considerable progress towards assessing land use and land cover Turner
    et al., (2007). Numerous effective methods and advanced classifiers have been
    applied to improve the performance of land use and land cover classification that
    is based on moderate resolution data. Researchers have used various methods to
    incorporate Landsat data into land-use change analyses Ozesmi and Bauer (2002);
    Lu et al. (2004); Rundquist et al. (2001); Zhang et al. (2000). The complexity
    of the landscape, the selected remote sensing data, image processing, and classification
    methods, make it difficult to obtain reliable and accurate land use and land cover
    information Manandhar et al. (2009). Researchers have tried to overcome this problem
    from many different perspectives, with the purpose of seeking an efficient method
    for mapping LULC patterns. These studies range from conventional statistical approaches
    to more powerful machine learning algorithms that have enhanced the quality of
    the solutions for this problem. Traditional remote sensing data classification
    methods include maximum-likelihood classifier, distance measure, clustering, or
    logistic regression. Over the last decade, more advanced methods such as decision
    trees, k-nearest-neighbors, random forest, neural networks and support vector
    machines have been used for LULC mapping Yu et al. (2014); Cheng et al. (2015);
    Han et al. (2015). Recently, a study on the state of the art of supervised methods
    for land use and land cover classification was performed by Khatami et al. (2016).
    It was reported that Support Vector Machine, k-nearest-neighbors, and Random Forest
    Tree generally provide better performance than other traditional classifiers,
    SVM being the most efficient method. Support Vector Machine and Random Forest
    Tree classifiers are recent developments in the computational aspects of image
    classification. Their ability to minimize classification errors make them superior
    to the parametric classifiers such as Maximum likelihood estimation classifier
    Huang et al. (2002); Foody and Mathur (2004); Pal and Mather (2005). SVM operates
    on the principle of statistical learning theory, called structural risk minimization,
    which minimizes an upper bound on the generalization error. It aims at reaching
    the minimum of the upper bound on the error probability of the classifier by achieving
    a trade-off between the training set and the capacity. The basic approach in support
    vector machines is to identify a hyper-plane that produces an optimal separation
    between the two classes. SVM classification with a hyperplane that maximizes the
    separating margin between the two classes is shown in Fig. 1. The algorithm defines
    the multidimensional space in such a way that the gap between class clusters is
    as large as possible. The hyper-plane is developed using a subset of the data
    called the training data set and the generalizing ability of the developed hyper-plane
    is validated using an independent subset called testing data set. If the training
    dataset is not linearly separable, a kernel method is used to simulate a non-linear
    projection of the data in a higher-dimensional space, where the classes are linearly
    separable (Oommen et al. (2008); Candade and Dixon (2004)). Download : Download

    with a hyper plane that maximizes the separating margin between the two classes.
    Random Forest Tree is an ensemble bagging algorithm which is fast, easy to parameterize,
    and robust and has been frequently used for land use and land cover classification
    Belgiu and Csillik (2018); Immitzer et al. (2012); Ok et al. (2012); Scanlon et
    al. (2006); Pelletier et al. (2016). Random Forest is a general term for ensemble
    methods using tree-type classifiers, ), k = 1, …,}, where x is the input vector
    and are the independent and identically distributed random vectors Breiman (2001);
    Gislason et al. (2006); Rodriguez-Galiano et al. (2012). Hence, some data may
    be used more than once in the training of classifiers, while others might never
    be used. Thus, greater classifier stability is achieved, as it makes it more robust
    when facing slight variations in input data and, at the same time, it increases
    classification accuracy. The trees are created by drawing a subset of training
    samples through replacement (a bagging approach). The random forest classifier
    consists of N trees, where N is the number of trees to be grown, which can be
    any value defined by the user. To classify a new dataset, each case of the datasets
    is passed down to each of the N trees. The forest chooses a class having the most
    out of N votes, for that case. Furthermore, when the RF makes a tree grow, it
    uses the best split of a random subset of input features or predictive variables
    in the division of every node, instead of using the best split variables. Therefore,
    this can decrease the strength of every single tree, but it reduces the correlation
    between the trees, which reduces the generalization error. The generalization
    error converges as the number of trees increases, therefore, the RF does not over
    fit the data. The output of the classifier is determined by a majority vote of
    the trees. The use of machine-learning classification methods for land use and
    land cover extraction has become a major focus of the remote-sensing literature
    Ghimire et al. (2012). Machine-learning algorithms are generally able to model
    complex class signatures, can accept a variety of input training data, and do
    not make assumptions about the data distribution (i.e. nonparametric). A wide
    range of studies has generally found that these methods tend to produce higher
    accuracy compared to traditional parametric classifiers, especially for complex
    data with a high-dimensional feature space, i.e. many predictor variables Pal
    and Mather (2005); Ghimire et al. (2012). Despite the increasing acceptance of
    machine-learning classifiers, parametric methods appear still to be commonly used
    in the applications and remain one of the major standards for benchmarking classification
    experiments. 1.2. Curve number (CN) Land use and land cover map is indispensable
    in water resources planning, management and monitoring programs at regional and
    national levels, and required as an input to various hydrological models. One
    of the most widely used models for calculating surface runoff in a watershed,
    developed by the Soil Conservation Service, uses storm rainfall and a curve number.
    National Resources Conservation Service (NRSC), United States Department of Agriculture
    (USDA) developed the Soil Conservation Service-Curve Number (SCS–CN) method in
    1969. The method is simple, user-friendly, stable, and useful for ungauged watersheds.
    According to the National Engineering Handbook NRCS (2009), soils are divided
    into four Hydrologic soil groups (HSGs), A, B, C, and D, and three dual classes,
    A/D, B/D, and C/D. Hydrologic soil groups are fundamental component of the SCS-CN
    method for the estimation of rainfall-runoff. HSG-A has the lowest runoff potential
    (typically contains more than 90% sand and less than 10% clay), HSG-B has moderately
    low runoff potential (typically contains between 10 to 20% clay and 50–90% sand),
    HSG-C has moderately high runoff potential (typically contains between 20 to 40%
    clay and less than 50% sand), and HSG-D has high runoff potential (typically contains
    more than 40% clay and less than 50% sand) Ross et al. (2018). A curve number
    is a quantitative descriptor of the land use/land cover and soil complex Slack
    and Welch (1980). The curve number grid is a raster containing curve number values
    assigned to each grid cell of land use/land cover and soil complex to indicate
    their specific runoff potential. The curve number can represent an average value
    for a watershed or an individual cell for a grid-based watershed. The curve number
    reflects the catchment characteristics like soil type, land-use, and antecedent
    moisture conditions Walega and Salata (2019); Ajmal et al. (2015); Harmel et al.,
    (2018); Epps et al. (2013). The SCS-CN model has been integrated into many widely
    used hydrological models such as Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) Neitsch
    et al. (2011) and Hydrologic Modeling System (HEC-HMS) Feldman (2000) to simulate
    surface runoff. Suribabu and Bhaskar (2015) used the SCS-CN method to estimate
    runoff using continuous time series rainfall and Indian remote sensing satellite
    data and presented a land-use factor based on the curve number to correct the
    infiltration rate according to the prevailing land use and land cover. The Hydrologic
    Engineering Center''s Geospatial Hydrologic Modeling Extension (HEC-GeoHMS) is
    extension to ESRI''s ArcGIS software that compute the curve number and other loss
    rate parameters based on various soil and land use/land cover databases. 1.3.
    Principal component analysis (PCA) PCA is a statistical procedure that transforms
    the input bands (with correlated variables) orthogonally from an input multivariate
    attribute space to a new multivariate attribute space (having linearly uncorrelated
    variables) whose axes are rotated with respect to each other. Transformation or
    dimensionality reduction of the data in the analysis compresses data by eliminating
    noise, redundancy, and irrelevant information. The linearly uncorrelated variables
    in new multivariate attribute space are called principal components. The first
    principal component (PC1 derived from the first eigenvector) is the direction
    in space along which projections have the largest variance. The subsequent principal
    component (PC2) is the direction that maximizes variance among all directions
    orthogonal to the previous principal component. The variances of the remaining
    principal component images decrease in order, as denoted by the magnitudes of
    the corresponding eigenvalues Li and Yeh (1998); Deng et al. (2008). Recent studies
    have investigated PCA-based methods for cloud extraction scheme for multi-spectral
    images (Wu and Han (2019)). Researchers have tried to manage imperfections in
    multivariate sensed data by using various PCA-based approaches. A PCA–OLS model
    was used by Firozjaei et al. (2019) for assessing the impact of surface biophysical
    parameters on land surface temperature variations. Massetti and Gil (2020), and
    Abdu (2019) employed PCA for classification accuracy and trend assessments of
    land cover/land use changes. Chen (2020) used PCA of Sentinel-2 to map the mangrove
    of Dongzhaigang, China. In this study, PCA is used to condense the information
    of high-dimensional Sentinel–2 multispectral satellite data into fewer channels
    (represented by the higher-order components) and use the principal components
    as inputs to the classifiers, thus reducing the computational demands and possibly
    improving performance. The present study developed an approach to analyze Sentinel–2
    satellite images using traditional and principal component analysis based approaches
    to create land use and land cover map, which is a prerequisite for developing
    the curve number. The study shows the performances of state-of-the-art classification
    methods, the Maximum Likelihood Estimation, Random Forest Tree, and Support Vector
    Machine tested on Sentinel–2 multispectral satellite data in order to observe
    if principal component analysis improves land use and land cover classification.
    Moreover, the application of land use and land cover map to create a curve number
    grid is shown. 2. Study area and data collection The present study was conducted
    in the Vishwamitri Watershed in Vadodara district, Gujarat. Vadodara district
    is located at the south of the Tropic of Cancer in the transition zone of heavy
    rainfall areas of South Gujarat and arid areas of North Gujarat plains. It has
    a subtropical climate with moderate humidity and forms a part of the great Gujarat
    plain. The eastern portion of the district is hilly terrain with several ridges,
    plateaus, and isolated relict hills with an elevation of 150–481 m above the mean
    sea level. The Vishwamitri river originates from the hills of Pavagadh, 43 km
    northeast of Vadodara. The Pavagadh hill is made of trappean rocks that emerge
    abruptly 830 m above the mean sea level. The Viswamitri river has a channel length
    of around 70 km, of which, 58 km flows through the Vadodara district. It meets
    the Dhadhar river at Pingalwada in the Vadodara district. Fig. 2 shows the geographical

    European Space Agency''s Sentinel–2 Multispectral Imager measures the reflected
    solar spectral radiances in 13 spectral bands ranging from the visible to the
    shortwave infrared bands Pahlevan et al. (2017). The primary purpose is to monitor
    vegetation, water bodies, cropland, urban areas, land use, and land cover change
    at local, regional, national, and global scales. Sentinel–2A and –2B can together
    revisit the same region every five days with data acquisitions available in Level
    1C processing, Table 1 shows the band characteristics of Sentinel–2 data. Table

    in the study are given in Table 2. Bands 1, 9, and 10 at 60 m resolution are dedicated
    mainly to atmospheric corrections and cirrus-cloud screening. As they do not contain
    surface information, those 3 bands were omitted after the pre-processing phase
    from the analysis. Table 2. Data characteristics of Cartosat DEM and Sentinel–2

    Soil data based on soil texture collected from (NBSS & LUP). 3. Methodology Geographic
    Information System with imported Cartosat Digital Elevation Model was used for
    watershed delineation as suggested by Gajalakshmi and Anantharama (2015); Patel
    et al. (2016); Rana and Suryanarayana (2019). ESRI''s ArcGIS Desktop 10.5 software
    was used to carry out the watershed delineation. ArcGIS is used for creating and
    using maps, compiling geographic data, analyzing mapped information, sharing and
    discovering geographic information, using maps and geographic information in a
    range of applications, and managing geographic information in a database. In order
    to remove small imperfections in the DEM data, the fill sink tool was used. A
    sink is a cell in DEM that does not have an associated drainage value. The direction
    that water will flow from that particular cell based on the underlying topography
    of the landscape. A raster of the flow direction from each pixel to its downslope
    neighbors is created by the flow-direction tool. Flow accumulations locate cells
    with high flow where streams and channels are to be expected. The accumulated
    flow as the accumulated weight of all pixels flowing into each downslope pixel
    in the output raster is calculated by the flow accumulation tool. A stream network
    was delineated by applying a threshold value to the flow accumulation raster.
    The point on the surface at which water flows out of an area is called the outlet
    or the pour point. Each cell has an outlet point called a pour point that indicates
    the location where water would naturally flow out of the cell. Pour points must
    be located in cells with a high cumulative flow. Fig. 4 shows the methodology
    adopted for watershed delineation. The soil data collected from the National Bureau
    of Soil Survey and Land Use Planning (NBSS & LUP) are shown in Fig. 3. Download

    Adopted methodology for watershed delineation. The Sentinel–2 cloud-free Level
    1C data product (L1C_T43QCE_A008039_20180920T054434) acquired on 20 September
    2018 was downloaded from the Sentinel Hub developed by European Space Agency.
    Sentinel–2 Level 1C data were processed from Top-Of-Atmosphere Level 1C to Bottom-Of-Atmosphere
    Level 2A. QGIS desktop 3.6.1 is a free and open-source cross-platform desktop
    geographic information system application that supports viewing, editing, and
    analysis of geospatial data. QGIS desktop 3.6.1 interface was used with Semi-Automatic
    Classification Plugin (SCP), developed by Congedo (2016), to convert the Sentinel–2
    MSI data to reflectance values and for dark object subtraction atmospheric correction
    (DOS1) of the data. After atmospheric correction, ten bands (2–8, 8A, 11, and
    12) were composited and clipped to the study area. The processed data were georeferenced
    to the WGS 84 UTM 43N projected coordinate system. In order to test the effectiveness
    of PCA, two stacks were created for the classification in ESRI''s ArcGIS Desktop
    10.5 software. Stack 1 (Fig. 7 (a)) contained atmospherically corrected bands
    (2–8, 8A, 11 and 12) and Stack 2 (Fig. 8 (a)) contained 3 major PCA bands accounting
    for the 97.96% of eigenvalues. The PCA technique was used to reduce the number
    of bands or dimensions necessary for classification. Dimension reduction leads
    to a reduction in the computation costs without compromising the desired variability
    in the data. According to Mather (2010), the process of PCA can be divided into
    three steps. The first step is to calculate the covariance or correlation matrix
    of multiband images. The covariance matrix is calculated as: CXY=Covariance between
    Band X and Band Y  = The number of pixels  = Individual pixel value vectors of
    Band X  = Mean of Band X  = Individual pixel value vectors of Band Y  = Mean of
    Band Y The diagonal elements of the covariance matrix are the band variances,
    and the off-diagonals are band covariances. If a correlation matrix is used instead
    of a covariance matrix, each entry in C should be further divided by the product
    of the standard deviations of the features represented by the corresponding row
    and column. RXY = Correlation between Band X and Band Y  = Covariance between
    Band X and Band Y  = Standard deviations of Band X  = Standard deviations of Band
    Y The second step is to calculate the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. Following
    equation is used for the calculation:  = Covariance matrix  = Eigenvector  = Identity
    matrix  = Eigenvalue The normalized eigenvectors of the covariance or correlation
    matrix form the new coordinate system. The mapping location of each pixel, X=(x1,
    x2, …, xk) on the ith principal component is given by which shows the rotation
    of the axes of the feature space. The traditional approach and PCA based approach
    used Stack 1 and Stack 2, respectively, as inputs for land use and land cover
    classification. The training data were collected based on the manual interpretation
    of the original Sentinel–2 data and DigitalGlobe''s WorldView-4 high-resolution
    imagery and was kept the same for all the three classifiers to avoid the optimistic
    bias in classification. The training sample size was kept below 1000 pixels per
    class to evaluate the influence of the training sample size, as well as the performance
    of classification algorithms. Training data for each land use and land cover class
    were collected as a group of pixels. The input data and corresponding ground truth
    data (training sample) were used to train the classifiers. The classifiers learn
    the complex relationships between the input and ground truth data (training sample).
    To determine the accuracy of each classification and class, a thematic accuracy
    assessment was performed. For this purpose, firstly a reference data set including
    a total of 100 points was created. Stratified random sampling was used with 100
    points to obtain the ground truth data from the manual interpretation of the original
    10 m resolution Sentinel–2 data (Band 2, 3 and 4) and DigitalGlobe''s WorldView-4
    data (Product Id: 1ba34688-3ee0-41e4-9187-de68fdb075df-inv) acquired on 25-10-2018
    at 5:30 a.m. with 31 cm resolution. The results of the classifications were not
    post-processed (e.g., filtered). The classification maps were evaluated in terms
    of their overall accuracy (OA), producer''s accuracy (PA), user''s accuracy (UA),
    and the Kappa index of agreement (k) or Kappa coefficient and a confusion matrix
    was created. The key element of a quantitative accuracy assessment is the creation
    of a confusion matrix (Congalton, 2001; Janssen and Vanderwel, 1994; Story and
    Congalton, 1986; Vikas and Suryanarayana, 2019). The confusion matrix is represented
    by a table that shows the correspondence between the classification result and
    a reference image assigned to a particular category, which is relative to the
    actual category as indicated by the reference data. The producer''s accuracy is
    the probability that value in a given class was correctly classified. User''s
    accuracy is the probability that a value predicted to be in a certain class is
    really in that class. The kappa coefficient measures the agreement between classification
    and truth-values. A kappa value of 1 represents a perfect agreement, while a value
    of 0 represents no agreement. The Overall accuracy is given by the ratio of the
    proportion of the correctly classified pixels to the total number of pixels in
    the confusion matrix. The land use and land cover maps were later used in HEC-GeoHMS
    for the integration of land use land cover and soil data for curve number grid
    preparation. A logical condition was defined in ArcGIS to generate the curve number
    raster from the raster files of hydrologic soil group and land use and land cover
    using TR-55 table Feldman (2000). The tables provide estimates of the curve number
    as a function of hydrologic soil group, cover type, treatment, hydrologic condition,
    antecedent runoff condition, and impervious area in the catchment. Selected curve
    number values for the study area is given in Table 3. Table 3. Selected curve

    is to delineate and measure the drainage area tributary to the point of analysis
    (delineation methodology is shown in Fig. 4). The potential maximum soil retention
    is then calculated using the following formula: where S is in mm, and CN is the
    curve number (dimensionless). SCS-CN assumes that, for a single storm event, potential
    maximum soil retention is equal to the ratio of direct run-off to available rainfall.
    This relationship, after algebraic manipulation and inclusion of simplifying assumptions,
    results in the following expression: Q = direct run-off depth P = total rainfall  =
    initial abstraction and S can be related using the following equation:  = λ S
    λ = 0.2 was assumed in the original SCS-CN model The interest of the study was
    to analyze Sentinel–2 data using traditional and PCA based approaches to create
    land use and land cover map, which is a prerequisite for developing the curve
    number grid. Hence, the runoff computation is not shown in the study. 4. Results
    and discussion The principal component analysis was used for data compression
    of Sentinel-2 multispectral data to statistically maximize the amount of information
    from the original data (bands) to a smaller number of components, called principal
    components. The first few principal components possess most of the variability
    of the data. The first principal component band derived from the first eigenvector
    had the maximum amount of the total variance of the Sentinel–2 data set containing
    bands 2–8, 8A, 11, and 12. The first three principal component bands accounted
    for 97.92% of eigenvalues. The variances percentage of the remaining principal
    component bands decreased in the order of the corresponding eigenvalues. The variance
    of the PCA bands 4 to 10 is small and mostly had noises; thus the bands were removed
    from the analysis. The eigenvalues and accumulative percentage of eigenvalues
    in PCA bands 2–8, 8A, 11, and 12 are given in Table 5. A loading plot shows how
    strongly each band influences a principal component. It ranges from −1 to 1. Loadings
    close to −1 or 1 indicate that the band strongly influences the component. Loadings
    close to 0 indicate that the band has a weak influence on the component. Fig.
    5 shows the loading plot of the bands. It can be seen that bands 6–8A have large
    positive loadings on component 1. While bands 2–5 and 11–12 have large positive
    loadings on component 2. Factor loading shows how much each band has contributed
    to the factor. Rescaled factor loadings of the principal components from the original
    (raw) image data are as shown in Table 6. Bands 6–8A (Vegetation Red Edge and
    near-infrared bands are highly correlated, Table 4) loaded highly in the first
    principal component, bands 2–5 and 11–12 (highly correlated), loaded highly (positively)
    in principal component 2, and Band 2-5 marginally loaded onto principal component
    3. Principal component 4–10 can be termed as noise components since no factor
    loading is prominent. It has been observed that deciduous plants have a sharp
    order-of-magnitude increase in leaf reflectance between approximately 700 to 750
    nm wavelength and healthy vegetation reflects highly in near-infrared band. Principal
    component 1 can be called a healthy vegetation component as it has the highest
    factor loading of 0.99 from band 7 and band 8A. However, principal component 2
    and principal component 3 can''t be generalized as loading is scattered across
    the spectrum. Table 4. Covariance (Correlation) matrix of sentinel–2 bands. Sentinel-2

    PCA transformed the correlated Sentinel–2 dataset into a substantially smaller
    set of uncorrelated variables representing most of the information present in
    the original dataset. Fig. 6(a–c) shows the PCA bands derived from the Sentinel–2
    data and Fig. 6(d–f) shows the frequency distribution of corresponding principal
    component bands. The total range (maximum value - minimum value) of PCA band 3
    is greater than the PCA band 1 and PCA band 2. However, most of the pixels fall
    in a small range around the mean of 6486.13, which shows information loss in PCA
    band 3. The frequency distribution reveals that the variance of the first principal
    component is the highest, followed by the second and then by the third. The calculated
    values of variance for PCA bands 1, 2, and 3 were 395879.55, 284229.30, and 45254.05,
    respectively. The image produced from PCA band 1 data resembles the original image
    and it contains most of the pertinent information inherent to the scene due to
    high variance. Adjacent bands in a multispectral remotely sensed image are often
    highly correlated and often convey almost the same information about the object.
    A high correlation meaning thereby that the bands are not statistically independent.
    A low degree of correlation was observed among the PCA bands 1, 2, and 3 (Fig.
    7(a–c)). The correlation values between PCA bands 1 and 2, 1 and 3, and 3 and
    2 were 0.01, −0.01, and 0.25, respectively. The non-structured appearance of the
    scatter plots and low correlation values confirm that there is no relationship
    among the PCA bands. High Correlation in stack 1 shows (Table 4) that there is
    a redundancy of information and if this redundancy can be reduced, then information
    can be compressed. The correlation between the bands which exist in the original
    data has disappeared in the principal components. So, the PCA was able to reduce
    correlation significantly. The principal components are new uncorrelated bands
    obtained by a linear combination of original data, retaining as maximum as possible
    the information present on the original data. In this way, a classification using
    the first few principal components can be better than one performed by means of
    the original dataset. If we compare the PCA band 1 and PCA band 2 images, PCA
    band 1 has higher brightness values for the pixels than PCA band 2, and PCA band
    1 shows a higher degree of contrast than PCA band 2. Download : Download high-res

    (b) Spectral response curves of LULC classes in Sentinel–2 bands. (For interpretation
    of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    Web version of this article.) Land use and land cover classes were selected based
    on knowledge about the specific study area. Seven major land use and land cover
    classes were identified, viz., Water, Built-up, Mixed forest, Cultivated land,
    Barren land, Fallow land with Vertisols dominance, and Fallow land with Inceptisols
    dominance. The classifications were conducted using Sentinel–2 original bands
    (traditional approach) and PCA-based approach. Prediction performances of the
    three classifier algorithms, MLE, RF, and SVM, were evaluated to reveal the efficiency
    of two different land use and land cover classification approaches with training
    data of less than 1000 pixels per class. Training data for each land use and land
    cover class were collected as a group of pixels. Stratified random sampling was
    used to obtain the testing data. The classification performed on the original
    Sentinel–2 bands led to an unacceptable outcome with a classification overall
    accuracy of 22% for MLE. However, 60% and 64% classification overall accuracy
    was achieved with RF and SVM classifiers, respectively. The classification results
    of RF and SVM are acceptable as the training data were limited to less than 1000
    pixels per class. In the PCA-based classification approach, the same training
    polygons were used to avoid the optimistic bias in classification. PCA based approach
    significantly improved the overall classification accuracy of all the three classifiers.
    The overall classification accuracy varied considerably among the classifiers.
    The overall classification accuracy of MLE classifier was increased from 22% to
    41% (19% increase) in the PCA based approach. The overall accuracy RF classifier
    was increased by 10% reaching 70%, whereas the SVM classifier outperformed both
    the classifiers with 76% overall accuracy (increased by 12%). The spectral response
    curve is the curve showing the variation of reflectance or emittance (in terms
    of Digital numbers) of a material with respect to wavelengths. Fig. 8, Fig. 9
    show the variation of responses of the land use and land cover classes in Stack
    1 and Stack 2 respectively. Classes having similar responses are hard to separate.
    It was also observed that as the spectral distance (or separability) of the classes
    Water and Built-up in Stack 1 and Stack 2 (Fig. 8, Fig. 9) in relation to other
    classes was more, that is why the user''s accuracy (UA) and producer''s accuracy
    (PA) for water class were the highest followed by the Built-up class, for both
    traditional and PCA-based classification approaches. Kappa coefficient showed
    a similar trend as that of the overall accuracy. Highest Kappa coefficient values
    were obtained with SVM in PCA based approach followed by the RF. Comparative visual
    analysis of both the approaches with all the three classifiers are shown in Fig.
    10, Fig. 11, and the results of accuracy assessment are given in Table 7. Download

    parametric (MLE) and non-parametric (SVM and RF) classifiers are similar to the
    other reported studies Yang et al. (2011); Huang et al. (2002). Nonetheless, little
    difference was also observed between the prediction performances of the SVM and
    RF machine learning algorithms. The land use and land cover classification results
    showed some diversity due to the low number of training data, yet the global performances
    of both the classifiers were very similar for both the approaches. HEC-GeoHMS
    was used to create the curve number with the help of the SVM classified land use
    and land cover map using PCA based approach and soil map containing hydrological
    soil groups. The curve number value varied from 36 to 100 for the study area,
    lower numbers indicate low runoff potential while larger numbers indicate an increased
    runoff potential. The calculated curve number is also termed as CN II or AMC II
    (Antecedent Moisture Condition II). The calculated curve number can be adjusted
    to dry moisture conditions (called as AMC I) and high moisture conditions (called
    as AMC III) by using adjusting factors. Fig. 12 shows the curve number maps and
    statistics is shown in Table 8, for the antecedent moisture condition II generated
    using the traditional approach and PCA based approach. It is evident from the
    results that land use and land cover map influences the curve number map significantly.

    costs and the requirement for skilled operators make providing gauge stations
    to each watershed prohibitively expensive. The runoff curve numbers estimated
    from remotely sensed parameters, such as land use and land cover and soil data,
    in combination with observed rainfall, predict runoff depth and peak flow, may
    result in high accuracy of hydrological modeling. As remote sensing data are widely
    used in mathematical watershed models to simulate and evaluate the existing and
    proposed management scenarios, it is necessary to improve the land use and land
    cover classification accuracy. In the study, traditional and PCA based approaches
    were used on Sentinel–2 processed data using three different supervised classification
    methods, namely, MLE, RF, and SVM. The results show that a PCA based approach
    is far superior to the traditional approach. Maximum classification accuracy was
    achieved with SVM classifier; SVM outperformed the MLE and RF classifiers in both
    traditional as well as PCA based approach even with a small training dataset.
    The uncorrelated principal component bands enhanced the classification accuracy
    as compared to the use of Sentinel–2 original bands. This confirms the feasibility
    of PCA in remote sensing to extract land use and land cover information and enhance
    the classification. Moreover, a curve number grid was also created using the land
    use and land cover map for antecedent moisture condition II. Various hydrological
    tools, models (SWAT, HEC-RAS, HEC-HMS, etc.), and algorithms use the curve number
    grid within a GIS environment for hydrological modeling. Compliance with ethical

    Open Access Sodium boric acid: a Tris-free, cooler conductive medium for DNA electrophoresis
    Jonathan R. Brody & Scott E. Kern Published Online:6 Jun 2018https://doi.org/10.2144/04362BM02
    Sections PDF/EPUB Tools Share It has been nearly three decades since the invention
    of DNA electrophoresis (1–6). Current conductive media for DNA electrophoresis
    remain largely restricted to legacy Tris-acetic acid-disodium EDTA (TAE) and Trisboric
    acid-disodium EDTA (TBE) at substantial ionic strengths, leading to higher cost
    and excessive heat generation, and limiting the voltage and speed of electrophoretic
    runs. TAE and TBE usually contain between 40 to 90 mM Tris, corresponding anion
    concentrations, and trace amounts of different forms of EDTA (1–2 mM) (7). Investigators
    have compared and analyzed TAE and TBE buffers in DNA electrophoresis; however,
    to our knowledge no one has substantially investigated the simplification and
    substitution of components of these buffers to achieve a more efficient and inexpensive
    conductive medium for DNA electrophoresis (8,9). It is well established that heat
    generation is a primary source of problems in TAE and TBE gels, causing sample
    diffusion, convection, denaturation, and poor gel integrity, and limiting the
    ability to run gels at a high voltage (10). Ohm''s law and the power law interrelate
    voltage (V), current (I), and power (P) (11,12). Power consumed in the electrophoresis
    system manifests as heat generation (P = VI). These interrelated variables are
    affected by ionic conductance due to choice of salts and ionized components in
    proportion to their particular concentrations in the media used in electrophoresis.
    A thorough analysis of these critical properties of widely used buffered media
    for DNA electrophoresis was performed. We found that TAE and TBE create a “runaway”
    positive feedback loop of current and temperature, which results in poor gel resolution
    at high voltage (Figure 1, lanes 3–4). This positive feedback loop makes low-voltage
    (5–10 V/cm) runs necessary and highlights the limitations of using Tris as a cation
    for DNA electrophoresis. Another component of currently used buffers, EDTA, is
    now largely superfluous, since most DNA samples are readily soluble and since
    commonly used enzymes today would not carry an undesirable enzymatic activity
    under electrophoretic conditions. Figure 1.  Sodium boric acid (SB) performance
    in agarose DNA electrophoresis as compared to commonly used conductive media.
    Gels comprised 1.2% (lanes 1–4) and 0.7% (lanes 5–7) agarose (Type I Low EEO;
    Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) and 0.1% ethidium bromide (Fisher Scientific, Fair
    Long, NJ, USA). In lanes 1–4, SB and Tris-boric acid-disodium EDTA (TBE) gels
    were run fast (350 V) for 16 min. A Tris-acetic acid-disodium EDTA (TAE) gel run
    under the same conditions experienced poor gel integrity and melting (not shown).
    In lanes 5–7, SB, TBE, and TAE gels were run at legacy conditions (125 V) for
    75 min. The power source (Model FB 570; Fisher Biotech, Pittsburg, PA, USA) displayed
    current flow at set voltage. All runs used a horizontal rig (MGU-500; CBS Scientific,
    Del Mar, CA, USA) and had 700 mL total volume of medium in the reservoirs and
    gels of 10 cm length. M, DNA marker (1 Kb Plus DNA Ladder™ Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
    CA, USA). PCR, 280-bp PCR-generated product. We thereby explored alternative,
    low-molarity, sodium-based conductive media that could mitigate this feedback
    loop. Extensive studies established that sodium concentrations between 7.5 and
    12.5 mM, with borate as the counterion, provided the best resolution (data not
    shown). We therefore prepared a sodium boric acid (SB) conductive medium, where
    1× SB consisted of 5 mM disodium borate decahydrate or 10 mM sodium hydroxide,
    pH adjusted to 8.5 with boric acid. A 20× stock solution of pH 8.0 produces the
    appropriate pH upon dilution to working strength; stock solutions of 10–50× can
    also be prepared and stored without difficulty. Under high-voltage gel running
    conditions, SB showed superior resolution compared to TBE, yielding high-resolution
    separation on a 1.2% gel within 16 min (Figure 1). For the SB gel, current and
    temperature increased only slightly; current increased from 200 to 287 mA, and
    the final temperature was 41°C. By contrast, the current for the TBE gel doubled
    from 306 to 600 mA, and the final temperature was 60°C. A TAE gel run under identical
    conditions showed a current spike from 395 to 838 mA, and a final temperature
    of 70°C, resulting in partial melting of the gel (data not shown). Under standard
    electrophoretic conditions, SB provided resolution and separation as good as or
    better than TBE and TAE gels (Figure 1, lanes 5–7). We next sought to address
    the comparative conductive capacities of SB, TBE, and TAE. To monitor electrolyte
    exhaustion, we presumed that an eventual drop in current over time was primary
    evidence of one electrolyte having migrated enough that it could no longer serve
    its full role as a transporter of the current from one electrode to the other,
    as would be produced by a local depletion of an electrolyte. SB (pH 8–9) had a
    delayed electrolyte exhaustion at constant voltage as compared to other media
    tested (the pKa of borate is 9.2) (Figure 2). Electrolyte exhaustion occurred
    at 3 h for SB, but at less than 1 h for TAE, as determined by observing the current
    at a constant voltage (Figure 2). In this regard, SB outperformed TAE and TBE.
    Indeed, TBE outperformed TAE, most likely due to the boric acid, which by buffering
    the hydroxide production provides a continuing cathodic source of borate for conducting
    current. Along similar lines of explanation, SB at pH 9 may exhaust slightly earlier
    than SB at pH 8 (Figure 2). At the lower pH, boric acid represents a larger reserve
    to replenish ions at the cathode. One would expect that boric acid-containing
    media could be used for longer runs without recirculation. Figure 2.  Electrolyte
    exhaustion. Conductive media were tested by plotting the current at constant voltage
    (200 V). TAE, Tris-acetic acid-disodium EDTA; TBE, Tris-boric acid-disodium EDTA;
    SB, sodium boric acid. Within our genetics laboratory, we have completely switched
    over to SB media for routine DNA separation. In addition, we have performed gel
    extraction of restriction-digested plasmid DNA from SB gels and successfully subcloned
    the fragment (data not shown). SB also sufficed for DNA migration in vertical
    polyacrylamide gels (data not shown). We have not encountered a situation in which
    SB was not optimal. Upon a re-examination of some fundamental properties of conductive
    media and a heightened attention to the self-amplifying nature of Joule heating,
    we can now strongly recommend that SB could replace TAE and TBE for many if not
    most standard DNA electrophoretic applications. It is possible to mitigate the
    runaway positive feedback loop with SB conductive medium, along with considerable
    savings in cost and time (Table 1). We estimate that SB could save over $30 million
    annually in the United States, based on cost per gel and an estimated agarose
    relevant consumption from a marketing survey of U.S. trends for 2002 (polyacrylamide
    gel-associated cost contributions were not included due to limited source data).
    SB is superior to conventional media in allowing better temperature control, improved
    portability and convenience by reduced power and amperage requirements of the
    power supply, an improved electrolyte exhaustion rate, and a decreased need for
    heat dissipation in the electrophoretic device. SB simply outperforms existing
    DNA electrophoretic media. Table 1.  Characteristics of Conductive Media for DNA

    Get rights and content Precision agriculture dates back to the middle of the 1980''s.
    Remote sensing applications in precision agriculture began with sensors for soil
    organic matter, and have quickly diversified to include satellite, aerial, and
    hand held or tractor mounted sensors. Wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation
    initially focused on a few key visible or near infrared bands. Today, electromagnetic
    wavelengths in use range from the ultraviolet to microwave portions of the spectrum,
    enabling advanced applications such as light detection and ranging (LiDAR), fluorescence
    spectroscopy, and thermal spectroscopy, along with more traditional applications
    in the visible and near infrared portions of the spectrum. Spectral bandwidth
    has decreased dramatically with the advent of hyperspectral remote sensing, allowing
    improved analysis of specific compounds, molecular interactions, crop stress,
    and crop biophysical or biochemical characteristics. A variety of spectral indices
    now exist for various precision agriculture applications, rather than a focus
    on only normalised difference vegetation indices. Spatial resolution of aerial
    and satellite remote sensing imagery has improved from 100''s of m to sub-metre
    accuracy, allowing evaluation of soil and crop properties at fine spatial resolution
    at the expense of increased data storage and processing requirements. Temporal
    frequency of remote sensing imagery has also improved dramatically. At present
    there is considerable interest in collecting remote sensing data at multiple times
    in order to conduct near real time soil, crop and pest management. Highlights
    ► Rapid advances in remote sensing for precision agriculture have occurred. ►
    Satellite imagery has improved in spatial resolution, return visit frequency and
    spectral resolution. ► Aerial hyperspectral imagery has revolutionized precision
    agriculture. ► Ground based sensors have been developed for on-the-go monitoring
    of crop and soil characteristics. ► The future challenge is to develop approaches
    that provide customized management for individual plants. Previous article in

    Precision agriculture is one of the top ten revolutions in agriculture (Crookston,
    2006), although it has only been practiced commercially since the 1990''s. Over
    one-third of US Midwestern farmers already practice some form of precision agriculture.
    Precision agriculture generally involves better management of farm inputs such
    as fertilisers, herbicides, seed, fuel (used during tillage, planting, spraying,
    etc.) by doing the right management practice at the right place and the right
    time. Whereas large farm fields under conventional management receive uniform
    applications of fertilisers, irrigation, seed, etc., with precision agriculture,
    these fields can be divided into management zones that each receives customised
    management inputs based on varying soil types, landscape position, and management
    history. Precision agriculture offers to improve crop productivity and farm profitability
    through improved management of farm inputs (Larson & Robert, 1991; Zhang, Wang,
    & Wang, 2002), leading to better environmental quality (Mulla, 1993; Mulla et
    al., 2002; Mulla, Perillo, & Cogger, 1996; Tian, 2002). Other benefits perceived
    by farmers include more precise hybrid selection, rental agreements that are better
    aligned with actual soil productivity, better matching of fertiliser applications
    to crop yield potential, lower chemical bills and fuel costs, and reduced compaction.
    Benefits to society include creation of high technology jobs (computer hardware,
    computer software, machinery guidance, soil and crop sensors, information management,
    decision support systems), and mitigation of environmental pollution arising from
    over-application of nitrogen and phosphorus fertiliser. Precision agriculture
    uses intensive data and information collection and processing in time and space
    to make more efficient use of farm inputs, leading to improved crop production
    and environmental quality (Harmon et al., 2005). Precision agriculture is beginning
    to emphasise spatial-temporal data analysis and management rather than spatial
    data analysis and management alone (Mamo, Malzer, Mulla, Huggins, & Strock, 2003;
    Miao, Mulla, Randall, Vetsch, & Vintila, 2009; Varvel, Wilhelm, Shanahan, & Schepers,
    2007). Crop yield and response to N fertiliser varies significantly across years
    in response to changes in climate (Bakhsh, Jaynes, Colvin, & Kanwar, 2000), just
    as it varies significantly across the landscape in response to variations in soil
    type and landscape features. Precision agriculture involves both data collection/analysis
    and information management, as well as technological advances in computer processing,
    field positioning, yield monitoring, remote sensing, and sensor design (Mulla
    & Schepers, 1997). More than 30% of the growth in US agribusiness (jobs, sales,
    exports, etc.) in the future is expected to come from further adoption of precision
    agriculture by farmers (Whipker & Akridge, 2006), including growth in demand for
    both information management services and technological advances such as global
    positioning system (GPS) autosteer guidance (e.g. Real Time Kinetic technology),
    variable rate irrigation, fertiliser and sprayer controllers, robotics, and real
    time decision making based on sensor networks and remote sensing. Adoption rates
    are also significant in Australia, Japan, Canada and Europe, specifically in Germany,
    Sweden, France, Spain, Denmark and the UK. Globally, there is little documented
    information about rates of adoption for precision agriculture in the developing
    world. Mondal and Basu (2009) state that countries such as Argentina, Brazil,
    China, India and Malaysia have begun to adopt precision agriculture. Precision
    agriculture is also widely used in the vineyards of Chile. The farms of the future
    are likely to be managed with much greater spatial and temporal resolution than
    they are with present approaches to precision agriculture. In Chilean vineyards,
    each grape vine receives an individually customised fertiliser prescription that
    varies with soil type, landscape position and hybrid. It is not unrealistic to
    expect that crops on modern US farms of the future will be managed plant-by-plant,
    a huge advance over farming by soil approaches of the past. This approach will
    require massive data collection and analysis on a scale not considered feasible
    today, involving stationary or mobile sensors that can measure characteristics
    of individual plants in real time. Sensors of the future could be based on satellites
    (Bausch & Khosla, 2010), airplanes (Goel et al., 2003; Haboudane, Miller, Pattey,
    Zarco-Tejada, & Strachan, 2004; Haboudane, Miller, Tremblay, Zarco-Tejada, & Dextraze,
    2002; Miao, Mulla, Randall, Vetsch, & Vintila, 2007), unmanned aerial vehicles
    (Berni, Zarco-Tejada, Suárez, & Fereres, 2009; Herwitz et al., 2004), tractors
    (Adamchuk, Hummel, Morgan, & Upadhyaya, 2004; Long, Engel, & Siemens, 2008), or
    attached to mobile robots (Astrand & Baerveldt, 2002) to record weed densities,
    crop height, leaf reflectance, moisture status and other properties important
    for decisions about fertilizer and pest management. These sensors must be robust,
    run on renewable energy sources, and be able to relay information using wireless
    networks (O''Shaughnessy and Evett, 2010; Wang, Zhang, & Wang, 2006) to computers
    that can perform data mining procedures and make complex management recommendations.
    These recommendations can be transmitted to computers and controllers in the field
    that are capable of varying the rates of irrigation, fertilisers, and herbicides
    at fine spatial resolution, if not plant-by-plant. 2. Remote sensing applications
    in agriculture Remote sensing applications in agriculture are based on the interaction
    of electromagnetic radiation with soil or plant material. Typically, remote sensing
    involves the measurement of reflected radiation, rather than transmitted or absorbed
    radiation. Remote sensing refers to non-contact measurements of radiation reflected
    or emitted from agricultural fields. The platforms for making these measurements
    include satellites, aircraft, tractors and hand-held sensors. Measurements made
    with tractors and hand-held sensors are also known as proximal sensing, especially
    if they do not involve measurements of reflected radiation. In addition to reflectance,
    transmittance and absorption, plant leaves can emit energy by fluorescence (Apostol
    et al., 2003) or thermal emission (Cohen, Alchanatis, Meron, Saranga, & Tsipris,
    2005). Thermal remote sensing for water stress in crops is based on emission of
    radiation in response to temperature of the leaf and canopy, which varies with
    air temperature and the rate of evapotranspiration. The amount of radiation reflected
    from plants is inversely related to radiation absorbed by plant pigments, and
    varies with the wavelength of incident radiation. Plant pigments such as chlorophyll
    absorb radiation strongly in the visible spectrum from 400 to 700 nm (Pinter et
    al., 2003), particularly at wavelengths such as 430 (blue or B) and 660 (red or
    R) nm for chlorophyll a and 450 (B) and 650 (R) nm for chlorophyll b. Other plant
    pigments such as anthocyanins and carotenoids are also important (Blackburn, 2007).
    In contrast, plant reflectance is high in the near infrared (NIR 700–1300 nm)
    region as a result of leaf density and canopy structure effects. This sharp contrast
    in reflectance behaviour between the red and NIR portions of the spectrum is the
    motivation for development of spectral indices that are based on ratios of reflectance
    values in the visible and NIR regions (Sripada, Heiniger, White, & Weisz, 2006).
    These spectral indices are often used to assess various attributes of plant canopies,
    such as leaf area index (LAI), biomass, chlorophyll content or N content. The
    amount of radiation reflected by bare soils is affected primarily by soil moisture
    and organic matter content, but also by clay minerals and calcium carbonate or
    iron oxides (Thomasson, Sui, Cox, & Al–Rajehy, 2001; Viscarra Rossel, Walvoort,
    McBratney, Janik, & Skjemstad, 2006). Each soil constituent has a specific spectral
    region where reflectance is strongest (Ben-Dor, 2010), and a specific spectral
    signature. Bare soil and crop canopies are often both present in a remotely sensed
    image, and the mixture of two spectral signatures often confounds the interpretation
    of reflectance data (Fig. 1). Spectral unmixing algorithms (Huete & Escadafal,
    1991), derivative spectra (Demetriades-Shah, Steven, & Clark, 1990) or spectral
    indices that adjust for soil effects (Haboudane et al., 2002, 2004) are often
    used to isolate information about plant characteristics when the reflectance is
    affected by both sources. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. Reflectance
    signatures of dry or wet soil in comparison to reflectance signatures of a Russet
    Burbank potato canopy with low or high rates of N fertiliser application. Remote
    sensing applications in agriculture are typically classified according to the
    type of platform for the sensor, including satellite, aerial, and ground based
    platforms. These platforms and their associated imaging systems can be differentiated
    based on the altitude of the platform, the spatial resolution of the image, and
    the minimum return frequency for sequential imaging. Spatial resolution affects
    the area of the smallest pixel that can be identified. As spatial resolution improves,
    the area of the smallest pixel decreases, and the homogeneity of soil or crop
    characteristics within that pixel increases. Poor spatial resolution implies large
    pixels with increased heterogeneity in soil or plant characteristics. Return frequency
    is important for assessment of temporal patterns in soil or plant characteristics.
    The availability of remote sensing images from satellite and aerial platforms
    is often severely limited by cloud cover (Moran, Inoue, & Barnes, 1997), whereas
    ground based remote sensing is less affected by this limitation. Remote sensing
    applications in agriculture have focused on a wide range of endeavours (Adamchuk
    et al., 2004; Moran et al., 1997; Pinter et al., 2003). These include crop yield
    and biomass (Shanahan et al., 2001; Yang, Everitt, Bradford, & Escobar, 2000),
    crop nutrient and water stress (Bastiaanssen, Molden, & Makin, 2000; Clay, Kim,
    Chang, Clay, & Dalsted, 2006; Cohen et al., 2005; Moller et al., 2007; Tilling
    et al., 2007), infestations of weeds (Lamb & Brown, 2001; Thorp & Tian, 2004),
    insects and plant diseases (Seelan, Laguette, Casady, & Seielstad, 2003), and
    soil properties such as organic matter, moisture and clay content, and pH (Christy,
    2008), or salinity (Corwin & Lesch, 2003). 2.1. Soil sensing in precision agriculture
    Precision agriculture started during the mid 1980''s with two contrasting philosophies.
    The first was exemplified by the “farming by soil” school (Larson & Robert, 1991).
    This school promoted the use of soil sampling and customised management of farm
    inputs by soil mapping unit. The second was exemplified by the “Soil Sampling
    Management Zone” school (Mulla, 1991, 1993; Mulla & Bhatti, 1997; Mulla, Bhatti,
    Hammond, & Benson, 1992), which later became known as “site-specific crop management”.
    Management zones are relatively homogeneous sub-units of farm fields that can
    each be managed with a different, but uniform customised management practice.
    This school became very popular when field comparisons of uniform versus variable
    fertiliser applications showed that there was considerable variability at scales
    finer than soil mapping units (Mulla et al., 1992). Bhatti, Mulla, and Frazier
    (1991) were the first to demonstrate that Landsat remote sensing had significant
    capabilities for estimating spatial patterns in soil organic matter, soil phosphorus
    and crop yield potential for use in precision agriculture applications. A third
    approach to precision agriculture began to emerge in the early 1990''s (Hummel,
    Gaultney, & Sudduth, 1996), known as proximal soil sensing. This approach was
    based on continuous real-time sensing of spatial variations in soil properties
    using sensors mounted on tractors. The first application of this approach was
    for soil organic matter sensing (Shonk, Gaultney, Schulze, & Van Scoyoc, 1991)
    based on reflectance from multiple light emitting diode (LED) sensors emitting
    radiation at 660 nm. The sensor was very accurate if calibrated for individual
    soil catenas, but was affected by variations in soil moisture. Sudduth and Hummel
    (1993) developed a portable NIR sensor which could simultaneously be used to estimate
    soil organic matter content and soil moisture content. Other related technology
    was developed by Christy (2008), allowing simultaneous measurements of soil organic
    matter content, soil moisture, soil pH, soil carbon and soil phosphorus, potassium,
    and calcium. A major breakthrough in precision agriculture occurred when Carter,
    Rhoades, and Chesson (1993) introduced continuous real-time, non-contact proximal
    sensing of soil apparent electrical conductivity using non-invasive electromagnetic
    induction with the Geonics EM-38 (Geonics Ltd., Mississauga, Ontario, Canada).
    Soil electrical conductivity measurements with the EM-38 have been used to map
    spatial patterns in soil salinity (Corwin & Lesch, 2003), soil clay content (Doolittle,
    Sudduth, Kitchen, & lndorante, 1994) and soil moisture content (Sudduth et al.,
    2005). These patterns are often used to define management zones. 2.2. Satellite
    remote sensing Satellites have been used for remote sensing imagery in agriculture
    (Table 1) since the early 1970''s (Bauer & Cipra, 1973; Doraiswamy, Moulin, Cook,
    & Stern, 2003; Jewel, 1989) when Landsat 1 (originally known as Earth Resources
    Technology Satellite 1) was launched in 1972. Multispectral Scanner System (MSS)
    sensors on Landsat 1 collected imagery in the green, red and two infrared bands
    at a spatial resolution of 80 m and a return frequency of 18 days. Landsat 1 was
    initially used by Bauer and Cipra (1973) to classify Midwestern US agricultural
    landscapes into maize or soybean fields with an overall accuracy of 83%. Landsat
    5 was launched in 1984 and collected Thematic Mapper (TM) imagery at a spatial
    resolution of 30 m in the blue, green, red, near infrared, and three infrared
    (including thermal) bands. France launched a comparable satellite (système pour
    l''observation de la terre (SPOT) 1) in 1986, which collected 20 m imagery with
    a return frequency of up to six days in the green, red and near infrared frequencies.
    Jewel (1989) used four images collected between February and September in East
    Anglia, UK to distinguish cereal crops, field crops, grassland and forest land
    with an accuracy of 88%. India launched the Indian Remote Sensing (IRS-1A) satellite
    in 1988, with coverage in the blue, green, red and NIR bands at a spatial resolution
    of 72 m. Panigrahy and Sharma (1997) used reflectance in the red and NIR bands
    collected on four dates between October and March to classify agricultural landscapes
    in India into rice or rice–potato cropping systems with 95% accuracy. Table 1.

    H These applications of remote sensing in conventional agriculture soon led to
    applications in precision agriculture. The first application of remote sensing
    in precision agriculture occurred when Bhatti et al. (1991) used Landsat imagery
    of bare soil to estimate spatial patterns in soil organic matter content, which
    were then used as auxiliary data along with ground based measurements to estimate
    spatial patterns in soil phosphorus and wheat grain yield (Mulla, 1997). The spatial
    resolution of Landsat, SPOT and IRS satellites is fairly coarse (20–30 m) for
    current applications in precision agriculture. Efforts were subsequently started
    to design satellite imaging systems that had the higher spatial resolution and
    quicker revisit cycles required for precision agriculture (Table 1). IKONOS was
    launched in 1999 by Satellite Imaging Corp, Magnolia, TX, USA in partnership with
    Lockheed Martin, Bethesda, MD, USA. IKONOS collected 4 m resolution imagery in
    the blue, green, red and near infrared bands at a return frequency of up to 5
    days. Seelan et al. (2003) used IKONOS images to identify N deficiencies in sugarbeet,
    fungicide performance efficiency in wheat and field sites that had inadequate
    artificial drainage in wheat. In 2001, DigitalGlobe, Longmont, CO, USA launched
    a satellite named QuickBird with capabilities similar to IKONOS. QuickBird had
    a revisit frequency of 1–3 days and collected imagery in the blue, green, red
    and near infrared at a spatial resolution of 0.6–2.4 m. Bausch and Khosla (2010)
    showed that QuickBird estimates of normalised green normalised difference vegetation
    index (NGNDVI) were strongly correlated with spatial patterns in nitrogen sufficiency
    in irrigated maize. García Torres, Peña-Barragán, López-Granados, Jurado-Expósito,
    and Fernández-Escobar (2008) showed that QuickBird images of olive orchards in
    Spain could be used to estimate areas of olive plantations, numbers of trees,
    and spatial patterns in projected area of tree canopies, and olive yields. These
    two satellites have steadily gained a substantial base of commercial subscribers
    interested in precision agriculture applications, in stark contrast to older satellite
    technology such as Landsat or SPOT. The next major breakthrough in satellite remote
    sensing for precision agriculture was the five-satellite constellation developed
    by the RapidEye, Brandenburg_an_der_Havel, Germany in 2008 (Table 1). RapidEye
    satellites provide daily coverage for any location on the globe, and collect data
    with a 6.5 m spatial resolution. RapidEye is the first satellite to provide imagery
    in the chlorophyll sensitive red-edge region of the spectrum (690–730 nm), along
    with the more traditional blue, green, red and near infrared reflectance. In 2008,
    GeoEye, Herndon, VA, USA launched a commercial satellite designed to provide services
    similar to RapidEye. The GeoEye 1 satellite has a return visit frequency of less
    than three days, and collects data at from 40 to 60 cm spatial resolution in the
    blue, green, red and near infrared bands. One of the main uses for GeoEye 1 imagery
    is providing Google Earth maps that are available through the Internet. This has
    revolutionised the ability to visualise land use patterns around the world. DigitalGlobe
    launched the WorldView 2 satellite in 2009, which collects imagery at 50 cm resolution
    with a 1 day revisit cycle. WorldView 2 is significantly more advanced than DigitalGlobe''s
    QuickBird satellite, as WorldView 2 collects imagery in the standard blue, green,
    red, and near infrared bands, as well as bands in the purple (450–480 nm), yellow,
    red-edge and a second near infrared frequency range. Several trends are apparent
    in satellite based remote sensing (Table 1). Firstly, the spatial resolution of
    imaging systems has improved from 80 m with Landsat to sub-metre resolution with
    GeoEye and WorldView. Secondly, the return visit frequency has improved from 18
    days with Landsat to 1 day with WorldView. Thirdly, the number of spectral bands
    available for analysis has improved from four bands (bandwidths greater than 60
    nm) with Landsat to eight or more bands (bandwidths greater than 40 nm) with WorldView.
    Hyperspectral imaging systems such as Hyperion on the National Aeronautics and
    Space Administration (NASA) earth observing 1 (EO 1) satellite provided even greater
    spectral resolution, with imaging from 400 to 2500 nm in 10 nm increments. As
    the spatial and spectral resolution of satellite imagery has improved, the suitability
    of using reflectance data from these platforms for precision agriculture applications
    has increased (Table 1). The most appropriate spatial and spectral resolution
    for precision agriculture applications depends on factors such as crop management
    objectives, capacity of farm equipment to vary farm inputs, and farm unit area.
    Estimation of spatial patterns in crop biomass or yield requires better spatial
    and spectral resolution (1–3 m) than variable rate application of fertiliser (5–10
    m). Accuracy of variable rate application of fertiliser is often limited by fertiliser
    spreader delay times (Chan, Schueller, Miller, Whitney, & Cornell, 2004). Variable
    rate spraying of herbicides for spot weed control requires better spatial and
    spectral resolution (0.5–1 m) than variable rate irrigation (5–10 m). Larger commercial
    farms can often afford to pay for remote sensing data with higher spatial and
    spectral resolution than smaller farms in developing countries. Satellite and/or
    aerial imagery is frequently used to estimate spatial patterns in crop biomass
    (Yang et al., 2000) and potential crop yield (Doraiswamy et al., 2003) using the
    Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). NDVI is calculated using reflectance
    ratios in the NIR and red portion of the spectrum (Rouse, Hass, Schell, & Deering,
    1973): (1) NDVI has several limitations, however, including potential interference
    from soil reflectance at low canopy densities and insensitivity to changes in
    leaf chlorophyll content in mature canopies with leaf area index values that exceed
    2 or 3 (Thenkabail, Smith, & De Pauw, 2000). The advent of crop combines equipped
    with yield monitors was a major advance in precision agriculture (Schueller &
    Bae, 1987; Stafford, Ambler, Lark, & Catt, 1996). Yield monitors provided fine
    scale resolution yield measurements across large spatial areas that could be used
    to improve the capacity of remote sensing to predict crop structural characteristics
    such as LAI, biomass, and yield. Many broadband spectral indices (Table 2) other
    than NDVI are available for use in precision agriculture (Miao et al., 2009; Sripada
    et al., 2006; Sripada, Schmidt, Dellinger, & Beegle, 2008). These indices reflect
    two historical trends in remote sensing for crop characteristics; namely, the
    prediction of ratios of reflectance in the red (R) and NIR bands versus ratios
    in the green (G) and NIR bands. The normalised red (NR) index focuses on the portion
    of the spectrum where chlorophyll strongly absorbs radiation. In contrast, the
    normalised green (NG) index focuses on the portion of the spectrum where pigments
    other than chlorophyll (carotenoids, anthocyanins, xanthophylls) absorb radiation.
    Similarly, there are two forms of the ratio vegetation index (RVI), one that consists
    of the ratio of NIR to R reflectance, the other green red vegetation index (GRVI)
    that consists of the ratio of NIR to G reflectance. Two forms of the NDVI exist,
    one that involves NIR and R reflectance, the other green normalized difference
    vegetation index (GNDVI) involves NIR and G reflectance. The difference vegetative
    index (DVI) was developed using the difference between reflectance in the NIR
    and R bands to compensate for effects of soil reflectance (Tucker, 1979). Sripada
    et al. (2006) found that economically optimum N rate in corn was better correlated
    with green difference vegetation index (GDVI) (NIR − G) than DVI (NIR − R), and
    these indices that compensated for soil effects performed better than NIR and
    R ratio indices such as NDVI and RVI that did not compensate for soil effects.
    A wide range of other indices have been developed to compensate for soil effects,
    including soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), green soil adjusted vegetation
    index (GSAVI), optimised soil adjusted vegetation index (OSAVI), green optimised
    soil adjusted vegetation index (GOSAVI) and modified soil adjusted vegetation
    index (MSAVI). A comparison of NDVI and simple ratio (SR8) vegetation indices
    for an irrigated commercial Minnesota potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) farm is shown
    in Fig. 2. Spatial patterns in N stress are identified more accurately with the
    SR8 index than the NDVI index. Table 2. Multi-spectral broad-band vegetation indices

    field. Moran et al. (1997) and Yao et al. (2010) summarised the major challenges
    for using satellite remote sensing for precision agriculture. Satellite imagery
    in the visible and NIR bands are limited to cloud free days, and are most usable
    when irradiance is relatively consistent across time. Only radar imagery collected
    using satellites or airplanes is unaffected by cloud cover. Other challenges include
    calibrating raw digital numbers to true surface reflectance, correcting imagery
    for atmospheric interferences and/or off-nadir view angles, and geo-rectifying
    pixels using GPS-based ground control locations. 2.3. Proximal remote sensing
    of crops for precision agriculture Given the limitations of satellite remote sensing
    for precision agriculture, there has been significant interest in proximal remote
    sensing techniques to assess crop growth and crop stress (Table 3). Proximal remote
    sensing involves sensors mounted on tractors, spreaders, sprayers or irrigation
    booms. Proximal sensing allows real time site specific management of fertiliser,
    pesticides or irrigation. The foundation for a transition from remote sensing
    to proximal sensing based assessment of crop status was established by Schepers,
    Francis, Vigil, and Below (1992), who used a Minolta soil plant analysis development
    (SPAD) meter to measure leaf greenness (chlorophyll) in maize crops at the silking
    stage under a range of applied N fertiliser rates. SPAD meter readings of leaf
    reflectance at 650 and 940 nm were found to be correlated with applied rate of
    N fertiliser as well as independent measurements of leaf N concentration. Schepers
    et al. (1992) suggested that proximal chlorophyll readings could be used to estimate
    N stress in maize by referencing the SPAD readings for stressed crops with the
    readings in a reference strip that received adequate rates of N fertiliser. Chlorophyll
    content of crop leaves is strongly affected by crop N status, but can also be
    affected to a lesser degree by other factors, such as crop variety and growth
    stage, pest infestations, water stress, and nutrient deficiencies other than N.

    Blackmer and Schepers (1995) introduced the concept of a nitrogen sufficiency
    index (NSI) to assess the degree of N stress in maize. The NSI was defined as
    the ratio of SPAD meter greenness readings for crops in a given field location
    relative to SPAD readings for the same crop in a well-fertilised reference strip
    with no N deficiencies. NSI values less than 0.95 were used to indicate areas
    with N stress that required additional N fertiliser. Varvel, Schepers, and Francis
    (1997) showed that SPAD meters and NSI values could be used for in-season correction
    of N deficiency in maize. Bausch and Duke (1996) showed that the SPAD meter could
    be replaced with a boom-mounted radiometer to estimate spatial patterns in NIR/G
    ratio and NSI across an irrigated maize field based on comparisons with a well-fertilised
    reference strip. They observed that this approach could detect N deficiencies
    in the V6 growth stage (Ritchie, Hanway, & Benson, 1993, p. 21), but results were
    confounded by interference with reflectance patterns from bare soil. Stone et
    al. (1996) measured spectral radiance in the red (671 nm) and NIR (780 nm) bands
    in wheat with a sensor mounted on a mobile lawn tractor. They used these data
    to estimate a spectral index known as the plant nitrogen spectral index (PNSI),
    which was the absolute value of the inverse of NDVI. Results showed that PNSI
    was strongly correlated with crop N uptake. Sensor readings were used to vary
    N fertiliser rates using an algorithm that increased exponentially with PNSI values
    (Solie, Raun, Whitney, Stone, & Ringer, 1996). This was the beginning of technology
    to variably apply N fertiliser “on-the-go” in response to proximal crop sensing,
    and was the basis for commercial development of the GreenSeeker NDVI active sensor
    marketed by NTech Industries, Ukiah, CA, USA in 2001. Raun et al. (2002) subsequently
    developed a seven step response index (RI)-based algorithm to estimate crop N
    fertiliser needs for maize and wheat based on in-season sensing of crop reflectance
    relative to check plots with no added fertiliser and reference plots with sufficient
    fertiliser. This algorithm accounted for both season-to-season temporal variability
    in crop growth using the concept of in-season estimated yield (INSEY) as well
    as within-field spatial variability in N supply. Algorithms for estimating potential
    crop yield and N uptake are available for many crops and locations around the
    world (Shanahan, Kitchen, Raun, & Schepers, 2008). The RI is estimated as the
    ratio of NDVI values in the crop relative to those in a reference strip with sufficient
    fertiliser. Link, Panitzki, and Reusch (2002) and Reusch, Link, and Lammel (2002)
    developed a tractor based passive sensor to determine crop N status based on NDVI.
    This was originally known as the Hydro-N sensor, but has since become known as
    the Yara-N sensor (Yara, Olso, Norway) (Table 3). A version of the Yara-N sensor
    is also available that uses active sensors (Link & Reusch, 2006), which reduces
    the errors caused by varying cloud cover, and allows the tractor operator to work
    at night. Holland, Schepers, Shanahan, and Horst (2004) developed an active crop
    sensor known as Crop Circle (Table 3). This sensor initially used reflectance
    in the green and NIR bands to estimate crop N deficiencies. The rationale behind
    using green rather than red reflectance with Crop Circle was that as crop LAI
    increases beyond 2.0, the green NDVI is more sensitive to changes in chlorophyll
    concentration and potential crop yield than NDVI (Gitelson, Kaufmann, & Merzlyak,
    1996; Shanahan et al., 2001; Sripada et al., 2006, 2008). This overcomes the limitation
    of using the GreenSeeker sensor at advanced crop growth stages. Solari, Shanahan,
    Ferguson, Schepers, and Gitelson (2008) used the Crop Circle sensor to show that
    N deficiencies could be better predicted using a green chlorophyll index defined
    as (NIR880/VIS590) − 1 in comparison with the green NDVI. Sripada et al. (2008)
    showed that the performance of spectral indices could be improved using ratios
    with the corresponding index values in reference strips receiving sufficient N
    fertiliser. Kitchen et al. (2010) and Scharf et al. (2011) showed that producers
    using the Crop Circle sensor could reduce N fertiliser applications by making
    in-season correction, while increasing crop yield and farm profitability. One
    limitation of the chlorophyll meter, GreenSeeker, Yara N and Crop Circle sensors,
    however, is that they cannot directly estimate the amount of N fertiliser needed
    to overcome crop N stress (Samborski, Tremblay, & Fallon, 2009). To overcome this,
    scientists have conducted comparisons of sensor readings with readings in reference
    strips receiving sufficient N fertiliser (Blackmer & Schepers, 1995; Kitchen et
    al., 2010; Raun et al., 2002; Sripada et al., 2008). They have used these data
    to develop N fertiliser response functions that relate sensor readings to the
    amount of N fertiliser needed to overcome crop N stress (Scharf et al., 2011).
    Even with this approach, reference strips with adequate fertiliser have to be
    strategically placed in representative soils and landscapes because yield response
    to N fertiliser exhibits significant spatial variability across production fields
    (Mamo et al., 2003). Also, reference strips have limitations for other crops like
    wheat (subject to lodging) and potato (subject to excessive vine growth at the
    expense of tuber growth). 2.4. Hyperspectral remote sensing in precision agriculture
    Hyperspectral remote sensing collects reflectance data over a wide spectral range
    at small spectral increments (typically 10 nm). It provides the ability to investigate
    spectral response of soils and vegetated surfaces in narrow spectral bands (10
    nm wide) across a wide spectral range. This is not possible with multispectral
    imaging that traditionally collects reflectance data in broadbands (greater than
    40 nm wide) centred in the B, G, R and NIR regions of the spectrum. When collected
    across large spatial extents at fine spatial resolution, hyperspectral imaging
    provides powerful insight into the spatial and spectral variability in reflectance
    for a bare or vegetated surface. This information is traditionally visualised
    using a three-dimensional hyperspectral data cube, with two spatial dimensions
    (x,y) and one spectral dimension (wavelength). An example of a hyperspectral data
    cube is shown in Fig. 3 for a commercial potato field in Minnesota, USA. The field
    shows significant spatial and spectral variability in reflectance. Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 3. Hyperspectral data cube for a commercial Russet
    Burbank potato field in Minnesota. The face of the cube is a red–green–blue image
    of the same area shown in Fig. 2. The first hyperspectral sensor was the airborne
    visible/infrared imaging spectrometer (AVIRIS), launched in 1987. This sensor
    provides continuous imagery from 380 to 2500 nm in bands that have a spectral
    resolution of 10 nm and a spatial resolution of 20 m. The satellite based Hyperion
    sensor, launched aboard EO-1 by NASA in 2000, has hyperspectral imaging capabilities
    similar to AVIRIS. Hyperspectral imagery collected by EO-1 Hyperion via the advanced
    land imager (ALI) sensor continues to be collected and is available for public
    use through the US Geological Survey, Center for Earth Resources Observation and
    Science (EROS). Datt, Jupp, McVicar, and Van Niel (2003) showed that ALI hyperspectral
    data could be used to more accurately predict spatial patterns in rice yield grown
    in Australia with derivative indices and red edge position in comparison with
    predictions based on NDVI. Miglani, Ray, Pandey, and Parihar (2008) showed that
    20 hyperspectral bands from ALI were necessary for agricultural remote sensing
    studies in the Meerut district of India. Wu, Wang, Niu, Gao, and Wu (2010) showed
    that vegetative indices based on red edge reflectance from hyperspectral ALI data
    could be used to accurately estimate canopy chlorophyll content and leaf area
    index for a broad range of agricultural crops in China. An aerial hyperspectral
    imaging system, the compact airborne spectrographic imager (CASI), has also been
    widely used (Haboudane et al., 2002, 2004). There are also hand-held or boom-mounted
    hyperspectral and multispectral imaging systems, including the CropScan (CropScan
    Inc, Rochester, MN, USA) sensor. Hyperspectral imaging differs from multispectral
    imaging in the continuity, range and spectral resolution of bands. In theory,
    it offers the capability of sensing a wide variety of soil and crop characteristics
    simultaneously, including moisture status, organic matter, nutrients, chlorophyll,
    carotenoids, cellulose, leaf area index and crop biomass (Goel et al., 2003; Haboudane
    et al., 2002; Zarco-Tejada et al., 2005). Specific wavelengths are most sensitive
    to each type of soil or crop characteristic. A red band centred at 687 nm is sensitive
    to crop leaf area index and biomass, while a near infrared band centred at 970
    nm is sensitive to crop moisture status (Thenkabail, Lyon, & Huete, 2010). Further
    examples of linking specific soil and crop characteristics with reflectance are
    given for 33 hyperspectral bands by Thenkabail et al. (2010). In contrast, multispectral
    imaging is often limited to analysis of single broadband combinations such as
    NDVI, which become insensitive to chlorophyll and other plant characteristics
    at LAI values exceeding 3.0 (Thenkabail et al., 2000), and are strongly interfered
    with by bare soil reflectance at low LAI values. Thenkabail et al. (2000) showed
    that hyperspectral data can be used to construct three general categories of predictive
    spectral indices, including 1) optimal multiple narrow band reflectance indices
    (OMNBR), 2) narrow band NDVI, and 3) SAVI. Only two to four narrow bands were
    needed to describe plant characteristics with OMNBR. The greatest information
    about plant characteristics in OMNBR includes the longer red wavelengths (650–700
    nm), shorter green wavelengths (500–550 nm), red-edge (720 nm), and two NIR (900–940
    nm and 982 nm) spectral bands. The information in these bands is only available
    in narrow increments of 10–20 nm, and is easily obscured in broad multispectral
    bands that are available with older satellite imaging systems. The best combination
    of two narrow bands in NDVI-like indices was centred in the red (682 nm) and NIR
    (920 nm) wavelengths, but varied depending on the type of crop (corn, soybean,
    cotton or potato) as well as the plant characteristic of interest (LAI, biomass,
    etc.). Advanced statistical methods for chemometric analysis of reflectance spectra
    have been used to interpret hyperspectral remote sensing data, including partial
    least squares (Lindgren, Geladi, & Wold, 1994; Viscarra Rossel et al., 2006),
    principal components analysis (Geladi, 2003), and pattern classification and recognition
    techniques (Stuckens, Coppin, & Bauer, 2000), including object oriented (Frohn,
    Reif, Lane, & Autrey, 2009) and decision tree (Wright & Gallant, 2007) classification
    techniques. Partial least squares (PLS) regression is perhaps more powerful than
    principal components analysis (PCA) in that PLS (like PCA) not only identifies
    factors that describe spectral variance, but also eliminates spectral bands that
    contain redundant information (Alchanatis & Cohen, 2010). Jain, Ray, Singh, and
    Panigrahy (2007) explored hyperspectral remote sensing for identification of N
    stress in potatoes grown in India. They used three techniques to identify bands
    that were optimal for detection of N stress, namely; 1) lambda–lambda plots, 2)
    principal component analysis, and 3) discriminant analysis. Lambda–lambda plots
    involve calculating, for example, the coefficient of determination (r2) for leaf
    N content at all hyperspectral reflectance bands. A graph of r2 for all possible
    combinations of band 1 on the x-axis and band 2 on the y-axis results in a lambda–lambda
    plot. The lambda–lambda plot is useful for identifying which combinations of two
    bands contain redundant information about N stress. Spectral bands or narrow band
    indices should be selected with low r2 to eliminate redundancy and maximise information
    about crop characteristics (such as N stress). Principal component analysis was
    used by Jain et al. (2007) to identify which combinations of bands account for
    a majority of the variance in crop reflectance characteristics. This technique
    is used to eliminate hyperspectral bands that do not contain useful information
    about the crop characteristics of interest. Stepwise discriminant analysis uses
    a ratio of treatment sums of squares to total sums of squares to find spectral
    regions with distinctly different mean values of reflectance. A variety of narrow
    band hyperspectral indices (Table 4) are available for use in precision agriculture
    (Haboudane et al., 2002, 2004; Li et al., 2010; Miao et al., 2007, 2009). Many
    of these have the same form as broadband spectral indices (Table 1), but differ
    in that the reflectance bands for hyperspectral indices are narrow (10–20 nm wide)
    bands centred around a single specific wavelength. These indices variously respond
    to canopy or leaf scale effects of leaf area index, chlorophyll, specific pigments,
    or nitrogen stress. Simple ratios (SR) 1 through 7 and normalized difference indices
    (NDI) 1 through 3 typically respond to leaf level changes in chlorophyll. In contrast,
    NDVI responds to canopy scale changes in leaf area index and chlorophyll. GNDVI,
    modified chlorophyll absorption in reflectance index (MCARI), transformed chlorophyll
    absorption in reflectance index (TCARI), MCARI2, OSAVI, and MSAVI respond to canopy
    scale changes in chlorophyll, with the latter two indices being designed to compensate
    for soil reflectance effects. PSSRa and PSSRb were designed specifically to respond
    to changes in chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b, respectively. New hyperspectral
    indices are continuously being tested and developed (Li et al., 2010) using techniques
    involving lambda–lambda plots where reflectance signatures are compared for all
    possible combinations of two reflectance bands. Table 4. Hyperspectral narrow-band

    of hyperspectral remote sensing in precision agriculture have recently been reviewed
    by Yao et al. (2010). These applications include 1) bare soil imaging for management
    zone delineation, 2) weed mapping, 3) crop N stress detection, 4) crop yield mapping,
    and 5) pest and disease detection. Perhaps of greatest interest for precision
    agriculture is using hyperspectral remote sensing for variable rate, in-season
    management of nitrogen fertiliser based on spatial patterns in chlorophyll content.
    Wu, Han, Niu, and Dong (2010) used hyperspectral data from the Hyperion EO-1 satellite
    to study chlorophyll content in a variety of agricultural canopy types in China,
    including flax, chestnuts, corn, bamboo, potato, pine, saccharose and tea. Chlorophyll
    content of leaves were estimated using a variety of vegetation indices derived
    from red edge reflectance bands located at 705 and 750 nm. The MCARI/OSAVI705
    index performed better than all other vegetation indices evaluated, with an r2
    value of 0.71. Wu, Wang et al. (2010) estimated chlorophyll content of maize in
    China using Hyperion hyperspectral reflectance data. The Enhanced Vegetation Index
    (EVI) was more accurate (r2 = 0.81) at predicting maize chlorophyll contents than
    MSAVI or NDVI. 3. Knowledge gaps for remote sensing in precision agriculture Rapid
    advances in remote sensing for precision agriculture have occurred over the last
    twenty five years. Satellite imagery has improved in spatial resolution, return
    visit frequency and spectral resolution. Aerial hyperspectral imagery has revolutionised
    the ability to distinguish multiple crop characteristics, including nutrients,
    water, pests, diseases, weeds, biomass and canopy structure. Ground-based sensors
    have been developed for on-the-go monitoring of crop and soil characteristics
    such as N stress, water stress, soil organic matter and moisture content. Precision
    farming has progressed through many stages. It began with farming by soil and
    progressed to site-specific crop management based on grid sampling and management
    zones. More recently there has been increasing emphasis on real-time on-the-go
    monitoring with ground based sensors. The challenge for the future is to develop
    precision farming approaches that can provide customized management of farm inputs
    for individual plants. There is a significant potential in precision agriculture
    for combining archived remote sensing data with real-time data for improved agricultural
    management (Thenkabail, 2003). Historical archives of satellite remote sensing
    data are available at many locations for Landsat, SPOT, IRS, IKONOS, and QuickBird.
    These data typically include reflectance in the B, G, R and NIR bands, at spatial
    resolutions of from 0.6 to 30 m spatial resolution. Images at a fixed location
    could be analysed across multiple crop growth stages, seasons and years in order
    to identify relatively homogeneous sub-regions of fields that differ from one
    another in leaf area index, NDVI, and potential yield. Auxiliary data at these
    same sites, including crop yield maps, digital elevation models and soil series
    maps could be combined with historical remote sensing data to identify potential
    management zones where precision agricultural input operations can be implemented.
    Real time remote sensing with high spatial and spectral resolution satellites
    such as EO-1 Hyperion or the upcoming (2016) NASA Hyperspectral Infrared Imager
    (HyspIRI) satellite (or comparable data collected with aerial platforms) could
    then be used for real time precision agricultural decision making and to refine
    the location of management zones identified using historical imaging and auxiliary
    data. With this in mind, there are several needs for future research in precision
    farming. These include the following: • More emphasis is needed on chemometric
    or spectral decomposition/derivative methods of analysis since spatial and spectral
    resolution of hyperspectral sensing systems are now adequate for most precision
    agriculture applications • Sensors are needed for direct estimation of nutrient
    deficiencies without the use of reference strips • Spectral indices should continue
    to be developed that simultaneously allow assessment of multiple crop characteristics
    (e.g. LAI, biomass, etc.) and stresses (e.g. water and N; weeds and insects, etc.)
    • Historical archives of satellite remote sensing data at moderate to high spatial
    resolution and traditional spectral resolution should be integrated with real-time
    remote sensing data at high spatial and spectral resolution for improved decision
    making in precision agriculture. Acknowledgement Support by the USDA-BARD fund

    TOOLS SHARE Abstract This essay summarizes deliberation by the Soil Science Society
    of America (SSSA) Ad Hoc Committee on Soil Quality (S-581) and was written to
    spur discussion among SSSA members. Varying perceptions of soil quality have emerged
    since the concept was suggested in the early 1990s, and dialogue among members
    is important because, unlike air and water quality, legislative standards for
    soil quality have not been and perhaps should not be defined. In simplest terms,
    soil quality is “the capacity (of soil) to function”. This definition, based on
    function, reflects the living and dynamic nature of soil. Soil quality can be
    conceptualized as a three-legged stool, the function and balance of which requires
    an integration of three major components — sustained biological productivity,
    environmental quality, and plant and animal health. The concept attempts to balance
    multiple soil uses (e.g., for agricultural production, remediation of wastes,
    urban development, forest, range, or recreation) with goals for environmental
    quality. Assessing soil quality will require collaboration among all disciplines
    of science to examine and interpret their results in the context of land management
    strategies, interactions, and trade-offs. Society is demanding solutions from
    science. Simply measuring and reporting the response of an individual soil parameter
    to a given perturbation or management practice is no longer sufficient. The soil
    resource must be recognized as a dynamic living system that emerges through a
    unique balance and interaction of its biological, chemical, and physical components.
    We encourage SSSA members to consider the concept of soil quality (perhaps as
    a marketing tool) and to debate how it might enable us to more effectively meet
    the diverse natural resource needs and concerns of our rural, urban, and suburban
    clientele of today and tomorrow. Citing Literature Volume61, Issue1 January-February

    15, No. 1 Knowledge Networks as Channels and Conduits: The Effects of Spillovers
    in the Boston Biotechnology Community Jason Owen-Smith, Walter W. Powell Published
    Online:1 Feb 2004https://doi.org/10.1287/orsc.1030.0054 Abstract We contend that
    two important, nonrelational, features of formal interorganizational networks—geographic
    propinquity and organizational form—fundamentally alter the flow of information
    through a network. Within regional economies, contractual linkages among physically
    proximate organizations represent relatively transparent channels for information
    transfer because they are embedded in an ecology rich in informal and labor market
    transmission mechanisms. Similarly, we argue that the spillovers that result from
    proprietary alliances are a function of the institutional commitments and practices
    of members of the network. When the dominant nodes in an innovation network are
    committed to open regimes of information disclosure, the entire structure is characterized
    by less tightly monitored ties. The relative accessibility of knowledge transferred
    through contractual linkages to organizations determines whether innovation benefits
    accrue broadly to membership in a coherent network component or narrowly to centrality.
    We draw on novel network visualization methods and conditional fixed effects negative
    binomial regressions to test these arguments for human therapeutic biotechnology
    firms located in the Boston metropolitan area. Previous Back to Top Next Figures

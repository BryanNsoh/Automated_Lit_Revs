    Location: Coimbatore, India SECTION I. Introduction There are many techniques
    available for the precision agriculture to monitor and control, environment for
    the growth of many crops. Due to unequal distribution of rain water, it is very
    difficult to requirement needed farmer to manage the water equally to all the
    crops in whole farm it requires some irrigation method that suitable for any weather
    condition, soil types and variety of crops. Irrigation management is a important
    factor in agriculture allows the farmer to improve the cultivation in a way the
    plants need. According to the requirement of the crops the threshold will be set,
    if the any environmental condition like temperature, soil conditions and humidity
    goes below or above the threshold value, then IOT sense the changing in parameters
    are monitored simultaneously and all the data will be transmitted to farmers,
    according to that farmer will take the controlling decision and send to the system.
    The system will run the actuator and control the parameter. Types of sensor used
    and controlling action that are taken according to them Temperature control -
    Growth of plantation depends on photosynthesis methods that is depends upon the
    radiation from the sun. Humidity control -Water vapour is main problem that''s
    affecting the growth of crops. Because of high humidity, chances of disease are
    increasing. Soil control- Soil water also affects the crop growth. Therefore,
    the monitor & control of soil condition have a specific interest, because the
    good condition of a soil provides the proper yield. The Proposal of the project
    is to develop a smart irrigation monitoring system using Arduino. Focus area will
    be parameters such as temperature and soil moisture. SECTION II. Objective The
    main objective of our project is to work for Farming where various new technologies
    to yield higher growth of the crops and their water supply. We are going to check
    the temperature, humidity, and soil moisture. The paper is all about automated
    control features with latest electronic technology using microcontroller which
    turns the pumping motor ON and OFF on detecting the dampness content of the earth
    and GSM phone line. It works automatically and hence reduces the man power. Irrigation
    is the artificial application of water to the land or soil. It is used to assist
    in growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and revegetation
    of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall. Watering
    systems will reduce the burden of getting water to plants when they need it. Knowing
    when and how much to water is two important aspects of watering process. To make
    the gardener works easily, the automatic plant watering system is created. SECTION
    III. Existing System Now days, water shortage is one of the biggest problem in
    the world. Many different methods are developed for conservation of water. We
    need water in each and every field. Water is considered to be basic need of all
    living creatures. Agriculture is one of the fields where water is required in
    massive quantity. Major problem in agriculture is every time excess of water is
    given to the fields. Many techniques are used to save or to control wastage of
    water from agriculture like Ditch Irrigation, Terraced Irrigation, Sprinkler System
    Rotary Systems. An automatic Smart Irrigation Decision Support System, SIDSS,
    is determined to manage irrigation in agriculture. System estimates the weekly
    irrigations needs of a plantation, on the basis of both soil evaluation and climatic
    variables convoked by several autonomous nodes deployed infield. This enables
    a closed loop control scheme to adapt the decision support system to local perturbations
    and evaluation errors. Two machine learning approach, PLSR and ANFIS, are proposed
    as reasoning engine of our SIDSS. This approach is validated on three commercial
    plantations of citrus trees located in Spain. Performance is evaluated against
    decisions taken by a human expert. The main characteristic of system is the use
    of continuous soil measurements to complement climatic parameters to precisely
    predict the irrigation needs the crops, in contrast with previous works that are
    based only on weather variables or doesn''t indicate the amount of water required
    by the crops. The use of real-time information from the soil specification in
    a closed loop control scheme allows to get used to the decision support system
    to local perturbations, avoiding the accumulative effect due to errors in consecutive
    weekly estimation, and/or detecting if the irrigation calculated for the SIDSS
    has been performed by the farmer. The analysis of the performance of the system
    is accomplished comparing the decisions taken by a human expert and the decision
    support component. Two machine learning techniques, PLSR and ANFIS, have been
    proposed as the basis of our reasoning engine and analysed in order to obtain
    the best performance. Limitations in the Existing System The Existing irrigation
    system does not make the efficient use of water. Water is not fed to the plant
    whenever there is need it leads to water scarcity. Quantity of water is not defined
    for each water supply in irrigation system. SECTION IV. Proposed System The Proposal
    of the project is to develop a smart irrigation monitoring system using Arduino.
    Focus area will be parameters such as temperature and soil moisture. This system
    will be a substitute to classical farming method. We will develop such a system
    that will help a farmer to know his field status in his home or he may be residing
    in any part of the world. It proposes an automatic irrigation system for the agricultural
    lands. Currently the automation is one of the important role in the human life.
    It not only provides comfort but also reduce energy, efficiency and time saving.
    Now the industries are using automation and control machine which is high in cost
    and not suitable for using in a farm field. So here it also designs a smart irrigation
    technology in low cost which is usable by Indian farmers. Arduino is the main
    heart of the whole system. An automated irrigation system was developed to optimize
    water use for agricultural crops. Automation allows us to control appliances automatically.
    The objectives of this paper were to control the water motor automatically and
    we can also watch live streaming of farm on android mobiles by using wi-fi. Advantages
    of the Proposed System The proposed system provides real time information on the
    field irrigation. Here the water is supplied based on the actual needs for the
    crops. This automated irrigation system is cost reduction and resource optimization.
    It improves the environment quality and increases the irrigation. It also reduces
    water logging and water shortages. SECTION V. System Architecture This archetype
    monitors the amount of soil humidity and temperature. A predetermine range of
    soil moisture and temperature is set, and can be varied with soil type or crop
    type. In case the moisture or temperature of the soil diverges from the specified
    range, the watering system is turned on/off. In case of dry soil and high soil
    temperature, it will activate the irrigation system, pumping water for watering
    the plants. Figure 1. System architecture Show All The block diagram of smart
    irrigation system is characterized in Fig1. It consists of a microcontroller (ATmega328)
    which is the brain of the system. Both the moisture and temperature sensors are
    combined to the input pins of the controller. The water pump and the servo motor
    are coupled with the output pins. If the sensors depart from the per-ordinated
    range, the controller turns on pump. The servo motor is used to control the angular
    point of the pipe, which ensures equal diffusion of water to the soil. To reduce
    the amount of field work for the farmer this operation also offers wireless switching
    on-off of pumps for watering, irrigating. Wireless sensor network of soil moisture
    sensor, soil pH sensor and soil temperature sensor is connected to an Arduino
    Mega 2560 micro controller board. The android application controls the pumps over
    GSM network via SMS (which enables pump control over long distances) and Blue-tooth
    (when in close proximity for real time diagnosis of the sensor readings). This
    system can be implemented on a large scale for farming purposes, which can further
    prove to be more beneficial. Owing to prevailing conditions and water shortages,
    the optimum irrigation schedules should be determined especially in farms to conserve
    water. SECTION VI. System Performance and Evaluation This project is implemented
    using Arduino ATmega328. Sensors are connected to Arduino using jumping cables.
    The entire system is observed and controlled by power full credit card sized microcontroller
    Arduino. Basic DC motor are used for automatic water supply. Figure 2. System

    ON mode. Show All Here the Sensor values are evaluated and displayed in system
    monitor using Arduino OS. The motor automatically will be ON based on readings.
    Figure 4. Sensor reading when soil moisture is wet and motor is in OFF mode. Show
    All Here the Sensor values are evaluated and displayed in system monitor using
    Arduino OS. The motor automatically will be OFF based on readings. SECTION VII.
    Conclusion In the present the farmers use irrigation approach through the manual
    control, in which the farmers irrigate the land at regular intervals. This process
    seems to consume more water and results in water wastage. Moreover, in dry areas
    where there is inadequate rainfall, irrigation becomes difficult. Hence, we require
    an automatic system that will precisely monitor and control the water essential
    in the field. Installing Smart irrigation system saves time and ensures judicious
    usage of water. Moreover, this architecture uses micro-controller which promises
    an increase in system life by reducing power consumption. The entire system is
    monitored and controlled by the power full credit card sized micro-controller
    Arduino. It provides with several benefits and can achieve with less manpower.
    The system provides water only when the humidity in the soil goes below the reference.
    Due to the direct transfer of water to the roots water management takes place
    and also helps to maintain the moisture to soil ratio at the root zone consistent
    to some extent. Thus, the system is efficient and compatible to changing environment.
    Our Future work involves, a water meter installed to estimate the amount of water
    used for irrigation and thus giving a cost estimation. A valve can be used for
    varying the volume of water flow. Furthermore, Wireless sensors can also be used.

    \ & Agricultural Engineering, Agricultural University of Athens,\n11855 Athens,\
    \ Greece; maraveas@aua.gr\nAbstract: This article presents the current state-of-the-art\
    \ research on applying artiﬁcial intelligence\n(AI) technology in smart greenhouses\
    \ to optimize crop yields, water, and fertilizer use efﬁciency, to\nreduce pest\
    \ and disease, and to enhance agricultural sustainability. The key technologies\
    \ of interest\nwere robotic systems for pesticide application, irrigation, harvesting,\
    \ bio-inspired algorithms for the\nautomation of greenhouse processes, energy\
    \ management, machine path planning and operation of\nUAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles),\
    \ resolution of scheduling problems, and image signal processing for\npest and\
    \ disease diagnosis. Additionally, the review investigated the cost beneﬁts of\
    \ various energy-\nmanagement and AI-based energy-saving technologies, the integration\
    \ of photovoltaics and dynamic\npricing based on real-time and time-of-use metrics,\
    \ and the cost beneﬁts of LoRa, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth,\nZigBee, mobile, and RFID (radiofrequency\
    \ identiﬁcation) technologies. The review established that\ncommercially viable\
    \ AI technologies for agriculture had increased exponentially. For example, AI-\n\
    based irrigation and soil fertilizer application enabled farmers to realize higher\
    \ returns on investment\non fertilizer application and gross returns above the\
    \ fertilizer cost, higher yields, and resource use\nefﬁciency. Similarly, AI image\
    \ detection techniques led to the early diagnosis of powdery mildew. The\nprecise\
    \ operation of agricultural robots was supported by the integration of light imaging,\
    \ detection,\nand ranging (LIDAR) optical and electro-optical cameras in place\
    \ of the traditional GPS (geographic\npositioning systems) technologies, which\
    \ are prone to errors. However, critical challenges remained\nunresolved, including\
    \ cost, disparities between research and development (R&D) innovations and\ntechnology\
    \ commercialization, energy use, the tradeoff between accuracy and computational\
    \ speeds,\nand technology gaps between the Global North and South. In general,\
    \ the value of this review is\nthat it surveys the literature on the maturity\
    \ level of various AI technologies in smart greenhouses\nand offers a state-of-the-art\
    \ picture of how far the technologies have successfully been applied in\nagriculture\
    \ and what can be done to optimize their usability.\nKeywords: greenhouses; agriculture;\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence; intelligent; algorithms; robotics\n1. Introduction\n\
    The AI systems of interest include bio-inspired ecological and swarm intelligence\
    \ algo-\nrithms, unmanned UAVs (Unmanned aerial vehicles) for pesticide application,\
    \ and robotic\nsystems for harvesting, irrigation, soil treatment, fertilizer\
    \ application, and seeding [1,2]. In\naddition, the study critiques the role of\
    \ swarm intelligence (genetic optimization algorithms\nand related algorithms)\
    \ in agricultural parameter optimization, machinery path planning,\nrobotic ﬂight,\
    \ resolution of scheduling problems, system identiﬁcation, power systems,\nand\
    \ image and signal processing [1,2]. The multidimensional view of AI (artiﬁcial\
    \ intelli-\ngence) technologies in smart greenhouses would provide a nuanced understanding\
    \ of the\nrecent milestones in research and development and their implications\
    \ for commercial and\nsmallholder agriculture in the developed global north (North\
    \ America, Western Europe,\nMediterranean region, China, Japan, and South Korea)\
    \ and underdeveloped global south\n(Africa, Latin America, and South Asia) [3].\n\

    Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n2 of 35\nEmerging technology companies, such as Blue\
    \ River Technology, Harvest CROO\nRobotics, Trace Genomics, and Autonomous Tractor\
    \ Corp were leading in the commer-\ncial deployment of self-driving agricultural\
    \ tractors, AI-based weed control systems, pest\ndiagnostics, soil analysis, and\
    \ crop health monitoring [4,5]. In line with [4,5], Karnawat\net al. [6] acknowledged\
    \ the immense role played by Blue River Technology in the advance-\nment of robotics\
    \ and AI systems in agriculture in California and the US in general. These\nemerging\
    \ trends of AI and machine learning (ML) in agriculture need to be summarized\
    \ to\nprovide a comprehensive overview of the state of the art (i.e., maturity\
    \ levels of various\nAI applications in agriculture, including barriers and facilitators)\
    \ and insights into future\ndevelopments [7].\nMany factors dictate the need to\
    \ review the maturity levels of various AI applications\nin agriculture. First,\
    \ there is increasing demand for technological solutions to address\nglobal food\
    \ insecurities, especially in the Global South. Currently, at least 810 million\n\
    people are food insecure. The actual ratio would increase over time in line with\
    \ the global\npopulation growth. By 2050, the global population will surpass 9\
    \ billion [8,9]. The higher\npopulation growth within a generation would strain\
    \ the already fragile agricultural systems\nand ecosystems that are being gradually\
    \ destroyed to create additional land for farming.\nIddio et al. argued that controlled\
    \ environment agriculture (CEA) using greenhouses\nmight help to offset the pressing\
    \ concerns about agricultural sustainability [10]. The case\nfor greenhouse-based\
    \ CEA was validated by the fact that greenhouse crop cultivation\nimproves yields\
    \ and reduces the need for excess pesticides, water, land, and transportation\n\
    of crops over extended distances. The case for CEA advanced by [10] was in tandem\
    \ with\nAfzali et al. [11], who supported the intensiﬁcation of agricultural technologies.\
    \ The need\nfor a paradigm shift in agricultural cultivation was premised on the\
    \ increasing risk of\nglobal starvation [12]. The AI-mediated improvements in\
    \ crop yields may help avert the\nforecasted global food crises.\nSecond, a large\
    \ body of knowledge, including the evidence presented by Senavirathne\net al.\
    \ [13] and Haque et al. [12], suggested that the satisfaction of future food needs\
    \ would be\nachieved by optimizing the existing crop production technologies,\
    \ given there was limited\narable land for agricultural expansion [14]. In line\
    \ with [14], Lakshmi and Corbett [15]\nestimated that smart technology in agriculture\
    \ may help boost yields by 60% before 2030.\nConservative estimates indicate the\
    \ EU market for precision agriculture systems will\nsurpass 11.8 billion by 2025\
    \ [16]. The projected market growth and higher yields catalyzed\nthe current greenhouse\
    \ boom. As of 2020, there were 3.6 million hectares of greenhouse\ncrops globally\
    \ [17–22].\nThird, current climate projection models forecast suppressed rainfall,\
    \ land degradation,\ndesertiﬁcation, ﬂooding, and other weather phenomena triggered\
    \ by climate change and\nincreased release of greenhouse gases [23,24]. The projections\
    \ documented by [23,24]\nreﬂected the current realities in Sub-Saharan Africa\
    \ [25]. The expansion of open-ﬁeld\nagriculture to offset climate-related challenges\
    \ is no longer a viable option. The European\nCommission Joint Research Centre\
    \ estimated that three-quarters of the useful land on\nearth was already degraded,\
    \ and the proportion of degraded land would surpass 90% by\n2050 [26]. The challenge\
    \ is most pronounced in developing countries that experienced the\nhighest dryland\
    \ desertiﬁcation rate between 1982 and 2015. During this period, at least\n5.4\
    \ million km2 of land was degraded [27]. In theory, losing traditional farming\
    \ dryland\nwas a sufﬁcient motivational factor for transitioning to smart greenhouses\
    \ powered by AI\ntechnologies. However, the contrary phenomenon is true for climate-smart\
    \ agriculture\nworldwide [28]. The current pace of transition does not match the\
    \ challenges. On a\npositive note, the transition to precision agriculture would\
    \ enable farmers to optimally\nuse water, soil, and energy resources to minimize\
    \ the negative effects of climate change on\nfarming [29]. The rational use of\
    \ agricultural resources would reduce the pressure on the\nnatural environment,\
    \ resulting in higher sustainability.\nThe article critiques recent research on\
    \ smart greenhouses and artiﬁcial intelligence\ntechnologies, including the favorable\
    \ factors and the challenges that have impeded the\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n\
    3 of 35\ngrowth of AI and smart greenhouse technologies. The study emphasized\
    \ smart farming\ntechnologies, mechanization of farms, smart micro-irrigation,\
    \ rapid soil analysis, pest\nprediction, and autonomous modiﬁcation of the greenhouse\
    \ microclimate, and LIDAR\n(light Imaging, detection, and ranging), optical and\
    \ electro-optical cameras for robotic\nsystem motion and object identiﬁcation\
    \ (see Figure 1) [30]. The speciﬁc scope was supported\nby the gaps in research\
    \ and the breadth of information relating to the impact of AI and IoT\n(Internet\
    \ of Things) and data-driven agriculture, intelligent crop planning, and farm\
    \ gate-\nto-fork systems [31,32]. More particularly, no review has so far comprehensively\
    \ mapped\nthe state of AI and IoT application in smart greenhouse farming to help\
    \ researchers and\nfarmers of plant factories to solve the imminent problems related\
    \ to global food insecurities\nand climate change, despite the fact that technological\
    \ innovations have been centrally\nplaced in the development of effective and\
    \ sustainable solutions to these challenges. Thus,\nthis review will enable farmers\
    \ of factory plants to understand the extent to which AI\nand IoT can be combined\
    \ to improve farming efﬁciency and productivity and will enable\nresearchers to\
    \ advance knowledge on this subject domain by building on the research\nachieved\
    \ so far.\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14 \n3 of 36 \n \nThe article critiques recent\

    \ subsystems with a unique combination\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n6 of 35\nof sensors\
    \ and controls with distinct attributes [13]. The impact of weeds, pests, diseases,\n\
    and water stress on crop yields validated the broadening scope of AI in precision\
    \ agriculture.\nEgorov et al. [59] noted that livermore was a pervasive weed across\
    \ the US, impacting the\ngermination and growth of plants. In line with Egorov\
    \ et al., [8,59] noted that improper\nmanagement of weeds could potentially reduce\
    \ crop yields by 48–60%. However, the\nprojected reduction in crop yields due\
    \ to pest infestation observed by [8] contrasts with\nRaatz et al., who reported\
    \ up to 60% losses in harvests due to pest infestation [60], but\nattributed the\
    \ phenomena to biotic culprits, including weed growth. Despite the contrasting\n\
    observations made by Raatz et al. [60] and [8], poor management of crop pests\
    \ and diseases\nhad a detrimental effect on crop yields. The devastating impact\
    \ of South American tomato\npinworm on sweet pepper and tomato in Almería, Southeastern\
    \ Spain, was a case in\npoint [61]. In the latter case, the Spanish farmers had\
    \ to rely on toxic pesticides, such\nas Chlorpyrifos-methyl, to manage the pests\
    \ [61,62]. Reducing human exposure to toxic\npesticides through the mechanization\
    \ of greenhouse spraying activities yielded signiﬁcant\nbeneﬁts in the long term\
    \ [63]. Additionally, intelligent IPM (Integrated pest management)\npractices\
    \ may offset the emerging pesticide resistance threats.\n2.2. Current AI Technologies\
    \ for Agriculture\nThe AI technologies available for smart greenhouses and precision\
    \ agriculture are\ndiverse, ranging from ecological bio-inspired algorithms, such\
    \ as Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy\nInference System–Particle Swarm Optimization (ANFIS-PSO),\
    \ ANFIS-GA (ANFIS with\nGenetic Algorithm) and ANFIS-ACO (ANFIS with Ant Colony\
    \ Optimization), swarm intel-\nligence algorithms (Artiﬁcial Bee Colony (ABC),\
    \ Flower Pollination algorithm (FPA), Fireﬂy\nalgorithm, Krill Herd algorithm,\
    \ and genetic optimization algorithms) [64] to UAV (drones)\npesticide application\
    \ and robotic systems for harvesting [9], irrigation, soil treatment, seed-\n\
    ing, fertilizer application, seeding, and other tasks [1,2]. The current body\
    \ of knowledge\nlinked the demand for robotics, UAVs, and bio-inspired algorithms\
    \ in agriculture to distinct\nfactors. On the one hand, scholars argued that the\
    \ growth was catalyzed by the need to\nenhance yields and operational efﬁciency\
    \ and reduce costs [8,29,33]. In line with [5,29,33],\nCao et al. reported a 10%\
    \ improvement in tomato yields with the iGrow intelligent green-\nhouse system\
    \ and 92% higher proﬁts [18]. On the other hand, AI assimilation in smart\nagriculture\
    \ was triggered by natural events, including higher levels of pesticide resistance\n\
    and forest ﬁres, which compromised agricultural production [65,66]. The following\
    \ sections\ncritiqued the two worldviews to yield better insights into the favorable\
    \ factors and barriers\nto AI-system adoption in smart greenhouses and precision\
    \ agriculture at large.\n2.2.1. Cost Beneﬁts of AI Technologies for Agriculture\n\
    The focus on the role of AI systems in smart greenhouses and the agricultural\
    \ sector,\nin general, was validated by the unique challenges and the enormous\
    \ contribution in terms\nof Gross Value Added (GVA). Agriculture provided direct\
    \ employment to approximately\n4.4% of the population in Europe, and its GVA exceeded\
    \ €181 billion [67]. The scenario\nwas not speciﬁc to the EU; at least 70% of\
    \ the Indian population depended on agriculture\nfor employment and sustenance\
    \ [68]. Despite the enormous contribution, the future of\nagriculture in Europe\
    \ and across the world is threatened by population dynamics; most\nEuropean farmers\
    \ are older (>80%), while a minority are below 40 years [67]. In contrast to\n\
    the European Economic and Social Committee’s report [67] on the impact of demographics\n\
    on agricultural technology adoption, Loudjani et al. [69] argued that the primary\
    \ barriers\nwere time and costs.\nThe average cost of installing AI systems on\
    \ farms was enormous and beyond the reach\nof smallholder farmers [70]. The contrary\
    \ was true for large commercial farms with a higher\ncapacity to absorb costs\
    \ and risks and a higher tendency to allocate resources for capital-\nintensive\
    \ investments [71]. The concerns raised by Kendall et al. [70] were supported\
    \ by the\nCisco and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) report [72],\
    \ which noted that\nagricultural sensors for AI systems with greater functionality\
    \ are expensive ($150–$1000+\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n7 of 35\nper sensor). The\
    \ initial capital outlay was a key impediment to technology adoption,\nconsidering\
    \ that multiple sensors are required for monitoring greenhouse microclimate\n\
    (humidity, temperature, soil nutrient, water levels, and pH). From another dimension,\n\
    the expenses were relative, given that local production of smart greenhouse components\n\
    may offset costs [73]; this view was corroborated by Chung’s study [73] on South\
    \ Korean\ncompanies Hyundai Metal Farming Company, Sewoon, DaeSungHione, and Dae\
    \ Ryun\nand local production of precision farming systems, such as sensors, actuators,\
    \ fans, heaters,\ndehumidiﬁers, and window motors. In contrast, there was insufﬁcient\
    \ production capacity\nin developing countries.\nThe cost-centric worldview advanced\
    \ by Kendall et al. [70] and Loudjani et al. [69]\nnegated the role of externalities.\
    \ Lakshmi and Corbett [18] argued that the effectiveness of\nAI systems was largely\
    \ dependent on the willingness of the local stakeholders to “modify,\ngenerate,\
    \ and extend their operational capabilities to improve efﬁciency” (p. 5209). Ad-\n\
    ditionally, the processes, AI resources, and tools (including drones, sensors,\
    \ and robots)\nemployed by commercial farms profoundly impacted the effectiveness\
    \ of AI systems.\nDrawing from Lakshmi and Corbett’s study [18], the cost was\
    \ not a primary barrier to AI\ntechnology adoption.\n2.2.2. Water and Fertilizer\
    \ Use Efﬁciency and Crop Yields with AI Systems\nThe success of the GOSSYM (a\
    \ combined simulation model for plant growth and deci-\nsion) aid for cotton crop\
    \ management mode inﬂuenced the iterative development of other\nAI systems, including\
    \ the HortiMED-AI-powered Decision Support Systems (DSSs) [74].\nOn a positive\
    \ note, the barriers to the transition from labor- and input-intensive agriculture\n\
    to knowledge-based farming would be eliminated over time; this is evident with\
    \ the recent\ninnovations in AI systems for smart/precision agriculture. In 2022,\
    \ Otazua reported the\nsuccessful development of the HortiMED-AI-powered decision\
    \ support systems (DSSs) that\nfacilitated autonomous greenhouse control using\
    \ sensors, “multilayer hierarchical control\narchitecture,” smart algorithms,\
    \ “hybrid modeling combining well-known mechanistic\nmodels with AI techniques,”\
    \ IoT, and machine learning (p. 1) [74]. The HortiMED-DSS was\ncapable of facilitating\
    \ cost-effective automation of greenhouse heating, ventilation, and\nfertigation,\
    \ and providing expert services relating to nutrient, crop, and climatic conditions\n\
    (fertilizer and water application rates and timelines).\nThe observations made\
    \ by [74] regarding the beneﬁts of automating greenhouse were\nin tandem with\
    \ Cui et al. [75]; precision irrigation and fertilizer application led to higher\n\
    nitrogen use and water use efﬁciency, and in turn, a lower risk of pests and diseases\n\
    in greenhouse cucumbers in China’s Yangling region. The observations made by Cui\n\
    et al. [75] about AI-mediated water-use efﬁciency corroborated the study by Lin\
    \ et al.,\nwhich noted that AI technologies provided water to crops within their\
    \ demand ranges [76].\nFrom a theoretical point of view, Cui et al. [75] and Lin\
    \ et al. [76] advanced a simplistic\nview of sensor operation, which did not align\
    \ with Briciu-Burghina et al. [77]. In the\nlatter case, Briciu-Burghina et al.\
    \ [77] argued that the accuracy of the soil moisture sensors\nwas dependent on\
    \ hardware components and environmental degradation of the sensor\ncomponents.\
    \ In line with Briciu-Burghina et al. [77], there were cases when the dielectric\n\
    soil moisture sensors failed to accurately measure periodic changes in the soil\
    \ moisture\nlevels; this had a negative domino effect on demand irrigation. The\
    \ faulty measurements\nwere linked to either corrosion or hardware malfunction.\
    \ The outcome reported by Briciu-\nBurghina et al. [77] negated the impact of\
    \ soil type on sensor malfunction—an issue that was\nextensively investigated\
    \ by Shamshiri et al. [78]. The study conﬁrmed that the “resistive\nsensor operates\
    \ defectively in sandy loam and clay loam soils owing to low bulk density\nand\
    \ high organic matter” (p. 5) Emerging research recommended the adoption of capacitive\n\
    soil moisture sensors to counteract the limitations of the resistive sensors.\n\
    From the researcher’s perspective, the risk of corrosion was disproportionately\
    \ higher,\nconsidering the dielectric sensors were buried in situ and the soils\
    \ were humid [77]. The\nrisk of sensor malfunction highlights the potential drawbacks\
    \ and limits of demand-driven\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n8 of 35\nagriculture.\
    \ Despite the mounting evidence on the risk of a sensor malfunction, the\ntechnology\
    \ issues are often disregarded due to cost considerations and the anticipated\
    \ cost\nsavings. Cui et al. [75] reported a 17.5% higher cucumber yield following\
    \ the introduction\nof AI-based irrigation, while the partial factor productivity\
    \ of applied nitrogen increased by\n29%. Similarly, with AI-based systems, Sharma\
    \ et al. [79] reported a 17% improvement in\nwheat grain yields. Considering the\
    \ outcomes were statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.005), AI-\nbased irrigation and\
    \ fertilizer application yielded tangible beneﬁts compared to traditional\ndrip\
    \ irrigation and manual soil fertilization. The positive outcomes reported by\
    \ Cui\net al. [75] were consistent with the Sharma et al. case study in Saudi\
    \ Arabia, where superior\npartial factor productivity of applied nitrogen with\
    \ ANN (Artiﬁcial neural network) models\nwas established [79]. Since no experimental\
    \ data contradicted the positive ﬁndings made by\nCui et al. [75] and Sharma et\
    \ al. [79], it appears that the AI technologies were cost-effective\nand may enable\
    \ farmers to achieve higher returns on investment on fertilizer application\n\
    and gross returns above the fertilizer cost.\nThe use-efﬁciency-related beneﬁts\
    \ that emerged from applying fertilizers were compa-\nrable to pesticide-use efﬁciency.\
    \ Facchinetti et al. [80] reported a 50% reduction in the use\nof pesticides based\
    \ on an initial theoretical mixture of 1000 L/ha. The introduction of com-\nputational\
    \ algorithms helped to reduce the demand for pesticides to 470 L/ha. The study\n\
    conﬁrmed that the pesticide application rates could be further reduced to 300\
    \ L/ha [80].\nFacchinetti et al. hypothesized a 33% reduction in pesticide use\
    \ [80], which does not match\nClaver’s research, which noted it was possible to\
    \ reduce pesticide usage by up to 78% using\nthe state-of-the-art algorithm systems\
    \ developed by Israel-based Greeneye Technology [81].\nSimilarly, Shankar et al.\
    \ postulated that intelligent technologies enabled farmers to practice\nvariable\
    \ rate application (VAR), which provided real-time data on the areas most infested\n\
    with pests and diseases [82]. The utility of the VAR was further reinforced by\
    \ the xarvio\nSpray Timer and SprayWeather, which enabled farmers to establish\
    \ the most appropriate\nwindow for spraying. Drawing from the empirical data provided\
    \ by [82], VAR eliminated\nthe need to apply excessive fertilizers in areas least\
    \ affected by pesticides, and was an ideal\nalternative compared to the system\
    \ proposed by Facchinetti et al. [80]. The use of fewer\npesticides in the production\
    \ of freshly cut salads had a beneﬁcial effect on human health,\nconsidering pesticide\
    \ residues in foods were risk factors for myriad non-communicable\ndiseases.\n\
    On the downside, the beneﬁts that accrue from DSS, VAR for pesticides, xarvio\n\
    Spray Timer and SprayWeather, AI-based fertilizer, irrigation, and other systems\
    \ may\nbe less relevant to remote areas with limited IT infrastructure and technical\
    \ expertise [8].\nHowever, these challenges may not persist in the long term,\
    \ considering the high pace of IT\ninfrastructure deployment in rural and urban\
    \ areas, previously classiﬁed as unproﬁtable for\nsuch ventures [83]. From another\
    \ perspective, the deployment of IT infrastructure would\nonly provide a partial\
    \ solution, given the aging of the population was also a major issue of\nconcern.\n\
    2.3. AI Systems for Integrated Pest Management\nDespite the concerns raised about\
    \ the prohibitive costs, the proponents of AI argue that\nthe long-term beneﬁts\
    \ outweigh the short-term costs [84,85]. The reliable use of AI systems\nto predict\
    \ rice production was a case in point [85]. Beyond the prediction of crop production,\n\
    AI systems facilitated the development of intelligent IPM systems capable of detecting\
    \ early\ninfestation of white ﬂies (Trialeurodes vaporariorum and Bemisia argentifolii)\
    \ and thrips (Thrips\ntabaci, Frankliniella intonsa, Thrips hawaiiensis, and Thrips\
    \ tabaci) [57]. The observations made\nby Rustia et al. [57] reinforce earlier\
    \ observations made by Karar et al. [14] on the suitability\nof deep learning\
    \ systems in the management of pests and diseases. From a commercial\nperspective,\
    \ the ﬁndings reported by Rustia et al. [57] and Karar et al. [14] were compelling,\n\
    but inadequate for catalyzing a paradigm shift in the market; this view was reinforced\n\
    by the fact that the existing stock of Al systems for pest identiﬁcation and management\n\
    focused on insect pheromone identiﬁcation [86]. The pheromone-centric ANN and\
    \ wireless\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n9 of 35\nsensor network (WSN) technology\
    \ cannot control all insect types, considering there is a\nlimited number of commercially\
    \ available pheromones for IPM [86].\nDespite the reservations reported by Singh\
    \ et al. [86], the ANN–WSN system for pest\nidentiﬁcation accurately categorized\
    \ harmful and beneﬁcial insects; these data guided the\ncalculation of the volume\
    \ of pesticides for IPM. The limits of WSN technology highlighted\nby [86] were\
    \ in tandem with [87], who noted that variable monitoring ranges, complex\ntypologies,\
    \ and environmental conditions compromised the operation of WSN systems.\nHowever,\
    \ recent R&D evidence suggests otherwise. The shortcomings of WSN identiﬁed\n\
    by [86,87] negate recent milestones achieved by Sacaleanu et al. [88] with wireless\
    \ sensors\nand actuators networks (WSAN). WSAN is an upgrade of WSN developed\
    \ to resolve most\nof the limitations of WSN using actuators for better monitoring\
    \ and control.\nThe advances made using WSAN have not been accompanied by greater\
    \ market adop-\ntion, owing to the newness of the technology; most studies still\
    \ focus on WSN technologies\nfor smart greenhouses [19,89]. Beyond the concerns\
    \ about the pace of market adoption, the\nbody of knowledge, including Rustia\
    \ et al. [57], Singh et al. [86], and Karar et al. [14], was\ninformed by small-scale\
    \ experiments under controlled conditions. Real-life applications\nof AI systems\
    \ (IRIS scout robots and robot scouts) in identifying pests and diseases in\n\
    agriculture yielded false positive data after analyzing pheromone trap images\
    \ and powdery\nmildew [90]. Since the latter ﬁndings were based on market data,\
    \ the IRIS scout robots\nand robot scouts were not ready for market adoption.\
    \ Inaccurate assessment of pests and\ndisease infestation using AI and ML (machine\
    \ learning) image analysis techniques would\nresult in the excessive application\
    \ of pesticides. Further research and development efforts\nwere necessary to minimize\
    \ false positive rates.\n2.4. Robotics and Algorithms for Precision Agriculture\
    \ and Smart Greenhouses\nRecently, commercial farms have deployed robotic systems\
    \ to selectively harvest\nfragile fruits and vegetables such as broccoli and tomatoes\
    \ [91]. The ﬁndings by [91] were\nin agreement with Lee et al. [92], who documented\
    \ the increased use of robotic systems\nto sort tomatoes based on color, size,\
    \ shape, and mass and to identify all defects during\nthe harvesting process.\
    \ The case for AI robotic systems in smart farming advanced by\nKootstra et al.\
    \ [91] was corroborated by Vidwath et al. [93] and Navas et al. [94], who\nhighlighted\
    \ the beneﬁts of soft robotic grippers in fruit and vegetable harvesting. In\n\
    contrast to Vidwath et al. [93] and Navas et al. [94], Tianhua et al. [95] argued\
    \ that AI robotic\nsystems could perform a wide range of unsafe greenhouse tasks\
    \ beyond harvesting. Such\napplications include pesticide spraying and UV-C treatment\
    \ of crops to mitigate the spread\nof powdery mildew. From a human health perspective,\
    \ Tianhua et al. [95] perspective\non the use of robotic systems for pesticide\
    \ application was validated by pesticide toxicity\nstudies [61,62,96]. For example,\
    \ Chlorpyrifos-methyl, a common pesticide employed in\nintegrated pest management\
    \ of the South American tomato pinworm, caused cholinesterase\ninhibition in humans\
    \ and death in severe cases [62]. In other studies, mechanical AI systems\nenabled\
    \ farmers to reduce their labor requirements by up to 90% [13]. However, the actual\n\
    reduction rates can be contested, considering robots cannot entirely replace human\
    \ labor.\nEmpirical data supported the arguments concerning costs and operational\
    \ efﬁciency\nof AI systems in farms. Hou et al. [97] used Dynamic Artiﬁcial Bee–Ant\
    \ Colony algorithm\n(DABACA) to optimize agricultural machinery plant operational\
    \ cycle and route plan-\nning. The study reported better optimization, convergence\
    \ accuracy (>90%), and reduced\noperational cycles, which translated to signiﬁcant\
    \ cost savings. The observations made\nby Hou et al. [97] using DABACA were in\
    \ line with Cao et al. [98], whose bio-inspired\nalgorithm-mediated task assignment\
    \ of agricultural machinery, which employed ant colony\nalgorithm-based B-patterns\
    \ to improve the operational efﬁciency of agricultural equipment,\nincluding the\
    \ fuel used and non-working distance covered during routine farm opera-\ntions.\
    \ However, critics argue that the positive outcomes drawn from experimental studies,\n\
    such as the observations made by Hou et al. [97] and Cao et al. [98], did not\
    \ justify the\nwidespread adoption of AI systems in greenhouses. The concerns\
    \ were premised on the\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n10 of 35\nfollowing factors.\
    \ First, AI systems in agriculture lacked standardized accuracy rates. The\nsystem\
    \ accuracy varied depending on the local environmental conditions and operational\n\
    factors. Second, the risk of error remained regardless of the algorithm’s robustness\
    \ [99,100].\nHowever, the higher risk of errors was not ubiquitous. Proietti et\
    \ al. established that RNN\n(Recurrent neural network)-based decoder–encoder systems\
    \ exhibited great potential in\nthe early detection of anomalies [101]. Similarly,\
    \ Aytenfsu et al. noted that Elman Recurrent\nNeural Network (ERNN) was 98% accurate\
    \ in predicting greenhouse temperature and\nhumidity levels. The case-speciﬁc\
    \ error theory provided better context concerning the\nbeneﬁts and limits of AI\
    \ systems in smart greenhouses. Even though [99,100] raised valid\nconcerns about\
    \ the constraints, commercial adoption should be encouraged.\nThe positive assessment\
    \ of AI systems in commercial agriculture was validated by suc-\ncessful commercial\
    \ adoption. For example, Gao et al. [102] used an ANN model to quantify\ncrop\
    \ evapotranspiration rates in Saudi Arabia. The ANN model yielded better estimates\n\
    than traditional approaches to estimating evapotranspiration. Accurate determination\n\
    of the plant evapotranspiration rates provided useful data for automated irrigation\
    \ algo-\nrithms. Beyond the estimation of the crop evapotranspiration rates, the\
    \ ANN and WDNN\nalgorithms were equally proven useful in predicting the photosynthetic\
    \ rates of plants,\namong other physiological indices that predict plant growth\
    \ rates and yield [103]. In other\ncases, hybrid algorithms were proven reliable\
    \ in weed prediction/optimization [104,105],\nand the determination of the soil\
    \ cation exchange capacity [106]. The positive assessment\nof ANN technologies\
    \ reinforces earlier observations by Proietti et al. [101] on the fusion\nof deep\
    \ learning and artiﬁcial intelligence (RNN encoders and LSTM (Long Short-Term\n\
    Memory)) to facilitate learning patterns in time series and modeling data sequences\
    \ using\nmonitored parameters to predict crop growth indicators in greenhouses.\
    \ The case for RNN\nadvanced by Proietti et al. [101] negated critical shortcomings\
    \ identiﬁed by Codeluppi\net al. [107]; NN systems were inferior to LSTM owing\
    \ to the long time series and vanishing\ngradient problem, which made it difﬁcult\
    \ to train the model on long-term dependencies.\nThe latter ﬁndings validate the\
    \ emerging transition from LSTM to RNN.\nGao et al. [102] and Hu et al.’s [103]\
    \ bias toward new algorithms for greenhouses\nwas validated by the following considerations.\
    \ First, modern greenhouses are complex;\nthere are dynamic relationships between\
    \ different greenhouse parameters, and the data\nmining ability of traditional\
    \ models is insufﬁcient to facilitate the extraction of all useful\ninformation.\
    \ Second, the traditional models’ low precision and convergence speeds made\n\
    them incompatible with modern intelligent greenhouses. On the downside, the research\n\
    of Gao et al. [102] and Hu et al. [103] negated the fact that the transition from\
    \ traditional\nto modern algorithms does not automatically translate to higher\
    \ prediction accuracy and\nsensitivity. The hybrid algorithms must be combined\
    \ with the appropriate classiﬁers to\nyield better accuracy and speciﬁcity [105].\
    \ For example, Tao and Wei achieved a 92%\naccuracy with the CNN (Convolutional\
    \ Neural Network)-Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nalgorithm for weed recognition\
    \ [104]. However, SVM coupled with the ANN algorithm\nproved inferior compared\
    \ to the emerging class of deep learning models. CNN was paired\nwith SVM because\
    \ the former exhibited satisfactory results in computer pattern recognition,\n\
    but unsatisfactory results in artiﬁcial differentiation of weeds. The SVM model\
    \ helped to\naddress this challenge [104]. In contrast to Tao and Wei [104], Emamgholizadeh\
    \ et al. [106]\nproposed a three-model algorithm integrating particle swarm, integrated\
    \ invasive weed\noptimization, and support vector for accurate weed recognition.\n\
    Drawing from the latter study, the development of algorithms for evaluating green-\n\
    house parameters should be customized to match local conditions and requirements.\
    \ The\nﬁndings of Emamgholizadeh et al. [106] were corroborated by Ibrahim et\
    \ al., who noted that\nthe integrated particle swarm algorithm was ideal for selecting\
    \ discriminant features [108].\nOn the downside, widespread adoption is constrained\
    \ by a paucity of temporal data for\nprecise predictions and training of AI and\
    \ ML systems. Karnawat et al. argued that the\nlack of suitable historical data\
    \ would be a critical impediment to the adoption of AI sys-\ntems in agriculture.\
    \ The latter ﬁndings contradict the positive narratives advanced by\nAppl. Sci.\
    \ 2023, 13, 14\n11 of 35\nEmamgholizadeh et al. [106] and Ibrahim et al. [108]\
    \ concerning the immense potential of\nCNN and ANN algorithms in intelligent farming.\
    \ The increased reliance on bio-inspired\nalgorithms in crop irrigation is justiﬁed,\
    \ given traditional irrigation methods resulted in a\n60% waste of water resources\
    \ [38]. The suitability of different algorithms in predicting the\nevapotranspiration\
    \ rates is depicted in Table 1. The data show that ELM-GA, ELM-CSA,\nELM-ACO,\
    \ and ELM PFA were ideal models for determining the evapotranspiration rates,\n\
    since the R2 (coefﬁcient of determination) values were close to unity. In addition,\
    \ the rela-\ntive mean, standard error, and mean of absolute value of errors (MAE)\
    \ values were within\nthe acceptable range [109]. The performance of ELM-GA/CSA/CSO/PFA\
    \ raises questions\non whether bio-inspired algorithms are better than traditional\
    \ ones. Such concerns were\ninformed by the study of Chahidi et al., which achieved\
    \ comparable R2, RSME (Relative\nStandard Mean Error), and MAE values using ANN,\
    \ SVM, and Gaussian process regression\ntechniques [110]. Following the comparison\
    \ of the validation and test performance, it was\ndeduced that the choice of ANN/SVM,\
    \ GPR vis-à-vis ELM-GA/CSA/CSO/PFA should\nconsider other variables beyond R2,\
    \ RSME, and MAE. The observations were justiﬁed\nby the model-speciﬁc training\
    \ time and performance in the validation phase [110]. The\nselection of the appropriate\
    \ algorithm is key to collecting reliable real-time data using\nsensors to help\
    \ eliminate excessive waste of water, pesticides, and fertilizers.\nTable 1. Evapotranspiration\

    \ and cost considerations [115] and the mixed beneﬁts of\nbio-pesticide formulations\
    \ (such as succinic acid and methanolic extract of Rosmarinus ofﬁci-\nnalis) [96].\
    \ The case for the biological control interventions by Homayoonzadeh et al. [96]\n\
    was in line with the research of Arnaouty et al. [116], which afﬁrmed that biological\
    \ control\nagents were effective compared to the traditional chemical agents (including\
    \ Radiant 12%\nSC, Kanemite 15% SC and Actra 25% WG) in the management of pests,\
    \ including whiteﬂy,\nFrankliniella occidentalis, and ﬂower thrips [116]. In addition\
    \ to the superior efﬁcacy of the\nbiological control agents, the sweet pepper\
    \ plants exhibited superior yields (35% better)\nfollowing treatment with the\
    \ biological control agents. Despite the positive observations\nmade by Homayoonzadeh\
    \ et al. [96] and Arnaouty et al. [116], one must acknowledge\nthat the effectiveness\
    \ of the biological control agents is contingent on the seasons and the\nAppl.\
    \ Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n13 of 35\nintensity of the pests and disease. The biological\
    \ control agents might be less effective if\nthere is a high intensity of pests\
    \ and diseases. Other major issues of concern with biological\ncontrol agents\
    \ include the mixed performance of the biological control agents.\nDespite the\
    \ reservations, the emphasis on biological rather than commercial IPM\ntechnicals\
    \ by Homayoonzadeh et al. [96] and Arnaouty et al. [116] represents an emerg-\n\
    ing pattern in commercial agriculture, guided by the need to conserve the environment\n\
    and reduce pesticide resistance—a phenomenon that is most common with commercial\n\
    pesticides [75]. For example, studies conducted in the Russian Federation established\
    \ that\nmites gradually became resistant to avermectin pesticides in the past\
    \ 20 years [117]. The\nobservations made by [117] in the Russian Federation were\
    \ comparable to the research of\nKirisik and Dagli’s [118] and Solmaz et al. [66]\
    \ in Turkey, where farmers recorded higher\nTetranychus Urtic resistance to Bifenazate\
    \ and Abamectin. The observations made by Kirisik\nand Dagli [118] and Solmaz\
    \ et al. [66] concerning the growing pesticide resistance in Turkey\nwere afﬁrmed\
    \ by Alpkent et al. [119], who attributed the arrhenotokous reproduction and\n\
    high fecundity of Tetranychus urticae populations in greenhouses to acaricide\
    \ resistance.\nHowever, in the latter case, the pesticides were resistant to a\
    \ wide range of pesticides,\nbifenthrin, and hexythiazox. From a globalist perspective,\
    \ Tetranychus urticae resistance to\npesticides would create a monumental challenge\
    \ for Turkey and the larger EU. Acaricides\npurchases represented 14% of the pesticide\
    \ expenditure in the continent [120]. Higher\nexpenditure on acaricides denotes\
    \ greater dependence, which has catastrophic effects on\ncrop yields if widespread\
    \ pesticide resistance is documented.\nEven though there was compelling evidence\
    \ to catalyze the industry transition to\nbiopesticides and intelligent IPM, the\
    \ rate of biological agent adoption was inadequate [121];\nthis was despite favorable\
    \ legislation and regulations, including Regulation (EC) No.\n1107/2009 and 2016/2903\
    \ (RSP) [122]. Current research does not provide clear-cut reasons\nwhy biological\
    \ agents have not outpaced chemical control agents in the market. On the\none\
    \ hand, Liu et al. attributed the phenomenon to risk aversion among farmers coupled\n\
    with an unfavorable marketing environment for biological pesticides in China [121].\
    \ On\nthe other hand, the low adoption was linked to the variable effectiveness\
    \ of the biological\ncontrol agents relative to chemical pesticides, and the longer\
    \ duration needed to secure\nﬁnancial returns following years of R&D investment\
    \ [123]. The operational challenges\nhighlighted by leading biological pesticide\
    \ manufacturers supported this narrative.\nFrom another dimension, the limited\
    \ uptake of biological pesticides could be linked to\nadopting a wide range of\
    \ complementary interventions, including crop diversiﬁcation and\ngrowing advocacy\
    \ for pesticide-free agriculture [124,125]. Statistics compiled by the EU\nconﬁrmed\
    \ that farmers were assimilating pesticide-free agriculture policies; this was\
    \ evi-\ndent from the consistent reduction in the level of pesticide dependence—the\
    \ most notable\nimprovement was observed in the Czech Republic, where pesticide\
    \ use reduced by 38%\nbetween 2011 and 2020. A similar downward trend was observed\
    \ in Denmark, Portugal,\nand Romania, with each country recording a 20% drop in\
    \ pesticide demand [120]. The pes-\nticide use patterns documented by [120] were\
    \ in agreement with Facchinetti et al. [80], who\ndocumented a marginal change\
    \ in pesticide use from the 1990s to the late 2000s as a result\nof the stringent\
    \ regulatory measures imposed by the EU, including Directive 2009/128/CE.\nA contrary\
    \ trend was observed in Latvia and Austria, where pesticide demand in-\ncreased\
    \ by 77% and 61%, respectively. In contrast to the statistics provided by Eurostat\
    \ [120],\nNeumeister noted that EU farmers were locked into pesticide use [126],\
    \ creating an eter-\nnal lose–lose situation for all stakeholders. The lose–lose\
    \ situation was evident from the\ndeclining genetic diversity, impaired crop yields\
    \ due to lower insect-assisted pollination,\nand the destruction of local ecosystems.\
    \ The contrasting observations about pesticide use\nand the rates and barriers\
    \ to biopesticide market entry afﬁrm the complexity of phasing\nout chemical pesticides\
    \ from the market. On a positive note, the scenario is forecasted to\nchange with\
    \ the gradual introduction of AI technologies in pest management.\nKarar et al.\
    \ deployed cloud-based solutions and CNN networks to target red spider,\nﬂax budworm,\
    \ cicadellidae, aphids, and ﬂea beetles [14]. Early detection of pesticides using\n\
    Appl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n14 of 35\nAI technologies would facilitate timely responses\
    \ using AI and IoT infrastructure. The\nobservations made by Karar et al. [14]\
    \ were corroborated by Rustia et al., who integrated\nboth AI and IoT systems\

    \ for humans and cost savings in commercial farming are unquantiﬁable. The\nlatter\
    \ evidence afﬁrms there were justiﬁable grounds for the transition from traditional\
    \ to\nintelligent IPM methods. The paradigm shift would beneﬁt global agriculture,\
    \ considering\nthat pests and diseases accounted for up to 40% of global crop\
    \ losses [14].\nIn contrast to the cost-related issues highlighted by Ni and Punja\
    \ [115], continuous\nand excessive pesticide use has a detrimental impact on pest\
    \ management, given the high\nrisk of pesticide resistance. Pesticide resistance\
    \ and incompatibility have partly led to the\nspread of the South American tomato\
    \ pinworm Tuta absoluta [61] and mites. The current\nstrains of the South American\
    \ tomato pinworm can only be eradicated using strong and\ntoxic pesticides, such\
    \ as chlorpyrifos-methyl and Spinosad [61]. Even though pesticide\ntoxicity and\
    \ resistance risk can be mitigated with biopesticide formulations, adoption has\n\
    remained low owing to their variable effectiveness across different classes of\
    \ pests and\ndiseases. For example, succinic acid and methanolic extract of Rosmarinus\
    \ ofﬁcinalis were\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n15 of 35\nonly proven effective against\
    \ Aphis gossypii in cucumber grown in greenhouses [96]. The\nlack of broad-spectrum\
    \ biopesticides may partly explain why the demand for chemical\npesticides remained\
    \ unchanged; this phenomenon introduced new constraints, considering\nindustrial\
    \ greenhouses cannot be used in isolation. Glinushkin et al. proposed an alternative\n\
    approach, focusing on less-potent chemical pesticides, such as Conﬁdor Extra and\
    \ Nocturne.\nOn the downside, these pesticides were only effective against the\
    \ phytoseiid mite Neoseiulus\nbarkeri Hughes, and their efﬁcacy was limited to\
    \ approximately 25% [117]. According to the\ndata in Table 2, the mortality rate\
    \ for the mites was notably higher for avermectin pesticide\n(>93%) (see Table\
    \ 2). The application of Conﬁdor, Actellic, Scelta, and malathion did not\nyield\
    \ mortality rates comparable to avermectin. The data suggested that pest mortality\
    \ rates\nwere proportional to the strength of the pesticides [117]. The estimates\
    \ provided by [117]\nwere comparable to experimental data drawn from Turkey [118,119].\
    \ Turkish farmers had\nrecorded high levels of red spider mite (Tetranychus Urtica)\
    \ resistance to Bifenazate and\nAbamectin (acaricides) [118,119]. Higher mite\
    \ mortality rates (>90%) were observed with\nthe adoption of aggressive pest management\
    \ techniques, including mite-dipping and leaf\ndipping. The widespread pesticide\
    \ resistance further validates the need for intelligent\nIPM systems.\nTable 2.\

    \ farmers with commercial greenhouses\nwere faced with a dilemma. On the one hand,\
    \ law regulations advocated using less toxic\npesticides [127]. However, ecologically\
    \ benign biopesticides were not broad-acting. On the\nother hand, chemical pesticides\
    \ with broad-spectrum activity against pests and diseases\nwere toxic to the environment\
    \ [117,121,122,124]. In light of the critical shortcomings of\ntraditional pesticides\
    \ in greenhouse agriculture, the proactive management of powdery\nAppl. Sci. 2023,\

    \ using AI and other smart\ntechnologies might yield enormous beneﬁts to farmers.\n\
    Complementary techniques for disease detection are needed, considering that the\n\
    research of Abdulridha et al. [113], Liu et al. [111], and Pane et al. [114] conﬁrmed\
    \ that\nAI-based disease detection systems had critical shortcomings. For example,\
    \ the detection\nof powdery mildew was impacted by the UV wavelength, the camera\
    \ properties, and the\nlocation of the infected leaves in relation to the non-infected\
    \ leaves. The shortcomings of\nAI-based disease detection systems in greenhouse\
    \ and open-ﬁeld agriculture raise pertinent\nquestions about sustainable IPM practices.\
    \ Two theories were advanced in the literature.\nOn the one hand, proponents of\
    \ the current status quo supported the continued use of pesti-\ncides to manage\
    \ aggressive pests and diseases, including Orius laevigatus, Nesidiocoris tenuis,\n\
    Tuta absoluta, and Amblyseius swirskii [61]. However, persistent pesticide use\
    \ increased\nthe risk of crop pesticide resistance [61,113]. Moreover, the concentration\
    \ of pesticides\ndiminished over time, contributing to the resurgence in the population\
    \ of Nesidiocoris tenuis\n(see Figure 6); this phenomenon informed the need for\
    \ frequent pesticide applications.\nOn the other hand, the proponents of smart\
    \ farming advocated using Al and IoT-based\nsolutions in pest management. The\
    \ high detection accuracy validated the case for AI in\npest management. The UAV-based\
    \ hyperspectral imaging and artiﬁcial intelligence system\nhad 82% and 99% classiﬁcation\
    \ accuracy for the asymptomatic and late development of\npowdery mildew [113,127].\
    \ Asymptomatic detection was critical to the early management\nof crop diseases\
    \ and the improvement of crop yields. In line with Abdulridha et al. [113],\n\
    Pane et al. [114] demonstrated the utility of intelligent solutions in managing\
    \ pests and\ndiseases. Following delineating the cost-beneﬁts of traditional pesticides\
    \ versus smart\nfarming solutions, the latter was encouraged despite the signiﬁcant\
    \ capital requirements in\nthe short term.\nIn light of the unique beneﬁts and\
    \ constraints of AI-based IPM techniques, complemen-\ntary solutions were needed\
    \ moving forward; this view was corroborated by Agarwal and\nVerma’s [128] assessment\
    \ of pest behavior-modifying chemicals; genetic engineering and\nplant immunization;\
    \ CRISPR-based genetic manipulation of pest populations; controlled\nintroduction\
    \ of predators, parasites, and diseases to reduce the population of plant pests\n\
    and diseases; and microbial pesticides. Even though RNA interference and genome\
    \ editing\nwere supported by Agarwal and Verma [128], the gene editing of crops\
    \ has not gained\ntraction, and there is strong opposition from bioethicists [129].\
    \ The ethical concerns are\nvalid, since CRISPR-based gene manipulation may trigger\
    \ undesirable changes in the crop\ngenome; these shortcomings validate the emphasis\
    \ on AI in IPM.\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n17 of 35\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14 \n\

    \ had an accuracy of up to 2 cm from the target. In other cases, the\nrobotic\
    \ systems achieved an accuracy of less than a centimeter [132]. In contrast to\
    \ other\nAI and ML systems, which recorded variable results under different environments\
    \ and\noperating conditions, the G-DGPS had consistent accuracy in Israel, Georgia,\
    \ and the US\n(California) [132]. The mixed observations of Rahmadian and Widyartono\
    \ [132] and Beloev\net al. [131] about the utility of GPS systems in agricultural\
    \ robots show that contextual\nfactors and technological improvements were important\
    \ moderating factors. Additionally,\none cannot disregard the legitimate concerns\
    \ raised about robotic system accuracy.\nThe issues raised by Zha [8] concerning\
    \ the inconsistent accuracy of AI systems in\nsmart greenhouses were in agreement\
    \ with Aghelpour, Bahrami-Pichaghchi, and Kisi’s [133]\nresearch, which reported\
    \ a low prediction accuracy for the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference\nSystem (ANFIS)\
    \ coupled with bio-inspired optimization algorithms. However, Aghelpour,\nBahrami-Pichaghchi,\
    \ and Kisi [133] and Zha [8] contradict Soheli et al. [134], who reported\na >93.6%\
    \ prediction accuracy using ANFIS and IoT. The higher accuracy reported by Soheli\n\
    et al. [134] reinforces the perspectives of Howard et al. on achieving an optimal\
    \ balance\nbetween scalability, computational speed, and accuracy of the AI systems.\n\
    The inconsistencies in the accuracy of ANFIS-AI systems with bio-inspired algorithms\n\
    can be partly linked to the distinct operational parameters and optimum operational\n\
    conditions. The later claims aligned with the research of Salam et al. [135] on\
    \ optimal\ntarget identiﬁcation using multiple unmanned UAVs guided by bio-inspired\
    \ algorithms\nto identify crop diseases. On a positive note, the lower prediction\
    \ accuracy reported by\nAghelpour et al. [133] and Zha [8] could be resolved using\
    \ digital models based on model\npredictive control. Howard et al. conﬁrmed that\
    \ the MPC (model predictive control) digital\nmodels improved accuracy without\
    \ compromising the computational speed [136]. On\nthe downside, the positive assessment\
    \ of MPCs by Howard et al. [136] negated the fact\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n19\
    \ of 35\nthat the classical controller systems had critical shortcomings and accurate\
    \ operations\ndepended on the mathematical models’ accuracy [10]. In most cases,\
    \ closed-loop control\nalgorithms, such as MPC, may impose new constraints on\
    \ manipulating variables and\noften on computational resources [10]. Despite the\
    \ strain on computational resources,\nthe continued use of MPC was validated by\
    \ unique beneﬁts and capabilities, including\nrolling optimization, which provided\
    \ the operators with sufﬁcient time to initiate inverse\nresponses, address sensor\
    \ failure, change the computing objectives, and address time delays\nbetween sensors.\n\
    The MPC system could help streamline the performance and accuracy of the UAV\n\
    systems, which are affected by light intensity, soil moisture, relative humidity,\
    \ pH, and the\nconcentration of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium [103,113,135].\
    \ The observations\nmade by [103,113,135] concerning the regulation of the greenhouse\
    \ microclimate were in\nagreement with the research of Jiang et al. [137] on the\
    \ factors predicting the economic\nreturn and fruit quality of greenhouse-grown-table\
    \ grapes in Northern China. Proper regu-\nlation of greenhouse parameters was\
    \ a key prerequisite for higher table grape yields and\nproﬁt margins. The observations\
    \ reinforce current research on the beneﬁts of greenhouse\nmicroclimate control.\
    \ For example, the DynaLight system and dynamic climate control\nin InfoGrow improved\
    \ the quality of greenhouse crops [136]. Similarly to [136], Afzali\net al. [11]\
    \ conﬁrmed that predictive modeling for greenhouse light management could yield\n\
    signiﬁcant cost savings. In contrast to [136] and Afzali et al. [11], Bersani\
    \ et al. noted that\ncost savings in predictive modeling were largely dependent\
    \ on the choice of the algorithm\nand MPC [138]. The latter study preferred particle\
    \ swarm algorithms. On the downside,\nthe selection of bio-inspired algorithms\
    \ may not sufﬁce to offset the existing challenges.\nEven in cases where the dynamic\
    \ climate control in InfoGrow was present, and it\nwas challenging to mitigate\
    \ the impact of local environmental conditions, the beneﬁts\nassociated with timely\
    \ detection of powdery mildew and management of pests outweighed\nthe drawbacks\
    \ [13,103,111,113,135]. The variable test set accuracy (85–90%) of the Adam,\n\
    RMSprop, Adamax, and Nadam optimizers depicted in Table 3 should not be perceived\
    \ as\na major impediment to the adoption of algorithms for smart farms [69]. The\

    \ in Greenhouses\n3.1. Energy Demand in Smart Greenhouses and Energy Optimization\
    \ Algorithms\nThe adoption of digital models (such as MATLAB/Simulink) to regulate\
    \ the insulated\nand transparent greenhouse microclimate is an emerging area of\
    \ research [139]. The materi-\nals for greenhouse structures, such as ﬁberglass,\
    \ PVC, polycarbonate, and reinforced plas-\ntics, had a domino effect on energy\
    \ use [140]. Intelligent greenhouse structures are energy-\nintensive—a factor\
    \ that may impede commercial adoption of AI technologies [141,142].\nThe claims\
    \ made by [77,78] concerning the energy-intensive nature of greenhouse culti-\n\
    vation were in tandem with Iddio et al., who noted that energy costs accounted\
    \ for 25%\nof the greenhouse overhead costs [10]. Energy is needed to heat and\
    \ cool greenhouse\nstructures and regulate light, humidity, and soil moisture.\
    \ The disproportionate use of\nenergy in greenhouses relative to other sectors\
    \ in the agricultural industry may explain why\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n20 of\
    \ 35\nthere was renewed interest in developing the next generation of AI-based\
    \ energy-saving\ntechnologies to reduce energy expenditure and improve yields.\n\
    Nguyen et al. documented various bio-inspired interventions for energy optimiza-\n\
    tion in smart grids, smart homes, and the internet of energy [55]. The study suggested\n\
    that swarm and evolutionary-based optimization algorithms were ideal for optimizing\n\
    the use of traditional and renewable energy sources to achieve higher user comfort\
    \ and\nenergy demand aligned with the production capacity and grid demand. In\
    \ contrast to\nNguyen et al. [55], Zhang et al. [142] proposed an AI-based mode\
    \ based on a particle\nswarm optimization (PSO) scheme. The latter reduced the\
    \ cost of greenhouse energy\nthrough integrating photovoltaics and dynamic pricing\
    \ (real-time and time-of-use). The\nalgorithm enabled seamless communication between\
    \ the external power grid (EPG) and\nthe PV system. For example, the supply of\
    \ power from the external power grid was only\nrequired when sunlight was low.\
    \ If there was sufﬁcient light and load, the EPG supply was\ndisconnected.\nIn\
    \ real-life greenhouse operations, the proposals made by Nguyen et al. [55] and\
    \ Zhang\net al. [142] may be relevant or less relevant depending on the local\
    \ operating conditions,\nenergy sources, the scale of greenhouse agriculture,\
    \ and speciﬁc circumstances; this is in\nline with Iddio et al. who recommended\
    \ the use of evolutionary algorithms to address the\nshortcomings associated with\
    \ proportional–Integral–derivative (PID) control of greenhouse\nstructures. Traditionally,\
    \ PID was preferred owing to its great performance, simplicity,\nand ﬂexibility\
    \ [10]. However, there were certain tradeoffs, including time-consuming\ncomputing\
    \ and the inability to handle abrupt and external disturbances [10]. The case\n\
    for the PID greenhouse control strategy advanced by [10] corroborates [20], who\
    \ noted\nit was a low-cost alternative. However, there were alternative systems\
    \ with comparable\nperformance, including GA-based model predictive control systems.\
    \ The PID-related\nshortcomings partly explain why AI bio-inspired algorithms,\
    \ such as EA (Evolutionary\nAlgorithm), were used to modify PID controllers in\
    \ greenhouses.\nSimilarly to Iddio et al. [10] and Zhang et al. [142], Jia et\
    \ al. [143] conﬁrmed that\nbio-inspired algorithms, particularly adaptive chaotic\
    \ ACO algorithms, could achieve\nsigniﬁcant energy savings. However, the use of\
    \ bio-inspired algorithms to reduce energy\ndemand in isolation would not sufﬁce,\
    \ considering energy expenditure in greenhouses\nwas a complex non-linear, multi-input\
    \ and output process; this may explain why CFD\n(computational ﬂuid dynamics)\
    \ modeling coupled with mathematical transformations and\nsystematization of greenhouse\
    \ design parameters were appealing alternatives [144–146].\nRasakhodzhaev et al.\
    \ employed mathematical models in the design of adjustable solar\ngreenhouse structures\
    \ with optimal height for better regulation of heating and cooling. In\ncontrast\
    \ to Zhang et al. [142] and Jia et al. [143], Chen et al. [144] employed computational\n\
    ﬂuid dynamics to regulate surplus air thermal energy in greenhouses. The data\
    \ were\nemployed in the operation of the fan-pad evaporative cooling system. Even\
    \ though the\nlatter system did not rely on bio-inspired algorithms, it demonstrated\
    \ the effectiveness of\nmodeling and simulations in regulating greenhouse cooling.\
    \ In line with Chen et al. [144],\nMirzamohammadi et al. demonstrated the effectiveness\
    \ of mathematical simulations using\nthe Monte Carlo model. However, the effectiveness\
    \ of the modeling system was largely\ndependent on the level of uncertainty.\n\
    The ACOA proposed by Jia et al. [143] regulated energy demand in smart sensor\
    \ net-\nworks. However, it remained unclear whether the optimal performance of\
    \ the bio-inspired\nalgorithms in controlled environments would yield satisfactory\
    \ performance in real-world\nscenarios. Such concerns were premised on the fact\
    \ that the performance of the bio-inspired\nalgorithm was inﬂuenced by the dynamic\
    \ relationship between biological interactions and\nphysical conditions (atmospheric,\
    \ weather, soil, and humidity). The concerns raised by\nJia et al. [143] were\
    \ partly in agreement with the assessment by An et al. [147] of system\noptimization\
    \ under non-deterministic weather conditions. The unpredictable weather\npatterns\
    \ impaired the performance of sensors and actuators for heating, lighting, and\
    \ CO2\ndosing and the development of a climate and irrigation strategy.\nAppl.\

    \ the pilot experiments may not be practical\nfor regions with diverse climatic\
    \ conditions and unique energy requirements. The above\nconcerns partly contributed\
    \ to the diversiﬁcation of AI approaches for energy management.\nIn the meantime,\
    \ the researcher posits that it would be prudent for smallholder farmers to\n\
    make incremental changes for better energy management; these may include selecting\
    \ con-\nnectivity technologies with lower energy requirements. For example, a\
    \ comparison of LoRa,\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, mobile, and RFID technologies\
    \ established the following. Leading\nconnectivity technologies for AI systems\
    \ with higher transmission ranges (20–100 m) had\nhigher energy input requirements;\
    \ Wi-Fi is a case in point. In contrast, LoRa had very low\nenergy requirements\
    \ and high transmission ranges (<30 km) [148]. The claims made by\nBersani et\
    \ al. [148] on the low energy requirements were in tandem with Placidi et al.\
    \ [84],\nwho noted that the system’s typology reduced the energy demand while\
    \ enhancing data\ntransmission over long distances. Beyond the selection of communication\
    \ channels, Bersani\net al. [138] reported 54% to 83% energy savings in incandescent\
    \ and ﬂuorescent lamps after\nincorporating a parallel particle swarm algorithm\
    \ for optimal location of lighting.\nThe case for LoRa networks in agriculture\
    \ made by Bersani et al. [148] and Placidi\net al. [84] aligned with the research\
    \ of Chen et al. [149] on the market integration of LoRa\ntechnology in greenhouses.\
    \ In one case, the LoRa transmission module was used to transfer\ndata collected\
    \ from sensors to the Raspberry Pi (single-board computer). In contrast to Chen\n\
    et al. [149], Henningson [150] observed that the accuracy of the Raspberry Pi\
    \ system was\nhigher when paired with Canon camera systems to improve the resolution\
    \ of the images\ndetected. After integrating the two systems, each plant had a\
    \ resolution of 0.006 pixels.\nOn the downside, farm-based data show that high\
    \ transmission ranges and low energy\nrequirements of LoRa did not automatically\
    \ translate to greater commercial adoption in\nrelation to -Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee,\
    \ mobile, and RFID. For example, Siskandar et al. [151]\npreferred fuzzy-guided\
    \ RFID-based communication channels for smart greenhouses fea-\nturing DHT22/\
    \ DS18B20 sensors for temperature and humidity regulation. In contrast\nto Chen\
    \ et al. [149], Bersani et al. [148], and Placidi et al. [84], Mu et al. [152]\
    \ and Elsayed\net al. [153] recommended alternative methods for managing energy\
    \ resources, including\nthe use of phase change materials for energy conservation\
    \ and agricultural residue to\ngenerate biofuels and energy. However, the application\
    \ of PCMs recommended by Mu\net al. [152] represents but a tiny fraction of the\
    \ potential applications in smart farming.\nFor example, Kong et al. [154] noted\
    \ that PCMs were appropriate materials for cold chain\nlogistics [154]. However,\
    \ not all scholars support the use of PCMs in greenhouses and\nrelated applications\
    \ due to the high risk of leakage during the phase change process [155].\nThe\
    \ researcher supports the use of PCMs, considering they can be coupled with solar\n\
    systems for maximum energy saving.\nOn the downside, incremental changes, such\
    \ as selecting less energy-intensive com-\nmunication systems, cannot sufﬁce;\
    \ they must be paired with other interventions, including\nthe adoption of renewable\
    \ energy systems in greenhouses [156,157]. Solar and geothermal\nenergy are the\
    \ most viable renewable energy systems [158]. Even though the transition\nto renewable\
    \ energy was widely encouraged, the reliability of the energy source was not\n\
    guaranteed, especially in regions with intermittent solar radiation [159]. Even\
    \ in regions\nwhere the supply of solar energy was guaranteed, mass utilization\
    \ of renewable energy\nresources was a challenge, owing to the signiﬁcant disconnect\
    \ between the use of AI in\nthe greenhouse and the deployment of AI in energy\
    \ saving; this was a paradoxical phe-\nnomenon, considering smart greenhouses\
    \ (featuring predictive light control systems) could\nreduce energy expenditure\
    \ by 14–33.85% [11]. The improvements in lighting achieved\nby [11] were in tandem\
    \ with [58], who documented a 19.4% cost saving following the\nintroduction of\
    \ a predictive control strategy and innovative greenhouse lighting system.\nThe\
    \ light prediction model is illustrated in Figure 8.\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n\

    \ by the high cost of heuristic-based predictions compared to the prediction-\n\
    based method (PBM). On average, the heuristic-based predictions cost $5.96/m2,\
    \ while the \nPBM cost $0.73/m2 per day [11]. The notable disparities in the cost\

    \ remained a priority, \nconsidering that the current rates of energy expenditure\
    \ were unsustainable in the long \nterm. For example, US-based greenhouse operators\
    \ utilize $600 million worth of electricity \nper year [160]. Regulating energy\
    \ use using AI was a practical option, since small-scale \nand large commercial\
    \ farms had to spend additional resources on IPM. On average, US \nfarmers spend\
    \ $1 billion on pesticides per year. Similarly, commercial farming in Europe \n\
    was pesticide intensive—farmers utilized an estimated 346,000 tons of pesticides\
    \ in 2020 \nalone [120]; nearly half of the expenses were on fungicides and bactericides.\
    \ \n4. Barriers to Incorporating Artificial Intelligence Technology in Smart Greenhouses\
    \  \nCurrent research on AI and IoT in agriculture advances distinct claims on\
    \ the \npotential barriers to incorporating AI technology in smart greenhouses.\
    \ One school of \nthought claimed that the inconsistent adoption of AI could be\
    \ linked to the slow \ncommercialization of R&D innovations, barriers to technology\
    \ acceptance, and \ninformation asymmetry. This school of thought was corroborated\
    \ by Zha [8] and \nSenavirathne et al. [13]. The second school of thought suggested\
    \ that demographics were \na major determinant. Research from Europe suggested\
    \ that demographics directly affect \nprogressiveness and technology adoption\
    \ in agriculture [67,161]. Younger generations are \nmore highly motivated to\
    \ adopt new farming technologies than older generations. In \nFigure 8. Sunlight\

    \ [120];\nnearly half of the expenses were on fungicides and bactericides.\n4.\
    \ Barriers to Incorporating Artiﬁcial Intelligence Technology in Smart Greenhouses\n\
    Current research on AI and IoT in agriculture advances distinct claims on the\
    \ potential\nbarriers to incorporating AI technology in smart greenhouses. One\
    \ school of thought\nclaimed that the inconsistent adoption of AI could be linked\
    \ to the slow commercializa-\ntion of R&D innovations, barriers to technology\
    \ acceptance, and information asymmetry.\nThis school of thought was corroborated\
    \ by Zha [8] and Senavirathne et al. [13]. The sec-\nond school of thought suggested\
    \ that demographics were a major determinant. Research\nfrom Europe suggested\
    \ that demographics directly affect progressiveness and technology\nadoption in\
    \ agriculture [67,161]. Younger generations are more highly motivated to adopt\n\
    new farming technologies than older generations. In contrast to the scenario observed\n\
    by [67,161] in Europe, Asian studies highlighted the aging of the population as\
    \ a bar-\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n23 of 35\nrier [162]. Drawing from the latter\
    \ studies, each continent had unique barriers and drivers\nfor precision technology\
    \ adoption in greenhouses.\nThe issues raised by Zha [8] and Senavirathne et al.\
    \ [13] concerning the pace of\ntechnology adoption were discounted by emerging\
    \ research on the immense beneﬁts of\naugmented reality, such as the GRETA application\
    \ in promoting technology adoption\namong hobby farmers, and those with limited\
    \ knowledge about farming technologies, and\neven professional farmers using unique\
    \ human-computer interactions [24]. The case for AR\nadvanced by [24] corroborates\
    \ Yaqot and Meneses’s study [163], which noted AR would\nhelp transform rural\
    \ and novice farmers into experts while providing agronomists with\na real-time\
    \ and holistic view of farm and crop health. The beneﬁts afforded by AR-based\n\
    systems such as GRETA suggest that poor understanding of technology should not\
    \ be an\nimpediment to the automation of greenhouse operations.\nThe low pace\
    \ of AI technology adoption in the global agricultural sector has remained\nunresolved.\
    \ For example, the ﬁrst AI-powered system for agriculture was the GOSSYM\ncotton\
    \ crop simulation model developed in 1985 to regulate water and fertilizer application,\n\
    weed control, and local climate for better cotton yields [8]. The GOSSYM model\
    \ was key to\ndeveloping the Artiﬁcial Intelligence Automated Greenhouse System\
    \ (AIAGS), processing\nsystems, and web applications [13]. On the downside, there\
    \ was limited R&D in the subse-\nquent years to build on the GOSSYM model. In\
    \ 1996, researchers developed an autonomous\nAURORA greenhouse robot to replace\
    \ manual labor. The historical slow adoption of pre-\ncision farming technologies\
    \ documented by [8,13] was in line with Maloku’s appraisal\nof precision farming\
    \ technology integration in the US and EU [71]. Until the late 2000s,\nonly 22%\
    \ of the farmers had integrated precision farming technologies in the West [71].\n\
    On a positive note, there was a notable improvement in the pace of technology\
    \ adoption\npost-2013. In the past two years, researchers have developed multi-application\
    \ AI systems\nfor intelligent IPM [15,86,128], seeding and harvesting, and weed\
    \ recognition [104,105],\nand digital twins for autonomous greenhouse operation\
    \ using traditional sensor data, IoT,\nbig data analytics, and AI [136]. However,\
    \ the pace of R&D innovations does not match\ncommercial adoption—the digital\
    \ twin-based GHI4.0 project in the Danish horticultural\nindustry was in the pilot\
    \ phase. On a positive note, 80% of Danish farmers attempted to\nintegrate precision\
    \ farming technologies in the production of maize and barley crops [71].\nPresently,\
    \ it is challenging to determine the cost-beneﬁts of technological innovation\n\
    and underlying motives for the transition to AI in agriculture [18]. For example,\
    \ even\nthough digital twins offer immense potential to balance accuracy, accuracy,\
    \ and compu-\ntational speeds in agriculture, there are limited data on their\
    \ applications. Howard et al.\nnoted that “state-of-the-art for DTs is limited\
    \ to speciﬁc sub-processes modeled with highly\nspecialized models” [136] (p.\
    \ 7). Further experimental data on the cost-beneﬁts of digital\ntwins was needed\
    \ before deploying the systems in greenhouses to simulate and optimize\nproduction.\
    \ The issues relating to digital twins are but a microcosm of the broader gaps\
    \ in\nthe body of knowledge, which does not sufﬁciently delineate the impacts\
    \ of AI and IT in\nagriculture. Drawing from experimental data compiled by researchers\
    \ in Europe, North\nAmerica, and Asia [86,90,104,105,108], there were region-speciﬁc\
    \ barriers and enablers for\nAI integration in agriculture depending on the pace\
    \ of knowledge and technology transfer.\nThe intermittent integration of R&D innovations\
    \ could be due to the higher costs,\nknowledge and resource gaps between advanced\
    \ and developing countries, the inability to\nentirely replace human labor on\
    \ farms with robots, and variations between the simulated\nand actual outcomes\
    \ in the ﬁeld/smart greenhouses [8]. The criticism of AI systems in\nsmart greenhouses\
    \ and farms by [8] was corroborated by Beloev et al. [131], who claimed\nthat\
    \ mechanical robots were unreliable because they relied on satellite triangulation\
    \ to\nguide movement—this technology was less reliable compared to LIDAR and camera\
    \ sensor\ninnovations. On a positive note, the constraints associated with satellite\
    \ triangulation have\nbeen addressed using light imaging, detection, and ranging\
    \ (LIDAR) optical and electro-\noptical cameras [131]. The advances highlighted\
    \ by [131] were consistent with [162], which\nnoted that algorithm systems had\
    \ led to the development of advanced sensor systems,\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n\
    24 of 35\nincluding fusion algorithms that facilitated the separation of colors\
    \ into the hue, saturation,\nand value formats. However, the case for electro-optical\
    \ cameras made by [131,162] was\nnot in line with the research of Saddik et al.\
    \ on latency issues in an image collection using\nmultispectral cameras [164].\
    \ The latter concerns reinforced the case for LIDAR systems in\nagricultural robots\
    \ [162]. The technology milestones in robotics shaped industry trends in\nthe\
    \ adoption of robotics for harvesting and greenhouse management.\n4.1. Training\
    \ and Test Accuracy of AI Systems in Smart Greenhouses and Precision Agriculture\n\
    The inclusion of different computational methods to attain higher accuracy rates\
    \ was\nconﬁrmed by Siskandar et al. in their assessment of the fuzzy logic system’s\
    \ accuracy\n(~95%) in smart greenhouses (see Table 3) [151]. Even though the observations\
    \ of Siskandar\net al. were speciﬁc to the long short-term memory neural network\
    \ for predicting the\noccurrence and development of powdery mildew in greenhouse\
    \ cucumber plants, they\nwere relevant to other AI systems for greenhouses. On\
    \ the downside, these claims contrast\nwith Lakshmi and Corbett [15], who argued\
    \ the current barriers to technology adoption\nmust be resolved.\nTraditionally,\
    \ it was challenging for Al systems to reconcile the images and measure-\nments\
    \ taken under controlled conditions with those in the ﬁeld due to variations in\
    \ the\nbackground complexity, imaging angle, and interferences in the natural\
    \ environment. The\nconstraints have been partly resolved with bio-inspired algorithms\
    \ customized for fault\nprediction, image recognition, and pest identiﬁcation\
    \ [165,166]. The use of AI to prevent\nroot rot diseases and fusarium wilt among\
    \ cucumber plants in greenhouses was a case in\npoint [167]. The broad application\
    \ of IoT, machine learning (ML), and artiﬁcial intelligence\n(AI) in agriculture\
    \ can be partly linked to technological advances in computing.\n4.2. Impact of\
    \ Demographics and Socioeconomic Factors on AI Technology Adoption in Agriculture\n\
    The shortage of young, progressive EU farmers raises legitimate concerns regarding\n\
    the actualization of Eurozone agricultural innovation policies, and by extension,\
    \ the ability\nto sustain higher food demands [67]. The issues raised in the European\
    \ Economic and Social\nCommittee’s report [67] were partly in line with Mohr and\
    \ Kühl’s research in Germany,\nwhere age predicted technology adoption [161].\
    \ For example, smartphone use and access\ndecreased with age among the German\
    \ farmers sampled. Similarly to Mohr and Kühl [161],\nMaloku [71] noted that less\
    \ educated and older farmers were less inclined to adopt precision\nfarming technologies.\
    \ However, the observations by Mohr and Kühl [161] concerning the\nrate of technology\
    \ acceptance in agriculture were not aligned with the European Economic\nand Social\
    \ Committee’s report [67]. Most of the sampled German farmers were young\n(mean\
    \ age = 33 years), and there was more than an 80% assimilation of smart farming\n\
    technologies among old and young farmers. The contrasting observations from Mohr\n\
    and Kühl and the European Economic and Social Committee’s report raise fundamental\n\
    questions on whether demographics were a barrier to adopting AI on smart farms\
    \ across\nEurope and the world.\nIn contrast to the European Economic and Social\
    \ Committee’s report [67] and Mohr\nand Kühl [161], Maloku [71] claimed multiple\
    \ externalities aided and impeded smart farm-\ning technology adoption; these\
    \ variables included farm size, ﬁnancial status, technology\nfactors, information\
    \ resources, social, economic issues (age, experience, and education),\nand farm\
    \ size. The latter argument provides a more representative picture of the dynamics\n\
    that led to higher or lower technology adoption that is more applicable to developing\n\
    and developed countries in the North and the South [137]. Further research on\
    \ the role of\ndemographics, farm size, ﬁnancial status, technology factors, and\
    \ information resources\nwas necessary, considering achieving and sustaining exponential\
    \ growth in AI technology\nadoption in agriculture is a prerequisite for tangible\
    \ global impact on crop yields, pest and\ndisease management, and optimization\
    \ of agricultural resources [168].\nDespite the overwhelming evidence in support\
    \ of AI, particularly robotics in har-\nvesting, critics argue that AI cannot\
    \ entirely “replace/replicate humans. Machines do\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n25\
    \ of 35\nnot have the multi-perspective skills of humans, as they are typically\
    \ programmed to\nperform speciﬁc tasks in constrained conditions” [69] (p. 9).\
    \ The issues raised by [69] do\nnot consider recent milestones with bio-inspired\
    \ algorithms that improved the precision\nand reliability of AI and ML infrastructure\
    \ in agriculture [169]. The use of bio-inspired\nhybrid algorithms for weed optimization\
    \ was a case in point [14,105,135]. The role of AI\nalgorithms highlighted by\
    \ [14,105,135] was corroborated by Beloev et al. [131], who used\nimage processing\
    \ algorithms to improve the ground-based accuracy of a robotic system.\nThe selection\
    \ of advanced algorithms, including Hierarchy/Hybrid Particle Swarm\nOptimization\
    \ (HPSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Evolutionary Algorithm (EA), Di-\nrect Artiﬁcial\
    \ Bee Colony (DABC), and Hybrid Genetic Algorithm with Particle Swarm\nOptimization\
    \ (GA-PSO) among others involves a tradeoff between computational speed,\npath\
    \ planning, ﬁtness, root means squared, and mean absolute errors [85]. For example,\n\
    the ANN algorithm had lower MAE and RSME values compared to the GEP testing and\n\
    training evolutionary algorithm (see Table 4). However, the ANN required higher\
    \ compu-\ntational resources [14,170]. On a positive note, the technical constraints\
    \ were short-term\nand should not be considered a critical impediment to the adoption\
    \ of AI systems.\nTable 4. Gene expression programming (GEP), ANN RSME, and MAE\

    0.065\n0.061\n0.087\n0.090\n0.091\nBeyond the technically related barriers to\
    \ the widespread adoption of AI systems in\nsmart farming, there were emerging\
    \ concerns about the impact of farmer demographics\non the adoption of AI systems.\
    \ For example, the aging of the farmers was a major issue\nin Europe [67,161].\
    \ In light of the observations made by critics and proponents of AI in\nsmart\
    \ greenhouses and precision agriculture, the following fundamental issues emerge.\n\
    First, AI technology critics negate smart agriculture’s immense contribution to\
    \ farming.\nSecond, the proponents of AI technology disregard the enormous capital\
    \ requirements and\nthe barriers to technology transfer in developing countries.\
    \ On a positive note, there were\nsuccessful cases in the developing countries\
    \ in the global south. For example, Ethiopian\nscientists had developed an ERNN\
    \ system to monitor humidity and temperature variations\nin greenhouse structures;\
    \ the system had additional capabilities for wind velocity and\ncarbon dioxide\
    \ concentration measurement [170]. Proper temperature regulation and\nmonitoring\
    \ were necessary, considering a majority of the greenhouse crops; tomatoes were\n\
    particularly susceptible to temperature variations [171]; the effect of chilling\
    \ stress on\ngreenhouse tomatoes in China was a case in point [171]. In practice,\
    \ incorporating artiﬁcial\nintelligence technology in smart greenhouses should\
    \ be supported by prior data on actual\nfarm applications and short and long-term\
    \ beneﬁts vis-à-vis the costs and potentially\ndetrimental environmental impacts.\n\
    The dynamic natural and physical conditions (including atmospheric, weather, soil,\n\
    and humidity) and biological interactions between plants, pests, and diseases\
    \ in green-\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n26 of 35\nhouses and open-ﬁeld agriculture\
    \ increase the complexity of the decision-making pro-\ncesses [6,15,57]. The sophisticated\
    \ relationship between these variables would predict the\nutility of AI in agriculture\
    \ and agricultural sustainability. On a positive note, emerging\nresearch on bio-inspired\
    \ algorithms and selected applications of AI systems in agriculture\nconﬁrmed\
    \ that the beneﬁts outweighed the risks [14,108,121]. Moreover, the ongoing R&D\n\
    projects would resolve most of the shortcomings.\n4.3. Sensor Signal Failure and\
    \ Communication Barriers\nThe growing advocacy for the integration of AI in precision\
    \ agriculture negates the\ntechnology-related challenges to commercial adoption.\
    \ Singh et al. established that inter-\nferences often compromised communication\
    \ between sensor nodes. There were multiple\nsources of interferences for sensor\
    \ signal transfer in greenhouses, including crop canopy,\nsoil, and temperature\
    \ [87,164]. Similarly to Singh et al. [87], Shamshiri et al. [78] observed\nthat\
    \ the accuracy of the soil moisture sensors was notably low in regions with high\
    \ vege-\ntative diversity. Sensor accuracy was impaired by different hydrological\
    \ properties and\ngeography, especially in real-world conditions dissimilar to\
    \ the training datasets. On a\npositive note, most of the constraints identiﬁed\
    \ by Singh et al. [87] and Shamshiri et al. [78]\nhave been addressed using AI\
    \ technologies. In particular, Vanegas-Ayala et al. demon-\nstrated the importance\
    \ of fuzzy clustering techniques in the humidity prediction modules.\nThe fuzzy\
    \ logic controllers enabled the AI systems to model and predict the behavior of\n\
    key greenhouse parameters. The system was appealing to the farmers because it\
    \ was\ninexpensive and easy to use. A major concern was that these issues were\
    \ often disregarded\nin research in favor of the mass transition to an intelligent\
    \ greenhouse system.\nThe risk of impaired transmission identiﬁed by Singh et\
    \ al. [87] may be resolved using\nthe hardware conﬁguration proposed by Serale\
    \ et al. [58]. The conﬁguration featured\nSiap+Micros t055 pyranometers and Apogee\
    \ SQ-515 Quantum sensors with a 1.2 mV\nsensitivity of 1.2mV. The conﬁguration\
    \ proposed by Serale et al. [58] bears semblance to\nAfzali et al., who deployed\
    \ Apogee instruments to measure the photosynthetic photon ﬂux\ndensity (PPFD)\
    \ over the plant canopy in a greenhouse structure [14]. The observations\nmade\
    \ by Serale et al. [58] and Afzali et al. [11] do not take into account the variable\
    \ accuracy\nof the Apogee solar radiation sensors. According to Zamora-Izquierdo\
    \ et al., the Apogee\nsensors had a mean accuracy of ±5% [172]. The accuracy of\
    \ the sensor systems could\nbe enhanced using the Remote Sensing Assisted Control\
    \ System (RSCS), which offered\nmultidimensional beneﬁts, including the measurement\
    \ of CO2 emissions, soil moisture,\nirrigation control, and agricultural production\
    \ capacities.\nNew experimental data have conﬁrmed that using plastic mulches\
    \ with sustainable\nremote sensing and AI technology systems is practical. In\
    \ particular, Jim et al. [173]\nreported the successful use of Landsat-5 thematic\
    \ mapper and hyperspectral airborne\nsensors to map plastic mulched farmlands\
    \ and plastic-covered greenhouses. The data were,\nin turn, employed to identify\
    \ regions where plastic mulches can be gradually replaced\nwith biodegradable\
    \ alternatives. The claims made by Jim et al. [173] concerning the role of\ntechnology\
    \ in mapping plastic mulches were in tandem with Hasituya et al., who deployed\n\
    remote-sensing aperture radar systems to map plastic mulches [174].\n5. Future\
    \ Perspectives\nThe critical review of the current body of knowledge supporting\
    \ the integration of AI\nsystems in agriculture yielded new insights and perspectives\
    \ on how best to enhance the\nefﬁciency of smart greenhouses. However, certain\
    \ issues should be addressed in upcoming\nstudies. For example, the current body\
    \ of knowledge did not establish a consensus on\nwhether automated agricultural\
    \ machinery manufacturers and commercial farms should\ntransition from satellite\
    \ triangulation to light imaging, detection and ranging (LIDAR),\noptical and\
    \ electro-optical cameras [131], or Satellite-Differential GPS (S-DGPS). The mixed\n\
    observations by Beloev et al. [131], John Deere [130], and Rahmadian and Widyartono\
    \ [132]\nwarrant further research inquiry considering there were different technical\
    \ requirements\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n27 of 35\nfor open space and indoor (greenhouse)\
    \ robotic systems. Future research on LIDAR and\noptical camera systems for open\
    \ space and greenhouse robotic tractors would provide\nbetter insights into the\
    \ cost-beneﬁts of available technologies to guide commercial adoption.\nEmpirical\
    \ and farm-based data are important, considering John Deere and other companies\n\
    were commercializing new autonomous tractor models ﬁtted with optical cameras\
    \ [130,132].\nMoreover, there was a growing acceptance of soft robotic systems\
    \ for fruit and vegetable\nharvesting and pesticide application.\nBeyond systems\
    \ for robotic structures, current data on the suitability of different vari-\n\
    ants of bio-inspired algorithms (swarm intelligence, genetic and evolutionary)\
    \ for pesticide\napplication, and robotic harvesting, automated regulation of\
    \ irrigation, soil treatment, fer-\ntilizer application, and seeding are speciﬁc\
    \ to the Global North [105,135]. Future research\nshould explore the suitability\
    \ of bio-inspired algorithms to support the automation of green-\nhouses in developing\
    \ countries. Isolated case studies of milestones in developing countries\nsupport\
    \ the recommendation. For example, ERNN systems augmented temperature and\nhumidity\
    \ measurements in Ethiopia’s greenhouses [170]. However, there were gaps in\n\
    the knowledge, which may impede decision-making among stakeholders in the future.\n\
    Future research should investigate whether the LoRa, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee,\
    \ mobile, or\nRFID communication technologies were best suited for speciﬁc bio-inspired\
    \ algorithms and\nthe inﬂuence of local conditions and variables on performance\
    \ and accuracy. At present,\nresearchers are focusing on different algorithms\
    \ to reﬁne algorithm performance. For\nexample, most studies focused on solar\
    \ radiation intensity, transpiration, and CO2 concen-\ntration to predict crop\
    \ yields, even though the approach yielded inaccurate results [18]. The\nstandardization\
    \ of input variables would improve accuracy and performance. Upcoming\nstudies\
    \ should help establish whether intelligent IPM was a sustainable alternative\
    \ to\ntraditional chemical pesticides and biopesticides, considering pesticide\
    \ resistance and the\nneed to adopt sustainable agricultural practices.\nAdditionally,\
    \ there is a growing demand for technological solutions to address climate\nchange\
    \ and global food insecurity, which urges the integration of AI technologies like\
    \ light\nimaging, detection and ranging 1128 (LIDAR), optical and electro-optical\
    \ cameras [131] or\nsatellite-differential GPS (S-DGPS). Apart from the technological\
    \ aspect, there is also a need\nto develop agricultural production policies that\
    \ favor the funding of these technologies\nand their integration to agricultural\
    \ production. Such policies can include setting aside\ngrant funds for institutions\
    \ and companies involved in their development. Such policies\nshould also include\
    \ solving the cost barriers that have consistently been highlighted in\nprevious\
    \ research. Most studies have also demonstrated the potential application of AI\n\
    in large scale agricultural production. Policy incentives to facilitate their\
    \ integration in\nsmall-scale farming may also encourage younger populations to\
    \ participate in agricultural\nproduction, because most farmers today in Europe\
    \ and North America are older. If the\nproblem is not addressed in a timely manner\
    \ using potential technological solutions, the\nissues of food insecurity are\
    \ likely to worsen in the future.\n6. Conclusions\nThe ﬁndings drawn from this\
    \ research had practical consequences for commercial\nagriculture, considering\
    \ a large body of knowledge focused on applying AI and IoT in\ntraditional applications,\
    \ and the emphasis on the beneﬁts of the technology negated critical\nconcerns\
    \ about energy demand, sensor failure, accuracy, and long-term use. The ﬁndings\n\
    broadened current knowledge on the cost beneﬁts of sensors, robotic systems, algorithms,\n\
    renewable energy systems for greenhouses, and support infrastructure. For example,\
    \ users\nof soil and humidity sensors paired with fuzzy clustering techniques\
    \ in the humidity\nprediction modules should be conscious of the fact that the\
    \ accuracy of the measurements\nmay be impaired by corrosion or hardware malfunction.\
    \ Additionally, the new generation\nof new agricultural robotic systems largely\
    \ depends on replacing GPS systems with LIDAR\nand optical camera systems, given\
    \ the former exhibited poor object recognition. The\nperformance of LIDAR systems\
    \ was enhanced with image processing algorithms.\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 14\n28\
    \ of 35\nThe commercial readiness of AI technologies was demonstrated by John\
    \ Deere com-\npany, Blue River Technology, Autonomous Tractor Corp, and other\
    \ companies that had\ndeveloped intelligence systems for monitoring crop and soil\
    \ health, weed control, and\nself-driving agricultural tractors. Despite the commendable\
    \ milestones achieved so far,\nthere were multiple barriers to the use of the\
    \ technology. The barriers included the cost\nof AI technology, variable performance\
    \ of the algorithm in real-world conditions vis-à-vis\ntraining, the ﬁnancial\
    \ status of the farmers, lack of information resources, aging, and lack of\nprior\
    \ experience with technology. Despite the shortcomings, adopting AI systems should\
    \ be\nencouraged, given they improved crop yields, water use, and fertilizer use\
    \ efﬁciency, and\nreduced the effects of pesticide resistance through intelligent\
    \ IPM. Moreover, bio-inspired\nalgorithms improved energy management by integrating\
    \ photovoltaics and dynamic pric-\ning and autonomous communication between the\
    \ greenhouse system and EPG supply. The\nemerging climate change risks further\
    \ reinforce the case for smart greenhouses powered by\nAI systems.\nIn summary,\
    \ most AI applications in agricultural production are in the development\nphase\
    \ because they have not fully matured for commercialization purposes. The few\n\
    AI solutions that have so far reached maturity and have been rolled out for commercial\n\
    use despite challenges (e.g., accuracy) include the use of drones, sensors, and\
    \ robots for\nharvesting crop yields. Although these technologies have been applied\
    \ commercially,\nthe challenge of accuracy and sustainability persists. For example,\
    \ underground sensor\nhardware can be damaged by moisture and other unpredictable\
    \ environmental conditions,\nleading to inaccurate data, which can easily mislead\
    \ decisions in commercial farms, leading\nto huge losses. Therefore, although\
    \ they have reached the commercial maturity, they still\nneed further development\
    \ to optimize their effectiveness in solving the identiﬁed problems\nand challenges.\
    \ Furthermore, considering that many studies are currently being undertaken\n\
    on this topic, it is also imperative to perform a similar mapping of the literature\
    \ every three\nyears to determine the current state of the art from time to time,\
    \ because technological\nadvancements are fast and imminent. Finally, more research\
    \ is needed on overcoming the\nchallenges of integrating AI applications into\
    \ farm input in the Global South, which must\ninclude solving the cost barriers\
    \ and knowledge and skills gaps.\nFunding: This research received no external\

    \ food demand and a growing human population, agriculture is the primary food\
    \ supplier and the most \nprominent labor user. It is also one of the essential\
    \ areas in a country's economy, according to gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) [1],\
    \ [2]. Water availability is an essential factor in optimizing the growth of crops\
    \ so that water \nscarcity can threaten food security. This reason makes water\
    \ conservation an essential factor in overcoming water \nshortages while increasing\
    \ yields. [3, 4]. Moreover, the development of agricultural technology and more\
    \ efficient \nagricultural management can produce productive crops and quality\
    \ harvests through greenhouse technology. \nDeveloping greenhouses for agriculture\
    \ can increase crop yields and improve water use efficiency [5].  \nAround 3.5%\
    \ of the world's agricultural land uses greenhouse and hydroponic systems to conserve\
    \ water use and \nother benefits such as crop protection and quality yields. A\
    \ greenhouse is a building with a wooden or metal \nfoundation covered with nets\
    \ or transparent material. Since 1960 the greenhouse has evolved from a building\
    \ that \nonly protects plants into a system for studying plant growth in a controlled\
    \ environment [6, 7]. Changes in \nagricultural land usage, lower irrigation water\
    \ output in primary, secondary, and tertiary canals, and global \nmicroclimate\
    \ changes contribute to the rising use of greenhouses in world agriculture [8].\
    \  \nAgricultural ecosystems (soil, nutrients, temperature, humidity, sunlight,\
    \ wind, and air composition) can be adapted \nto the needs of the plants planted\
    \ in greenhouses to extend productive plant life, change planting seasons, \n\
    increase crop yields and improve harvest quality. [9, 10]. Moving crops from their\
    \ natural environment to \ngreenhouses protect plants from weather and microclimate\
    \ uncertainties. On the downside, a greenhouse is a \nplace that can store solar\
    \ heat and requires resources to manage the microclimate according to plant needs,\
    \ \nespecially in countries with tropical climates. [4, 11]. Crop growth problems\
    \ arise in agriculture that depends on rain \nand drought; runoff and erosion\
    \ problems also arise during heavy rains. Water control is needed to meet crop\
    \ \nwater needs while conserving water [12]. The water control system functioned\
    \ as a regulator for water flow \naccording to the plant's needs in its growth\
    \ phase [13, 14]. \nConventional irrigation systems use a uniform amount of water\
    \ to fields from one corner to another during their \ngrowth period regardless\
    \ of the type of plant and its water needs. The result is water-wasting, where\
    \ one side of \nthe land has sufficient water, while the other can have excess\
    \ or lack of water [15]. Therefore, a control system \nknown as an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system is needed to support plants' water needs while saving water.\
    \ The way the \nsystem works, in general, is to adapt to the type of plant and\
    \ then automatically calculate the water needs of the \n657 \n \nIrfan Ardiansah,\

    \ Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nplant and schedule water\
    \ supply based on the plant growth phase [16]. Intelligent irrigation systems\
    \ are suitable for \nuse in a greenhouse because a greenhouse has an enclosed\
    \ structure to reduce or eliminate parameters affecting \nplant growth, such as\
    \ seasons, rainfall, climate change, plant pests and diseases, and environmental\
    \ changes [17, \n18]. \nIntelligent irrigation systems are part of precision agriculture,\
    \ also known as smart farming, which integrates \ninformation technology, communication\
    \ technology, and control technology to automate various agricultural \nactivities\
    \ that humans initially did. With an intelligent irrigation system, the irrigation\
    \ process can run optimally in \nmanaging water to meet the needs of plants [19].\
    \ Intelligent irrigation systems can manage water needs based on \nvarious parameters\
    \ such as microclimate conditions, weather, sunlight, water quality such as acidity\
    \ (pH), turbidity \n(TDS), and electrical conductivity (EC), along with plant\
    \ growth phases through the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. \nAn intelligent\
    \ irrigation system can improve irrigation decisions to achieve water savings\
    \ and increased yields [20–\n22]. \nThe intelligent irrigation system is one of\
    \ the best systems in managing and saving water while maximizing \nharvests; water\
    \ is distributed evenly to each plant according to its needs and minimizes wasted\
    \ water [23]. This \nsystem can also mix nutrients and water and help deliver\
    \ them directly to the root zone, ensuring it is always in \noptimal moist conditions,\
    \ minimizing surface runoff, preventing root rot, and eliminating percolation.\
    \ The advantage \nis increased crop productivity, and better harvest quality also\
    \ ensures optimal water efficiency. Nevertheless, good \nintegration between IoT\
    \ devices, monitoring, control, and data acquisition can be done automatically\
    \ with minimum \nintervention to get an optimal and efficient, intelligent irrigation\
    \ system [24, 25]. \nIn the intelligent irrigation system, the controller can\
    \ process input data, present information, and manage irrigation \nbased on greenhouse\
    \ conditions, especially crop conditions to prevent water deficit. Nevertheless,\
    \ in addition to \nsystem automation, it is necessary to present current and past\
    \ system conditions to users, both plant responses to \nthe system and vice versa.\
    \ This method ensures that water management runs smoothly, and users can study\
    \ \nhistorical data as a reference for the next planting period and ensure optimal\
    \ farming [26–29]. This process \nrequires real-time monitoring, sophisticated\
    \ control systems, and precise instruments. The difference between a \nmonitoring\
    \ system and a control system is that the control system regulates the hardware\
    \ according to conditional \nconstraints. The control system manages the hardware\
    \ and software by defining the output and input parameters \nprecisely. The input\
    \ is microclimate parameters, plant properties, weather conditions, water quality,\
    \ and other \nsensors collect helpful information [30–33]. \nMany articles published\
    \ on IoT focus on agriculture, as discussed by [30, 34]. IoT is one of the best\
    \ inventions of \nthe 21st century in agriculture. In addition, review articles\
    \  [21], [35] discuss IoT opportunities in agriculture or \nintelligent farming\
    \ and how the connection between IoT, data mining, data science, and machine learning\
    \ \nsustainability supports agriculture. [36] describes the automation model for\
    \ monitoring and controlling the \nagricultural sector and predicting information\
    \ based on past data. There are currently no review studies that explore \nthe\
    \ monitoring and control strategy of intelligent irrigation systems in greenhouses,\
    \ necessitating the formation of \nintelligent irrigation system review articles\
    \ that focus on integrating various monitoring and control materials. As a \n\
    result, this study will cover intelligent irrigation system monitoring and control\
    \ mechanisms and their relevance to \ngreenhouses and irrigation. \nThis study\
    \ aims to classify the results of previous research, identify the results, and\
    \ bridge them with future trends \nto identify future research. Chapter 2 discusses\
    \ research methodology, and Chapter 3 discusses various irrigation \nmethods used\
    \ by intelligent irrigation systems. In contrast, Chapter 4 discusses monitoring\
    \ and controlling \nstrategies for IoT and then continues to Chapter 5, discussing\
    \ the integration of artificial intelligence. The last \nchapter discusses future\
    \ directions and trends in intelligent irrigation. \n2 REVIEW METHODOLOGY \nThe\
    \ methodology applied in selecting published literature with the theme of intelligent\
    \ farming focuses on the topic \nof intelligent irrigation systems and their control\
    \ systems by using an extensive search on several online libraries of \nmultidisciplinary\
    \ journals as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Springer, MDPI, and IOP, as well\
    \ as online \nengineering libraries as Agricola and IEEE Xplore. This technique\
    \ produces many research articles relevant to \nintelligent farming and irrigation\
    \ systems and their relationship to monitoring and control. That is why it is\
    \ essential \nto check the reputation of the publisher's journal before using\
    \ the article through the SCOPUS and ScimagoJR \nwebsites. This review's selection\
    \ of relevant articles emphasizes the latest journal articles in the last eleven\
    \ years \n(2011 - 2021); it can be seen in Figure 1a that in 2020 there was a\
    \ surge in articles discussing monitoring, control, \nand artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture. Other conditions are that all articles must be published in\
    \ SCOPUS indexed \njournals and conference proceedings. As shown in Figure 1b,\
    \ which shows the percentage of articles indexed by \nSCOPUS with articles with\
    \ Quartile 1 dominating research in this field means that the research is internationally\
    \ \nrecognized and has the best quality content. All articles used are smart farming,\
    \ intelligent irrigation system, and \nprecision agriculture. Articles are carefully\
    \ selected by reading and summarizing them to ensure continuity of ideas.  \n\

    \ to grow and develop; in agriculture, this watering technique is called \nirrigation.\
    \ Irrigation has two methods, namely conventional and modern. Conventional agriculture\
    \ usually uses rain \nand surface irrigation to irrigate its land [37, 38]. The\
    \ problem is how to predict rain accurately, and surface \nirrigation does not\
    \ continuously irrigate the entire land with a uniform discharge. Surface irrigation,\
    \ classified as \nconventional irrigation, works by distributing water from springs\
    \ or rivers to the ground surface following gravity; \nmonitoring is done manually\
    \ by looking at the water level without IoT and automation [37].  \nDeveloping\
    \ countries generally use surface irrigation, for example, Indonesia. It uses\
    \ it to irrigate paddy fields by \nconstructing furrows that connect water sources\
    \ with rice fields and irrigate them. However, this method requires a \nlevel\
    \ ground surface to ensure adequate water distribution [39]. On the other hand,\
    \ surface irrigation results in high \nlevels of water loss due to evaporation,\
    \ uncontrolled water discharge, and percolation, which can reduce soil \nnutrient\
    \ levels resulting in sub-optimal crop yields [37]. There are two commonly used\
    \ surface irrigations: (1) \nFurrow irrigation is interpreted as water flowing\
    \ through small furrows made on the land slope. Water enters the soil \nfrom the\
    \ bottom and sides of the furrow and moves laterally and downwards to moisten\
    \ the soil and simultaneously \ncarry dissolved salts, fertilizers, and herbicides\
    \ [40]. Good tillage with uniform slopes can give better results from \nthis method.\
    \ Furrow irrigation is suitable for various soils, slopes, and crops especially\
    \ row crops. Crops that will be \ndamaged if water covers the stems or crowns\
    \ should use furrow irrigation [40, 41]. Furrow irrigation is also suitable \n\
    for tree crops. In the early stages of tree planting, using one furrow beside\
    \ the tree row may be sufficient, but as the \ntree grows, creating two or more\
    \ new furrows is necessary to provide sufficient water [42]. (2) Flooding Irrigation\
    \ is \nan irrigation method commonly used to provide water in lowland rice cultivation\
    \ and generally, water carried out \ncontinuously. Flooding is carried out continuously\
    \ at the same height throughout plant growth, starting from planting \nuntil several\
    \ days before harvest [43]. The use of flooding irrigation depends on sufficient\
    \ water to flood the land \nsurface with 10 cm of water. The disadvantage is inhibiting\
    \ plant growth and water wastage [44]. Because flooding \nirrigation uses water\
    \ excessively, flooding irrigation evolved into intermittent irrigation by flooding\
    \ and drying the \nland alternately from planting season until one week before\
    \ the flowering. The water level is maintained at 3 to 5 \ncm during flowering.\
    \ Giving water this way can reduce water usage up to 30 percent without reducing\
    \ crop yields \n[43–45] \n Modern irrigation offers uniform discharge for each\
    \ plant, including nutrients and saving water, mainly when \nplanting is carried\
    \ out in a greenhouse, making it easier to monitor water quantity and quality\
    \ and regulate water \nsupply schedules [46, 47]. The amount of water delivered\
    \ is determined by the plant's demands, irrigation method, \nand type of growing\
    \ medium. The choice of irrigation method influences the type of nutrients, the\
    \ number of \nnutrients, the rate of infiltration, evaporation, water absorption,\
    \ and drainage [12]. \nModern irrigation uses less water and is more efficient\
    \ than conventional irrigation, and this method saves more \nenergy and water.\
    \ It is an effective method for use in areas where water is scarce or has irregular\
    \ rains. This \nmethod allows farmers to cultivate crops consistently, creating\
    \ a reliable food supply [3, 11]. Modern irrigation relies \non water from wells,\
    \ lakes, and reservoirs stored in water tanks and then irrigates plants using\
    \ gravity or water \npumps [12]. The method of giving water is even more specific,\

    \ Radio Service (GPRS) and Zigbee module and built a microprocessor-based gateway\
    \ \nto better control water discharge with water efficiency than conventional\
    \ irrigation systems, with the difference \nbetween conventional and modern irrigation\
    \ can be seen in Figure 2. \n \nFig 2. Types of irrigation \n3.1 \nSprinkler Irrigation\
    \ \nFarmers use sprinkler irrigation to mimic precipitation patterns. They used\
    \ small sprinkler nozzles connected to an \nextensive piping system to ensure\
    \ comprehensive irrigation coverage and used pumps to spray high-pressure \nwater\
    \ onto the air [48]. The advantage of sprinkler is that it minimizes runoff, is\
    \ suitable for all types of soil, and has \na water-saving rate of between 30\
    \ - 50%. Sprinkles can be mixed with fertilizer solutions and used in close \n\
    cropping and high plant population [28]. However, this method has high operating\
    \ costs for cleaning sprinkler \nnozzles and maintaining high-pressure pumps and\
    \ pipes. In addition, sprinkler irrigation is unsuitable for use in \nwindy areas\
    \ because wind gusts and evapotranspiration cause high water loss rates. Moreover,\
    \ regular \nmaintenance of the pipes and their connections to avoid leaks or clogs\
    \ can reduce the water spray pressure, \nreducing water distribution to the plants\
    \ [37, 48]. \n3.2 \nDrip Irrigation \nIn drip irrigation, the water source moistens\
    \ the soil or planting media through the holes in the pipes and flows \nthrough\
    \ a hose connected to the emitter with low pressure. The focus of water droplets\
    \ is a small part of the soil or \ngrowing medium that covers the root zone by\
    \ adjusting it to get water droplets [49]. Drip irrigation is the most \nefficient\
    \ irrigation because it can distribute water and nutrients simultaneously to the\
    \ root zone, which results in \nbetter nutrient uptake. Due to the circulation\
    \ of water in the roots through the capillary principle, the pores of the \nsoil\
    \ or planting medium remain dry so that air circulation is maintained and soil\
    \ moisture is at field capacity. \nProduces a root zone capable of breathing more\
    \ intensely during its growth cycle [25, 37, 50]. \nDrip irrigation uses dripping\
    \ water delivered at a rate of between 2 - 20 liters per hour. The application\
    \ of this \nmethod is to place an emitter on each plant. It is suitable for use\
    \ on vegetables and fruit, but farmers usually only \nconsider high-value plants\
    \ because the investment value is relatively high [37, 49]. This method supports\
    \ various \ntypes of soil by adjusting the speed of water application. Hefty porous\
    \ sandy soils need a fast drip-rate; conversely, \nclay soil needs a slow drip\
    \ rate to avoid water logging and runoff [25, 37]. \n4 MONITORING AND CONTROLLING\
    \ STRATEGIES \nA total of 30 papers were used to examine the irrigation system's\
    \ monitoring and control method. These \npublications provide ways for regulating\
    \ irrigation by employing sensors to measure changes in microclimate, water \n\
    quality, and soil moisture values. The paper's distribution is represented in\
    \ Figure 3 below. \nAn effective and efficient monitoring system is needed to\
    \ collect different plant growth parameters. Monitoring in an \nintelligent irrigation\
    \ system involves collecting data representing the latest microclimate data and\
    \ water and soil \nconditions around the irrigation area through a microcontroller\
    \ connected to the IoT [51], shown in Figure 4. The \ndevelopment of real-time\
    \ monitoring devices was made possible due to the rapid development of microcontrollers\
    \ \nand sensors, low-cost hardware (Arduino UNO, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi), and fast\
    \ internet, which enhanced the \nperformance of monitoring and control systems\
    \ [17, 52]. There are two types of internet connections: wired and \nwireless;\
    \ Wired connections make the internet connection stable, but with fixed hardware\
    \ location. Wireless \nconnection makes flexible hardware placement but has signal\
    \ interference [53]. \n \n660 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview of IOT based\

    \ \n \n \n \nFig 3. Distribution of papers on monitoring and controlling strategies\
    \ \n \nFig 4. Block diagram of IoT based Smart Farming \nAll devices and sensors\
    \ are connected directly to the server via a cabling system in a wired connection\
    \ case. This \nsystem is only effective when a few parameters are measured and\
    \ use a small greenhouse; it is crucial because \nthe more connected devices,\
    \ the more cables are used. So, the wired greenhouse system is not suitable for\
    \ large \nor commercial greenhouses. The advantage is that data transactions are\
    \ safe and have minimal interference [51, \n53, 54]. WSN is the latest technology\
    \ in intelligent farming that can be expanded and scaled up without modifying\
    \ \nthe greenhouse infrastructure. Its wireless form makes it easy to receive\
    \ and transmit data between nodes using \nlow-power frequencies. Unfortunately,\
    \ interference and signal loss are common problems because of the high \nfrequency\
    \ in the air. However, the increase in greenhouse size, the number of parameters,\
    \ sensors variety, node \nsize, and devices distant is not a problem because an\
    \ additional WSN only needs to be attached to an existing \nnetwork. Another advantage\
    \ is Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology, wirelessly connected sensor nodes\
    \ \nnetwork to sense and send various data, and extensible [36, 54, 55]. \nThe\
    \ implementation of WSN in agriculture itself is extensive, with sensors, RFID,\
    \ cameras, drones, and cloud \nservices connected seamlessly for data acquisition\
    \ and transmission. Cloud computing serves data collection and \nanalysis to generate\
    \ visualizations, decision support, and commands; system users (farmers or researchers)\
    \ can \nthen access data remotely via their devices to gain real-time insights\
    \ [19, 56]. Thus, monitoring and controlling the \nintelligent irrigation system\
    \ can be effective, efficient, convenient, and optimal yields. [55] proposed the\
    \ approach \nwith WSN and gateway node to collect soil moisture values in plants\
    \ by taking soil and cultivated plants images. \nThe challenges in building a\
    \ system that can accommodate these two technologies are sensor coverage, \ncommunication\
    \ between devices, computational process efficiency, and electricity usage. [57]\
    \ also offers UAVs for \naerial monitoring of vegetation and irrigation areas.\
    \ \nAppropriate control techniques in intelligent irrigation systems can increase\
    \ crop water supply precisely to improve \nthe efficiency of water use, energy\
    \ savings, harvest optimization, proper use of nutrients, and effective use of\
    \ labor. \n11\n5\n14\n0\n5\n10\n15\nMicroclimate\nWater Quality\nSoil Moisture\n\

    \ systems for greenhouse: recent trends and \nchallenges \n \nJournal of Applied\
    \ Engineering Science- Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nTherefore,\
    \ a control system can manipulate several irrigation parameters, like air circulation,\
    \ air temperature, \nrelative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation [58–60].\
    \ A technology that can analyze the surface temperature \nof agricultural land\
    \ without touching it using thermal imaging was proposed by [61] to determine\
    \ which areas of \nland are in dire need of water because the non-uniformity of\
    \ soil moisture can inhibit spinach growth. Studies by \n[56, 62–64] also state\
    \ that it is possible to use thermal imaging for nurseries, forecasting crop yields,\
    \ pest and \ndisease disturbances, maintenance of agricultural machinery, and\
    \ irrigation scheduling. \n4.1 \nMicroclimate based  \nMonitoring and controlling\
    \ the microclimate in the greenhouse is a critical factor to account for water\
    \ loss due to \nevaporation. Air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation,\
    \ and wind speed need precision measurements to \nmeet crop water requirements\
    \ [30, 65]. The Raspberry Pi, various Arduino models, connected to WSN, and cloud\
    \ \nservers are popular hardware. WSN implementation is an efficient way to interconnect\
    \ various sensors placed far \napart in the greenhouse. The system performs accurate\
    \ system monitoring, collects data, and presents charts, and \ncontrol devices\
    \ are activated, referring to predefined threshold values compared with real-time\
    \ data [30, 36, 66]. \n[59] presented a technique for evaluating microclimate\
    \ parameters in two tropical greenhouses before planting \ntomatoes using LoRa\
    \ wireless and IoT sensors. The comfort ratio model (CftM) and scenario analysis\
    \ show that \nenvironmental conditions can adapt to the growth phase of tomato\
    \ plants. The microclimate before and during \nplanting was analyzed using the\
    \ Simulink app. Also, a study by [67] showed that a microclimate parameter \n\
    measurement device in a greenhouse could yield comprehensive data for temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2 levels, \nlighting levels, soil moisture, acidity, irrigation\
    \ water conductivity, and airflow velocity. In winter, the greenhouse \nbehavior\
    \ was studied by [68] using fuzzy logic control (FLC) due to uncertainty in the\
    \ greenhouse environment. The \nfuzzy set was developed based on experts in greenhouse\
    \ thermal behavior. Fuzzy control manages decisions \nbased on weather forecasts\
    \ and user interactions. [54] also took a similar approach to measure leaf temperature,\
    \ \nair temperature, and soil moisture using three connected sensors to assess\
    \ the level of microclimate in a \ngreenhouse and use Zigbee to transmit sensor\
    \ data. \nControlling the microclimate in the greenhouse by using fan ventilation\
    \ and fan-pad ventilation can also be an \noption. This forced ventilation can\
    \ prevent plants from overheating even if the greenhouse does not use an \nevaporative\
    \ cooling system. Greenhouses can produce good harvests in the spring, and the\
    \ data show a \nrelationship between the greenhouse microclimate and water uptake\
    \ that minimizes drainage [69]. [70] built a \nmonitoring system using an open-source\
    \ platform to collect microclimate variables (air temperature, humidity, soil\
    \ \ntemperature, and soil moisture). Communication between devices uses Bluetooth\
    \ and obtain electricity supply \nthrough solar panels. [71] has proposed improvements\
    \ to the greenhouse IoT-based system by adding color \nspectrum monitoring using\
    \ a camera system to get photos of the plant canopies translated into color (RGB,\
    \ HSL, \nand brightness), plant texture, thermal (plant temperature), and plant\
    \ morphology. The system works with NFT to \nirrigate lettuce plants in the greenhouse,\
    \ automatically recording data and identifying plant stress levels. \n4.2 \nWater\
    \ Quality-based \nWater quality safety is a challenge in the 21st century because\
    \ of the many pollutants, which are predominantly \nartificial such as environmental\
    \ damage, packaging waste, or chemical waste. Overexploitation of natural \nresources,\
    \ rapid industrial development, and agricultural expansion are the leading causes\
    \ of the problem. [72]. \nWater quality is affected by direct and indirect sources\
    \ of pollution such as sewage, factory waste, agricultural and \nurban runoff.\
    \ The need for human involvement in water quality management is essential [73,\
    \ 74]. Water quality \nmanagement is a way to regularly collect water quality\
    \ information in a location to find out its current condition. \nWater quality\
    \ management aims to measure water quality variables such as microbial content\
    \ physical and \nchemical properties, provide an early warning system and provide\
    \ decision support for further treatment [75, 76]. \nWSN and IoT are inevitable\
    \ to manage variables over a wide area for larger areas such as lakes or oceans.\
    \ \n[75] has proposed a system that assesses irrigation water quality with IoT\
    \ by detecting potential hydrogen (pH), \nelectrical conductivity (EC), turbidity,\
    \ and salinity in real-time using different sensors to maintain plant health status.\
    \ \nAlso, [77] undertook a study to build a continuous water quality monitoring\
    \ system using open-source hardware \nand low-cost sensors. Preliminary results\
    \ show that the device can produce accurate results at a lower cost than \nexisting\
    \ technologies with proper calibration. \n4.3 \nSoil Moisture-based \nFarmers\
    \ need to consider soil conditions because moist soil means the plant still has\
    \ enough water for growth [11]. \nMonitoring soil moisture content becomes vital\
    \ as the basis for irrigation scheduling. Raspberry Pi and Arduino \nUNO have\
    \ commonly used devices in developing low-cost IoT-based soil moisture management\
    \ interfaced using \nvarious sensors [30, 60, 75]. The sensor used is a capacitive\
    \ type and transmits electricity without conduction; it \ncan measure soil moisture\
    \ changes by planting them into the soil and measuring its volumetric water content.\
    \ The \nTime Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensor is a more precise option for measuring\
    \ soil moisture, consisting of two \nmetal rods embedded at the depth at which\
    \ the humidity is to be measured. Works by sending pulses to the soil \nand then\
    \ calculating the response of the soil as soil moisture content. Due to its good\
    \ quality in measuring soil \nmoisture, this TDR sensor is quite expensive to\
    \ use in large-scale greenhouses [78, 79]. \n662 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An\

    \ trends \nand challenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science - Vol.20,\
    \ No 3, 2022 - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \n[80] proposed a soil moisture\
    \ control system for measuring water content in soil at different soil depths,\
    \ soil types, \nand air temperatures using various sensors integrated with Arduino\
    \ UNO. The ESP8266 wireless module is then \nlinked to the Arduino to upload data\
    \ to the cloud server. A similar study by [81] succeeded in developing an IoT-\n\
    based field control system integrated with cloud-based data monitoring and analysis.\
    \ The analysis results help \npredict water consumption for better crop yields.\
    \ [82] approach to controlling soil moisture uses wireless technology \nutilizing\
    \ GSM networks and push notifications to automate water supply for plants. A system\
    \ proposed by [83] \npresents an Android application-based humidity monitoring\
    \ method, where an Arduino interface sensor connected \nto Wi-Fi sends state data\
    \ to a smartphone. Another monitoring approach is carried out by [60] using IoT\
    \ and soil \nnutrient sensors to detect nutrient adequacy for plants. The decision\
    \ support system then receives the data \nparameters and processes them as a farming\
    \ decision. \n[84] implemented a user-friendly system, representing the soil moisture\
    \ level with colors. These colors have helped \nfarmers visually identify and\
    \ manage soil moisture content without understanding the values displayed. Likewise,\
    \ \n[85] proposed a soil nutrient control system that can manage the concentration\
    \ of nutrients in the soil by planting \nsensors in the soil to map nutrient variability.\
    \ Also, [86] developed an innovative device that uses a camera-\nintegrated drone\
    \ for field mapping. Images are analyzed to generate soil moisture and nutrient\
    \ values and use \nthem for irrigation planning and scheduling. \n5 ARTIFICIAL\
    \ INTELLIGENCE IN IRRIGATION SYSTEM \nArtificial intelligence in intelligent irrigation\
    \ systems was the subject of 25 papers. These studies concentrate on \ndeveloping\
    \ decision support systems, fuzzy logic models, and artificial neural network\
    \ models that can take \ndecisions automatically in response to changes in field\
    \ conditions. The distribution of articles based on the theme \nof artificial\
    \ intelligence is shown in Figure 5 below. \n \nFig 5. Distribution of papers\
    \ on artificial intelligence in irrigation system \nArtificial intelligence (AI)\
    \ is a branch of science concerned with creating machines that can understand\
    \ and act in \nthe same way as humans. Machine learning is a burgeoning sub-domain\
    \ of AI that explores patterns in large \namounts of data [58, 87]. The popularity\
    \ of machine learning is due to more and more data generated by various \napplications\
    \ and IoT. The system can generate helpful information for making decisions or\
    \ becoming input to other \nsystems by studying data patterns. The need for agricultural\
    \ products is directly proportional to the increase in the \nearth's population,\
    \ so agroindustry and innovative agriculture technology get the spotlight in the\
    \ industrial revolution \n4.0 [16, 46].  \nAI has the potential to solve nonlinear,\
    \ multiparameter, and time-varying problems in managing intelligent irrigation\
    \ \nsystems. By applying AI algorithms to specific problem areas, the system tries\
    \ to imitate human logic, thought \nprocesses, and decision making through the\
    \ application of Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest \nNeighbor\
    \ (kNN), Decision Tree and Random Forest by using past data to feed AI and provides\
    \ new knowledge to \nthe system [58, 61]. [88] has researched by applying different\
    \ regression and machine learning algorithms to \nseveral sensor datasets to develop\
    \ weekly irrigation plan predictions. \nA study implementing an intelligent irrigation\
    \ system shows many advantages, such as minimizing soil stress to \nchanging microclimate\
    \ conditions, efficient water use, and reducing human interaction. This solar\
    \ panel-powered \nsystem has a Sensor Layer, Central Layer, and Valve Layer running\
    \ together. The function of the Central Layer is \nto control the process that\
    \ produces input (sensor layer detects moisture content) and output (valve layer\
    \ opens to \nprovide water). The system also enables fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ by calibrating other sensors according to the \nrequired input [89]. \n5.1 \n\

    \ where the decision support system (DSS) comes in [76, 90]. DSS \nhas a framework\
    \ that can represent complex systems with an efficient and robust approach that\
    \ is easy to \nunderstand generates additional information and new perspectives\
    \ to improve the quality of irrigation management. \nDSS is an information system\
    \ that analyzes data and represents it to make decisions quickly. The primary\
    \ purpose \nof DSS is to support and improve decision-making [28, 76]. Figure\
    \ 6 shows a DSS logic diagram that consists of \nfour connected components: Database,\
    \ model base, knowledge base, and user interface. \n \nFig 6. Block diagram of\
    \ Decision Support System \nThe Database in irrigation DSS collects and manages\
    \ air temperature, relative humidity, crop water requirements, \nirrigation records,\
    \ and solar radiation. The knowledge base has three parts: fact base, rule base,\
    \ and inference \nengine used to analyze data, solve uncertain problems and draw\
    \ conclusions. The model base creates optimization \nmodels, integrates numerous\
    \ decision models, analyzes them to create crop water simulations, and offers\
    \ farmers \nirrigation scheduling. [71, 76]. \nDeveloping and utilizing a decision\
    \ support system in irrigation management is essential for scheduling water \n\
    delivery based on crop needs. The main problem is how moist the soil is and how\
    \ much water the plants need \nbased on the type of plant, planting technique,\
    \ availability of water, amount of fertilizer applied, microclimate \nconditions,\
    \ and stage of plant development [91]. With DSS, farmers can manage their farms\
    \ daily using plant \ndatabases and water supply strategies to perform irrigation\
    \ calculations and fertilization adjustments to obtain \noptimal yields. There\
    \ are times when a system has a crop suggestion feature that advises farmers to\
    \ plant a crop \nthat yields the highest profit under certain constraints [92].\
    \ \nThe problem is that the characteristics of crops, soils, and microclimatic\
    \ conditions in agriculture are dynamic and \nnot linear, varying with seasons.\
    \ Therefore, setting the proper irrigation schedule will directly influence plant\
    \ growth. \nThe core of DSS includes monitoring different parameters using different\
    \ sensors and configuring their rules. DSS \nmanages sensor readings stored in\
    \ the cloud to adjust irrigation scheduling to maintain irrigation system efficiency\
    \ \nroutinely [76, 90]. An intelligent irrigation DSS must have the ability to\
    \ adapt to changes in transient and spatial \nplant dynamics, such as uncertainties\
    \ in microclimate conditions, nutrient requirements, and environmental \nchanges.\
    \ Researchers have proposed many studies on DSS applied to irrigation systems,\
    \ such as [93], who \ndeveloped an automated irrigation system using a single\
    \ lateral pipe covering a large area to manage water at \nvarying speeds. \nSprinkler\
    \ irrigation developed by [94] uses an automatic linear moving sprinkler system\
    \ with WSN based DSS. The \nsystem can adapt to crop types, irrigation requirements,\
    \ and planting locations to command individual sprinkler \nheads how and where\
    \ water must be applied. Similarly, [76] built a DSS integrated fertigation simulator\
    \ for \ndesigning drip or sprinkler irrigation for on-site olives and grapes farms.\
    \ The system has a database, simulation \nmodel, and user interface that shows\
    \ the ranking of design alternatives through multicriteria decision-making \n\
    (MCDM). The scope of the calculation of this system includes land analysis, water\
    \ requirements, and plant \nnutrition. \n664 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview\

    \ model is a data-driven technique with easy-to-understand logical rules. [50,\
    \ 68, 95] proposed a fuzzy \nlogic-based irrigation scheduling by enforcing control\
    \ rules to microclimate data, evaporation data, and soil \nconditions. The process\
    \ flow can be seen in Figure 7. \n[96] succeeded in building and testing a rule-based\
    \ Fuzzy Logic application to assess the water stress index of \nplants in a greenhouse;\
    \ the application accepts three input variables, namely air temperature, solar\
    \ radiation, and \nwater pressure. Results show that Fuzzy Logic eliminates the\
    \ need for air aerodynamic resistance data, making \nthis system more straightforward.\
    \ \n[95] developed fuzzy logic using the LabVIEW application to create a graphical\
    \ user interface (GUI) for a drip \nirrigation control system in a greenhouse.\
    \ The input parameters used are air temperature and soil moisture and \nprocess\
    \ them using fuzzy rules to produce information of irrigation duration. The test\
    \ results show that fuzzy logic \ncontrol can efficiently estimate irrigation\
    \ schedules in an automated system, and greenhouse managers can \nmonitor real-time\
    \ data and devices that are easy to manage, even for ordinary users. [97] research\
    \ also designed \nan irrigation control based on fuzzy logic applying the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation for rice cultivation with a \nparameter model in the difference between\
    \ actual and target evapotranspiration following the plant growth phase. \nEach\
    \ phase has its water requirement. The research aims to develop an intelligent\
    \ system that helps irrigation \nmanagement and produces a system that can work\
    \ better than conventional irrigation systems. The results showed \nthat the control\
    \ system saves water, improves irrigation performance, improves crop quality,\
    \ and saves labor.  \n \nFig 7. Fuzzy Logic-based Intelligent Irrigation System\
    \ \nAlso, [50] developed a fuzzy logic system that evaluates the irrigation system\
    \ based on the variable availability of \nirrigation water during the planting\
    \ period on the level of farmers' income which results in the efficiency of the\
    \ \nirrigation system performance. To assist in making decisions on irrigation\
    \ distribution. [98] conducted similar \nresearch by developing an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system to turn on and off the irrigation system using input \nparameters\
    \ of water use, water and air temperature, and soil moisture. They implement WSN-based\
    \ monitoring to \nsend data on fuzzy logic, which then performs irrigation scheduling\
    \ by applying fuzzy rules. The system can \nmaintain soil moisture content at\
    \ the specified limit to save the use of electrical energy, water, and runoff.\
    \ \n5.3 \nArtificial Neural Network Model \nOne application of AI in agriculture\
    \ is Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithms, which can predict using elements\
    \ \ninterconnected and work in parallel. The advantage of neural networks is that\
    \ they can be trained, for example, to \ndistinguish grass from rice or to compare\
    \ tomatoes to peppers [71]. The ANN system can predict with high \naccuracy when\
    \ fed reliable and precise data. A trained ANN is considered an expert in a category\
    \ of data. This \nexpert can then predict possible future conditions and prepare\
    \ what-if scenarios [73, 87]. Other advantages of ANN \nare (1) Adaptive learning,\
    \ the ability to learn and carry out tasks based on the data provided, (2) Self-organization,\
    \ \nthe system can independently compile and build information representations\
    \ during the learning process, and (3) \nReal-time operations, computations are\
    \ carried out in parallel, so it is faster to get calculation results [99]. \n\
    The ANN model is a simple model consisting of three primary neurons distributed\
    \ in the input layer, multiples of the \nhidden layer, and the output layer. ANN\
    \ development requires necessary basic steps, namely datasets, ANN \nmodel training\
    \ data, and ANN model test data for evaluation. Using quality data, the ANN model\
    \ has a mechanism \nfor self-study and solving complex problems. Input neurons\

    \ linear and \nnonlinear functions [26, 87, 99, 100]. \nThe following Figure 8\
    \ shows the ANN process flow. In general, the use of ANN includes problem-solving\
    \ in system \noptimization, process control, pattern classification, forecasting,\
    \ and prediction. The main components of an ANN \nmodel consist of neuron nodes,\
    \ a hidden layer containing weights between parameters and distribution rules\
    \ to \ngenerate information for learning rules and independent learning skills\
    \ through experience. There are two types of \nANN models based on their input\
    \ choices: feed-forward and feed-backward networks [99]. \n \nFig 8. The flow\
    \ of feed-forward artificial neurons \nEvapotranspiration is essential information\
    \ that needs to be known to optimize plant growth, especially in water \nmanagement\
    \ and sustainable irrigation systems. Knowledge of the parameters of air temperature,\
    \ relative \nhumidity, wind speed, hours of sunshine, and latitude can optimize\
    \ the management of ET0 in a greenhouse [97]. \nANN research on intelligent irrigation\
    \ systems is applied to scheduling and irrigation discharge to achieve savings\
    \ \nin irrigation water use. [87] conducted a study to estimate the value of soil\
    \ moisture in rice farming land using \nminimal micro and macro climate data by\
    \ applying two ANN models. The first model predicts the value of ET0 \nusing the\
    \ minimum, maximum and average air temperature variables. The second model does\
    \ the same thing but \nuses air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation.\
    \ The test results show that both models produce reliable and \naccurate soil\
    \ moisture estimates. \nA study by [101] has developed an ANN model to calculate\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET0). After testing, they concluded \nthat the ANN model\
    \ predicts evapotranspiration better than the conventional ET0 equation. Similarly,\
    \ [90] \ndeveloped an ANN to calculate ET0 and compared it with the Penman-FAO\
    \ equation and Penman-Monteith model \nusing four and six microclimate variables\
    \ as inputs. The test indicates that the three models provide accurate \nresults\
    \ using six input parameters. In contrast, the test results with four parameters\
    \ show that only the ANN model \ncan accurately predict the ET0 value. This research\
    \ shows that building an ANN model is possible even with limited \nmicroclimate\
    \ data.  \nIn addition, irrigation control system automation was also proposed\
    \ by [102] using the ANN cluster and closed-loop \ncontrol, which resulted in\
    \ better performance than time-based irrigation control. However, they did not\
    \ provide \ninformation regarding the irrigation method used and the percentage\
    \ of water savings. [100] developed an \nintelligent irrigation system for evapotranspiration\
    \ using the ANN model and a photovoltaic system to predict \nirrigation scheduling\
    \ based on cropping moisture distribution data; this study reported better daily\
    \ water and \nelectrical energy savings also better crop yields. The application\
    \ of ANN in irrigation water management has also \ndiscussed prediction of water\
    \ salinity, water quality, rain runoff, and forecasting of surface irrigation\
    \ infiltration,  \n[73] proposed two ANN models to predict Biochemical Oxygen\
    \ Demand (BOD) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) for \nirrigation water originating from\
    \ rivers; the conclusion is that water quality management in other areas can also\
    \ use \nthis ANN model. Similarly, [103] uses the ANN model to design an intelligent\
    \ system to manage water systems for \nagriculture and fisheries. [104] explained\
    \ that the greenhouse environment has dynamic and complex \ncharacteristics, making\
    \ it difficult to use conventional control methods as a solution. Radial Basis\
    \ Function Neural \nNetworks (RBF) algorithm and nonlinear adaptive controllers\
    \ become solutions to control greenhouse microclimate. \n[74] discusses the use\
    \ of ANN in drip irrigation systems to predict the distribution of subsurface\
    \ irrigation water. \nThe development of the ANN is to model the continuous wetting\
    \ pattern after the water droplets from the emitter \ntouch the ground surface.\
    \ \n6 FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES \nThis review explored the various studies\
    \ and progress to improve irrigation water use efficiency, nutrient \noptimization,\
    \ and crop yields. The aim is to improve and increase food availability by implementing\
    \ IoT-based \nmonitoring and control on agricultural land, especially greenhouses.\
    \ The review results show that researchers and \n666 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al.\

    \ trends \nand challenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science - Vol.20,\
    \ No 3, 2022 - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \nfarmers can maximize the use\
    \ of the latest IoT technologies for environmental conditions monitoring, data-driven\
    \ \ncontrol, and artificial intelligence. Nowadays, there is an increase in research\
    \ that develops techniques and models \nfor developing irrigation control systems.\
    \ The trend is due to the emergence of various sensors and controls on the \n\
    market; this provides vast opportunities for the development of precision agriculture,\
    \ especially for making \nintelligent predictions of agricultural processes such\
    \ as crop yields, crop water requirements, and microclimate \nconditions. Researchers\
    \ also need to explore other factors that influence irrigation scheduling planning,\
    \ especially \nin large agricultural areas, because researchers generally conduct\
    \ studies on a laboratory scale. Research from \ndifferent perspectives will enrich\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems and result in inaccurate predictions that can\
    \ advise \nfarmers regarding their farming activities and notify them when anomalies\
    \ occur. \nFurthermore, researchers need to test various control systems in the\
    \ irrigation systems discussed, focus on \nadaptive control, and combine it with\
    \ real-time monitoring. It is essential to build systems that can adapt to dynamic\
    \ \nparameters of microclimate, soil, and plant. At the same time, ensure the\
    \ intelligent irrigation system runs optimally. \nIn addition, it is essential\
    \ to develop intelligent irrigation systems that are increasingly complex and\
    \ digital-based so \nthat the technology is suitable, affordable, and stable for\
    \ smallholders. The hope is to increase water use efficiency \nand solve water\
    \ scarcity. \n7 CONCLUSION \nLimited water has become the biggest challenge for\
    \ farmers, and efficiency must solve water scarcity in irrigation \nmanagement.\
    \ The main objective is to control the amount and frequency of irrigation so that\
    \ the amount of water \nreceived by plants is sufficient to keep the root zone\
    \ moist. Farmers who are generally ignorant about the \ncomplexity of optimal\
    \ irrigation management need a system that can facilitate big data processing\
    \ analysis tools \nand transmit quality information quickly and efficiently. The\
    \ system must be able to provide recommendations \naccording to the conditions\
    \ of the agricultural environment to increase the experience and decision-making\
    \ of \nfarmers. \nThis problem challenges researchers to increase efforts to develop\
    \ sophisticated monitoring and control strategies \nfor intelligent farming that\
    \ minimize irrigation water use. This review draws on previous relevant studies\
    \ on \nagriculture water saving. The review results describe research trends in\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems monitoring \nand control strategies and assess\
    \ research opportunities to ensure water availability and savings. We hope this\
    \ \nreview provides insight and inspiration for researchers to continue research\
    \ on irrigation monitoring and control to \nachieve food security and water savings.\

    \ the development of Agriculture 4.0 has \ntaken place, which encompasses concepts\
    \ ranging from precision agriculture, moni-\ntoring, decision-making; as well\
    \ as those related to Industry 4.0, IoT, machine learning, \nsustainability and\

    \ the activities that has contributed significant-\nly to the country’s development,\
    \ with the agricultural sector being one of the main \ncontributors to the Colombian\
    \ economy and sustainable development. Given the geo-\ngraphical and climatic\

    \ have great potential, but due to factors related to productivity, innovation,\
    \ \nquality standards, among others, the country’s agricultural development has\
    \ lagged \nand the need to establish policies in line with the technological advances\
    \ of agriculture \nworldwide is increasing [1].\nAn Agricultural Production Unit\
    \ - APU is defined as an agricultural production \norganization unit that produces\
    \ agricultural, forestry, livestock, and aquaculture goods. \nIt also has a single\
    \ natural or legal producer and uses some means of production such \nas machinery,\
    \ workforce, buildings, or equipment on its land [2]. Currently, of the total\

    \ Cooperativa de Colombia\nTraditional Colombian agriculture is characterized\
    \ by the use of ancient tech-\nniques that have been applied by several generations\
    \ of Colombian farmers and \nare still in use today, either because they are associated\
    \ with deep-rooted cultural \nknowledge or because the technological gap is an\
    \ obstacle to the adaptation and \napplication of new technologies in agriculture.\
    \ The development and implementation \nof technologies that contribute to improving\
    \ the activities carried out in agriculture \nand increase the productivity of\
    \ the sector have been presented late in Colombia if \nwe make the comparison\
    \ with worldwide projects and advances made in precision \nagriculture and Agriculture\
    \ 4.0; however, in the last decade, some projects related to \nprecision agriculture\
    \ have been implemented that involve the application of ICT and \nIoT and that\
    \ can be considered as a basis for the further development of Agriculture \n4.0\
    \ in the country. Based on the above, this article presents a review of the most\
    \ rel-\nevant aspects related to the technological development of Colombian agriculture\
    \ and \nprojects that have been carried out in the country in the field of precision\
    \ agriculture. It \nalso addresses the context of the progress of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 at the national level and \npresents possible IoT integration tools and\
    \ architectures applicable in this field. Finally, \nthe benefits and implications\
    \ of the development of Agriculture 4.0 in the country \nare highlighted, emphasising\
    \ through this work the importance and necessity of the \nconsolidation of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 to strengthen national agricultural development.\n2. PRECISION AGRICULTURE\
    \ IN COLOMBIA\nPrecision agriculture “is a concept of agricultural management\
    \ that uses digital tech-\nniques to monitor and optimize agricultural production\
    \ processes” [4, p. 4]. Precision \nagriculture aims to optimize the management\
    \ of agricultural production by taking into \naccount soil and crop variability,\
    \ by using technologies that allow agricultural activ-\nities to be adjusted according\
    \ to the specific requirements of the soil and the plant. \nThe beginnings of\
    \ precision agriculture date back to the late 1980s in Europe and \nthe United\
    \ States, while in Latin America it began in the late 1990s and early 2000s, \n\
    with Argentina and Brazil being pioneers in the implementation of precision agricul-\n\
    ture practices. In Colombia, given that traditional agricultural practices continue\
    \ to be \nused in most agricultural work, the boom in precision agriculture has\
    \ been occurring \nin the last decade with the implementation of technologies\
    \ and the development of \nprojects in the cultivation of relevant agricultural\
    \ products in the country, such as \ncoffee, sugarcane, and oil palm.\nThe traditional\
    \ agricultural practices prevailing in the country have brought \nabout adverse\
    \ effects reflected in low crop productivity, inefficient use of resources, \n\

    \ management of crops without taking into account their specificities, \nwhich\
    \ have a negative impact on both the farmers’ economy –since profitability is\
    \ \ndetermined by the potential of their crops– and on the environment –since\
    \ the eco-\nlogical impact caused by the inadequate management of inputs and resources\
    \ con-\ntributes to land degradation–. Based on this, precision agriculture has\
    \ made inroads \nin Colombian agriculture as a solution to the counterproductive\
    \ effects of traditional \nagricultural practices, generating benefits such as\
    \ increased crop productivity due to \nthe use of the production potential of\
    \ the land, reduced use of fertilizers, and waste \nof resources since their use\
    \ is based on the specific requirements of the crop and/or \nsoil, reduced negative\
    \ impacts due to land degradation and reduced production costs.\nThe development\
    \ and implementation of precision agriculture technologies in \nthe country have\
    \ been achieved as a result of research work by universities, institu-\ntions,\
    \ research centers for Colombian agricultural products, and public and private\
    \ \ncompanies, such as the National University of Colombia, the University of\
    \ the Llanos, \nthe University of Nariño, Cenicaña, Cenicafé, Cenipalma, SENA,\
    \ IGAC and Ingenio Río \nPaila-Castilla, among others. In most cases, the precision\
    \ agriculture applications \nand projects developed a focus on aspects such as\
    \ soil variability analysis, use of \ngeographic information, use of sensors,\
    \ and drones [5].\nRegarding unmanned aerial vehicles or drones, their boom in\
    \ the country began \nin 2015, being used in remote sensing processes as part\
    \ of precision agriculture tech-\nnologies focused on crop management. The images\
    \ obtained by drones, also known \nas UAV’s (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), are mostly\
    \ used in the activities of monitoring, \ntracking, and identification of diseases\
    \ in crops of a smaller extension of land; while \nfor crops of large extensions\
    \ the use of satellite images is employed [6].\nConcerning the application of\
    \ precision agriculture technologies and the lay-\nout of plantations along with\
    \ the management of pests and crop diseases, research \nconducted by the Center\
    \ for Oil Palm Research (Cenipalma) in 2011 showed that \nby performing the automatic\
    \ layout of plantations with the use of AMS technology \n(Agricultural Management\
    \ Solutions of the brand John Deere) a significant improve-\nment in the performance\
    \ of this activity can be obtained if compared to the perfor-\nmance obtained\
    \ by doing the layout manually; additionally, the effectiveness of the \nuse of\
    \ geographic information technologies in activities related to agronomic man-\n\
    agement activities was demonstrated [7]. With the support of Corpoica (Colombian\
    \ \nAgricultural Research Corporation), research was conducted in 2015 related\
    \ to the \nanalysis of multispectral images using drones [8], from which it was\
    \ concluded that \nthe use of this precision agriculture technology is very useful\
    \ when carrying out activ-\nities related to the monitoring and diagnosis of the\
    \ development conditions of a crop; \n8\nColombian agriculture: approaching agriculture\
    \ 4.0.\nIngeniería Solidaria\ne-ISSN 2357-6014 / Vol. 18, no. 2/may-august 2022\
    \ / Bogotá D.C., Colombia\nUniversidad Cooperativa de Colombia\nas drones facilitate\
    \ the use of multispectral cameras from which images of varied \ntonalities can\
    \ be obtained to identify problems in specific areas of the crop.\nRegarding the\
    \ application of precision agriculture in the fertilization process, \nin 2018\
    \ an investigation was carried out on banana crops using satellite images, \n\
    drones for the collection of aerial images and sensors to perform measurements\
    \ of \nsoil variables, to obtain the characterization of the soil and subsequently\
    \ identify and \ndetermine the agronomic management units (AMU); these being understood\
    \ as “a \nspatial unit of cultivation within which there is relative homogeneity\
    \ in the variables \nthat affect productivity” [9, pp. 42-51]. With this, it was\
    \ possible to establish with great-\ner precision the number of inputs required\
    \ for each AMU according to its specific \ncharacteristics, thus reaching the\
    \ conclusion that the fertilization plan developed for \neach AMU, based on the\
    \ information obtained through the application of precision \nagriculture technologies,\
    \ decreases production costs as the use of fertilizers is lower \ncompared to\
    \ traditional management [10].\n3. AGRICULTURE 4.0 IN COLOMBIA\nAgriculture 4.0\
    \ began in the early 2010s with the development and evolution of tech-\nnologies\
    \ such as sensors, ICT systems, microprocessors, IoT, and Big Data [11]. It \n\
    “consists of the integration of agricultural processes with information technologies,\
    \ \nusing algorithms, massive amounts of data acquired in the field by sensors,\
    \ to in-\ncrease crop productivity and improve the management of rural properties”\
    \ [12, p. 13]. \nIn this way, the incursion of smart technologies in agriculture\
    \ gave way to the mod-\nernization of various activities and processes that have\
    \ transformed the agricultural \nproduction chain in several countries, thus achieving\
    \ the optimization of fieldwork \nthanks to the use of tools related to information\
    \ technologies, Big Data and data sci-\nence, and automation [12].\nAs support\
    \ for decision making related to crop management, Agriculture 4.0 \nuses tools\
    \ such as sensors to obtain data from the field, IoT to send the data ob-\ntained\
    \ to the network, cloud computing technologies to access data and information\
    \ \non the Internet, Big Data for the analysis of the data and information collected,\
    \ and in \nsome cases connectivity between mobile devices and machine-to-machine\
    \ (M2M) \ncommunication [13]. According to the World Government Summit [14], some\
    \ of the \ntechnologies employed in Agriculture 4.0 that are contributing to the\
    \ transformation of \nagriculture focus on the use of new techniques for food\
    \ production such as hydropon-\nic agriculture, and the incorporation of technologies\
    \ such as automation, IoT, drones in \n9\nJosé Ignacio Rodríguez Molano, Yeimy\

    Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia\nplanting activities, irrigation, crop analysis,\
    \ and monitoring, and Blockchain to optimize \ntraceability and security in food\
    \ supply chains.  \nDue to the technological and digital gap and the lack of policies\
    \ in line with \ncurrent technological advances, the development of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 has not been fully \nadopted in the country; however, in recent years, some\
    \ actions, projects, and research \nhave been carried out that can be considered\
    \ as the foundations for a future incursion \nof Agriculture 4.0 in Colombia.\
    \ One of these actions was the creation, in 2017, of the \n“Strategic Plan for\
    \ Science, Technology, and Innovation of the Colombian Agricultural \nSector 2017-2027\
    \ (PECTIA for its Spanish acronym)” and the National Agricultural \nInnovation\
    \ System (SNIA for its Spanish acronym). These strategies are designed to \nimprove\
    \ productivity, sustainability and strengthen the Colombian agricultural sector\
    \ \nthrough research, innovation, knowledge management and technological development\
    \ \nactivities [15]. Another foundational action for the development of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 in the \ncountry took place in recent years with the implementation of the\
    \ Smart Agro 4.0; a \nproject of FAO in collaboration with the company Telefónica,\
    \ which also had coverage \nin Peru and El Salvador, and whose implementation\
    \ began in 2018 and ended in 2020. \nThis pilot project aimed to apply innovation\
    \ and digitalization technologies to promote \nsustainable agricultural practices,\
    \ for which it made use of an integrated system that \nallowed control activities,\
    \ monitoring, and prediction of agronomic variables, using \nwater sensors and\
    \ a mathematical model for obtaining and processing crop data. In \nthe case of\
    \ Colombia, the project was carried out in potato and coffee crops and, by \n\
    2019, the results obtained showed that potato production had doubled, its quality\
    \ had \nimproved and there was a decrease of approximately 44% in unit production\
    \ costs; \nall achieved thanks to the implementation of technological improvements\
    \ in the crop \nirrigation systems [16].\nRegarding research developed in the\
    \ country and that have applied Agriculture \n4.0 tools, there is the implementation\
    \ of a wireless sensor network for the irrigation \ncontrol system of a strawberry\
    \ crop in the highlands of Pasto [17], from which informa-\ntion is obtained on\
    \ soil moisture in various areas of the crop and subsequently deter-\nmines the\
    \ specific area and the required irrigation time of the same. This is executed\
    \ \nthrough a closed-loop control system that uses soil moisture, which is measured\
    \ by \nthe sensors as an output variable and then feeds it back to the controller\
    \ that gen-\nerates the action to be executed by the respective actuators. The\
    \ application of this \nsystem, in contrast to traditional irrigation, improved\
    \ water use in the irrigation activity \nand, in turn, a significant improvement\
    \ in fruit quality was obtained. Also, a study was \nconducted in which drones\
    \ were used for monitoring and diagnostic activities of a \npotato crop in Cundinamarca\
    \ [8] whose results were reflected in the reduction of work \n10\nColombian agriculture:\

    \ drones, coupled with \nmultispectral cameras, obtain high-resolution images\
    \ with which it is easier to identify \nthe problems that crops present, helping\
    \ to better determine the necessary measures \nto intervene in the specific affected\
    \ area [18].\n4. IoT INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURES\nAND TOOLS APPLICABLE TO COLOMBIAN\n\
    AGRICULTURE\nGlobally, several types of research have been carried out to develop\
    \ complements \nand technological solutions that improve the performance and productivity\
    \ of agri-\ncultural activities, taking into account the aspects covered by Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 and its \nimplementation through IoT technologies which, when applied to\
    \ agriculture, com-\nprise some main aspects which are: Physical structure or\
    \ hardware components, \ndata acquisition, and their respective processing and\
    \ analysis [19]. In this way, pro-\nposed architectures for precision agriculture\
    \ have been generated, mostly focused on \nmonitoring crop variables.\nIn Colombia,\
    \ for example, researchers from Armenia and Popayán conducted \nan IoT architecture\
    \ proposal for the analysis of climatic variables of a crop based on \nthe Lambda\
    \ architecture to establish the layers of the structure of the proposed archi-\n\
    tecture [20], which consist of: a Capture layer, made up of hardware components\
    \ such \nas sensors and data acquisition modules; a storage layer, to store the\
    \ data collected \nthrough databases and storage servers; a processing layer,\
    \ in which data analysis is \ncarried out using interpretation tools; and a query\
    \ layer, which provides the visualiza-\ntion of the information to the end-user\
    \ to know the behavior of the climatic variables \nof the crop, as well as receive\
    \ recommendations to make decisions according to the \nrequirements presented\
    \ by the crop (Figure 4). This proposed architecture highlights \nthe use of low-cost\
    \ sensors and the Arduino YUN board for their ease of use as tools to \ncapture\
    \ the climatic variables of the crop, as well as the use of the free software\
    \ Weka \nfor data mining, with which the information was presented to the user\
    \ in the graphical \ninterface of the query layer. \n11\nJosé Ignacio Rodríguez\

    \ data collection, processing and analysis, and the \npresentation of the information\

    \ agricultural activities such as soil sampling and mapping through sen-\nsors\
    \ that inform the user of the state and properties of the soil; crop irrigation\
    \ with pro-\ngrammed and more efficient systems; precise fertilizer application\
    \ according to the \nrequirements of each crop zone; pest and disease control\
    \ using sensors and image \nprocessing tools; and crop monitoring using monitors\
    \ and yield maps [23]. Geographic \nInformation Systems or GIS are also part of\
    \ the application tools for precision ag-\nriculture. These are software with\
    \ data storage and processing modules that have \na defined geographic location,\
    \ allowing for the analysis, monitoring, simulation and \npresentation of large\
    \ amounts of data and information in the form of graphs, maps and \nmultimedia\
    \ systems. The application of this type of geoprocessing tool, with which \ncrop\
    \ spatial variability mapping can be performed, is of great help to manage agri-\n\
    cultural production systems in areas with low productivity as they support decision\
    \ \nmaking based on the state and requirements of the crop [24]. Such spatial\
    \ variability \nof crops can be estimated by: continuous measurement methods such\
    \ as yield mon-\nitors, discrete ones such as soil sampling, and remote ones such\
    \ as the use of satellite \nimagery. Yield monitors consist of devices that perform\
    \ periodic measurements of \nthe flow of harvested material and, from this, calculate\
    \ a crop yield value, generating \nestimates with which yield maps can be constructed,\
    \ which graphically present crop \nyield data and thus allow for the identification\
    \ of areas that require intervention to \nimprove their production [25].\nAnother\
    \ of the Agriculture 4.0 tools that can be more extensively applicable to \nthe\
    \ variety of crops in the country consists of the wireless sensor network, whose\
    \ \nuse and application extends to activities such as land monitoring, greenhouses,\
    \ and \nautomated irrigation systems; this is based on the measurement of environmental\
    \ \nfactors through the deployment of two types of sensor nodes: the source node,\
    \ which \nperforms measurements of the environment and collects this data, and\
    \ the receiver \nnode, which collects the information from the source node [26].\
    \ As presented in [27], \nthrough the use of an automation system composed of\
    \ sensors and actuators, and \nmonitoring and control software, better results\
    \ are obtained when installing an auto-\nmatic control system for a greenhouse\
    \ crop, as this eliminates the uncertainty factors \nassociated with manual crop\
    \ control, as there is greater precision and control of cli-\nmatic conditions\
    \ and environmental variables, leading to better results in terms of crop \ngrowth\
    \ and development. Complementary to the above, and taking as a reference the \n\
    projects developed in several European countries, automated crop monitoring could\
    \ \nalso be considered as a technology applicable to Colombian agriculture to\
    \ optimize \nthe performance of some agricultural activities; it uses probes and\
    \ sensors to collect \ndata and, based on the interpretation of these data through\

    \ AND IMPLICATIONS OF\nAGRICULTURE 4.0 IN COLOMBIA\nAccording to the Food and\
    \ Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the \nincursion of digital\
    \ technologies in agriculture can generate benefits in three relevant \nareas:\
    \ environmental, with systems that adapt to climate change, and by optimizing\
    \ \nthe use of resources required in agricultural production; economic, reducing\
    \ pro-\nduction costs and increasing agricultural productivity; and social, allowing\
    \ greater \ninclusion. For this, the country must have essential conditions for\
    \ the proper ap-\nplication of digital technologies and to make way for the digital\
    \ transformation of \nColombian agriculture, such as ensuring the affordability\
    \ of smartphones to farmers, \nimproving infrastructure and connectivity to enable\
    \ Internet access in different terri-\ntories nationwide, training and educating\
    \ the population on the use of ICTs and digital \ntools, and establishing policies\
    \ and programs that promote the digital transformation \nof agriculture and agricultural\
    \ development [29].\nTraditional Colombian agriculture has always been affected\
    \ by extreme weath-\ner events such as the El Niño and La Niña phenomena, which\
    \ cause crops in various \nregions nationwide to be damaged by droughts, rains,\
    \ or frosts. Given this, the im-\nplementation of Agriculture 4.0 practices in\
    \ the country would constitute an efficient \nsolution to face and adapt to climate\
    \ changes, contributing to the reduction of the \neconomic losses generated by\
    \ them and affecting farmers. This highlights the need \nfor the country to eliminate\
    \ or minimize the existing technological and digital divide, \nand to invest in\
    \ education so that society acquires digital knowledge that will not \nonly be\
    \ necessary and beneficial when applied in the agricultural context but will also\
    \ \ncontribute to the development and progress of the nation in general.\nHowever,\
    \ climate change and low agricultural productivity, global population \ngrowth,\
    \ and with this the increased demand for natural resources and food, are fun-\n\
    damental aspects associated with agriculture and represent challenges to be faced\
    \ \nwith the application of technological practices of Agriculture 4.0 [14]; this,\
    \ added to \nthe challenges that have arisen when developing Agriculture 4.0 in\
    \ other countries \nand that should also be considered for its advancements in\
    \ Colombia, such as those \nrelated to low internet coverage and connectivity,\
    \ the workforce that is not trained in \ntechnology, and aversion to it [23].\n\

    \ related to Agriculture 4.0 have been developed \nin the country, to achieve\
    \ its consolidation at the national level it is necessary to invest \nin technology\
    \ and provide education and training to the actors involved in the agri-\ncultural\
    \ sector so that they obtain the knowledge required to apply the technological\
    \ \nmodels and tools in their crops according to their capabilities and requirements.\n\
    Given that, at the national level, the implementation of automation in the ag-\n\
    ricultural sector is scarce, the promotion of research in this area will contribute\
    \ to \nthe development of advances and projects that will strengthen the deployment\
    \ of \nAgriculture 4.0 in the country. In this way, the application of Agriculture\
    \ 4.0 practices in \nthe country will allow farmers to optimize agricultural activities,\
    \ improve crop produc-\ntivity and take advantage of their potential, reduce costs\
    \ and production requirements, \nbe competitive, adapt to change, and produce\
    \ sustainably.\nTo meet the challenges affecting the agricultural sector, it is\
    \ necessary for \nColombian farmers to gradually replace traditional production\
    \ methods and adopt \nmodern technological practices, allowing their activities\
    \ to adapt to change and im-\nprove food production. In this way, the application\
    \ of Agriculture 4.0 will contribute to \nstrengthening and promoting the development\
    \ of national agriculture.\nREFERENCES\n[1] \nMinisterio de Agricultura y Desarrollo\

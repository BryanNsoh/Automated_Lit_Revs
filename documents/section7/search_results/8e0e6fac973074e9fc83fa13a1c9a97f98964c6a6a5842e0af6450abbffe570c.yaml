    \ in any medium, provided the original work is\nproperly cited.\nIn recent years,\
    \ intelligent sensor techniques have achieved signiﬁcant attention in agriculture.\
    \ It is applied in agriculture to plan the\nseveral activities and missions properly\
    \ by utilising limited resources with minor human interference. Currently, plant\
    \ cultivation\nusing new agriculture methods is very popular among the growers.\
    \ However, the aeroponics is one of the methods of modern\nagriculture, which\
    \ is commonly practiced around the world. In the system, plant cultivates under\
    \ complete control conditions in\nthe growth chamber by providing a small mist\
    \ of the nutrient solution in replacement of the soil. The nutrient mist is ejected\n\
    through atomization nozzles on a periodical basis. During the plant cultivation,\
    \ several steps including temperature, humidity,\nlight intensity, water nutrient\
    \ solution level, pH and EC value, CO2 concentration, atomization time, and atomization\
    \ interval\ntime require proper attention for ﬂourishing plant growth. Therefore,\
    \ the object of this review study was to provide signiﬁcant\nknowledge about early\
    \ fault detection and diagnosis in aeroponics using intelligent techniques (wireless\
    \ sensors). So, the farmer\ncould monitor several paraments without using laboratory\
    \ instruments, and the farmer could control the entire system\nremotely. Moreover,\
    \ the technique also provides a wide range of information which could be essential\
    \ for plant researchers and\nprovides a greater understanding of how the key parameters\
    \ of aeroponics correlate with plant growth in the system. It oﬀers\nfull control\
    \ of the system, not by constant manual attention from the operator but to a large\
    \ extent by wireless sensors.\nFurthermore, the adoption of the intelligent techniques\
    \ in the aeroponic system could reduce the concept of the usefulness of\nthe system\
    \ due to complicated manually monitoring and controlling process.\n1. Introduction\n\
    Agriculture has an ancient history nearly dates back to\nthousands of years. Moreover,\
    \ its advancement has been\npushed by implementing the several new systems, practices,\n\
    technologies, and approaches with the time. It employs over\none-third of the\
    \ global workforce [1]. The agriculture is the\nbackbone of an economy for many\
    \ countries and executes a\nsigniﬁcant contribution to the development of the\
    \ economy\nfor underdeveloped countries. Besides, it steers the process\nof economic\
    \ prosperity in developed countries. Several\nresearch studies concluded that\
    \ overall world agriculture uses\napproximately seventy percent per year available\
    \ fresh water\nto irrigate only seventeen percent of the land. Another side,\n\
    the total available irrigated land is gradually decreasing due\nto the rapidly\
    \ increasing of food requirements and eﬀects of\nglobal warming [2, 3]. In other\
    \ words, agriculture is dealing\nwith new main signiﬁcant challenges. Foote [4]\
    \ said FAO\nreported that world food production must be increased by\nseventy\
    \ percent to provide suﬃcient food production for\nthe fast-growing population\
    \ and urbanisation. The expected\nworld population growth for the half of the\
    \ present century\nis daunting. However, depending on the estimate, it could\n\
    be expected to rise above the nine billion people by midcen-\ntury. As many studies\
    \ reported that the population is increas-\ning very fast, the global population\
    \ was one billion in 1800,\nHindawi\nJournal of Sensors\nVolume 2018, Article\
    \ ID 8672769, 18 pages\nhttps://doi.org/10.1155/2018/8672769\nand it increased\
    \ to seven billion people in 2012. However,\nstudies report feared that at the\
    \ end of the current century,\nit could be expected to reach eleven billion people\
    \ and there\ncould be many, many more mouths to feed soon. Thus, the\nrapid increase\
    \ of the population, alongside the decrease in\nagriculture land, intensiﬁcation\
    \ of global climate changes,\nand exacerbation of water resources, declines labour\
    \ force\nand energy crunches are posing tremendous challenges and\nhurdles to\
    \ the agriculture sector [5, 6]. Furthermore, the\ndeveloping and developed countries\
    \ will deal with substantial\nwater crises and issues due to rapid urbanisation\
    \ and indus-\ntrialisation. The available fresh water for irrigated agriculture\n\
    land is supposed to decrease in future [7, 8]. Besides, the\nunpredictable climate\
    \ changes include extreme weather con-\nditions, intense storms, heat waves, and\
    \ ﬂoods will have a\nsubstantial adverse impact on world agriculture sector. We\n\
    need more production from agricultural systems to meet\nthe growing food demands.\
    \ Otherwise, we will suﬀer from\nfood insecurity problems which will be the biggest\
    \ threat.\nMoreover, Qiu and coworkers [9] revealed that the progress\nof the\
    \ agriculture production is not only signiﬁcant for to\nproducing food to feed\
    \ the population, but it is also essential\nfor the industrial sector. Similarly,\
    \ the agriculture is the main\nsource to produce the raw material for many industrial\
    \ sec-\ntors. Therefore, it must be understood that industrial and\nagricultural\
    \ developments are not alternatives. However,\nboth sectors are complementary\
    \ to each other on the path\nto achieving the food security issues.\nAs the evolution\
    \ of humankind from hunters and gath-\nerers to agrarian societies, the eﬀorts\
    \ have mainly focused\non improving the plant yield and productivity by either\n\
    genetic changes, cultural or husbandry, management prac-\ntices, or by developing\
    \ and introducing plant protection\nmeasures. Accordingly, in the last and present\
    \ century,\npeoples have started exploring the possibilities by adopting\ndiﬀerent\
    \ modern techniques in agriculture. The adoption\nof the precision farming methods\
    \ in agriculture is one of\nthe excellent examples. The purpose is to try and\
    \ mechan-\nise them in agriculture to prevent the crop losses due to\nsudden climatic\
    \ changes, soil-borne diseases, pest attaches,\nand so on. However, many research\
    \ studies have been\nsuggested and reported that problems and challenges of\n\
    agriculture could overcome by adopting the precision farm-\ning methods. At present,\
    \ several countries are increasing\ntheir farming productivities by implementing\
    \ the precision\nfarming methods.\nBaudoin et al. [10] reported that the artiﬁcial\
    \ plant grow-\ning method (e.g., greenhouse and factory farms) is one of the\n\
    fundamental types of precision agriculture. Nowadays, the\nmethod is receiving\
    \ importance and gaining the intention\nof the growers. The method can provide\
    \ suﬃcient food\nsupply throughout the year. In the system, the plant grows\n\
    around the year by artiﬁcially adjusting and controlling\nthe surrounding environmental\
    \ conditions such as tempera-\nture, CO2 (carbon dioxide), humidity, light intensity,\
    \ airﬂow,\nand nutrients supply within the conﬁned facilities [11, 12].\nBesides,\
    \ the system minimises environmental impact and\nmaximises the crop yield with\
    \ signiﬁcant results as compared\nwith traditional (open-ﬁeld) cultivation system\
    \ [13]. Savvas\nand team [14] informed that at present soilless plant cultiva-\n\
    tion is one of the most disruptive inventions ever presented\nin the ﬁeld of artiﬁcial\
    \ plant growing system. The soilless sys-\ntem refers to plant cultivation techniques\
    \ without the use of\nsoil by providing artiﬁcial solid material or water nutrient\n\
    solution as a growing medium instead of soil. However, the\nwater culture is related\
    \ to the process of hydroponic and\naeroponic plant cultivation (Figure 1). In\
    \ both methods, the\nroots of the plant are continuously or intervalley nurtured\n\
    with or within water nutrient solution by providing a spe-\nciﬁc control environment\
    \ in artiﬁcial supporting structure\n[16, 17]. Both methods provide many beneﬁts\
    \ to the grower\nsuch as full control of nutrient concentration and supply and\n\
    prevention of many soil-borne diseases and infections to\nplant, thus resulting\
    \ in increased plant yield with signiﬁcant\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n\

    \ of available\nnatural resources [18, 19].\nSeveral studies reported aeroponic\
    \ and hydroponic\nsystems as a modern and innovative plant cultivation tech-\n\
    niques under the soilless system. By adopting these tech-\nniques, the growing\
    \ food crises could be resolved [20, 21].\nMoreover, the hydroponic system to\
    \ grow initially leafy\ngreen vegetables was the ﬁrst to emerge, which started\
    \ taking\ncommercial exploitation routes in industrialised countries in\nwest\
    \ and east but eventually was found to have particular\ndefects and problems that\
    \ forced people to discover and\nexperiment with newer variations and techniques\
    \ like the\naeroponic system. According to the NASA report, the aero-\nponic system\
    \ could reduce water, nutrient, and pesticide\nusage by 98, 60, and 100 percent,\
    \ respectively, and increase\nthe plant yield by 45 to 75 percent [22].\nThe primary\
    \ motivation of this review article is to pro-\nvide an idea about the use of\
    \ intelligent sensor techniques\nin the aeroponic system. It could provide an\
    \ opportunity\nfor full automation, scalability, anytime-anyplace access\nmonitoring,\
    \ and fault diagnostics in the aeroponic system.\nMoreover, it would be helpful\
    \ for the local farmer and grower\nto provide timely information about rising\
    \ problems and\ninﬂuencing factors for successful plant growth in the aeropo-\n\
    nic system. The farmers could start to understand their crops\nat a micro scale\
    \ and able to communicate with plant through\naccessible technology. To the best\
    \ of our knowledge, this is\nthe ﬁrst work to provide a brief review of the use\
    \ of intelligent\nsensor techniques in the aeroponic system. However, the rest\n\
    of the paper is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the\ncurrent work in\
    \ the aeroponic system with intelligent sensor\ntechniques. In Sections 3, 4,\
    \ and 5, we present the brief\ndescription about the aeroponic system, application,\
    \ and\nworking protocol of wireless sensor network in the aeroponic\nsystem. Sections\
    \ 6, 7, 8, and 9 describe the advantages, future\napplication, application of\
    \ artiﬁcial intelligence in agricul-\nture, and conclusion.\n2. Related Work\n\
    Aeroponics is the new plant growing technique of modern\nagriculture. Until now,\
    \ it is not entirely implicated among\nthe farmers. Mostly, it is practiced by\
    \ the researchers for\nperforming the experimental studies. Their study reports\n\
    concluded that it could be well accepted in agriculture as\na modern-day plant\
    \ cultivation activity where the modern\nfarmer does not need soil to grow the\
    \ plant. However, the\naeroponic system has some substantial vulnerability like\
    \ a\nfailure of water supply pumps, nutrient distribution line\nand preparation,\
    \ and atomization nozzle clogging, which\nrequire special knowledge and attention\
    \ to avoid damage,\nrapid plant death, and failure of the system [23]. Further-\n\
    more, the integration of the intelligent agriculture techniques\ncould be the\
    \ best solution to avoid or deal with the above-\nmentioned issues without any\
    \ technical expertise. Xiong\nand Qiao [24] reported that the integration of the\
    \ intelligent\nagriculture systems could be an eﬀective approach for solving\n\
    complex problems of agriculture domains. Zhai et al. [25]\nreported that presently,\
    \ several research studies had been\nconducted on the use of intelligent techniques\
    \ in agriculture\nespecially in the last two decades. Besides, several new tech-\n\
    niques and application have been introduced and patented\nto improve the traditional\
    \ agriculture practices. However,\nexperts mainly focused and monitor the climatic\
    \ condition,\nsoil properties, water quality, plant development, livestock\nmanagement,\
    \ and fertilizer application, pesticide applica-\ntion, and illumination control\
    \ through various intelligent\ntechniques [26–32]. Meanwhile, it could be concluded\
    \ that\ntraditional agricultural logistics is improved and upgraded by\nintroducing\
    \ and implementing the several modern technolo-\ngies and techniques in agriculture\
    \ domains [33]. Basnet and\nBang [34] reported that the collecting information\
    \ through\nsensors and communication technology played a vital role\nin improving\
    \ agricultural production. It has shifted agri-\nculture from input-intensive\
    \ to knowledge-intensive, and\nagriculture becomes more networked and decision-making.\n\
    Both small- and large-scale farmer can beneﬁt from intro-\nducing this technique\
    \ into the agriculture value chain, having\ntheir productivity increased, quality\
    \ improved, services\nextended, and costs reduced. It provides insights into various\n\
    issues in the agriculture like weather prediction, crop and\nlivestock disease,\
    \ irrigation management, and supply and\ndemand of agriculture inputs and outputs\
    \ and helps in solv-\ning those problems. Rehman and Shaikh [35] concluded that\n\
    at present, several information technologies including satel-\nlite navigation,\
    \ grid and ubiquitous computing, and sensor\nnetwork are exercised in agriculture.\
    \ However, the applica-\ntion of the sensor network is supporting agriculture\
    \ practices\nand activities in a very positive direction [36, 37]. Zhang and\n\
    coworkers [38] used a sensor network to monitor air tem-\nperature, humidity,\
    \ ambient light, and soil moisture and\ntemperature. Also, the aeroponic system\
    \ is the new applica-\ntion of the soilless agriculture. Besides, several studies\
    \ had\nbeen successfully designed the aeroponic system by using\nvarious information\
    \ technologies approaches such as Tik\nand coworkers [39] designed and implemented\
    \ a wireless\nsensor network to monitor the aeroponic system. They used\ntemperature,\
    \ light intensity, pH, and EC monitoring sen-\nsors. Moreover, the study reported\
    \ that the wireless sensor\nnetwork oﬀers a wide range of information which could\n\
    be required for the horticulturist to provide a greater\nunderstanding of how\
    \ these environmental and nutrient\nparameters are correlated with plant growth.\
    \ The real-time\ninformation obtained from sensor nodes can be utilised to\noptimise\
    \ strategies to control the temperatures and the other\nproperties of the nutrient\
    \ solution. A study by Pala et al. [40]\nproposed an approach to monitor automation\
    \ and early fault\ndetection tools in the aeroponic system through intelligent\n\
    techniques. In the protocol, they designed a highly scalable\naeroponic system\
    \ and coded as aero-pot prototype. They\ndeveloped software based on a genetic\
    \ algorithm to optimise\npower consumption of the aeroponic system. Their study\n\
    concluded that using this software user can deﬁne various\nproperties and virtually\
    \ conﬁgure the aeroponic system.\nThe developed software can allow the user to\
    \ add and remove\nthe lights and pumps and deﬁne consumption of added\ndevices\
    \ with minimum grower eﬀort. Laksono et al. [41]\ndesigned a wireless sensor and\
    \ actuator network for the\n3\nJournal of Sensors\ncontrolling, monitoring, and\
    \ conditioning of an aeroponic\ngrowth chamber. The designed wireless protocol\
    \ was based\non ZigBee technique. They also designed a data transmission\nsystem\
    \ to transfer the data from the database server to\nadministrator through text\
    \ message. The proposed system\nwas based on the sensors, actuators, communication\
    \ system,\nand database server. The experiment results showed that the\nproposed\
    \ wireless protocol based on ZigBee techniques was a\nuseful tool of the wireless\
    \ sensor network to monitor the\naeroponic system. Jonas et al. [42] developed\
    \ an automatic\nmonitoring system to control the environmental and nutri-\nent\
    \ supply of the aeroponic system. The designed wireless\nprotocol was based on\
    \ Arduino development board. Their\nstudy concluded that the proposed system can\
    \ control the\nnutrient atomization frequency based on the root chamber\nmoisture\
    \ content. However, the system can automatically\ntransfer all the gathered information\
    \ to a web server and also\nshare on Twitter. Sani et al. [43] recommended a web-based\n\
    control and monitoring system for the aeroponic system.\nTheir system was composed\
    \ of microcontrollers (using\nArduino IDE program), actuators (two relays include\
    \ atomi-\nzation spray and fan on/oﬀ on speciﬁc time), the sensor (tem-\nperature\
    \ and pH sensor), LDR (light intensity sensor), and\ncommunication modules (GSM/GPRS/3G\
    \ modem). The\npresent study concluded that our proposed design was able\nto monitor\
    \ and measure the temperature, pH, light intensity,\natomization time and interval\
    \ time, and fan activation time\nand interval time in the aeroponic system. The\
    \ proposed\nmethod was able to directly send the real-time information\nfrom the\
    \ sensor to the server via the Internet using GSM.\nAnitha and Periasamy [44]\
    \ designed wireless sensor tech-\nnique to monitor the aeroponic system. The technique\
    \ was\nbased on the ZigBee prototype. The proposed network archi-\ntecture was\
    \ based on temperature, pressure, humidity, water\nlevel, and pH monitoring sensors.\
    \ The sensors transmitted\nthe gathered data to the GSM (Global System for Mobile)\n\
    node or coordinator node, whereas the gateway device was\nused to transfer the\
    \ data to the personal computer. However,\na server was connected to the database\
    \ where the maximum\nand minimum threshold values of pH, water level, and tem-\n\
    perature were ﬁxed. Furthermore, if the monitored value\nreaches above or below\
    \ the threshold values stored in the\ndatabase, thus, the system was able to start\
    \ the alarm sound\nto aware the farmer. Another study in 2016 by Kernahan\nand\
    \ Cupertino [45] invented a system to monitor and control\nthe aeroponic system\
    \ using wireless techniques. They con-\ncluded that a reliable aeroponic system\
    \ provides a wireless\nconnection between its subsystem for the exchange of data\n\
    and commands. The various subsystems manage one or\nmore plants growing atriums\
    \ include nutrient atomization\non hanged roots, maintenance, control of nutrient\
    \ solution\nlevel, the addition of various nutrients, and control of the\nlight\
    \ quantity and cycle. A study by Montoya et al. [46]\ndesigned a wireless sensor\
    \ system to monitor the aeroponic\nsystem. The system protocol was based on the\
    \ Arduino\ndevelopment board. They used analog and digital sensors\nfor monitoring\
    \ temperature, nutrient atomization, EC, and\npH ﬂuctuations and level of nutrient\
    \ solution in the nutrient\nreservoir. In order to acquire data and automation\
    \ system,\nthe two Arduinos were managed in a master-slave conﬁgu-\nration and\
    \ connected to each other through wireless by\nWi-Fi. All the recorded data was\
    \ autosaved in microSD\nmemory and sent to a web page. Their study concluded that\n\
    the proposed protocol could be used for automation and\ncould monitor the aeroponic\
    \ system. Kerns and Lee [47]\nﬁrstly designed and introduced an aeroponic system\
    \ using\nIoT (Internet of things) to automate the system. The pro-\nposed system\
    \ is comprised of a mobile application, service\nplatform, and IoT device with\
    \ sensors (pH balance, tempera-\nture, and humidity). They used Raspberry Pi Zero\
    \ device and\ndesigned a system to monitor and measure the selected\nparameters.\
    \ The gathered data was autosaved into the data-\nbase server by sending an SQL\
    \ query. Their study concluded\nthat the proposed system could help farmers to\
    \ control and\nmonitor the aeroponic system remotely. Furthermore, Karu\n[48]\
    \ also designed and implemented a high-precision system\nfor small-scale aeroponic\
    \ plant cultivation. The system is\nallowed to precisely control the nutrient\
    \ solutions, pH, and\nEC levels and gives data about humidity, temperature, pH,\n\
    and EC concentration and amount of the nutrient solution\nin the reservoir. A\
    \ recent study by Martin and Rafael [49]\nalso proposed and suggested systems,\
    \ methods, and devices\nfor the aeroponic system. Mithunesh et al. [50] proposed\
    \ an\nintelligentcontrolsystem foranaeroponicsystem. Thesystem\nprotocol was based\
    \ on an open-source development board\ncalled Raspberry Pi. Their study concluded\
    \ that the developed\nsystem provides the simple management and high availability\n\
    established by using both the local and global systems. Idris\nand Sani [51] designed\
    \ monitoring and control system for\nthe aeroponic system. They concluded that\
    \ the developed sys-\ntem is able to monitor the aeroponic system working parame-\n\
    ter such as temperature and humidity by sending the data in\nreal time from sensor\
    \ to the display system. Janarthanan\netal.[52]concluded thattheproblemsoftheaeroponicsystem\n\
    could be solved by the use of wireless sensor and actuator\nsystem. It allows\
    \ the user to monitor and interact with the\nsystem through mobile app and a web\
    \ interface. However,\nLiu and Zhang [53, 54] designed an aeroponic system for\n\
    automatic control of water-fertilizer and temperature. They\nconcluded that system\
    \ supplies an experimental platform\nwith features of simple structure and convenient\
    \ control.\n3. The Aeroponic System\nThe aeroponic system is one of the techniques\
    \ of the soilless\nculture, where the plant grows in the air with the assistance\
    \ of\nartiﬁcial support instead of soil or substrate culture. It is an\nair-water\
    \ plant growing technique where lower portions such\nas the roots of the plant\
    \ are hanged inside the growth cham-\nber under complete darkness in controlled\
    \ conditions. How-\never, the upper portions of the plant such as leaves, fruits,\
    \ and\ncrown portion are extending outside the growth chamber.\nUsually, the artiﬁcial\
    \ supporting structure (plastic or thermo-\nfoam) is provided to support and divide\
    \ the plant into two\nparts (roots and leaves). In the system, plant roots are\
    \ openly\nexposed in the air and directly irrigated with a small droplet\nsize\
    \ of the water nutrient at interval basis. The nutrient solu-\ntion is supplied\
    \ through diﬀerent atomization nozzles with or\n4\nJournal of Sensors\nwithout\
    \ high air pressure. Moreover, several studies consid-\nered aeroponics as a modern-day\
    \ agricultural activity which\nis practiced in an enclosed growth chamber under\
    \ entire con-\ntrolled conditions, as it could eliminate the external environ-\n\
    mental factors as compared with traditional agriculture\nactivity. Hence, it is\
    \ no longer dependent on large-scale land\nuse, and it could be set up in any\
    \ place, a building that has\nlifted global climate without considering the current\
    \ climate\nsuch as rainy season and winter [23, 55–59]. Buer et al. [60]\nreported\
    \ that atomization nozzle uses the tiny amount of\nthe water nutrient solution\
    \ and provides an excellent growth\nenvironment for the plant. Zobel and Lychalk\
    \ [61] said it is a\nmodern-day agricultural research tool which provides several\n\
    agricultural research opportunities for a researcher with sig-\nniﬁcant results\
    \ by providing artiﬁcial growth conditions.\nHowever, Table 1 shows the essential\
    \ monitoring and control\nparameters in the aeroponic system. Hessel et al. [62]\
    \ and\nClawson et al. [63] studies discovered that aeroponics con-\ntributes to\
    \ the advances and developments in many areas of\nplant root studies. It provides\
    \ an excellent chance for plant\nresearchers to deeply study the behavior of plant\
    \ root under\ndiﬀerent conditions and without any complications. Until\nnow, many\
    \ researchers had conducted plant root research\nand experimental studies root\
    \ response to drought [64],\neﬀects of diﬀerent oxygen concentrations on plant\
    \ root\ndevelopment [65, 66], root microorganism [67–69], arbuscu-\nlar mycorrhizal\
    \ fungi production [70], and legume-rhizobia\ninteraction [71]. Furthermore, studies\
    \ also practiced the\ntechnique by growing vegetables, fruits, herbs, and medicinal\n\
    root-based plant [72–74] such as tomato, potato, soybean,\nmaize, lettuce, Anthurium\
    \ andreanum, and Acacia mangium\n[15, 59, 75–79].\n3.1. Present Status of the\
    \ Aeroponic System. The aeroponic\nsystem is one of a holistic production management\
    \ method\nin agriculture which promotes and improves agroecosys-\ntem, health,\
    \ and biodiversity. The system has a paramount\nreputation in the horticulture\
    \ department, because of its\nimplications on the economic and technical aspects\
    \ in the\nagriculture. Among all agriculture systems, only the aeropo-\nnic system\
    \ is receiving the full attention of farmers, policy-\nmakers, entrepreneurs,\
    \ and agricultural researchers. The\ngrower could reduce the requirements of chemical\
    \ inputs\nincluding fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and other agro-\nchemicals.\
    \ The grower could obtain higher cultivated plant\nyield and quality as compared\
    \ with other growing methods.\nHowever, the aeroponic system is labour-intensive.\
    \ It oﬀers\nmany opportunities for the farmers to increase rural employ-\nment.\
    \ The farmer can grow a plant in their homes by provid-\ning artiﬁcial growth\
    \ environment. Anitha and Periasamy\n[44] reported that nowadays many families\
    \ are practicing\nthe aeroponic system on their terrace. Besides, several coun-\n\
    tries of the world are using aeroponics for making an expan-\nsion in nourishment\
    \ creation managing the monetary issues\nand making the nation naturally amicable\
    \ to have their par-\nticular food supply. While some years ago, the use of the\n\
    aeroponic system was limited almost around the world\n[84]. At present, the system\
    \ is acquiring more attention from\nthe farmers and several countries are being\
    \ eﬀectively\nadopting as an economical and environmentally friendly veg-\netable\
    \ and fruit growing system. However, it is practiced in\nfollowing countries:\
    \ Abu Dhabi, Australia, Bhutan, Bolivia,\nBrazil, Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, China,\
    \ Canada, Colombia,\nEcuador, Egypt, Ethiopia, France, Germany, Ghana, Greece,\n\
    Indonesia, Italy, India, Iran, Japan, Israel, Kenya, Korea,\nMalaysia, Mongolia,\
    \ Malawi, New Zealand, Nigeria, Peru,\nPhilippines, Poland, Russia, Rwanda, Saudi\
    \ Arabia, South\nAfrica, Spain, Singapore, South Korea, Slovakia, Sri Lanka,\n\
    Taiwan,\nThailand,\nUzbekistan,\nand\nVietnam.\nBesides,\nattempts are made to\
    \ represent the system in other countries\nof the world [23].\n3.2. Key Problems\
    \ and Diﬃculties of the Aeroponic System.\nAeroponic cultivation is performed\
    \ in an outdoor and indoor\ninstallation and or in a greenhouse under controlled\
    \ condi-\ntions. It may be carried out within a facility that includes\nthe provision\
    \ of light for plant growth, the centralised deliv-\nery of nutrient solution,\
    \ and electrical power. The growing\nplants are set in a growth chamber and periodically\
    \ soaked\nwith nutrient solution small mist ejecting through atomiza-\ntion nozzle\
    \ (Figure 2). In addition, the aeroponic system\ngives the chance to control the\
    \ entire growth chamber envi-\nronment precisely. The aeroponic system is the\
    \ modern\ntechnique of the agriculture which is still under develop-\nment. Until\
    \ now, limited studies have been performed, and\nconducted studies concluded that\
    \ the system has some prob-\nlems and issues. Studies suggested that aeroponics\
    \ is per-\nformed without soil or any solid media; thus, the main\nobserved problems\
    \ are water and nutrient buﬀer, any fail-\nure of the water pumps, nutrient solution\
    \ distribution and\npreparation, atomization nozzle clogging, and so on, which\n\
    lead to rapid death of the grown plant [40]. Kernahan and\nCupertino [45] reported\
    \ that the aeroponic system provides\nbetter control of the plant growth and nutritional\
    \ availability\nand prevents the plant from various diseases and root rot.\nHowever,\
    \ during plant growth from sowing to harvest time,\nthe methods adopted in the\
    \ aeroponic system require a little\nhand-operated contribution, interference\
    \ regarding physical\npresence, and expertise in domain knowledge of plants, envi-\n\
    ronment control, and operations to maintain and control the\ngrowth of the plant.\n\
    Moreover, there is a requirement to sustain and keep\nretain the nutrient solution\
    \ parameters which include nutri-\nent temperature, pH, and EC concentration in\
    \ a narrow\nrange of preferred values for optimal growth. If these param-\neters\
    \ drift outside the desired range, it will create several\nproblems for plant\
    \ growth. In addition, some supplemental\nparameters can adjust to optimise the\
    \ plant growth further.\nThe additional parameters are atomization time, atomization\n\
    interval time, air temperature, relative humidity, light inten-\nsity, and carbon\
    \ dioxide (CO2) concentration which make\nthe system complicated and time-consuming\
    \ with high\nhuman energy and with the higher level of expert training\nand skill\
    \ for operating the system. However, the grower has\nthe responsibility to control\
    \ and monitor the ﬂuctuations\nof the above parameters in the desired range to\
    \ achieve\nthe suitable growth conditions for the speciﬁc plants. A fail-\nure\
    \ to accurately control and monitor the parameters could\n5\nJournal of Sensors\n\
    signiﬁcantly aﬀect the growth of the plant and cause ﬁnan-\ncial loss. If any\
    \ component failure occurs while the operator\nis not present on site, it may\
    \ be detected too late to prevent\nharm, because systems generally include some\
    \ automated\nmeans for periodically providing nutrient mist to the plant\nroots,\
    \ reﬁlling a nutrient reservoir, and managing light cycles\nand intensity. Therefore,\
    \ the aeroponic cultivation consid-\nered hitherto to be somewhat unsuitable for\
    \ the local grower\nand due to the above reasons and it is not common to\nﬁnd\
    \ an installation. However, the main reason for the low\nacceptability of the\
    \ aeroponic system is not a cost, but the\nmain drawback is the amount of attention\
    \ required of the\ngrower with a high level of expertise and judgment. For the\n\
    above-discussed reasons, more sophisticated and advanced\nmonitoring techniques\
    \ have implemented in the aeroponic\nsystem for early fault detection, real-time\
    \ monitoring, and\ncontrol and automation of the system. Hence, it would be\n\
    advantageous to use artiﬁcial intelligent tools (Figure 3) in\nthe aeroponic system\
    \ to detect fault and diagnosis problems\non time. Thus, it could help to avoid\
    \ rapid damages to grown\nplants and help to fully automate the aeroponic system.\n\
    4. The Aeroponic System and Sensor Network\nIn recent years, early fault detection\
    \ and diagnosis using an\nintelligent agricultural monitoring system is considered\
    \ as\nthe best tool to monitor plant without any complicated oper-\nations and\
    \ laboratory analysis which required domain exper-\ntise and extensive time. The\
    \ development of these convenient\nfeatures has attracted much attention in the\
    \ agriculture.\nThe system is based on a wireless sensor network which\ncomprises\
    \ of a data server, a wireless convergence node,\na plurality of wireless routers,\
    \ and a plurality of wireless sen-\nsor nodes. However, the wireless sensor nodes\
    \ are used as the\nTable 1: Basic monitoring and control parameters in the aeroponic\

    operations to be monitored. Park et al. [85] stated that wire-\nless sensor network-based\
    \ systems could be a signiﬁcant\nmethod to fully automate the agriculture system,\
    \ because\nthe sensors provide real-time signiﬁcant information and\nbelieved\
    \ to eliminate the considerable costs of just wiring.\nAnother study by Kim [86]\
    \ said that in agriculture, sensor\nnetwork technique helps to improve existing\
    \ systems\ninstalled in the greenhouse eﬃciently and smoothly by for-\nwarding\
    \ real-time collected information to the operator\nthrough the radio signals.\
    \ The system optimises the trans-\nmission protocols more accurate and quick and\
    \ maximises\nthe application of energy to save the energy and reduce the\nconsumption.\
    \ Pala and team [40] suggested that the utilisa-\ntion of artiﬁcial intelligence\
    \ techniques in the aeroponic sys-\ntems could lead not only to ﬁnd early fault\
    \ detection but also\nto fully automate the system without any or small interven-\n\
    tions of human operators. The aeroponic system could gain\nmore popularity among\
    \ local farmers by deploying this tech-\nnique in a system for monitoring and\
    \ controlling purpose.\nHowever, it will conserve resources and minimise impacts\n\
    on the environment. The farmers could start to understand\ntheir crops at a micro\
    \ scale and able to communicate with\nplant through accessible technology. Therefore,\
    \ in this arti-\ncle, we explored how wireless sensing technologies wove into\n\
    the aeroponic system. Thus, the primary motivation of this\nreview article was\
    \ to provide an idea about diﬀerent intelli-\ngent agriculture monitoring tools\
    \ used for early fault detec-\ntion and diagnosis for plant cultivation in the\
    \ aeroponic\nsystem (Figure 4). Additionally, it would be helpful for the\nlocal\
    \ farmer and grower to provide timely information about\nrising problems and inﬂuencing\
    \ factors for successful plant\ngrowth in the aeroponic system. The adoption of\
    \ the intelli-\ngent agriculture monitoring tools could reduce the concept\nof\
    \ unsuitable for the amateur.\n4.1. Number of Sensor Nodes and Input Parameters.\
    \ At pres-\nent, the utilisation of diﬀerent sensor techniques is almost\npossible\
    \ in every ﬁeld of life due to the sharp progressions in\nthe currently available\
    \ technologies. Moreover, the sensor is\na device that has capabilities to measure\
    \ physical attributes\nand convert them into signals for the observer [87]. A\
    \ WSN\n(wireless sensor network) traditionally consists of a few to\ndozens and\
    \ in some cases thousands of the sensor nodes\nwhich are connected to one or more\
    \ sensors [88]. Generally,\nit includes a BS (base station), which acts as a gateway\
    \ between\nthe WSN and the end users. Each sensor node is consisting of\nﬁve main\
    \ components, which are a microcontroller unit, a\ntransceiver unit, a memory\
    \ unit, a power unit, and a sensor\nunit [89]. Each one of these components is\
    \ a determinant in\ndesigning a WSN for deployment. Furthermore, the micro-\n\
    controller unit is in charge of the diﬀerent tasks, data process-\ning, and the\
    \ control of the other components in the node [88].\nThrough the transceiver unit,\
    \ a sensor mode performs its\ncommunication with other nodes and other parts of\
    \ the\nWSN. It is the most dominant communication unit. The\nmemory unit is another\
    \ important part of the WSN system,\nwhich is used to store the observed data.\
    \ The memory unit\ncould be RAM, ROM, and their other memory types ﬂash or\neven\
    \ external storage devices such as USB. Lastly, the last\none unit is the power\
    \ unit. It is one of the critical components\nof the system which is for node\
    \ energy supply. However, the\npower unit could be any source; it can store in\
    \ batteries (most\ncommon) rechargeable or not on in capacitors. In addition,\n\
    for extra power supply and recharging the power unit, the\navailable natural resource\
    \ could be used. The natural sources\ninduce solar power energy in forms of photovoltaic\
    \ panels\nand cells, wind power energy with turbines, kinetic energy\nfrom water,\
    \ and so on. Last but not the least is the sensor unit,\nwhich includes several\
    \ sensors for parameter measurements\nsuch as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide,\
    \ methane,\nand carbon monoxide [90]. However, in the aeroponic sys-\ntem, the\
    \ total required number of sensors and actuators\ndepends on the size and requirement\
    \ of the operator.\n4.2. Sensor Types and Monitoring Parameters. In this review\n\
    study, we reviewed the previous work done on the aeroponic\nsystem using wireless\
    \ sensor network technique. We found\nthat the primary objective of a wireless\

    \ and Lee [47].\n7\nJournal of Sensors\nsystem for the aeroponic system is to\
    \ control the growth\nchamber climatic condition as per the crop data sheet. How-\n\
    ever, the basic principle of the aeroponic system is to grow\nthe plant by suspending\
    \ in the closed, semiclosed, or dark\nenvironment in the air with artiﬁcial provided\
    \ support. In\nthe system, the plant stems, leaves, and any fruit grow in a\n\
    vegetative zone above the suspension medium, and roots\ndangle below the suspension\
    \ medium in an area commonly\nreferred as a root zone [46]. Generally, closed\
    \ cell foam is\ncompressed around the lower stem and inserted into an\nopening\
    \ in the aeroponic growth chamber, which decreases\nlabour and expense. However,\
    \ the trellising is used to sus-\npend the weight of cultivated plant [44]. Ideally,\
    \ the environ-\nment is kept free from pests and diseases so that the plants\n\
    grow healthier and more quickly than other plants grown\non techniques. Furthermore,\
    \ the key to the success and high\nyields of the air gardening is a scientiﬁc\
    \ grade monitoring of\nthe conditions and accurate control of the growing environ-\n\
    ment. Each plant yields and needs a diﬀerent environmental\ncondition for growth.\
    \ However, the plant growth is mainly\ninﬂuenced by the surrounding environmental\
    \ and climatic\nvariables and the amount of water and the fertilizers supplied\n\
    by irrigation. There is a requirement to monitor and control\nliquid nutrient\
    \ parameters in a narrow range of preferred\nvalues for optimal growth. The parameters\
    \ include nutrient\ntemperature, pH, and EC concentration. If the parameters\n\
    drift outside the desired range, the plants can harm. Besides,\nthere are some\
    \ additional parameters which can be adjusted\nto further optimise growth, such\
    \ as air temperature, relative\nhumidity, light intensity, and carbon dioxide\
    \ (CO2) concen-\ntration. Idris and Sani [51] reported that the one solution to\n\
    solve the problems of monitoring and controlling the grow-\ning conditions in\
    \ the space environment is by applying some\nsensors. The sensor can detect and\
    \ monitor a number of\nparameters such as temperature, humidity, light intensity,\n\
    O2 and CO2 levels, direction, and wind speed. Aside from\nthe sensors, there is\
    \ also a requirement for the actuators to\ndistribute nutrients and waters to\
    \ plant roots or lower stems\n(Figure 5). The sensor collects the information\
    \ of the various\nenvironmental conditions and forwards the signals to the\nactuator\
    \ to take place and produce the outcome for the col-\nlected information to know\
    \ the status of that parameter.\nThe actuator can control the environment changes.\
    \ The sen-\nsors store information that analyzes the environment and\nidentiﬁes\
    \ the location, object, people, and their situations.\nThe sensor provides multiple\
    \ contributions in various\ndomains that depend on a variety of attribute and\
    \ variant\nin time [87, 91, 92].\n4.2.1. Temperature Sensor. In the aeroponic\
    \ system, the\ntemperature is one of the critical factors signiﬁcantly\ndetermining\
    \ plant growth and development. A reduction\nin temperature below the optimal\
    \ conditions often results\nin suboptimal plant growth. A diﬀerent cultivar requires\n\
    a diﬀerent temperature level for the photosynthesis process\nand growth, which\
    \ can advance the plant growth stage. It\nwill eventually bring us substantial\
    \ economic beneﬁts. In\nthe aeroponic system, the optimum growth chamber tem-\n\
    perature should not be less and more than 4 and 30°C,\nrespectively, for successful\
    \ plant growth. The temperature\nﬂuctuations of aeroponic growth chamber can signiﬁcantly\n\
    aﬀect the root growth, respiration, transpiration, ﬂowering,\nand dormant period\
    \ [93]. Therefore, the temperature sensors\ncan be used to monitor the temperature\
    \ ﬂuctuations of the\naeroponic system. At present, temperature sensors are used\n\
    in many applications like environmental controls, food pro-\ncessing units, medical\
    \ devices, and chemical handling. The\ntemperature sensor is a device mainly composed\
    \ of thermo-\ncouple or resistance temperature detector. The temperature\nsensor\
    \ measures the real-time temperature reading through\nMobile phone\nPC\nInternet\n\

    \ the data about tem-\nperature from a particular source and convert the data\
    \ into\nan understandable form for a device or an observer. The\ntemperature\n\
    sensor\naccurately\nmeasures\ntemperatures\nslower changing from critical applications\
    \ such as facilities\nor rooms and sends them to the user’s webpage.\n4.2.2. Humidity\
    \ Sensor. Aeroponics is the technique of culti-\nvating plant by providing the\
    \ water nutrient small spray in\nthe air. Thus, the humidity is another important\
    \ parameter\nof aeroponic growth chamber environments, and its control\nis recognised\
    \ to be very important for signiﬁcant plant\ngrowth. In the aeroponic system,\
    \ the plant gets all available\nmoisture in the growth chamber. Moreover, if the\
    \ growth\nchamber has too high or less moisture content, both condi-\ntions will\
    \ create many problems for the plant. Accordingly,\nan accurate and precise means\
    \ of testing moisture content\nin the growth chamber will help farmers to monitor\
    \ their\ncrops and provide a suitable growth environment for the\nplant. Wang\
    \ et al. [94] reported that a humidity sensor is a\ndevice that detects and measures\
    \ water vapour present in\nthe air within a room or enclosure. At present, humidity\
    \ sen-\nsors are widely used in medicine, agriculture, and environ-\nmental monitoring.\
    \ However, the most commonly used\nunits for humidity measurement are relative\
    \ humidity [95].\nThe development of humidity sensors has shown remarkable\nprogress\
    \ because of using various types of sensing materials in\nrecent years. The sensing\
    \ materials used in humidity sensors\ncan classify into ceramics, polymers, and\
    \ composites [96].\nThe humidity sensor could be placed in the growth chamber\n\
    to maintain the moisture level. If the moisture level becomes\nless than the plant\
    \ requirement, the sensors will forward the\nsignals to atomization nozzles to\
    \ perform their work.\n4.2.3. Light Intensity Sensor. As we know, all vegetable\
    \ plants\nand ﬂowers require large amounts of sunlight, and each plant\ngroup\
    \ reacts diﬀerently and has the diﬀerent physiology to\ndeal with light intensity.\
    \ Some plant performs well in low\nlight intensity and some in high light intensity.\
    \ However,\nthe aeroponic system implements in indoor conditions, so\nit is necessary\
    \ for the farmer to provide suﬃcient light quan-\ntity of at least 8 to 10 hours\
    \ for a day to grow the healthy\nplant. The artiﬁcial lighting is a better option\
    \ to present\nenough intensity to produce a healthy plant [97, 98]. In the\nconventional\
    \ aeroponic system, the control of the light quan-\ntity present in the growth\
    \ chamber is mostly done by farmer\nthrough observing the plant condition. However,\
    \ it is a time-\nconsuming and challenging task for the farmer to provide the\n\
    required light concentration accurately. It could be a better\noption to use intelligent\
    \ agriculture techniques to monitor\nthe light intensity in the aeroponic system.\
    \ The intelligent\nagriculture techniques mean using the sensor system to con-\n\
    trol the light intensity. The light sensor is an electronic device\nwhich is used\
    \ to detect the presence or nonpresence of light\nand darkness. There are several\
    \ types of light sensors includ-\ning photoresistors, photodiodes, and phototransistors.\
    \ These\nlight sensors distinguish the substance of light in a growth\nchamber\
    \ and increase or decrease the brightness of light to\na more comfortable level.\
    \ Light sensors can be used to auto-\nmatically control the lights such as on/oﬀ.\
    \ By adopting the\nsensor network in aeroponics, the farmer could be able to\n\
    monitor light intensity without any human interference.\nBecause the sensors will\
    \ perform all work such as if the light\nintensity in the growth chamber will\
    \ be less than the required\nlight quantity for plant growth, the sensor will\
    \ automatically\nforward the signal to the LED light to turn on until the light\n\
    quantity reaches to the desired level.\n4.2.4. CO2 Sensor. The appropriate oxygen\
    \ concentration in\nthe root environment is crucial to keep the root metabolism\n\
    in nutrition solution. The available oxygen concentration\nfor the root environment\
    \ is a hugely signiﬁcant factor since\nlow concentrations aﬀect the root respiration,\
    \ nutrient\nabsorption, and, consequently, the plant growth [66]. Thus,\nthe CO2\
    \ sensor could be used to monitor the carbon dioxide\nﬂuctuations in the aeroponic\
    \ growth chamber. A carbon\ndioxide sensor is an instrument which is used for\
    \ the mea-\nsurement of carbon dioxide gas concentration. Bihlmayr\npH sensor\n\

    \ sensors are used to measure indoor\nair quality in a building to perform demand-based\
    \ ventila-\ntion. However, the CO2 sensor data measuring range is in\nbetween\
    \ 500 and 5000 parts per million. There are two main\ntypes of the CO2 sensors\
    \ which include nondispersive infra-\nred carbon dioxide sensors (NICDS) and chemical\
    \ carbon\ndioxide sensors (CCDS), whereas the NICDS detected CO2\nin a gaseous\
    \ environment by its characteristic absorption\nand composed of an infrared detector,\
    \ an interference ﬁlter,\na light tube, and an infrared source. However, the CCDS\
    \ of\nsensitive layers are based on polymer or heteropolysiloxane\nwith low-energy\
    \ consumption [100].\n4.2.5. Water Level Sensor. The aeroponics is the method\
    \ of\nthe plant cultivation by providing a small mist of the nutrient\nsolution\
    \ in the growth chamber. Thus, there is no any use of\nsoil; just water is required\
    \ to cultivate the plant throughout\nthe germination to harvest time. Therefore,\
    \ the water nutri-\nent solution reservoir is one of the major components of\n\
    the aeroponic system which should be monitored throughout\nthe growth period.\
    \ In the conventional aeroponic system, the\nfarmer checks the water nutrient\
    \ level in the nutrient solution\nreservoir, and if he founds water level less\
    \ than the desired\nlevel, he maintained accordingly. However, by adopting the\n\
    precision agriculture techniques, the farmer will be able to\nmonitor and control\
    \ water nutrient level through the intelli-\ngent methods such as wireless sensors.\
    \ The water nutrient\nlevel sensors detect the liquid level in the reservoirs\
    \ and facil-\nitate operator in collecting water nutrient level data in real\n\
    time. The sensors will alert the operator about any potential\nproperty damage\
    \ that results from any leaks and also allow-\ning to know when a container is\
    \ nearing empty.\n4.2.6. EC and pH Sensor. In the aeroponic system, the plant\n\
    productivity is closely related to nutrient uptake and the EC\nand pH regulation\
    \ of the nutrient solution. The EC and pH\nconcentration of the nutrient solution\
    \ aﬀects the availability\nof the nutrients to plants [101]. The pH and EC concentra-\n\
    tions are controlled to prevent barrier growth. Their mea-\nsurement is essential\
    \ because the solubility of minerals in\nacidic, alkaline, and ion concentration\
    \ of all the species in\nsolutions is diﬀerent and the solution concentration\
    \ changes\nwith solubility [102, 103]. The unmonitored EC and pH\nconcentration\
    \ of the nutrient solution will quickly lead to\na situation where plants cannot\
    \ absorb the essential nutri-\nents, if not corrected this will eventually lead\
    \ to harmful\nplant growth and poor productivity. Thus, the EC and pH\nconcentration\
    \ of the nutrient solution is a critical parameter\nto be measured and controlled\
    \ throughout the plant growth.\nMoreover, in the conventional aeroponic system,\
    \ the EC and\npH value of the nutrient solution is mostly monitored manu-\nally\
    \ by performing laboratory analysis or using advanced\nequipment which is a time-consuming\
    \ process. For instance,\nwhen the EC of the nutrient solution decreased or increased,\n\
    the control of nutrient solution concentration is mostly\nachieved by adding more\
    \ high concentration nutrient solu-\ntion or the fresh water, respectively, to\
    \ the nutrient solution\nto maintain the EC level to the prescribed target range.\
    \ Sim-\nilarly, for pH, an acid solution and an alkali solution are used\nto control\
    \ the pH ﬂuctuation of the nutrient solution within a\nspeciﬁed target range [101].\
    \ However, these conventional\nmethods are time-consuming and challenging task\
    \ for the\nfarmer to maintain the EC and pH value at the desired range\naccurately.\
    \ In addition, the EC and pH sensor could be used\nto deal with the above challenges.\n\
    5. Sensor Working Protocol in the\nAeroponic System\nToday, the world demands\
    \ automatic tools to do most of the\nwork for them without bothering its user\
    \ for doing some task.\nSo, the concept is all about a very high level of automation\n\
    system which will be independent of its users to a very great\nextent, reduce\
    \ human eﬀorts, and save all kinds of resource\nutilisation, as monitoring and\
    \ controlling will be done by\ncomputers leaving very few easily manageable tasks\
    \ for\nhumans, and it will interest more people to join this ﬁeld\n[104–106].\
    \ Moreover, the monitoring and control system\nfor the aeroponic system mainly\
    \ consists of following sec-\ntions which include the aeroponic system, data acquisition,\n\
    controlling the equipment, data transmission module, cloud\ndata processing server,\
    \ social communication platform, and\nmobile application. A typical architecture\
    \ of sensor nodes\nfor controlling and monitoring the aeroponic system is\nshown\
    \ in Figure 6. Furthermore, in architecture, the data\nacquisition section refers\
    \ to some sensor nodes used in the\nAeroponic system\nData acquisition\nMobile\
    \ application\nControl and\nmonitoring center\nData transmission\nmodule\nSocial\

    \ network in the aeroponic system.\n10\nJournal of Sensors\nsystem to establish\
    \ a data acquisition module. The data\nacquisition module is placed in the aeroponic\
    \ system or near\nthe growth chamber to collect the real-time information\nfrom\
    \ selected parameters (temperature, light intensity,\nhumidity, nutrient solution\
    \ level, atomization quantity, and\nphotos of the growing plants) and transmit\
    \ the gathered data\nto the control and management centre. However, the control\n\
    and management section refers to the central processing unit\n(CPU) of the system.\
    \ The CPU of the system consists of some\nprimary functions such as Arduino and\
    \ WRTnod protocols,\nwhose work is to store, manage gathered data from collection\n\
    nodes, process, and then accurately and automatically send\nto the web server\
    \ in real time [104–109]. Thus, the system\ncan help the farmer and grower to\
    \ monitor and control the\nsmart aeroponic system remotely using the mobile app.\
    \ In\nother words, the plant will be able to talk with the farmer\nthrough a mobile\
    \ app that whether the selected parameters\nare working well or not.\n6. Advantages\
    \ of Sensor Techniques in the\nAeroponic System\nThe continuously increasing food\
    \ demands require rapid\nimprovement and development in the food production\n\
    system. However, to enhance the quality and productivity\nof the cultivated crop,\
    \ peoples are moving towards the mod-\nern plant cultivation technologies in agriculture.\
    \ Thus, the\naeroponics is one of the rising plant growing technologies\nin agriculture\
    \ as a modern-day cultivation technique, where\nthe plant is cultivated in an\
    \ air environment, and no any soil\nsupport is provided. In the aeroponic system,\
    \ a number of the\nparameters are required to control for successful plant\ngrowth\
    \ because there is no any growing medium provided\nto the plant. For example,\
    \ if the plant has some sudden stress\nand the farmer is not present at the site\
    \ that means the plant\nwill die. Therefore, the proper management of the crop\
    \ is\nessential. In the conventional aeroponic system, grower uses\nhis knowledge,\
    \ skills, and judgment to adjust and maintain\nthe parameters such as EC and pH\
    \ meter, minimum and\nmaximum temperature, light intensity, and humidity level\n\
    through several instruments and checks the readings which\nare labour-intensive\
    \ and time-consuming task. To deal with\nthe above problems, the aeroponic system\
    \ can be developed\nwith a wireless sensor and actuator network for monitoring\n\
    the key parameters at lower labour cost, time, and without\nany technical knowledge.\
    \ The wireless sensor and actuator\nnetwork oﬀer several advantages including\
    \ faster response\nto confrontational climatic conditions and better quality con-\n\
    trol of the crop that produces at a lower labour cost. This\nadvancement in the\
    \ aeroponic system through wireless sen-\nsor network for monitoring growth chamber\
    \ environment\nis beneﬁcial. However, the monitoring system also oﬀers a\nrange\
    \ of information which could be required by plant scien-\ntists or grower to provide\
    \ a greater understanding of how\nthese environmental and nutrient parameters\
    \ correlate with\nplant growth. It is now recognised that plant grower can per-\n\
    fectly and easily acquire the skills needed to operate an aero-\nponic system.\
    \ It provides the full control of the system, not by\nconstant manual attention\
    \ from the operator but to a large\nextent by wireless sensors.\n7. Future Application\n\
    Artiﬁcial intelligence agriculture techniques are consid-\nered as a high potential,\
    \ improving technique for decision-\nmaking in agriculture. Nowadays, it is quickly\
    \ getting peo-\nples’ intention, more and more visible in our society and\ndynamically\
    \ turning our social awareness and lifestyle. The\ntechniques provide several\
    \ opportunities to monitor the\nplant growth and development from pre- to postharvest.\n\
    Aeroponics is the new plant cultivation technology of agri-\nculture which is\
    \ still under development. However, we\nreviewed the literature and found that\
    \ only limited study\nhad been conducted on the implementation of the intelligent\n\
    agricultural techniques in the aeroponic system. Moreover,\nuntil now, most of\
    \ the studies had been designed the aeropo-\nnic system using a wireless sensor\
    \ network using ZigBee and\nArduino system with Bluetooth, global system of mobile\
    \ and\nWi-Fi, and communication modules. During a literature\nsurvey, we noted\
    \ that no any single study had implemented\nthe idea of the cloud computing and\
    \ big data techniques in\naeroponics to collect real-time information via the\
    \ Internet.\nThe techniques provide many advantages to the user such\nas reduction\
    \ of the initial cost, allocation of the resources\non demand, and maintenance\
    \ and upgrade performed in\nthe back-end, easy, and rapid development. The techniques\n\
    present a chance to the operator to stay connected with the\nsystem using mobile\
    \ accessories like a smartphone, tablet,\nand PCs at any location via the Internet\
    \ which is not\nrestricted by conditions, locations, and time. Furthermore,\n\
    the system would be designed using additional artiﬁcial\nintelligence techniques\
    \ such as image processing, automatic\nseedling transplanters, and harvesting\
    \ and packing robots.\nThe purpose of image processing and analysis is to measure\n\
    and identify the physiology, growth, development, nutrient\ndeﬁciencies, diseases,\
    \ and other phenotypic properties of\nthe plants through automated and nondestructive\
    \ analysis.\n8. Application of Artificial Intelligence\nTechniques in Agriculture\n\
    Agriculture is the primitive and ancient application that\nhumans started ﬁrst\
    \ after born on earth. It has an extensive\nhistory between numerous industries\
    \ and very intimately\nlinked to the human development on earth. Moreover, in\n\
    the past, the agriculture sector was labour-intensive, but the\nnext-generation\
    \ farmers, researchers, and associated organi-\nsations proposed and applied new\
    \ farming methods, technol-\nogies, skills, and knowledge in agriculture as a\
    \ modern era to\nreduce labour-intensive task. Presently, the technology is\n\
    considered as a key tool to overcome many challenges and\neases the way how people\
    \ live. In the past, the many problems\nof agriculture, especially in irrigation\
    \ water management,\ncrop yield production, environment predication, and deci-\n\
    sion-making, were decided by many factors. In addition,\nthe fertilization often\
    \ decided by the mathematical equations,\nformulas, or the experiences of the\
    \ experts. The cultivation is\n11\nJournal of Sensors\nrepresented by descriptive\
    \ and causal knowledge, and diag-\nnosis of pests and diseases is represented\
    \ by uncertain knowl-\nedge. Thus, this knowledge and experience are illogically\n\
    incomplete and imprecise, and the traditional procedures\ncan not handle them.\
    \ However, artiﬁcial intelligence has its\nsuperiority. It could be an eﬀective\
    \ approach for solving com-\nplex problems to the levels of experts using imitate\
    \ experts\n[110]. The term artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) was developed in\n1956,\
    \ as “the science and engineering of making intelligent\nmachines” [111]. It is\
    \ a abroad discipline, which was devel-\noped for the interaction of several types\
    \ of ﬁelds such as com-\nputer science, information theory, cybernetics, linguistics,\n\
    neurophysiology, and psychology [112]. The main purpose\nof the creation of the\
    \ intelligence techniques is to ﬁnd the\nsolutions for complex problems and to\
    \ work, react, and\nrespond like humans. It performed work better than a well-\n\
    qualiﬁed person and brought positive economic and environ-\nmental results [112,\
    \ 113]. Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) tools\nhave helped to predict the behavior\
    \ of nonlinear systems\nand to control variables to improve the operating conditions\n\
    of a system’s environment [114–117]. A recently published\nreport highlighted\
    \ that artiﬁcial intelligence is emerging as\npart of the solutions towards improved\
    \ agricultural produc-\ntivity. The global artiﬁcial intelligence in agriculture\
    \ is\nexpected to grow at a signiﬁcant level. It is employed to\nimprove the eﬃciency\
    \ of daily tasks in agriculture such as\nthe adoption of robots and drones, crop\
    \ health monitoring\nprotocols, automated irrigation system, and driverless trac-\n\
    tors [118]. At present, several research studies have been per-\nformed by implementing\
    \ the artiﬁcial intelligent techniques\nin agriculture. Popa [119] revealed that\
    \ some of the devel-\noped applications for agriculture are expert systems and\
    \ soft-\nware, sensors for collecting and transmitting data, and\nrobotic and\
    \ automation which are adapted from diﬀerent\nindustries into agriculture, whereas\
    \ the expert systems and\nsoftware is the planning process such as strategic or\
    \ opera-\ntional; it has beneﬁted substantially, due to the expansion of\npersonal\
    \ computer and Internet use. The systems are gener-\nated through the structured\
    \ knowledge base and reasoning\nmechanisms acquired from a human expert but with\
    \ an\nenhanced computational power and speed [120]. These sys-\ntems can demarcate\
    \ management zones taking in consider-\nation with relevant factors and able to\
    \ recommend suitable\ncrop rotations, optimal plant density, water requirements,\n\
    appropriate fertilizer use, diagnosing pests and diseases for\ncrops, and suggesting\
    \ preventive or curative measures\n[121]. Huang et al. [122] discussed soft computing\
    \ and appli-\ncations in agriculture. The study reported that soft comput-\ning\
    \ is the combination of the computing technologies, such\nas an artiﬁcial neural\
    \ networks (ANNs), fuzzy logic (FL),\nand genetic algorithms (GAs). These techniques\
    \ are opposed\nto the hard computing method which states to a huge set of\nstochastic\
    \ and statistical methods. The hard computing\nprovides inaccurate solutions and\
    \ results of very complex\nproblems through modelling and analysis with a tolerance\n\
    of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth, and an approxima-\ntion. However,\
    \ the soft computing techniques are used to\nachieve tractability and robustness.\
    \ It provides a low-cost\nsolution with a tolerance of imprecision, uncertainty,\
    \ partial\ntruth, and approximation [123–127]. Sui and Thomasson\n[128] developed\
    \ a BP-trained feedforward ANNs to predict\nnitrogen status in cotton plants based\
    \ on a data from a\nground-based sensing system. Tumbo and team [129] used\nan\
    \ on-the-go system for sensing chlorophyll status in corn\nusing BP-trained feedforward\
    \ ANNs and ﬁber optic spec-\ntrometry to acquire spectral response pattern data\
    \ in corn\nﬁelds. Tang et al. [130] developed a texture-based weed clas-\nsiﬁcation\
    \ method consisting of a low-level Gabor wavelet-\nbased feature extraction algorithm\
    \ and a high-level ANN-\nbased pattern recognition algorithm. El-Faki and group\n\
    [131] established and tested ANN-based weed detection\nalgorithms capable of detecting\
    \ the leading weed species\ncompeting with wheat and soybean crops. A study by\
    \ Krish-\nnaswamy and Krishnan [132] predicted the nozzle wear rates\nfor four\
    \ fan nozzles using regression and ANN methods.\nPearson and Wicklow [133] developed\
    \ a neural network to\nidentify fungal species that infect single kernels using\
    \ princi-\npal components of the reﬂectance spectra as input features.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [134] developed year-round air temperature pre-\ndiction models for prediction\
    \ horizons from 1 to 12 h using\nfeedforward-style ANNs. Zadeh [123] introduced\
    \ the con-\ncept of fuzzy sets as a mean for describing complex systems\nwithout\
    \ the requirements for precision. Fuzzy logic may also\nbe useful for descriptive\
    \ systems, those that fall somewhere\nbetween hard systems and soft systems, such\
    \ as biology\nand agriculture [135]. Studies reported that in agriculture,\nfuzzy\
    \ logic is used for multicriteria analysis of the image,\nimage classiﬁcation,\
    \ vegetation mapping, assessment of soil\nsuitability, and planning forest harvesting\
    \ [136–143]. Al-\nFaraj and coworkers [144] established a rule-based FL crop\n\
    water stress index (CWSI) using growth chamber data and\ntested this method on\
    \ tall fescue canopies grown in a green-\nhouse. Thomson et al. [145] and Thomson\
    \ and Ross [146]\ndeveloped a coupled sensor- and model-based irrigation\nscheduling\
    \ method. Yang et al. [147, 148] informed on the\ndevelopment of an image capture/processing\
    \ system to\ndetect weeds and a fuzzy logic decision-making system to\ndetermine\
    \ where and how much herbicide to apply in an\nagricultural ﬁeld. Gil and team\
    \ [149] applied multiple linear\nregression and FL inference models to evaluate\
    \ the eﬀects of\nmicrometeorological conditions on pesticide application for\n\
    two spray qualities (ﬁne and very ﬁne). Qiu et al. [150]\nestablished a fuzzy\
    \ irrigation decision-making system using\nvirtual instrumentation platform of\
    \ sensors, test instru-\nments, data logger, and LabVIEW. Generally, published\n\
    studies use on/oﬀ controllers where the inherent complexity\nof irrigation process\
    \ made it diﬃcult to achieve optimal\nresults [151]. Ali et al. [152] developed\
    \ temperature and\nhumidity controller inside the greenhouse using fuzzy logic.\n\
    However, several studies have been conducted to develop\nmany control strategies\
    \ to optimise the greenhouse environ-\nment using artiﬁcial intelligence techniques\
    \ such as neural\nnetwork, fuzzy logic controller, adaptive predictive control,\n\
    PID, and nonlinear adaptive PID control [153–159]. Zhu\net al. [160] used the\
    \ remote wireless system for water\nquality online monitoring in intensive aquaculture\
    \ using\nartiﬁcial neural networks. The results demonstrate that\nonline monitoring\
    \ for water quality information could be\n12\nJournal of Sensors\naccurately acquired\
    \ and predicted by using the remote\nwireless system. Mahajan et al. [161] reported\
    \ that agricul-\nture is noteworthy that computer vision applications have\ngrown\
    \ due to reduced equipment costs, increased computa-\ntional power, and increasing\
    \ interest in nondestructive food\nassessment methods. The use of these techniques\
    \ presents\nadvantages when compared with traditional methods based\non manual\
    \ work; however, there are still some challenges\nto be overcome. Moreover, the\
    \ principle of artiﬁcial intel-\nligence in agriculture is one where a machine\
    \ can perceive\nits environment, and through a certain capacity of ﬂexible\nrationality,\
    \ can act to address a speciﬁed goal related to\nthat environment.\n9. Conclusion\n\
    The objective of our study was to present the information\nabout the use of automated\
    \ monitoring and controlling tech-\nnique in the aeroponic system. The aeroponic\
    \ system is the\nnew plant cultivation method of the modern agriculture. Its\n\
    existence can allow producing food whole year without any\ninterval. The system\
    \ could create an excellent set which\nencourages the sustainable city life for\
    \ those peoples who\nwant to live in urban area. Moreover, during plant growth\n\
    from sowing to harvest time, the methods adopted in the\naeroponic system require\
    \ a little hand-operated contribution,\ninterference regarding physical presence,\
    \ and expertise in\ndomain knowledge of plants, environment control, and oper-\n\
    ations to maintain and control the growth of the plant.\nTherefore, the system\
    \ is considered hitherto to be somewhat\nunsuitable for the grower, and due to\
    \ the above reasons, it is\nnot common to ﬁnd an installation. We reviewed the\
    \ litera-\nture and found that implementation of advanced monitoring\ntechnology\
    \ tools in aeroponics could provide an opportunity\nfor the farmer to monitor\
    \ and control several paraments\nwithout using laboratory instruments, and the\
    \ farmer can\ncontrol the entire system remotely. Thus, it could reduce\nthe concept\
    \ of the usefulness of the system due to the com-\nplicated manual monitoring\
    \ and controlling process. The\ntechnology oﬀers incredible opportunities for\
    \ the aeroponic\nsystem to increase the capability, reliability, and availability\n\
    among the farmers and growers. We believe that our review\narticle will contribute\
    \ to the adoption of the advanced mon-\nitoring technology in the aeroponic system.\
    \ However, the\ntechnique provides a range of information which could be\nrequired\
    \ by plant scientists to provide a greater understand-\ning of how these environmental\
    \ and nutrient parameters\ncorrelate with plant growth.\nConflicts of Interest\n\

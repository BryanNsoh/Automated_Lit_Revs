    PDF Abstract Hydro-climatic information has a potential to improve agricultural
    productivity under climate variability. Recent developments in information sharing
    platforms (Environmental Virtual Observatories, EVOs) could make information provisioning
    more actionable. Here we present the results of a diagnostic study for the development
    of a hydro-climatic EVO that enables rice farmers in Northern Ghana to deal with
    climate variability and water shortage. The hydro-climatic EVO aims to combine
    data from scientific and indigenous forecast systems, facilitating information
    exchange using two-way interaction with stakeholders to co-produce knowledge.
    Data was collected through informal interviews with field practitioners, through
    focus group discussions with farmers and content analysis of documents. Results
    show that both the biophysical and socio-institutional circumstances need be taken
    into account for the development of the EVO. Existing governance and information
    exchange arrangements and lack of collaboration between actors were found to limit
    current hydro-climatic information flow, interpretation, and use. Our study reveals
    existing models of information exchange and their limitations in the study area.
    We discuss the proposed design of a hydro-climatic EVO from a responsible innovation
    perspective, considering possible future eventualities in a process that aims
    to be anticipatory, inclusive, reflexive and responsive. We conclude that such
    a hydro-climatic EVO has a potential to contribute to rice farmers’ adaptive decision-making
    in Northern Ghana, but there are challenges that need to be considered. The diagnostic
    study has helped to refine these challenges and offers concrete suggestions to
    improve both the design and implementation of the proposed platform in a responsible
    way. Keywords: DiagnosticsHydro-climaticEVOsRiceGhana 1 Introduction Due to increased
    anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions the global temperatures are rising with
    a change in global water cycle resulting in more erratic precipitation patterns.
    Consequently, both soil and surface water availability is becoming less reliable
    ( IPCC, 2014). This increased climate variability is affecting smallholder farmers
    in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently more than 600 million people in rural communities
    in sub-Saharan Africa depend on agriculture for their livelihoods ( Rockström
    et al., 2014). Many farmers are struggling to cope with challenging conditions,
    which result in low yields and food insecurity ( Di Falco et al., 2011). One of
    the main problems for food production in Africa is large-scale climate variability.
    Both inter-annual and seasonal rainfall variability are a challenge for farming
    decision-making in Sub-Saharan Africa. Future climate change caused by increased
    greenhouse gas emissions are likely to result in changing rainfall patterns. Similar
    to other countries within Guinea and Sudan Savanna agro-ecological zones, Ghana
    is vulnerable to climate variability and change ( Africa Partnership Forum, 2007).
    The agricultural sector depends heavily on rainfall that varies annually and seasonally.
    This significantly affects soil water availability for crops and increases the
    risks for low crop production and failure ( Kunstmann and Jung, 2005; Asante and
    Amuakwa-Mensah, 2014). Meanwhile the agriculture sector is very important for
    the economy of Ghana, employing 44% of the work-force and accounts for nearly
    one-quarter of GDP ( CIA, 2012). The degree of community vulnerability and crop
    failure is greatest in its three northern regions, namely Upper East, Upper West,
    and the Northern region. Farmers in these regions are faced with many uncertainties
    prior to every growing season, most of which are attributed to water and climate
    variability ( Gbetibouo et al., 2017). Due to increasing climate variability farmers
    struggle about decisions such as seed variety to plant, when to plant, when to
    fertilize, when to do supplementary irrigation and sometimes when to harvest.
    According to Ndamani and Watanabe (2013), a farmer usually starts to make preparations
    for planting crops with the onset of the rainy season. After months of drought,
    the soil is dry and hard. In the month of May, the farmer starts to look into
    the sky every day expecting the first rain clouds to appear, which would indicate
    the beginning of the major production season. When the rain finally comes, the
    farmer starts to plough his land and plants his crops. But his mind is filled
    with worry. How much rain will there be this year? Will there be another dry spell
    shortly after the first rain, which could destroy the seedlings? Would it be better
    to wait and start seeding later? He recalls, however, that two years ago, there
    was no dry period in May and a heavy rain washed away the seeds that he had planted
    too late. Finding solution to these dilemmas of a typical farmer is vital and
    urgent. Several studies have predicted the future climate of Ghana to be more
    variable and uncertain, making the agriculture sector more vulnerable ( Kankam-Yeboah
    et al., 2013; Water Resources Commission, 2010; Obuobie et al., 2012). Recent
    progress in climate modeling has increased the ability to predict rainfall from
    a few days to seasonal forecasts ( Njau, 2010). Being able to predict the weather
    and climate especially rainfall is indispensable for guiding water users, especially
    farmers in their planning and decision making ( Logah et al., 2013). Empirical
    studies have shown that climate forecasts can help farmers reduce their vulnerability
    to drought and climate extremes, while also allowing them to maximize opportunities
    when favorable conditions are predicted ( Patt et al., 2005; Phillips et al.,
    2001; Roncoli et al., 2009). The underlying assumption in the current practices
    of hydro-climatic information services is that if we provide the farmer with more
    and better information, they would be able to improve their farming practices
    ( Etwire et al., 2017; Anoop et al., 2015; Okello et al., 2011). This one-directional
    model of providing climate services has shown to be flawed, as farmers tend not
    to trust scientific information and experience difficulties in interpreting and
    using it. They are therefore confident that their indigenous systems work better
    ( Hartmann et al., 1999; Letson et al., 2001; Mcnew et al., 1991). Efforts to
    train farmers to adopt this model of providing climate services generally fail
    to improve the uptake of climate information ( Manyanhaire, 2015; Patt and Gwata,
    2002), because providers also have little understanding of users, and what drives
    the influence of indigenous forecasts ( Artikov et al., 2006). We however argue
    that science should not be a one directional effort, where science produces new
    knowledge and information and makes it accessible for end-users. Instead, the
    process should be interactive, where science and practice co-design, co-create
    and co-produce knowledge by bringing in different forms of expertise. The latter
    would result in better appreciation of the scientific expertise as well as indigenous
    knowledge necessary to improve societal resilience to climate change ( Hiwasaki
    et al., 2014, 2015; Mazzocchi, 2006). Increasingly there are calls for involving
    farmers not only as end-user, but as an active participant who is not only involved
    in use of the information, but also in the creation of it. Environmental Virtual
    Observatories (EVOs) aim to enable cross-fertilization of different sources of
    environmental knowledge on web-based virtual platforms, incorporating information
    gathering, processing and dissemination technologies ( Karpouzoglou et al., 2016).
    The first generations of these systems aimed to support the scientific process
    of knowledge creation and mainly targeted scientific audiences. They failed to
    deliver a strong knowledge creation component especially in information generation
    and dissemination projects that seek to empower local communities to manage their
    environmental change using actionable knowledge ( Dewulf et al., 2005). Hence,
    several authors have proposed second generation EVOs that emphasize knowledge
    co-creation between scientists and societal actors, and bidirectional information
    flows, so as to create actionable knowledge that can support decision-making (
    Karpouzoglou et al., 2016). However, these systems are place based and context
    sensitive, requiring a thorough understanding of the potential to uptake co-develop,
    co-produce and co-implement such hydro-climatic information systems. As part of
    a larger endeavor, we aim to design a “second generation” information system in
    the form of a hydro-climatic information system called a hydro-climatic Environmental
    Virtual Observatory. This system will use data from the scientific seasonal climate
    forecast ECMWF-4 (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts-system 4)
    model, complemented with farmers indigenous forecast collected through citizen
    science ( Pettibone et al., 2016) to generate actionable knowledge for adaptive
    decision making in rice farming systems. Karpouzoglou et al., (2016) indicate
    that in the context of emerging open-technologies for information exchange, added
    value can be achieved by removing institutional and geographical barriers associated
    with information flow. In this paper we aim to diagnose the socio-ecological settings
    of rice farming systems in northern Ghana in the context of climate variability
    and change to ensure effective design and operationalisation of hydro-climatic
    EVO. We first conduct a diagnosis of the socio-ecological settings of rice production
    system in Northern Ghana in the context of climate variability and change. In
    the next step, we elaborate the diagnostics by focused on hydro-climatic information
    needs and use in rice based farming systems. Based on these diagnostic steps,
    we identify the specific challenges and opportunities identified in our case region,
    which could be meaningfully addressed by a potential EVO. We used the four dimensions
    of Responsible Innovation to reflect on the robustness of the design and processes
    of hydro-climatic EVO to deal with the challenges and opportunities faced in a
    responsible way. The outcome of our study is a framework for the hydro-climatic
    EVO outlining its properties and processes. 2 Conceptual framework Studies show
    that crop management strategies of farmers (e.g. timing of planting, weeding,
    fertilizing, application of pesticides) are shaped by predictive weather/climate
    information. Traditionally farmers make use of indigenous knowledge to produce
    seasonal and weather forecast ( Svotwa et al., 2007). Traditional Ecological Knowledge
    (TEK) is known by a wide variety of terms, including indigenous knowledge (IK),
    local knowledge (LK) and traditional knowledge (TK). It has many definitions and
    there is no consensus on an operational definition applicable across disciplines.
    Huntington et al. (2004) for example, understands TEK as ‘…the knowledge and insights
    acquired through extensive observations of an area or species’ (Huntington et
    al., 2004, p 1270). In contrast, Berkes et al., (1995) in an attempt to more fully
    incorporate indigenous world views, broadens the scope of TEK and define it as
    ‘…a cumulative body of knowledge, practice, and belief, evolving by adaptive processes
    and handed down through generations by cultural transmission, about the relationship
    of living beings (including humans) with one another and with their environment
    (Berkes et al., 1995, p7). In the context of this study, emphasis is placed on
    “indigenous”, which is defined as native or local knowledge that is passed on
    from generation to generation. Such knowledge is used for “forecasting”, i.e.
    the prediction of a future occurrence or condition ( Daily Nation, 2017). Indigenous
    forecasts are based on farmers’ experience of changes in certain biophysical indicators
    ( Orlove et al., 2010; Roncoli et al.,2002). Literature shows that African farmers
    are using various local weather indicators such as plants, animals, insects, the
    solar system and wind in predicting the weather and climate ( Speranza et al.,
    2010; Ziervogel and Opere, 2010; Tarhule and Lamb, 2003; Roncoli et al.,2002).
    Studies have therefore suggested that particularly in Africa indigenous knowledge
    has the potential to enhance farmers’ adaptation to climate variability and change
    ( Naess, 2013; Derbile et al., 2016; Mikkelsen and Langohr, 2004). However, it
    is plausible that indigenous knowledge is not sufficient anymore because of projected
    climate change. Increasingly, scientific projections are developed to further
    inform farmers about short, medium and long-term climate variability and change,
    particularly for rainfall. It is important, however, to acknowledge that weather
    and climate forecast systems have limited value unless they can directly influence
    decisions and have an impact on the systems under consideration ( Hammer, 2000).
    Manyanhaire (2015) argue for the integration of indigenous knowledge systems with
    climate change science as a basis for comprehensive community based response to
    the impacts of climate change. It is argued that farmers are more likely to adopt
    new ideas when these can be seen in the context of their existing practices. Patt
    and Gwata (2002) for example observed that farmers’ willingness to use seasonal
    climate forecasts increased when the forecasts presented are combined and compared
    with local indigenous forecasts. As indicated in the introduction, creating conditions
    that allow for knowledge exchange between scientists, decision-makers and citizens
    is becoming increasingly necessary for building resilience and responding to environmental
    change ( UN, 2014; Mol, 2006; Buytaert et al., 2014; Folke et al., 2010). The
    concept of Environmental Virtual Observatories (EVOs) offers the opportunity to
    bring together scientific and indigenous knowledge ( Karpouzoglou et al., 2016).
    Examples of first generation of these EVOs are Wilkinson et al. (2013) for communicating
    flood risk to catchment stakeholders and a cloud technology for connecting and
    integrating fragmented data, models, and tools to deliver new holistic approaches
    to environmental challenges ( Emmett et al.,2014). They have paid less emphasis
    on how enhanced participation of a variety of users can be achieved via a virtual
    platform. In many cases, projects that seek to generate and disseminate information
    that provides actionable knowledge for empowering local communities and enhancing
    environmental management for example have achieved limited success ( Dewulf et
    al., 2005). Despite considerable progress in recent years, many cases exist where
    knowledge and perspectives of certain groups of people are either not included
    or under represented ( Karpouzoglou et al., 2016). This is particularly challenging
    for EVOs that exist on the interface between scientists and non-expert users.
    Similarly, most of the first generation EVO’s are developed and communicated,
    using mostly top-down approaches. For example, local farmers are considered as
    end-users of forecast products developed by scientist from universities and/or
    research institutions. In most cases, farmers do not contribute to the process
    of developing the weather climate forecast products ( Ouédraogo et al., 2015).
    As a result, the communicated forecasts are often not locally specific or applicable
    and therefore contribute to limited action. Second generation EVOs seek to resolve
    this problem by enhancing participation of all relevant stakeholders. While first
    generation EVOs are primed for scientists, second generation EVOs have a benefit
    to include knowledge co-creation and resilience through their participatory design.
    Second generation EVOs such as those proposed by Karpouzoglou et al., (2016) have
    a stronger focus on the processes of knowledge co-creation and interaction between
    stakeholders. An important aspect of this knowledge co-creation EVO is its potential
    to achieve greater relevance by engaging with stakeholders. In some cases, citizen
    become active contributors to science ( Buytaert et al., 2014) and EVO’s offer
    the possibility to connect scientist and local farmers via a virtual platform
    where information is exchanged and knowledge created to support farm decision-making.
    Active engagement of farmers can range from short-term collection of data to intensive
    engagement in creating new knowledge with scientists and/or other volunteers (
    Pettibone et al., 2016). Introducing new innovations such as EVO’s should be undertaken
    responsibly, especially when directed at socially desirable and socially acceptable
    ends ( Owen et al., 2013). Designing these EVOs responsibly means acknowledging
    that such frameworks are not only technical but are also socially and politically
    constituted ( Winner, 1978). Innovative technologies that underlie EVO’s might
    have great benefits for society, but unforeseen impacts are not just possible
    but probable. To guide the design and evaluation of our EVO, we build onto the
    responsible innovation concept. We make use of the responsible innovation (RI)
    framework of Stilgoe et al. (2013) which provides a set of basic principles that
    seek to maintain novelty and at the same time make it responsible: anticipation,
    reflexivity, inclusion, and responsiveness. Anticipation requires that researchers
    and organizations continuously ask ‘what if?’ questions, which include but not
    limited to what are the likely consequences? What are possible unintended effects?
    It requires projection and futuristic thinking in a systematic way and consideration
    of how the EVO is predictable and resilient to change. For example, it provides
    early warnings of future unfavourable consequences and estimate risk-based harm
    of innovations ( European Environment Agency, 2001, 2013; Hoffmann-Riem and Wynne,
    2002).The second dimension, reflexivity, refers to the principle that institutions
    and organizations must reflect on their activities and assumptions and acknowledge
    that the knowledge they produce and use has limitations. How they frame issues
    may not be universally applicable and without reflexivity may lead to frame conflicts
    or unresponsiveness of stakeholders ( Stilgoe et al.,2013; Wynne,1993). The third
    dimension, inclusion, refers to the need to involve minorities and groups without
    a voice in the innovation process ( Hajer, 2009; Felt, 2009; Stilgoe et al., 2013).
    Whereas the first generation of EVO’s placed limited emphasis on stakeholder involvement,
    responsible innovation requires active involvement of different groups through
    dialogue and representation throughout the innovation process. The dimension of
    responsiveness as proposed by Stilgoe et al. (2013) requires that systems of innovation
    have the capacity to change or shape direction in response to stakeholder and
    public values and changing circumstances. Also in this = article, we use the framework
    to evaluate the proposed hydro-climatic EVO. 3 Methodology In this paper, we address
    the following research question: How will the existing socio-ecological setting
    in rice production systems in Northern Ghana promote or hinder a possible hydroclimatic
    EVO design and operationalisation? To diagnose our case region and analyze the
    potential for designing a new EVO, the study adopts a systematic approach involving
    five sequential steps (see Fig. 1). We gathered data from both primary and secondary
    sources using qualitative methods of data collection and analysis. Fig. 1 Workflow
    of the study. Display full size 3.1 Data collection To collect data, we made use
    of three qualitative methods: content analysis of existing documents, interviews,
    and focus group discussions. The selection of methods provided us insight into
    the socio-ecological context of the case study, information needs and use as well
    as the challenges of existing systems and opportunities for the development of
    a hydro-climatic EVO. a) Research literature and documents analysis: We collected
    policy documents, donor agency reports, scientific research articles and research
    reports from related projects and programs by going through government and non-governmental
    organizations’ websites and online repositories. We specifically focused on analyzing
    local governance and institutional documents containing rules, structures and
    arrangements about farming, irrigation and water use in Northern Ghana to gain
    a thorough understanding of the decision-making context and practices. The data
    collected helped us also to guide the interviews. b) Interviews We informally
    engaged in an open conversation with fifteen (15) practitioners from nine different
    organizations (Table 1). To allow the discussion to move in the direction preferred
    by the practitioners, we opted not to use a structured interview guide, but rather
    semi-structured the conversations along topics emerging from the document analysis.
    The informal setting allowed respondents to speak more freely and openly about
    their experiences and helped in building relationships for future collaborations.
    Table 1 Stakeholders engaged in informal interviews. Download CSVDisplay Table
    The practitioners were purposefully selected based on their principal role (civil
    society representatives, policy and decision makers, researchers and farmer representatives)
    and expertise in climate, water and farming. The conversation centered on five
    thematic areas: (i) perception of the climate-water-food production problem in
    northern Ghana; (ii) current actions taking by farmers and organizations to manage
    these problems; (iii) farmers’ hydro-climatic informational needs and use; (iv)
    the value of seasonal climate forecast; and (v) the feasibility of hydro-climatic
    EVO to ameliorate the challenges. Each conversation lasted for about one hour
    and the information was recorded digitally and captured in a field notebook. c.
    Focus Group Discussions To collect information about the challenges farmers experienced
    through the existing governance arrangements, water management practices, information
    management and decision-making, we organized seven Focus Group Discussions (FGDs)
    with farmers who were engaged in irrigated and/or rainfed rice farming within
    the Kumbungu District. FGDs were held at the farm, community and scheme levels.
    Discussions at the farm level focused on the perception of farmers on problems
    of the climate-water-food production nexus and steps taken to manage them. In
    addition, discussions revolved around the hydro-climatic informational needs of
    farmers. To broaden the scope, the FGDs organized at the community level included
    rice farmers, traditional leaders, political representatives and women.This allowed
    us to discuss the place of hydroclimatic information in their farming cycle, as
    well as the ways in which governance arrangements and decision-making processes
    at the community and farm level worked. At the scheme level, similar questions
    were asked to inquire on the activities of rice farmers within the Bontanga Irrigation
    Scheme about governance, water management and how that impacted decision-making.
    Participants were leaders of farmer associations, the manager and representatives
    of committees (see table Table 2). Table 2 Actor groups for Focus Group Discussion.

    were analysed in two stages; we first scanned existing literature and documents
    for relevant information from empirical and theoretical perspectives. Next was
    a synthesis of information Secondly, we thoroughly examined them by reading, extracting
    and synthesising key information from the selected literature and documents; background
    information of rice farmers as well as insight into the socio-ecological settings
    of rice production systems in Northern Ghana. It also provided supplementary research
    data on the importance of rice in the economy of Ghana, historical and current
    climatic variability and change in Northern Ghana as well as model projections
    of these changes and their undesirable impact on farmers was established (see
    Section 4.1a). In addition, arrangement and rules governing rice farmers’ activities
    in Northern Ghana and the management framework of the irrigation schemes including
    existing hydro-climatic information systems and their value to rice farming was
    obtained via literature and document analysis (Section 4.1b). Using Atlas.ti (
    Hwang, 2008), we used open-coding methods and clustered the topics of the several
    themes. The analysis was aimed at first verifying our findings from the literature
    and document analysis to corroborate evidences and secondly to probe further on
    arising issues such as practical challenges of climate variability and change
    for farmers and the potential value of hydro-climatic information systems for
    farmers’ adaptive decision making. Focus Group Discussions were similarly transcribed
    and processed through thematic analysis. The analysis provided information on
    the rules of engagement and decision making among rice farmers, their knowledge
    of existing hydro-climatic information services, information access and utilization,
    challenges of institutional linkage and information exchange at farm level (see
    Section 4.1b and 4.2). 4 Results The section outlines the results of the diagnostic
    analysis (Section 4.1), and the key challenges reported by farmers (Section 4.2).
    4.1 Diagnostic analysis of the socio-ecological system To analyze the current
    setting, we focus on rice farmers in Northern Ghana (Fig. 2). We specifically
    explore the socio-ecological aspects of climate change impacts on crop productivity
    (i.e. yield per unit area) and not ''food production'', as this is dependent on
    many other factors than climate change, such as quality of land, infrastructure
    investment, available finance, international trade policy, and food market. We
    analyze this case region by splitting it in two dimensions; the biophysical factors
    (climate and water) and socio-institutional (actors, rules, practices, decision-making)
    parameters framing the activities of rice farmers within the study area. Fig.
    2 Northern sector of Ghana in a black rectangle (A) relative to Africa showing
    Ghana (B). Display full size 4.1.1 Biophysical context From the literature analysis
    and interviews, the major The biophysical issues in the case area are mapped in
    Fig. 3. The main issue in the North of Ghana (∼97,702 km² land area) is climate
    variability which significantly impacts agricultural productivity. Development
    of the agricultural sector in this region is affected by the climatic conditions,
    such as the long dry season of about six to seven months followed by five-month
    rainy season (April/May to September/October) usually characterized by sporadic
    droughts and/or floods ( Amikuzino and Donkoh, 2012; Barry et al., 2005). Temperatures
    in the region are higher compared to those in the southern part of the country.
    The lowest maximum temperatures are around 26 °C mostly recorded in August and
    highest temperatures are between 40–42 °C recorded in March or April ( Mdemu,
    2008). The climate system of Northern Ghana is characterized by distinctive inter-annual
    and inter-decadal variability in precipitation and temperature( Nyadzi, 2016).
    The area is associated with an erratic unimodal rainfall of an annual sum between
    400 and 1200 mm. Changes in the duration of the rainy season have shortened the
    length of the growing season, delaying the onset of planting season in most cases,
    while dry season and rainy season temperatures have increased by about 1 °C and
    2 °C respectively ( Acquah, 2011; Kunstmann and Jung, 2005). Fig. 3 Analysis of
    the main biophysical issues in Northern Ghana (Fieldwork 2017). Display full size
    The northern part of Ghana experiences the greatest rainfall variations and this
    is projected to increase along with increasing temperature (2.1–2.4 °C) from 2010
    to 2050 ( Owusu and Waylen, 2009). According to Kankam-Yeboah et al., (2011),
    high temperatures that were previously recorded in March (peak of the dry season)
    are now being recorded also in January. In addition, the onset of the rainy season
    has become more difficult to predict. They also indicated that in the past, the
    rainy season started in April and ended around late September or early October.
    However, in recent times, the rainy season starts in June or July with extreme
    heavy rainfall in September or October. These outcomes indicate a potential increase
    in the intensity and frequency of extreme events, such as droughts and floods
    and a consequential reduction in the crop growing period with serious implications
    for crop yields and food security ( Abdul-Rahaman and Owusu-Sekyere, 2017a, b;
    Kasei et al. 2014). Current occurrences and long-term climate patterns create
    future uncertainties with serious implications for climate prediction and agricultural
    productivity. As re-iterated by Antwi-Agyei et al., (2012), climate variability,
    manifested at different time scales and in different ways will significantly impact
    the agricultural sector of Northern Ghana. In addition, large temporal and spatial
    rainfall variability results in high variability in river flow. As results, most
    rivers flow for only a few months a year with limited or no flow during the rest
    of the year ( Amisigo and Van De Giesen, 2005). The combination of climate change,
    intensive land use, population growth and economic development results in increased
    water demand and more pressure on the available water resources ( Stanturf et
    al., 2011). To cope with climate variability hydraulic infrastructure such as
    small-scale reservoirs and large scale irrigation systems have been constructed
    mainly for agricultural purposes ( Faulkner et al., 2008; Amisigo et al., 2015).
    Uncertainties related to climate variability is a major challenge for both rain-fed
    and irrigated farmers and water managers because to productively manage their
    activities, critical climate sensitive decisions have to be taken months ahead
    of a season ( Asante and Amuakwa-Mensah, 2014). Sustainability of rain-fed farming
    systems becomes a challenge with severe impacts on crop yields ( Fosu-Mensah et
    al., 2012; Acquah, 2011). Not only does this affect rain-fed farming, it also
    has a major toll on irrigation schemes. Water levels in the dry season are low
    making it difficult to irrigate farmlands limiting production. Farmers have reported
    re-sowing of seeds due to poor germination following delay in rains, which increases
    their cost of production. Irrigation water managers rely on river discharge to
    decide the frequency, quantity and method of water distribution. The uncertainty
    associated with predicting seasonal rains and water availability puts farmers
    in a dilemma when key farming decisions are to be made ( Ndamani and Watanabe,
    2013). In the face of these challenges, rice is a central crop as it accounts
    for 15% of agricultural output and 45% of the total area used in cereal grain
    production in Ghana ( Stanturf et al., 2011). Rice is produced under irrigation,
    rain-fed lowland and rain-fed upland systems (CSIR-SARI, 2011). Studies on climate
    change project increasing temperatures and declining rainfall, resulting in reduced
    rice production (e.g. Asante and Amuakwa-Mensah, 2014). In a study carried out
    by Knox et al. (2012) rice is projected to experience the most variations of all
    studied crops, since water scarcity, and over reliance on unpredictable rainfall
    are the major factors affecting rice production in Northern Ghana ( Kranjac-Berisavljevic
    et al., 2003). 4.1.2 Socio-institutional context The North of Ghana is divided
    into three administrative regions: Upper East, Upper West and Northern Regions
    (Fig. 2). The majority of this area is located in the Tropical Guinea Savannah
    zone, with small parts (extreme north of the upper east and west regions) sharing
    border with Burkina Faso in the Sudan Savanna. The north of Ghana is the poorest
    part of the country yet recent reports indicate that about 80% of the economically
    active population in this part of Ghana engages in agriculture, producing millet,
    guinea-corn, rice, maize, groundnut, beans, and sorghum with some few others producing
    dry season tomatoes and onions. Livestock and poultry production are also common
    in the region (GSS, 2013). The north of Ghana is generally endowed with about
    20 small and large irrigation schemes. Rice farming periods and practices are
    similar across the three regions, even though there are individual preferences
    for different varieties depending on farmer’s own aim of farming ( GIDA, 2016,
    2011). Governance in Ghana is characterized by two main governance arrangements.
    These are traditional and formal arrangements. Formal governance arrangements
    have been established by legal and structural definitions captured in the constitution
    and other working documents dependent on the context. Traditional governance arrangements,
    although ‘loosely’ framed are embedded in local and community culture expressed
    in the form of rules, norms and beliefs (see also Myers and Fridy, 2017). In Northern
    Ghana, the activities of rice farmers are informed by both governance arrangements
    ( Nanedo et al., 2014). Our engagements revealed that the Ghana Irrigation Development
    Authority, has the mandate of developing and managing irrigation infrastructure
    (see also Namara et al., 2011). The Ghana Meteorological Agency, Water Resource
    Commission and the Center for Scientific and Industrial Research are also collaborative
    institutions in meeting information, water security and advice on crop productivity
    respectively (see also Braimah et al., 2014; Nanedo et al., 2014). The Participatory
    Irrigation Management Strategy ( Namara et al., 2011), adopted in the 1990s has
    served as the framework for a more decentralized management of Irrigation Schemes.
    At the scheme level, the manager is responsible for the daily operations of the
    scheme and thus engages farmers and leadership of farmer associations in the drafting
    of schedules and assigning of roles for effective water management for irrigation
    purposes. Water is thus discharged through canals onto farmlands within different
    laterals guided by agreed schedules. The manager also coordinates decisions and
    information exchange amongst all actors as part of steps to adapt to changing
    conditions experienced. Rainfed rice farmers operating within communities are
    also guided by traditional governance arrangements aimed at ensuring effective
    engagement and resource use. These are in the form of rules and procedures which
    community members are expected to adhere to or live by. For example, Chiefs are
    custodians of lands and thus farmers who do not have family lands would have to
    consult the leadership for land for farming activities. Water is also perceived
    as a communal resource and hence farmers are expected to consider the interest
    of other users in the quest to meet their water needs. Chiefs who are thus seen
    to have the highest authority within the community legally enforce communal decisions.
    Farmers must thus adhere to agreed rules even if it does not satisfy their needs.
    In both systems, we found the existing governance arrangements to be faced with
    multiple challenges limiting stakeholder interaction and information exchange.
    For instance, information provision through Chief are usually aimed at general
    community concerns and activities rather than agriculture information required
    for farm decision-making. Most farmers thus took the initiative of obtaining information
    from other farmers or platforms such as radio and mobile telecommunication service
    operators involved in related information provision (See also Al-Hassan et al.,
    2013). Community representatives such as Assemblymen are not instrumental in providing
    relevant farm related information. Within the irrigation scheme, power play and
    gender imbalance results in bias in engagement. Results of the focus group discussions
    show that access to water was mostly characterized by power play especially during
    the dry season as only a few laterals upland could access water for irrigation
    from the dam. Thus, lands in the upland are allocated to cronies of the irrigation
    manager, chiefs and heads of committees. Women are also less represented and hence
    limited in accessing land and obtaining relevant information related to farm activities.
    Governance arrangements within the scheme also put the Scheme manager in charge
    of information directly relevant for scheme operations. In some contexts, farmers
    receive delayed information relevant for decision-making due to inactivity on
    the side of leadership. Interviews and FGDs pointed to weak institutional collaborations
    especially on information provision and use (see also Nugent, 2000). A situation
    largely attributable to negligence, poor leadership, weak communication links,
    inadequate resources and logistical challenges. For example, the Ghana Meteorological
    Agency provides seasonal climate information only at the start of the season and
    mostly to radio stations and irrigation scheme managers with little contact with
    farmers themselves. However, wherever these contacts exist they are inconsistent
    and generally decrease over the season. Private operators providing hydro-climatic
    information have limited collaboration with the public sector. Thus, ESOKO, MTN
    and Vodafone only interact with farmers without consideration of existing programmes
    and how their interventions could be embedded in them. Braimah et al. (2014) allude
    to complex local socio-political issues that affect relationships within irrigation
    schemes. These range from power play to gender inequalities affecting knowledge
    exchange and resource management. Interviews also revealed that farmers take a
    number of key decisions in managing changes in climatic conditions and how they
    affect water availability and food production. These include when and how to prepare
    farmlands, when, what and how to plant, perform weed control, apply fertilizer
    and harvest. Farmers adapt their decisions considering outcomes and what is deemed
    appropriate in a given context (see also Ndamani and Watanabe, 2013). Under irrigated
    rice farming, water managers lead the decision process with the design of an irrigation
    schedule. Farmers however are responsible for specific decisions on their farms.
    Under rain-fed systems, the farmer leads the risk management process by exploring
    how experience from the previous season and new knowledge or information on weather
    inter alia, water availability in their decision-making (see also Abdul-Razak
    and Kruse, 2017). The survey revealed that adaptive farm decisions of farmers
    are generally based on information generated from indigenous and scientific forecasts.
    While farmers were quick to acknowledge the limitations in their personal forecast
    they however considered it better for decision making than the scientific forecast
    provided by Ghana Meteorological Agency as this was perceived to be generic and
    not locally specific to their community and needs (See also Gwenzi et al., 2016;
    Zuma-Netshiukhwi et al., 2013) Information systems within the study area were
    identified to provide scientific forecast information whereas indigenous forecasts
    were tied to farmers observation matched with experience. For example, farmers
    are able predict the beginning of the wet season and when to prepare their fields
    for planting ( Ofori-Sarpong, 2001). They base their predictions on a set of indicators,
    each of which has different levels of reliability. The flowering of the shea nut
    tree, migratory patterns of birds and position of the constellation Pleiades all
    help farmers determine when the rainy season is due ( Benneh, 1970). They are
    able to predict date of seasonal rainfall onset and cessation, and whether the
    season will receive above, below and normal rainfall. Also, they are able to make
    daily weather predictions of low, medium and high rainfall (Frimpong, 2013). In
    the next section, the paper presents findings on information systems and how they
    enable hydro-climatic information access and use. 4.2 Hydro-climatic information
    access and use in rice farming systems in Northern Ghana The role of hydro-climatic
    information in knowledge creation, improved adaptation and improved agricultural
    production has been highlighted in different studies and initiatives ( Sam and
    Dzandu, 2016; Owolade and Kayode, 2012). For example, in 2014 and 2015, the Ghana
    Meteorological Agency ( GMet, 2016) in collaboration with the CGIAR and ESOKO
    provided weather and seasonal climate information via conventional SMS to farmers
    in two piloted communities (Doggoh and Bompari) in northern Ghana ( ESOKO, 2016).
    Other media such as radio and television programs are also used to provide relevant
    information in English and local languages (i.e. Dagbanli, Frafra, Gonja, Kasem
    etc.). In spite of these interventions, there are still challenges in information
    access and interpretation by farmers who are illiterates and can’t read text and
    even literate farmers lack the necessary skills to understand technical information
    because of the format in which they are presented. Also, the extent to which those
    who could read adopt the information and new knowledge received is considerably
    questionable (see also Sam and Dzandu, 2016). Our inventory of existing ICT and
    media platforms in Ghana as shown in Table 1 reveals some potential information
    transfer models, namely radio, mobile apps, websites and conventional phone-based
    services (e.g. recorded voice messages and SMS texts for more literate farmers).
    Other non-ICT means of information transfer include moving vans, extension officers,
    water managers and head of farmer organizations who disseminate pertinent information
    to farmers. Table 3 provides an assessment of strengths and limitations of the
    main communication tools regarding their utilization in hydro-climatic information
    services delivery in northern Ghana. Table 3 Overview of key strengths and limitations
    of main media platforms in hydro-climatic information services in Ghana. Download
    CSVDisplay Table 5 Discussions This study set out with the aim of diagnosing how
    socio-ecological settings of rice farmers in Northern Ghana could affect the design
    and operationalisation of a hydro-climatic EVO. In this section, we draw on the
    insights from our diagnostic analysis to outline the characteristics of our hydro-climatic
    EVO. The design aims to overcome the identified challenges and capitalize on opportunities
    identified in section 4.2. The framework consists of two main parts: the structural
    elements of the framework and the processes through which it operates. We discuss
    the process of designing the EVO through the lens of the four dimensions of RI.
    5.1 Design features: description of the structural elements Our diagnostics resulted
    in different hydro-climatic information needs, challenges and opportunities for
    an EVO. We propose a hydro-climatic EVO (Fig. 4) consisting of three major elements;
    (i) data sources, (ii) data handling processes, (iii) platform for information
    and data exchange. Fig. 4 Fundamental Architecture of hydro-climatic EVO. Display
    full size (i) Data sources Data will be sourced from two main knowledge systems;
    indigenous and scientific knowledge systems (see Fig. 4). First, as explained
    earlier, Ghanaian farmers use indigenous ecological knowledge to understand weather
    and climate patterns in order to make decisions about crop and irrigation cycles
    (Frimpong, 2013). Prior to every season the EVO will collect farmers’ seasonal
    forecast of rainfall onset and cessation date and, rainfall amount and degree
    of temperature forecast expressed on a nominal scale of below, normal or above
    normal. Also within the season, the EVO will collect farmers’ twenty- four (24)
    hours weather forecast of low, medium or high rain. Second, seasonal temperature
    and rainfall data from European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF-S4)
    seasonal forecasts system 4 ( Molteni et al., 2011) will be analyzed to also provide
    same seasonal climate information on rainfall onset and cessation date, amount
    of rainfall and degree of temperature also expressed in a nominal scale of below,
    normal and above normal. ECMWF-S4 is a state-of-the-art seasonal ensemble climate
    model that provides seasonal climate forecast on daily timescale into seven months
    ahead of time. The daily nature of the data will allow us to estimate daily rainfall
    amount of either low, medium and high. (ii) Data handling processes The second
    element of the framework is the data handling process where indigenous and scientific
    data are collected, processed, analyzed, and visualized. The collection of data
    will be partly automated. The hydro-climatic-EVO will offer a platform where farmers
    can regularly upload their seasonal climate and daily weather forecast information.
    These indigenous forecast information from farmers will be complemented with those
    from scientific forecast. There are clear differences and limitations of both
    data sources. However, seasonal information such as rainfall onset and cessation
    date, above, below and normal rainfall generated from the analysis of the ECMWF-S4
    temperature and rainfall data will be used to complement those predicted by farmers
    using their indigenous knowledge. In a similar way daily weather information such
    as low, medium and high rainfall predicted by farmers will complement information
    estimated from the daily data from ECMWF-S4 or any other weather model. There
    is potentially great value in combining both sources of data. For example, both
    data sources have inherent value that will complement the weakness exhibited by
    each without substituting one for the other and building on their respective strengths.
    The question that remains is whether information from both sources will be provided
    independently or combined. Developing a comprehensive approach to either independently
    present scientific and indigenous forecast information or harmonize them for actionability
    remained to be further explored in our next study. (iii) Information exchange
    for adaptive farm decision making The hydro-climatic EVO has additional features
    that distinguish it from other EVOs. It offers a participatory opportunity to
    actively engage end-users to co-create actionable knowledge. Farmers can share
    their forecast information and receive tangible information for their adaptive
    farm decision-making. For example seasonal climate information such as onset and
    cessation date, rainfall amount (be it above, normal or below normal) and seasonal
    dam water levels, and the degree of temperature per season will support: (i)  Pre-season
    decisions: such as when to buy seeds and which variety to buy, irrigation land
    size allocation and Labour size, which weedicide, pesticide and fertilizer to
    buy. (ii)  Land preparation decisions: when to clear land, when to harrow and
    plough, (iii)  Planting decisions: when to nurse, transplant and which planting
    method to adopt and (iv)  Harvesting decision: when to harvest and by which method.
    On the other hand daily weather information (be it yes/no rain, low, medium or
    high rainfall) received by farmers will support farm decisions such as (i)  when
    to fertilie, (ii)  when to apply weedicides and pesticides and (iii)  when to
    carry out supplementary irrigation. Details of information need and decision-making
    by rice farmers are discussed by Nyamekye et al. (2018) and Nyadzi et al., (2018).
    The EVO offers tailor made information that generate actionable knowledge to for
    decision making at different stages of farming. The interface of the Hydro-climatic
    EVO will be carefully designed with close collaboration with end-users to ensure
    effective data and information exchange with a particular focus on non-literate
    users with little or no prior ICT experience. The hydro-climatic EVO therefore
    envisages opportunities for learning and becoming an integral part of rice production
    systems in the region. 5.2 Hydro-climatic EVO: addressing challenges in existing
    information systems The main challenges of existing information systems and what
    our EVO seek to do differently is summarized in Table 4. Challenges with existing
    systems that limit their usefulness include user unfriendliness of the system,
    inaccuracies of forecast information, relevance of information, managing user
    expectation and weak collaborations. Table 4 Identified challenges in existing
    information systems and the way forward. Download CSVDisplay Table 5.3 Design
    process: hydro-climatic EVO as responsible innovation We build on the responsible
    innovation framework ( Stilgoe et al., 2013) to assess the initial steps taken
    in the process of building a hydro-climatic EVO, and to identify the challenges
    ahead. For each cardinal principle, we raised some salient questions that seek
    to guide the development and implementation. (i) Anticipation Anticipation involves
    “systematic thinking aimed at increasing resilience, while revealing new opportunities
    for innovation and the shaping of agendas for socially-robust risk research” (
    Stilgoe et al., 2013). This relates to forecasting, and imagining possible and
    desirable futures, but also to the ‘ethics of promising’. This dimension of the
    RI framework makes us ask ‘what if…?’ questions ( Ravetz, 1997) to expose the
    various contingencies associated with the development of the hydro-climatic-EVO.
    From its conception, the envisaged hydro-climatic-EVO anticipates the future by
    considering the potential impacts of climate variability and change on farmers’
    daily and seasonal farm decision making. Rather than optimizing for the most likely
    future scenario, the hydro-climatic-EVO accounts for the associated uncertainty
    by trying to make variability in water availability manageable for different farming
    purposes. Climate variability and change is only one of the potentially relevant
    future developments. Equally important is the unintended consequences which could
    be the future development of farming in the region, in terms of economic prospects
    and farmers’ aspirations. Will farmers move out of agriculture into other occupations
    if possible, or do they see a future for themselves and their children that will
    motivate them to further improve their farmer system and embrace new technologies
    such as an EVO? The approach taken to ensure inclusiveness through user-centered
    design (see below) creates some challenges for the ‘ethics’ of promising. Developing
    features that are most relevant to users implies that these may be quite specific
    and/or novel, making it uncertain to what degree the innovation will be able to
    deliver on the promised usefulness of the EVO. (ii) Reflexivity Reflexivity means
    “holding a mirror up to one’s own activities, commitments and assumptions, being
    aware of the limits of knowledge and being mindful that a particular framing of
    an issue may not be universally held” ( Stilgoe et al., 2013). It is about questioning
    the value systems and theories that shape science, innovation and their governance.
    The envisaged hydro-climatic-EVO will be developed through interdisciplinary collaboration,
    where the absence of shared standard ways of operating leads to mutual questioning
    and thus some form of reflexivity. This reflexivity prevents the natural scientists
    to retreat into sole modelling, and prevents the social scientists to retreat
    into sole analysis of social processes. Reflexivity also requires carefulness
    not to violate the social and cultural ethics of the society in which the project
    is carried out, particularly because different countries and vulnerable populations
    are involved. This was vital especially during our interaction with farmers, for
    example regarding their traditional knowledge and regular engagement for information
    exchange. A continuous challenge is to remain reflexive about assumptions made
    in building the EVO, and to what extent these are aligned with the users’ context.
    Thus the need for continuous scrutiny of project activities and dealing with every
    farmer and situation distinctively. (iii) Inclusion The user-centered design framework
    ( Zulkafli et al., 2017) adopted for the development of the hydro-climatic EVO
    strongly emphasizes inclusion. Various actors and institutions were actively involved
    in the early development process, with particular attention paid to potential
    end-users. The engagement of different actors on the project especially during
    regular workshops and trainings is expected to play a pivotal role in creating
    a sense of ownership among the farmers and other actors (public and private sector
    agencies, local leaders and chiefs). A clear example of inclusiveness is the involvement
    of both rainfed and irrigated rice farmers on the project. Each of these farmer
    types has its own need, which must be met. Also the reliance on both scientific
    and indigenous data and knowledge systems to generate actionable knowledge enhances
    the inclusiveness of hydro-climatic EVO. Inclusion is never perfect, however,
    and pragmatic choices have an impact. The particular study area receives considerable
    attention from development actors, partly because of its proximity to the city
    of Tamale and its university. Farmers with higher literacy levels, fluency in
    English, and familiarity with ICT are easier to involve in e.g. local smartphone-based
    data gathering. (iv) Responsiveness Responsiveness is the capacity to “change
    shape or direction in response to stakeholders, public values, and changing circumstances”
    ( Stilgoe et al., 2013). Funded by a university programme (INREF 1 ) that values
    “research for development”, our hydro-climatic-EVO project has a good starting
    point for achieving responsiveness. The user-centered design approach to developing
    the EVO emphasizes the importance of the user context as a starting point – in
    terms of livelihoods, culture and decision-making. A choice that was made early
    in the project to include the practice of rainfed farming as well as irrigated
    farming, was responsive to the importance of rainfed farming for large parts of
    the rural population, in particular the poorer sectors. The design and structure
    of the hydro-climatic-EVO aims to meet the needs of users and remain flexible
    enough to respond to future changes in circumstances, e.g. new knowledge and emerging
    perspectives, new technical possibilities or demands, as well as changes in livelihoods
    or cultural values. Being a university-led project with a limited period (5 years)
    creates some challenges for responsiveness as well. What about responding to changes
    when paid project members are no longer around? Finally, the responsiveness to
    stakeholder and public values might be challenged by the responsiveness to academic
    values and incentives, which prioritize modeling, analysis and publication over
    stakeholder engagement and practical application. This limitation is therefore
    recognized and in cases where they emerged efforts must be put in place to amicably
    deal with them. For example, we seek to understand indigenous forecast techniques
    and develop methods to quantify them in order to harmonize them with scientific
    forecast derived from models. 6 Conclusion The diagnostics study presented here
    offers a number of important insights that help to further refine and implement
    the hydro-climatic EVO. First, participatory design will create a sense of ownership
    among farmers. This is because, being actively involved from the design to production
    and implementation stages of the project is novel, and it increases the likelihood
    that the hydro-climatic information services developed will be useful for farmers.
    Secondly, the diagnostics provides in-depth appreciation of the socio-ecological
    conditions in which the EVO will operate. Thirdly, our reflection using the RI
    framework exposed key challenges, which the hydro-climaticEVO development process
    needs to deal with. Asking these questions, however, allowed us to discuss plausible
    solutions at an early stage in the design process. One of the key challenge anticipated
    is the reliance on stakeholder participation throughout the project cycle. Farmers
    need incentives and motivation for continuous participation. In our case, we argue
    that both rainfed and irrigated farmers are challenged by climate variability
    and limited water availability and that urgent action is needed. The information
    services developed can help with improving their farm decision making in order
    to better cope with climate variability. However, it remains unclear how much
    time future users and other stakeholders are prepared to devote to the design
    process. Close monitoring is needed to find out if farmers feel that providing
    regular data and information is too time consuming. Limited commitment of users
    can potentially reduce data availability and quality. As a response we pay specific
    attention to openness and transparency in the design process, to allow participants
    to freely share their opinions and concerns. At the same time, researchers need
    to be proactive. They should be seen as and perceived to be serious with the process
    through their active engagement. In the context of decision-making, our reflections
    and findings present key challenges in terms of language, interpretation and usability.
    The knowledge co-creation and subsequent provision of actionable knowledge must
    align with literacy and user confidence in being able to easily relate to outputs.
    Our approach and innovation possesses the potential to deal with the socio-ecological
    challenges imposed by climate variability and limited water availability. We argue
    that one of the most important drivers of success to our project will be the intensive
    collective interaction of scientist and farmers compelled by the structure and
    mechanism of the hydro-climatic EVO, in which scientist and other stakeholders
    think, plan and execute together from common ground. In addition, the responsible
    line of questioning will reduce the possible surprises and eventualities that
    may affect the EVO development. Important issues to follow-up on are the performance
    of indigenous and scientific forecast to meet the hydro-climatic information needs
    of rice farmers in Northern Ghana. Another issue from our diagnostics is how governance
    systems limit information flow and interpretation. For our follow up studies we
    aim to investigate governance arrangements and how these are enabling or inhibiting
    adaptive decision-making amongst farmers and water managers. Also in the next
    stage of this project is to find out what is the most preferred model of information
    exchange by rice farmers. . The potential of including farmers in information
    collection through citizen science potentially bridges part of the gap between
    scientific and indigenous expertise and constitutes a novel contribution to the
    field of environmental observations. We conclude that the socio-ecological conditions
    in Northern Ghana necessitate the development of an effective second generation
    hydro-climatic EVO as this potentially responds to the principles of RI expected
    to drive technological innovation to manage change in natural resource management.
    Finally, the proposed hydro-climatic EVO has potential for influencing adaptive
    farm decision making in Northern Ghana in spite of identifiable challenges. Using
    the RI framework has helped us to refine these challenges and offer concrete suggestions
    to improve both the design and implementation of the proposed platform in a responsible
    way. Further reading Agyekumhene, C., de Vries, J.R., van Paassen, A., Macnaghten,

    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nWith the bane of climate variability\
    \ and its consequences for water \navailability in rice farming systems, farmers\
    \ have relied heavily on climate \ninformation systems for meteorological information\
    \ to help manage \nuncertainties and create actionable knowledge for decision-making.\
    \ \nHowever, the limited impact of existing information systems calls for further\
    \ \nresearch on what could be done differently to improve information gathering\
    \ \nand synthesis, the cross-fertilisation of knowledge, and the elimination of\
    \ \nsocial and technical barriers in these systems. This dissertation sets out\
    \ to \nstudy existing information systems, how these contribute to actionable\
    \ \nknowledge creation in rice farming systems, what adaptive decisions farmers\
    \ \ntake in managing uncertainties, and how best to restructure climate \ninformation\
    \ systems for impact.  \n \nBecause of the multi-faceted nature of the problem,\
    \ the study adopts an \ninterdisciplinary research approach and provides evidential\
    \ justifications \nusing a case study in Ghana. Generally, the dissertation draws\
    \ on qualitative \nresearch methods such as focus group discussions, interviews,\
    \ workshops, \nand observations, with data analysed by content and theme. The\
    \ study \nproposes a new framework for climate information systems and adds to\
    \ the \nfurther conceptualisation of actionable knowledge and adaptive decision-\n\
    making in rice farming systems. It shows that both indigenous and scientific \n\
    knowledge should be considered in establishing the salience, credibility, and\
    \ \nlegitimacy of knowledge created through information systems in rice farming\
    \ \nsystems. It also contributes strongly to the conceptualisation of adaptive\
    \ \ndecision-making by drawing on uncertainties and logics of decision-making.\
    \  \n \nThe scientific and societal relevance of this study is grounded not only\
    \ in its \ncontribution to scientific debates on information systems, actionable\
    \ \nknowledge, and adaptive decision-making, but also in its action-oriented \n\
    approach contributing to practical designs of climate information systems that\
    \ \npromote collaborative and participatory processes to formulate information\
    \ \nneeds and what best could be actionable in rice farming systems.  \n \n \n\

    Chapter 1\n14\n1.1 Background and problem definition \nSub-Saharan Africa is arguably\
    \ the region most vulnerable to climate \nvariability, as evidenced by higher\
    \ temperatures, low precipitation, flooding, \nand drought resulting in severe\
    \ impacts on food production exacerbated by \nlow adaptive capacities (Hendrix\
    \ & Glaser, 2007; Kotir, 2011). In Ghana, \nrecorded temperatures rose about 1o\
    \ C over the last 40 years of the twentieth \ncentury, with high temperatures\
    \ mostly in the north of the country and dire \nconsequences for agricultural\
    \ productivity (Akudugu, Dittoh, & Mahama, \n2012; Fosu-Mensah, Vlek, & MacCarthy,\
    \ 2012; Abdul-Razak & Kruse, \n2017). In Kumbungu District in Northern Ghana,\
    \ rice farmers are faced with \nan uncertain future, with a lack of security about\
    \ future seasonal and weather \nconditions increasing the level of risks that\
    \ they have to surmount.  \n \nGovernment interventions such as irrigation infrastructure\
    \ have proved \ninadequate. In a context where farmer population thresholds merit\
    \ such \ninterventions, poor maintenance practices, financial constraints, and\
    \ weak \ngovernance structures have hampered their multiplier effect when they\
    \ are \nintroduced into communities (Bacho & Bonye, 2006). The construction of\
    \ \nirrigation dams was expected to improve water management through the \nstorage\
    \ and discharge of water for irrigation purposes. The Bontanga \nIrrigation Scheme\
    \ is one of numerous government interventions to support \nfood production in\
    \ the northern part of Ghana. The scheme serves \ncommunities within Kumbungu\
    \ District, with farmers accessing water for \nirrigation purposes. However, the\
    \ majority of households still practice rainfed \nfarming given the limited land\
    \ area for cultivation under irrigation, amongst \nother reasons (Alhassan, Loomis,\
    \ Frasier, Davies, & Andales, 2013; \nKudadze, Imoru, & Adzawla, 2019; Zakaria,\
    \ Abujaja, Adam, Nabila, & \nMohammed, 2013). Of these, rice farmers, given the\
    \ crop’s copious water \nrequirement, are at a high risk of crop failure, especially\
    \ in rainfed farming \nsystems. This requires farmers to adapt their practices\
    \ by taking decisions \ntowards reducing vulnerabilities and limiting probabilities\
    \ of crop failure.  \n \nEffectively, farmers require forecasts of rainfall amount,\
    \ rainfall distribution, \ntemperature, humidity, and wind speed to be made available\
    \ through \ninformation systems. These are comprised of public (e.g. Ghana \n\
    General introduction\nChapter 1\n15\nMeteorological Agency) and private (e.g.\
    \ ESOKO, Farm radio, Farmer line) \nsocial or technological systems enabling the\
    \ collection, processing, and \ndissemination of information to support decision-making\
    \ (Laudon, 2012; \nRainer, Cegielski, Splettstoesser-Hogeterp, & Sanchez-Rodriguez,\
    \ 2013). \nAlthough the provision of seasonal and weather information is expected\
    \ to \nreduce risks faced by farmers, studies in Ghana have pointed to their limited\
    \ \nimpact at farm level because of misconceptions about information needs, \n\
    untimeliness, non-relevance, and limited uptake and use in decision-making \n\
    (Agyekumhene et al., 2018;  Aker, 2011; Alemna & Sam, 2006; Annor-\nFrempong,\
    \ Kwarteng, Agunga, & Zinnah, 2006; Munthali et al., 2018). Also, \ninformation\
    \ disseminated is packaged in machine-readable formats, making \nit difficult\
    \ for farmers to interpret, given their low literacy levels. Farmers \nalso resort\
    \ to de facto indigenous knowledge using indicators such as the \nmovement of\
    \ birds, wind direction, and behaviour of farm animals. However, \nthe reliability\
    \ of indigenous indicators has been questioned, as changes in \nnatural and environmental\
    \ conditions make them less reliable than before. \nFundamental to the challenge\
    \ is the underlying factor of participation and \ncollaborative framing of information\
    \ through co-production, which seems to \nbe lacking in the way in which current\
    \ information systems operate. There is \nalso the question of scale, whereby\
    \ information systems are unable to provide \ngeographically segregated meteorological\
    \ information at farm or community \nlevel. In effect, information provision and\
    \ how that transforms into actionable \nknowledge applicable to farmer decision-making\
    \ in efforts to adapt to \nchanging social and environmental conditions must be\
    \ studied to improve the \ntransformational power of meteorological information\
    \ (Partey et al., 2018; \nMabe, Nketiah, & Darko, 2014). \n \nIn current literature\
    \ on how to bridge the information provision and uptake \ngap through a collaboration\
    \ of scientists and citizens, a new generation of \nenvironmental virtual observatories\
    \ (EVOs), including information systems, \nhave been highlighted as presenting\
    \ such opportunities. Karpouzoglou et al. \n(2016a, p. 1) define EVOs as ‘a suite\
    \ of information gathering, processing \nand dissemination technologies (infrastructure,\
    \ tools and software) supported \nby World Wide Web that can enable cross-fertilisation\
    \ of different sources of \nknowledge on shared virtual platforms’. Thus, the\
    \ thrust of EVOs is the \nChapter 1\n16\ncollation, processing, and synthesis\
    \ of knowledge to make it actionable using \ntechnologies and support from the\
    \ internet (Vitolo, Elkhatib, Reusser, \nMacleod, & Buytaert, 2015; Zacharias\
    \ et al., 2011). However, EVO as a \nconcept is still evolving, with the need\
    \ to investigate how so-called second \ngeneration EVOs, including information\
    \ systems, could help address the \ninformation–knowledge–decision-making interrelationship\
    \ in social and \necological systems in order to manage complex problems.  \n\
    \ \nThis dissertation is embedded in the EVOCA programme led by Wageningen \n\
    University and Research and its partners, which has the goal of exploring how\
    \ \nEVOs could be leveraged to transform the development landscape in rural \n\
    Africa. The programme has the theme ‘Responsible life-science innovations \nfor\
    \ development in the digital age’ and addresses the overall question: How \ncan\
    \ life-science knowledge, digital technologies, and responsible innovation \n\
    concepts be leveraged in development contexts to build inclusive virtual \nplatforms\
    \ for environmental information that enable connective action to \naddress development\
    \ challenges in crop, water, health, and wildlife \nmanagement?  \n \nIn line\
    \ with this, this dissertation focusing on rice farming systems in Ghana \nset\
    \ out first with the goal of inquiring into how existing information systems \n\
    contribute to actionable knowledge creation for adaptive decision-making and \n\
    second to contribute to the debate on how climate information systems can be \n\
    better framed to improve cross-fertilisation of knowledge for decision-\nmaking\
    \ amidst water insecurities in rice farming systems in Ghana. More \nspecifically,\
    \ the dissertation focuses not only on design questions but also on \nhow forecast\
    \ information translates into actionable knowledge and uptake in \ndecision-making.\
    \ The dissertation addresses the overall question: How do \nexisting information\
    \ systems contribute to actionable knowledge creation for \ndecision-making in\
    \ rice farming systems and what does this mean for the \nestablishment of a new\
    \ generation of climate information systems?  \n \n \n \nGeneral introduction\n\
    Chapter 1\n17\n1.2 Climate information systems and adaptive governance in farming\
    \ \nsystems \nAdaptive governance has emerged in the last decade as a lens of\
    \ both theory \nand practice (Amelia, Paturusi, & Merit, 2019; Bedi, 2019; Brunner\
    \ & Lynch, \n2013; Sharma-Wallace, Velarde, & Wreford, 2018) for managing complex\
    \ \nenvironmental problems consequent to the recognition of failures of previous\
    \ \nmanagement regimes. In farming systems specifically, the increasing pressure\
    \ \nfrom dynamic environmental, political, social, and economic stressors has\
    \ \nnecessitated a shift from traditional government to a new form of governance\
    \ \nthat is adaptive to changing conditions (Pereira & Ruysenaar, 2012). Central\
    \ \nto adapting to such complex changes are information, knowledge, and \nlearning\
    \ shaped by practices along the pathway of change, involving \ninteraction between\
    \ actors at different levels of governance within food \nsystems. Significantly,\
    \ actionable knowledge for the adaptive governance of \nfood systems could be\
    \ improved through the use of emerging platform \ntechnologies in the form of\
    \ information systems where information is \ntransformed into knowledge through\
    \ informational processes, institutions, \nand practices (Cameron, Somachandra,\
    \ Curry, Jenner, & Hobbs, 2016; Evans, \nTerhorst, & Kang, 2017).  \n \nOne of\
    \ the key propositions regarding technology and adaptive governance \nthat has\
    \ gained traction is the subject of EVOs. Virtual observatories are not \na new\
    \ subject in our society. For example, the emergence of virtual \nobservatories\
    \ in the early 2000s in Europe and the Americas in astronomical \nsurveys led\
    \ to the formation of the International Virtual Observatory Alliance \n(IVOA)\
    \ in 2002 (Hanisch, 2014). However, global environmental change has \nprecipitated\
    \ experimentation with virtual observatories at different temporal \nscales. In\
    \ the context of current global challenges, discussions have shifted to \nhow\
    \ scientists and citizens can collaborate in managing complex problems \nsuch\
    \ as those experienced in farming systems (Gouveia, Fonseca, Camara, & \nFerreira,\
    \ 2004; Savan, Morgan, & Gore, 2003).  \n \nKarpouzoglou et al. (2016a) add to\
    \ this discussion with a further \nconceptualisation of EVOs. These authors indicate\
    \ that EVOs take the form \nof environmental sensor networks, knowledge and data\
    \ portals, or \nChapter 1\n18\nenvironmental data visualisation and monitoring\
    \ platforms. They highlight \nthe dominance of scientists in these systems, engaged\
    \ mostly in \nenvironmental modelling to maximise the use of new technologies\
    \ in the \ncharacterisation of natural systems. The authors conceptualise the\
    \ \naforementioned systems as first generation EVOs. For them, the emphasis \n\
    here is on scientific information collation and processing for a scientific \n\
    audience. However, they create a second category of EVOs, which they \nclassify\
    \ as second generation EVOs (see Figure 1.1). They indicate that these \nEVOs\
    \ concentrate on co-creation of knowledge via interaction between \nmultiple stakeholders\
    \ such as community-based environmental monitoring \nsystems. Thus, second generation\
    \ EVOs lean towards user-centred designs \nand networks (Athanasiadis & Mitkas,\
    \ 2004; Beven, Buytaert, & Smith, \n2012;Cieslik et al., 2018; Kimmins, Rempel,\
    \ Welham, Seely, & Van Rees, \n2007; Mancuso & Bustaffa, 2006; Stepenuck & Green,\
    \ 2015; Zulkafli et al., \n2017).  \n \n \nFigure 1.1: First and second generation\
    \ EVOs \n \nGeneral introduction\nChapter 1\n19\nIncreasingly, the interaction\
    \ between stakeholders enabled by second \ngeneration EVOs, including information\
    \ systems, is expected to improve the \nadaptive governance of social-ecological\
    \ systems (Folke, Hahn, Olsson, & \nNorberg, 2005; Pereira & Ruysenaar, 2012;\
    \ Karpouzoglou et al., 2016). The \nprocesses and mechanisms that underlie the\
    \ approach have been tested in \nmultiple contexts, informing a shift in framing\
    \ to comprise not only \nmanagement, but also social conditions (Armitage, Berkes,\
    \ & Doubleday, \n2010; Folke, 2007; Walker, Hollin, Carpenter, & Kinzig, 2004).\
    \ The thrust, \naccording to Folke et al. (2005), is that, following abrupt changes,\
    \ adaptive \ngovernance systems often self-organise and hence crises could be\
    \ \nopportunities to transform into a more desired state. To this end, second\
    \ \ngeneration EVOs can enable stakeholder collaborations and joint framing of\
    \ \ncrises to respond and adjust when needed.  \n \nIn the context of farming\
    \ systems, farmers and other stakeholders can \ncollaborate in dealing with social\
    \ and ecological shifts, with information \nsystems such as observatories enabling\
    \ self-organising through an \ninformation lens (Fridman & Lenters, 2013; Hipsey\
    \ et al., 2015). \nNevertheless, research must provide scientific evidence in\
    \ farming systems \nof how farmers adapt through decision-making to deal with\
    \ crises such as \nclimate change and how information systems contribute to this,\
    \ as shown in \nFigure 1.2 (Dutton, 2002; Vaughan & Dessai, 2014; Visbeck, 2008).\
    \ \nWilkinson et al. (2013) refer to a growing recognition that the involvement\
    \ of \nlocal communities in land and water management decisions has a multiplier\
    \ \neffect in the form of economic, social, and environmental benefits. They \n\
    indicate that cloud-based technologies such as EVOs can facilitate the process\
    \ \nof information exchange. The authors elaborate on how an Environmental \n\
    Virtual Observatory Pilot project (EVOp) was designed by the UK Natural \nEnvironment\
    \ Research Council as part of a proof of concept. The vision for \nsetting up\
    \ the EVO was to make environmental data visible and accessible to \na range of\
    \ potential users; to provide tools for data integration, greater access \nto\
    \ knowledge; and to develop new added-value knowledge. However, there \nis a need\
    \ to address urgent research gaps in first generation EVOs and what \nthese gaps\
    \ present for second generation EVOs, ranging from design to \napplication. For\
    \ example, what technologies should be considered? How \nChapter 1\n20\nshould\
    \ data be packaged as applicable information? How do we cross-fertilise \nknowledge?\
    \ \n \nMol (2006), borrowing from Castells (1996), points to a new informational\
    \ \nmode of environmental governance to which he refers as informational \ngovernance.\
    \ In differentiating informational governance from conventional \nmodes of environmental\
    \ governance, the author opines that informational \ngovernance refers to ‘the\
    \ idea that information (and informational processes, \ntechnologies, institutions,\
    \ and resources linked to it) is fundamentally \nrestructuring processes, institutions,\
    \ and practices of environmental \ngovernance’ (Mol, 2006, p. 5). Whereas conventional\
    \ environmental \ngovernance relies on authoritative resources and the power of\
    \ the state, in \ninformational \ngovernance, \ninformation \nbecomes \na \nresource\
    \ \nwith \ntransformative \npowers \nfor \nmultiple \nstakeholders \nand \nnetworks.\
    \ \nUnderstanding these transformative powers dovetails into establishing how\
    \ \nstakeholders make sense of information received. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ \n1.3.1 Conceptualising actionable knowledge  \nIn social-ecological systems,\
    \ information is expected to contribute to new \napplicable knowledge in dealing\
    \ with change. The term, actionable \nknowledge, has been used in multiple contexts\
    \ to signify knowledge that \ndrives people to act. Cross and Sproull (2004) define\
    \ actionable knowledge \nas knowledge that leads to immediate progress on a current\
    \ assignment or \nproject. Shipper et al. (2007), borrowing from Cummings and\
    \ Jones (2003), \ndefine actionable knowledge as knowledge that meets scientific\
    \ rigour and \nallows individuals to make informed choices about important practical\
    \ \nproblems and to implement solutions to them effectively. Geertsema et al.\
    \ \n(2016) use the term to depict knowledge that specifically supports stakeholder\
    \ \ndecision-making and consequent actions. Thus, there is an emphasis on \nactionable\
    \ knowledge being produced from an interactional process and a \nreference to\
    \ ultimate use in decision-making (Dewulf, Craps, Bouwen, Abril, \n& Zhingri,\
    \ 2005; Ingelgård, Roth, Styhre, & Shani, 2002; Meinke et al., 2006; \nNana, Asuming-Brempong,\
    \ & Nantui, 2013).  \n \nAs indicated, actionable knowledge has been interpreted\
    \ and measured \ndifferently in multiple contexts. In the domains of information\
    \ and knowledge \nresearch, reference is made not only to scientific knowledge\
    \ but also to \nindigenous knowledge systems (Kirchhoff, Lemos, & Dessai, 2013;\
    \ \nKoocheki, 2003; Warren & Cashman, 1988). In the context of this thesis, I\
    \ \nfocus on actionable knowledge creation in information systems in rice \nfarming.\
    \ The adoption of ICT-driven technologies has increased in food \nsystems in developing\
    \ countries such as Ghana, with interventions from both \nthe private and the\
    \ public sector. Interventions have leveraged the high \npenetration of mobile\
    \ phone technology in both urban and rural parts of the \ncountry. However, the\
    \ adoption of technology for information provision has \nnot necessarily translated\
    \ into gains in the form of new knowledge, especially \nat local scales for use\
    \ by farmers (Aker, 2011; Alemna & Sam, 2006; Conley \n& Udry, 2001). \n \nGeneral\
    \ introduction\nChapter 1\n23\nBorrowing from the work of Cash et al. (2003),\
    \ I argue that the interactional \nprocess of knowledge creation from information\
    \ involves an interplay of the \nfactors of salience, legitimacy, and credibility\
    \ within rice farming systems \n(see Figure 1.2). The authors refer to salience\
    \ as scientific information being \nmade responsive and context sensitive to decision-makers’\
    \ needs; credibility \nas information being accurate, of high quality, and scientifically\
    \ valid; and \nlegitimacy as the context of producing information through an open\
    \ and \nunbiased process.  \n \nHowever, given the prevalence of multiple knowledge\
    \ systems in rice \nfarming systems in Northern Ghana, it also needs to be established\
    \ how not \nonly scientific but also indigenous knowledge comes into play in actionable\
    \ \nknowledge creation, although Cash et al. (2003) focus on scientific \nknowledge.\
    \ What is actionable could also be context specific, as confirmed \nby Dewulf\
    \ et al. (2005), whereby knowledge is embedded in communities of \npractice following\
    \ an interwoven process involving both explicit and tacit \nknowledge. I estimate\
    \ how EVOs can contribute to actionable knowledge \ncreation by drawing on how\
    \ current information systems in rice farming \nsystems enable actionable knowledge\
    \ creation. I define actionable knowledge \nas indigenous and scientific knowledge\
    \ that is locally relevant, trustworthy, \nand produced in a fair, transparent\
    \ way. I define salience as locally relevant, \ntimely, and relatable scientific\
    \ and indigenous knowledge; credibility as \nknowledge that is trustworthy and\
    \ can be based on scientific evidence or trust \nin the experience (indigenous\
    \ knowledge) of fellow farmers; and legitimacy \nas scientific and indigenous\
    \ knowledge produced in a fair, balanced, and \ntransparent way. \n \n1.3.2 Conceptualising\
    \ adaptive decision-making  \nDecision-making in farming systems is shrouded in\
    \ uncertainty about \nnumerous conditions, including seasonal and weather variability.\
    \ In the trio-\nchord of information provision, knowledge creation, and decision-making,\
    \ \nreference is made to the complexities at the point of decision-making that\
    \ can \nbe attributable to the lack of complete information of future events and\
    \ \ndivergent frames in other contexts (Clements, Haggar, Quezada, & Torres, \n\
    2011; Howden et al., 2007; Meinke & Stone, 2005; Risbey, Kandlikar, \nChapter\
    \ 1\n24\nDowlatabadi, & Graetz, 1999). One key concept is that of adaptive decision-\n\
    making. Decision-making theories have been characterised by a shift in \nperspective\
    \ from structuralist to constructivist views with reference to \nuncertainty,\
    \ and hence decision-makers can be rational only to the degree of \nchoice framing\
    \ underpinned by information and knowledge of events \n(Gigerenzer & Selten, 2002;\
    \ Simon, 1972). The adaptive decision-maker is \n‘methodological, systematic,\
    \ independent and unimpulsive throughout the \ndecision-making’ (Phillips, 1997,\
    \ p. 276), but this still might not result in \nutility maximisation due to ‘ignorance,\
    \ obtuseness, or deviousness’ (March, \n1978, p. 598), and hence decision-makers\
    \ are boundedly rational, as argued \nby Simon (1972).  \n \nThe dissertation\
    \ adds to the discussion with a focus on two logics of decision-\nmaking (the\
    \ logic of consequentiality and the logic of appropriateness) \npropounded in\
    \ rational theories pioneered by March and Olsen (1976). The \nlogic of consequentiality\
    \ connotes the idea that decision-makers have a \nknowledge of alternatives available\
    \ and consequences or outcomes of \nalternatives, and follow a rule whereby they\
    \ select one alternative on the basis \nof its consequences and act accordingly\
    \ to maximise their benefits \n(Edmondson & Moingeon, 1998; March & Olsen, 1976;\
    \ Nalbandov, 2009; \nOstrom, 1991). Contrastingly, the logic of appropriateness\
    \ perceives human \naction and decision-making as driven by rules of appropriate\
    \ behaviour, \norganised into institutions. The urge is to follow what is socially\
    \ defined as \ntrue or right in spite of consequences and expected utility. Key\
    \ questions \nposed by the decision-maker include: What are the decision options?\
    \ What \nare my preferences? What are the consequences of the different options\
    \ for \nmy preferences? Which option has the most favourable consequence? \n \n\
    I conceptualise farmer decision-making with reference to adaptive decision-\n\
    making whilst drawing on both logics indicated above. Adaptive decision-\nmaking\
    \ refers to non-standard decision-making in response to change \n(Hogan, Berry,\
    \ Ng, & Bode, 2011; Lal, Lim-Applegate, & Scoccimarro, \n2002). I also draw on\
    \ two forms of uncertainty in decision-making: \nsubstantive and institutional\
    \ uncertainty. Substantive uncertainty has to do \nwith gaps and conflicting understandings\
    \ in knowledge, with the consequence \nGeneral introduction\nChapter 1\n25\nthat\
    \ there is limited understanding of the nature of a problem (Head, 2014). \nInstitutional\
    \ uncertainty connotes uncertainty about the rules of the game in \ndecision-making\
    \ and how they transform (Koppenjan & Klijn, 2004). I argue \nfor a relationship\
    \ between decision logics and forms of uncertainty faced by \nfarmers and adaptive\
    \ decision-making in rice farming systems, as shown in \nFigure 1.2. Adaptive\
    \ decision-making by farmers could be underpinned by \neither of the logics (Stuart,\
    \ Schewe, & McDermott, 2014; Willock et al., \n1999; Wilson, Hooker, Tucker, LeJeune,\
    \ & Doohan, 2009).  \n \n1.4 Research questions \nFrom the problem analysis in\
    \ section 1.1, I pose the key question: How do \nexisting information systems\
    \ contribute to actionable knowledge creation for \ndecision-making in rice farming\
    \ systems and what does this mean for the \nestablishment of a new generation\
    \ of climate information systems? \n \nIn pursuance of the above, I investigate\
    \ three key research questions: \n \nRQ 1: What principles could guide the design\
    \ and operationalisation of \nclimate information systems in rice farming systems\
    \ in Northern Ghana? \nAs an entry point, it is essential to reflect on key conceptualisations\
    \ that exist \nin the literature on how climate information systems could be designed\
    \ and \noperationalised. This involves combining both empirical evidence and \n\
    theoretical dispositions to ensure the leverage of opportunities and \nlimitations,\
    \ be they technical or social. To this end, the question also leads to \na possible\
    \ framework for a climate information system that could be \noperationalised in\
    \ Ghana.  \nRQ 2: How do governance arrangements influence farmer adaptive decision-\n\
    making given uncertainty and information needs? \nThis question seeks to establish\
    \ empirically the rules, processes, and \nstructures that exist in rice farming\
    \ systems and how these inform adaptive \ndecisions taken by farmers at farm level.\
    \ Conceptually, addressing the \nquestion informs how change within these rules\
    \ contributes to interpreting the \ndifferent forms of uncertainties and farmers’\
    \ adaptive decisions. It involves \nChapter 1\n26\nestablishing the decision-making\
    \ logics that serve to underpin farmers’ \ndecisions in adapting to change in\
    \ the presence of uncertainties. The question \nalso attempts to address farmer\
    \ information needs in a new breed of climate \ninformation systems.  \n \nRQ\
    \ 3: How do existing information systems enable actionable knowledge \ncreation\
    \ and what information could improve decision-making in rice \nfarming systems?\
    \ \nAs a functional climate information system is anticipated to contribute to\
    \ \nactionable knowledge creation, this research question explores existing \n\
    information systems and the degree to which they enable actionable \nknowledge\
    \ creation and what second generation climate information systems \ncould do differently.\
    \ The question also contributes to the conceptualisation of \nactionable knowledge\
    \ by inquiring into the components of knowledge that \ndrive action in rice farming\
    \ systems. Furthermore, through the lens of second \ngeneration information systems,\
    \ the study aims to investigate what a \nfunctional climate information system\
    \ could do differently to improve \nactionable knowledge creation and farmer adaptive\
    \ decision-making.  \n \n1.5 Methodological approach \nInterdisciplinary studies\
    \ involving both social and natural sciences in \ninvestigating current global\
    \ challenges have become necessary because of the \ncomplex nature of today’s\
    \ problems (Diaz, Aguirre, & Rodriguez, 2004). \nTobi and Kampen (2018) in their\
    \ work to develop a methodological \nframework for interdisciplinary research\
    \ are quick to make reference to \nvarious factors – such as the differences in\
    \ epistemologies, skills, and \ncompetency of scientists, institutional contexts,\
    \ and the design of \ncollaboration structures – as success or failure factors.\
    \ This, however, does \nnot invalidate the understanding that interdisciplinary\
    \ studies provide the \navenue for adopting multiple lenses to investigate most\
    \ phenomena. Schary \nand Cardinal (2015) reiterate that interdisciplinary research\
    \ is a synthesis of \nconcepts, models, and/or theoretical frameworks from two\
    \ or more distinct \nacademic disciplines. Adopting an interdisciplinary approach\
    \ to research \nallows for the innovation and creativity deemed necessary in recent\
    \ literature \n(Bromham, Dinnage, & Hua, 2016; Khan, Choudhury, & Uddin, 2019).\
    \ In \nGeneral introduction\nChapter 1\n27\nwater management (sometimes classified\
    \ as a boundary concept) research, we \nsee a new crop of interdisciplinary researchers\
    \ and methodologies being \nadopted (Levinson & Thornton, 2003; Mollinga, 2008).\
    \  \n \nI adopted an interdisciplinary approach to understand both technical and\
    \ \nsocial dimensions of the climate–water–food problem. To do this, I \ncollaborated\
    \ with another PhD candidate at some points along the research \nprocess and worked\
    \ with an interdisciplinary supervisory team sharing \nknowledge from diagnosis\
    \ of the research problem, empirical studies, and \nscientific writing on research\
    \ findings (Benton, 2013). Largely, the EVOCA \nproject revolved around an interdisciplinary\
    \ framework composed of PhD \nsupervisory teams and PhD candidate selection for\
    \ each case study.  \n \n1.5.1 Research design: qualitative case study \nQualitative\
    \ studies are useful to the extent that they allow for understanding \nthe meaning\
    \ of situations and contexts and the identification of new \nunanticipated phenomena,\
    \ processes, and – to a degree – explanations for \ncausality whilst engaging\
    \ with a small number of people (Lambert & \nLambert, 2012; Maxwell, 2008). Investigating\
    \ the ‘why’ and ‘what’ of water \nmanagement in food systems invites the use of\
    \ qualitative research designs \nsuch as a case study in interdisciplinary research,\
    \ to understand processes and \nmeaning rather than measuring in terms of quantity\
    \ or frequency (Dewulf, \nFrancois, Pahl-Wostl, & Taillieu, 2007; Thomas, 2011).\
    \ A case study is an \nempirical inquiry that investigates a contemporary phenomenon\
    \ within its \nreal-life context using multiple sources of evidence (Yin, 2003).\
    \ Two \ncommon case study approaches are found in qualitative research: a social\
    \ \nconstructivist approach informed by the works of Stake (2008) and Merriam\
    \ \n(2009); and a post-positivist viewpoint seen in the works of Eisenhardt \n\
    (1989), Flyvberg (2011), and Yin (2003). As a study design, a case study is \n\
    defined by an interest in individual cases rather than in the inquiry methods\
    \ \nused (Hyett, Kenny, & Dickson-Swift, 2014).  \n \nThis dissertation leans\
    \ towards a social constructivist approach, with \ninductive interpretation of\
    \ data, as described by Walsham (1995) in his study \non the use of computer-based\
    \ information systems. Walsham, with reference \nChapter 1\n28\nto what Giddens\
    \ (1984) described as a ‘double hermeneutic’, indicates that \nresearchers could\
    \ influence those being researched when in-depth case \nstudies are carried out\
    \ over a long period of time. However, the process also \nbuilds trust and enables\
    \ frankness in responses from those engaged in the \nfield. We see the emergence\
    \ of qualitative approaches in investigating \ntechnology adoption and use in\
    \ agriculture systems in the works of Mackrell \net al. (2009) and Doss (2001).\
    \ Using a qualitative case study design, I studied \nthe context over a long period\
    \ of observations in the field. Spending time with \nfarmers directly in the district\
    \ over three different cropping seasons increased \ncommunity acceptance and the\
    \ willingness of stakeholders to engage, as I \nbecame not just an observer but\
    \ also a participant in the system. The approach \nafforded me the opportunity\
    \ to establish deeper meaning through \nobservations and continuous daily interaction\
    \ with farmers, water managers, \nand community leaders. Ultimately, the point\
    \ of co-producing a design and \ncontent concept for a second generation climate\
    \ information system emerged \nfrom a cumulative joint process of diagnostics\
    \ of context through the lens not \njust of the researcher, but also of those\
    \ been researched.  \n \n1.5.2 Data collection and analysis \nIn this dissertation,\
    \ I use mixed methods to gather relevant data from within \nboth rainfed and irrigated\
    \ rice farming systems. Case study research designs \nallow for flexibility in\
    \ methods dependent on research questions to be \naddressed at each point. The\
    \ use of mixed methods permits the information \nfrom one method to throw light\
    \ on the interpretation of findings from other \nmethods (Dattilio, Edwards, &\
    \ Fishman, 2010). I employed qualitative data \ncollection methods including focus\
    \ group discussions (FGDs), interviews, \nand observations to address RQs 1, 2,\
    \ and 3. \n \nTo address RQ 1, I used interviewed guides in engaging farmers and\
    \ \nstakeholders involved in agriculture information provision to answer design\
    \ \nquestions as part of an ex-ante assessment. I also organized FGDs with \n\
    farmers in selected communities within the district for insight into technology\
    \ \nuse and an overview of social constructions. To answer RQ 2, I engaged rice\
    \ \nfarmers in communities first via direct interviews using interview guides\
    \ to \nestablish how governance arrangements inform decision-making in adapting\
    \ \nGeneral introduction\nChapter 1\n29\nto change, be it social or bio-physical,\
    \ and I also organized FGD sessions for \nin-depth deliberations to support findings\
    \ from individual interviews. I also \nobserved farmers’ practices within communities.\
    \ For RQ 3, farmers and \ninformation service providers were also engaged exploratorily\
    \ through FGDs \nand direct interviews. However, I additionally adopted a quasi-experimental\
    \ \napproach (scenario workshops) to answer RQ 3 by simultaneously varying \n\
    information parameters relevant for farmers in a climate information system \n\
    in the spirit of testing a model of a functional system. The data in Chapters\
    \ 2 \nto 5 were analysed by content (Hsieh & Shannon, 2005; Krippendorff, 2018)\
    \ \nand theme (Nowell et al., 2017). The specific application of these \nmethodologies\
    \ in data collection and analysis can be found within the \nchapters. This is\
    \ summarised in Table 1.1. \n \n Table 1.1: Research methodology and tools \n\

    \ in Northern Ghana, with Kumbungu as its capital, was \ncarved out of the Tolon-Kumbungu\
    \ District in 2012 with Legislative \nInstrument (L.I) 2062. The district shares\
    \ a boundary with Tamale Metropolis \nto the South, West Mamprusi and West Gonja\
    \ to the North, Savelugu/Nanton \nmunicipality to the East, and Tolon district\
    \ to the West, respectively. Figure \n1.3 shows the district in a regional context.\
    \ The district lies between latitudes \n9015` and 10002` North and longitudes\
    \ 0053`and 1025` West. The vegetative \ncover is Guinea savannah interspersed\
    \ with short drought-resistant trees and \ngrassland (Asare-Bediako, Showemimo,\
    \ Buah, & Ushawu, 2007). As at 2010, \nthe population and housing census report\
    \ indicates that the district had a \npopulation of 56,166, with an even composition\
    \ of both males and females in \npercentage terms. \n \nThe district is drained\
    \ by the White Volta and other water bodies including \nthe Bontansi river. Rains\
    \ in the district begin in May and end in the latter part \nof October, with July\
    \ to September as peak periods. Average annual rainfall \nwithin the district\
    \ is 1000mm. The temperature is warm, especially between \nFebruary and April.\
    \ Soils are of sandy loam with a few alluvial deposits in \nthe district’s lowlands.\
    \ Soil erosion and the perennial bush burning of \nvegetation leaves soils exposed\
    \ to high temperatures, destroying soil fauna. \nThe district is agrarian, with\
    \ most inhabitants engaged in crop production and \nanimal rearing. Major crops\
    \ cultivated include rice, yams, maize, beans, \ngroundnuts, tomatoes, peppers,\
    \ and green leafy vegetables. A few residents \nare also involved in fishing on\
    \ the White Volta (Alhassan et al., 2013). \n \nGeneral introduction\nChapter\

    \ \nThe district is home to one of the major irrigation schemes in the Northern\
    \ \nRegion. The Bontanga Irrigation Scheme was set up between 1978 and 1983 \n\
    (Zakaria et al., 2013). The scheme’s water source is the Bontanga River, a \n\
    tributary of the White Volta. The scheme has a potential cover area of 800 \n\
    hectares, with 450 hectares of irrigable land covered as at 2014. Of the total\
    \ \nland area, 240 hectares are used for lowland rice cultivation and 210 hectares\
    \ \nfor upland vegetable production (Braimah, King, & Sulemana, 2014; \nKuwornu\
    \ & Owusu, 2012). \n \nThe dissertation focuses on Kumbungu District and specifically\
    \ on \ncommunities in the vicinity of the Bontanga Irrigation Scheme – as it offers\
    \ \nthe opportunity to investigate water management complexities within both \n\
    irrigated and rainfed farming systems. Secondly, the district offers an avenue\
    \ \nto augment research on technology adoption by diverse farmers in Northern\
    \ \nGhana (Azumah, Donkoh, & Awuni, 2018; Nchanji, Müller, Günther, Schritt, \n\

    1.6 Structure of the thesis \nThis dissertation is comprised of seven chapters\
    \ including this introductory \nchapter. Chapter 2 sets the tone for the exploratory\
    \ study towards designing \na second generation climate information system by\
    \ providing in-depth \nfindings on design compositions of existing information\
    \ systems in the study \narea. The chapter also provides insight into bio-physical\
    \ conditions in the \nstudy area. Chapter 3 presents in-depth findings on governance\
    \ arrangements \nand decision-making by rice farmers both within and outside the\

    \ \nits conceptualisation. This is critical in addressing research gaps on what\

    \ agricultural \nproductivity under climate variability. Recent developments in\
    \ information \nsharing platforms (Environmental Virtual Observatories, EVOs)\
    \ could make \ninformation provisioning more actionable. Here we present the results\
    \ of a \ndiagnostic study for the development of a hydro-climatic EVO that enables\
    \ \nrice farmers in Northern Ghana to deal with climate variability and water\
    \ \nshortage. The hydro-climatic EVO aims to combine data from scientific and\
    \ \nindigenous forecast systems, facilitating information exchange using two-\n\
    way interaction with stakeholders to co-produce knowledge. Data was \ncollected\
    \ through informal interviews with field practitioners, through focus \ngroup\
    \ discussions with farmers and content analysis of documents. Results \nshow that\
    \ both the biophysical and socio-institutional circumstances need be \ntaken into\
    \ account for the development of the EVO. Existing governance and \ninformation\
    \ exchange arrangements and lack of collaboration between actors \nwere found\
    \ to limit current hydro-climatic information flow, interpretation, \nand use.\
    \ Our study reveals existing models of information exchange and their \nlimitations\
    \ in the study area. We discuss the proposed design of a hydro-\nclimatic EVO\
    \ from a responsible innovation perspective, considering \npossible future eventualities\
    \ in a process that aims to be anticipatory, \ninclusive, reflexive and responsive.\
    \ We conclude that such a hydro-climatic \nEVO has a potential to contribute to\
    \ rice farmers’ adaptive decision-making \nin Northern Ghana, but there are challenges\
    \ that need to be considered. The \ndiagnostic study has helped to refine these\
    \ challenges and offers concrete \nsuggestions to improve both the design and\
    \ implementation of the proposed \nplatform in a responsible way. \n \n \n \n\

    \ the potential of hydro-climatic information Systems\nChapter 2\n37\n2.1 Introduction\
    \ \nDue to increased anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions the global \ntemperatures\
    \ are rising with a change in global water cycle resulting in more \nerratic precipitation\
    \ patterns. Consequently, both soil and surface water \navailability is becoming\
    \ less reliable. This increased climate variability is \naffecting smallholder\
    \ farmers in sub-Saharan Africa. Currently more than 600 \nmillion people in rural\
    \ communities in sub-Saharan Africa depend on \nagriculture for their livelihoods\
    \ (Rockström & Falkenmark, 2015). Many \nfarmers are struggling to cope with challenging\
    \ conditions, which result in \nlow yields and food insecurity (Di Falco, Veronesi,\
    \ & Yesuf, 2011). One of \nthe main problems for food production in Africa is\
    \ large-scale climate \nvariability. Both inter-annual and seasonal rainfall variability\
    \ are a challenge \nfor farming decision-making in Sub- Saharan Africa. Future\
    \ climate change \ncaused by increased greenhouse gas emissions are likely to\
    \ result in changing \nrainfall patterns. \n \nSimilar to other countries within\
    \ Guinea and Sudan Savanna agroecological \nzones, Ghana is vulnerable to climate\
    \ variability and change (Africa \nPartnership Forum, 2007). The agricultural\
    \ sector depends heavily on rainfall \nthat varies annually and seasonally. This\
    \ significantly affects soil water \navailability for crops and increases the\
    \ risks for low crop production and \nfailure (Kunstmann & Jung, 2005; Asante\
    \ & Amuakwa-Mensah, 2015). \nMeanwhile the agriculture sector is very important\
    \ for the economy of Ghana, \nemploying 44% of the work-force and accounts for\
    \ nearly one-quarter of \nGDP. The degree of community vulnerability and crop\
    \ failure is greatest in \nits three northern regions, namely Upper East, Upper\
    \ West, and the Northern \nregion. Farmers in these regions are faced with many\
    \ uncertainties prior to \nevery growing season, most of which are attributed\
    \ to water and climate \nvariability (Gbetibouo, 2009). \n \nDue to increasing\
    \ climate variability farmers struggle about decisions such as \nseed variety\
    \ to plant, when to plant, when to fertilize, when to do \nsupplementary irrigation\
    \ and sometimes when to harvest. According to \nNdamani and Watanabe (2014), a\
    \ farmer usually starts to make preparations \nfor planting crops with the onset\
    \ of the rainy season. After months of drought, \nChapter 2\n38\nthe soil is dry\
    \ and hard. In the month of May, the farmer starts to look into \nthe sky every\
    \ day expecting the first rain clouds to appear, which would \nindicate the beginning\
    \ of the major production season. When the rain finally \ncomes, the farmer starts\
    \ to plough his land and plants his crops. But his mind \nis filled with worry.\
    \ How much rain will there be this year? Will there be \nanother dry spell shortly\
    \ after the first rain, which could destroy the \nseedlings? Would it be better\
    \ to wait and start seeding later? He recalls, \nhowever, that two years ago,\
    \ there was no dry period in May and a heavy rain \nwashed away the seeds that\
    \ he had planted too late. \n \nFinding solution to these dilemmas of a typical\
    \ farmer is vital and urgent. \nSeveral studies have predicted the future climate\
    \ of Ghana to be more variable \nand uncertain, making the agriculture sector\
    \ more vulnerable (Kankam-\nYeboah, Obuobie, Amisigo, & Opoku-Ankomah, 2013; Obuobie,\
    \ Kankam-\nYeboah, Amisigo, Opoku-Ankomah, & Ofori, 2012). Recent progress in\
    \ \nclimate modelling has increased the ability to predict rainfall from a few\
    \ days \nto seasonal forecasts (Njau, 2010). Being able to predict the weather\
    \ and \nclimate especially rainfall is indispensable for guiding water users,\
    \ especially \nfarmers in their planning and decision making (Logah, Obuobie,\
    \ Ofori, & \nKankam-Yeboah, 2013). Empirical studies have shown that climate forecasts\
    \ \ncan help farmers reduce their vulnerability to drought and climate extremes,\
    \ \nwhile also allowing them to maximize opportunities when favourable \nconditions\
    \ are predicted (Patt, Suarez, & Gwata, 2005; Phillips, Makaudze, \n& Unganai,\
    \ 2001; Roncoli et al., 2009).  \n \nThe underlying assumption in the current\
    \ practices of hydro-climatic \ninformation services is that if we provide the\
    \ farmer with more and better \ninformation, they would be able to improve their\
    \ farming practices (Etwire et \nal., 2017; Anoop, Ajjan, & Ashok, 2015; Okello,\
    \ Kirui, Njiraini, & Gitonga, \n2012). This one-directional model of providing\
    \ climate services has shown to \nbe flawed, as farmers tend not to trust scientific\
    \ information and experience \ndifficulties in interpreting and using it. They\
    \ are therefore confident that their \nindigenous systems work better (Hartmann,\
    \ Bales, & Sorooshian, 1999; \nLetson et al., 2001; McNew, Mapp, Duchon, & Merritt,\
    \ 1991). Efforts to train \nfarmers to adopt this model of providing climate services\
    \ generally fail to \nDiagnosing the potential of hydro-climatic information Systems\n\
    Chapter 2\n39\nimprove the uptake of climate information (Manyanhaire, 2015; Patt\
    \ & \nGwata, 2002), because providers also have little understanding of users,\
    \ and \nwhat drives the influence of indigenous forecasts (Artikov et al., 2006).\
    \ \n \nWe however argue that science should not be a one directional effort, where\
    \ \nscience produces new knowledge and information and makes it accessible for\
    \ \nend-users. Instead, the process should be interactive, where science and \n\
    practice co-design, co-create and co-produce knowledge by bringing in \ndifferent\
    \ forms of expertise. The latter would result in better appreciation of \nthe\
    \ scientific expertise as well as indigenous knowledge necessary to improve \n\
    societal resilience to climate change (Hiwasaki, Luna, Syamsidik, & Shaw, \n2014;\
    \ Hiwasaki, Luna, Syamsidik, & Marcal, 2015; Mazzocchi, 2006). \nIncreasingly\
    \ there are calls for involving farmers not only as end-user, but as \nan active\
    \ participant who is not only involved in use of the information, but \nalso in\
    \ the creation of it. \n \nEnvironmental Virtual Observatories (EVOs) aim to enable\
    \ cross-fertilization \nof different sources of environmental knowledge on web\
    \ based virtual \nplatforms, incorporating information gathering, processing and\
    \ dissemination \ntechnologies (Karpouzoglou et al., 2016a). The first generations\
    \ of these \nsystems aimed to support the scientific process of knowledge creation\
    \ and \nmainly targeted scientific audiences. They failed to deliver a strong\
    \ \nknowledge creation component especially in information generation and \ndissemination\
    \ projects that seek to empower local communities to manage \ntheir environmental\
    \ change using actionable knowledge (Dewulf et al., 2005). \nHence, several authors\
    \ have proposed second generation EVOs that \nemphasize knowledge cocreation between\
    \ scientists and societal actors, and \nbidirectional information flows, so as\
    \ to create actionable knowledge that can \nsupport decision-making (Karpouzoglou\
    \ et al., 2016a). However, these \nsystems are place based and context sensitive,\
    \ requiring a thorough \nunderstanding of the potential to uptake co-develop,\
    \ co-produce and co-\nimplement such hydro-climatic information systems. \n \n\
    As part of a larger endeavour, we aim to design a “second generation” \ninformation\
    \ system in the form of a hydro-climatic information system called \nChapter 2\n\
    40\na hydro-climatic Environmental Virtual Observatory. This system will use \n\
    data from the scientific seasonal climate forecast ECMWF-4 (European \nCentre\
    \ \nfor \nMedium-Range \nWeather \nForecasts-system \n4) \nmodel, \ncomplemented\
    \ with farmers indigenous forecast collected through citizen \nscience (Pettibone\
    \ et al., 2016) to generate actionable knowledge for adaptive \ndecision making\
    \ in rice farming systems. Karpouzoglou et al. (2016) indicate \nthat in the context\
    \ of emerging open-technologies for information exchange, \nadded value can be\
    \ achieved by removing institutional and geographical \nbarriers associated with\
    \ information flow. \n \nIn this paper we aim to diagnose the socio-ecological\
    \ settings of rice farming \nsystems in northern Ghana in the context of climate\
    \ variability and change to \nensure effective design and operationalisation of\
    \ hydroclimatic EVO. We first \nconduct a diagnosis of the socio-ecological settings\
    \ of rice production system \nin Northern Ghana in the context of climate variability\
    \ and change. In the next \nstep, we elaborate the diagnostics by focused on hydro-climatic\
    \ information \nneeds and use in rice based farming systems. Based on these diagnostic\
    \ steps, \nwe identify the specific challenges and opportunities identified in\
    \ our case \nregion, which could be meaningfully addressed by a potential EVO.\
    \ We used \nthe four dimensions of Responsible Innovation to reflect on the robustness\
    \ of \nthe design and processes of hydro-climatic EVO to deal with the challenges\
    \ \nand opportunities faced in a responsible way. The outcome of our study is\
    \ a \nframework for the hydro-climatic EVO outlining its properties and processes.\
    \ \n \n2.2 Conceptual framework \nStudies show that crop management strategies\
    \ of farmers (e.g. timing of \nplanting, weeding, fertilizing, application of\
    \ pesticides) are shaped by \npredictive weather/climate information. Traditionally\
    \ farmers make use of \nindigenous knowledge to produce seasonal and weather forecast\
    \ (Svotwa, \nManyanhaire, & Makanyire, 2007). Traditional Ecological Knowledge\
    \ \n(TEK) is known by a wide variety of terms, including indigenous knowledge\
    \ \n(IK), local knowledge (LK) and traditional knowledge (TK). It has many \n\
    definitions and there is no consensus on an operational definition applicable\
    \ \nacross disciplines. Huntington et al. (2004, p. 1270) for example, understand\
    \ \nTEK as ‘…the knowledge and insights acquired through extensive \nDiagnosing\
    \ the potential of hydro-climatic information Systems\nChapter 2\n41\nobservations\
    \ of an area or species’. In contrast, Berkes et al. (1994) in an \nattempt to\
    \ more fully incorporate indigenous world views, broadens the scope \nof TEK and\
    \ define it as ‘…a cumulative body of knowledge, practice, and \nbelief, evolving\
    \ by adaptive processes and handed down through generations \nby cultural transmission,\
    \ about the relationship of living beings (including \nhumans) with one another\
    \ and with their environment (Berkes et al., 1994, \np.7). In the context of this\
    \ study, emphasis is placed on “indigenous”, which \nis defined as native or local\
    \ knowledge that is passed on from generation to \ngeneration. Indigenous forecasts\
    \ are based on farmers’ experience of changes \nin certain biophysical indicators\
    \ (Orlove, Roncoli, Kabugo, & Majugu, 2010; \nRoncoli, Ingram, & Kirshen, 2002).\
    \ Literature shows that African farmers are \nusing various local weather indicators\
    \ such as plants, animals, insects, the \nsolar system and wind in predicting\
    \ the weather and climate (Speranza, \nKiteme, Ambenje, Wiesmann, & Makali, 2010;\
    \ Ziervogel & Opere, 2010; \nTarhule & Lamb, 2003; Roncoli et al., 2002). Studies\
    \ have therefore \nsuggested that particularly in Africa indigenous knowledge\
    \ has the potential \nto enhance farmers’ adaptation to climate variability and\
    \ change (Naess, \n2013; Derbile, Jarawura, & Dombo, 2016; Mikkelsen & Langohr,\
    \ 2004). \nHowever, it is plausible that indigenous knowledge is not sufficient\
    \ anymore \nbecause of projected climate change. \n \nIncreasingly, scientific\
    \ projections are developed to further inform farmers \nabout short, medium and\
    \ long-term climate variability and change, \nparticularly for rainfall. It is\
    \ important, however, to acknowledge that weather \nand climate forecast systems\
    \ have limited value unless they can directly \ninfluence decisions and have an\
    \ impact on the systems under consideration \n(Hammer, 2000). Manyanhaire (2015)\
    \ argue for the integration of indigenous \nknowledge systems with climate change\
    \ science as a basis for comprehensive \ncommunity based response to the impacts\
    \ of climate change. It is argued that \nfarmers are more likely to adopt new\
    \ ideas when these can be seen in the \ncontext of their existing practices. Patt\
    \ and Gwata (2002) for example \nobserved that farmers’ willingness to use seasonal\
    \ climate forecasts increased \nwhen the forecasts presented are combined and\
    \ compared with local \nindigenous forecasts. \n \nChapter 2\n42\nAs indicated\
    \ in the introduction, creating conditions that allow for knowledge \nexchange\
    \ between scientists, decision-makers and citizens is becoming \nincreasingly\
    \ necessary for building resilience and responding to \nenvironmental change (Mol,\
    \ 2006; Buytaert et al., 2014; Folke et al., 2010). \nThe concept of Environmental\
    \ Virtual Observatories (EVOs) offers the \nopportunity to bring together scientific\
    \ and indigenous knowledge \n(Karpouzoglou et al., 2016a). Examples of first generation\
    \ of these EVOs are \nfor communicating flood risk to catchment stakeholders and\
    \ a cloud \ntechnology for connecting and integrating fragmented data, models,\
    \ and tools \nto deliver new holistic approaches to environmental challenges (Emmett\
    \ et \nal., 2014). They have paid less emphasis on how enhanced participation\
    \ of a \nvariety of users can be achieved via a virtual platform. In many cases,\
    \ projects \nthat seek to generate and disseminate information that provides actionable\
    \ \nknowledge for empowering local communities and enhancing environmental \n\
    management for example have achieved limited success (Dewulf et al., 2005). \n\
    \ \nDespite considerable progress in recent years, many cases exist where \nknowledge\
    \ and perspectives of certain groups of people are either not \nincluded or under\
    \ represented (Karpouzoglou et al., 2016). This is particularly \nchallenging\
    \ for EVOs that exist on the interface between scientists and non-\nexpert users.\
    \ Similarly, most of the first generation EVO’s are developed and \ncommunicated,\
    \ using mostly top-down approaches. For example, local \nfarmers are considered\
    \ as end-users of forecast products developed by \nscientist from universities\
    \ and/ or research institutions. In most cases, farmers \ndo not contribute to\
    \ the process of developing the weather climate forecast \nproducts (Ouédraogo,\
    \ Zougmoré, Barry, Somé, & Grégoire, 2015). As a \nresult, the communicated forecasts\
    \ are often not locally specific or applicable \nand therefore contribute to limited\
    \ action. Second generation EVOs seek to \nresolve this problem by enhancing participation\
    \ of all relevant stakeholders. \n \nWhile first generation EVOs are primed for\
    \ scientists, second generation \nEVOs have a benefit to include knowledge co-creation\
    \ and resilience through \ntheir participatory design. Second generation EVOs\
    \ such as those proposed \nby Karpouzoglou et al. (2016a) have a greater focus\
    \ on the processes of \nknowledge co-creation and interaction between stakeholders.\
    \ An important \nDiagnosing the potential of hydro-climatic information Systems\n\
    Chapter 2\n43\naspect of this knowledge co-creation EVO is its potential to achieve\
    \ greater \nrelevance by engaging with stakeholders. In some cases, citizen become\
    \ \nactive contributors to science (Buytaert et al., 2014) and EVO’s offer the\
    \ \npossibility to connect scientist and local farmers via a virtual platform\
    \ where \ninformation is exchanged and knowledge created to support farm decision-\n\
    making. Active engagement of farmers can range from short-term collection \nof\
    \ data to intensive engagement in creating new knowledge with scientists \nand/or\
    \ other volunteers (Pettibone et al., 2016). \n \nIntroducing new innovations\
    \ such as EVO’s should be undertaken \nresponsibly, especially when directed at\
    \ socially desirable and socially \nacceptable ends (Owen, Bessant, & Heintz,\
    \ 2013). Designing these EVOs \nresponsibly means acknowledging that such frameworks\
    \ are not only \ntechnical but are also socially and politically constituted (Winner,\
    \ 1978). \nInnovative technologies that underlie EVO’s might have great benefits\
    \ for \nsociety, but unforeseen impacts are not just possible but probable. To\
    \ guide \nthe design and evaluation of our EVO, we build onto the responsible\
    \ \ninnovation concept. We make use of the responsible innovation (RI) \nframework\
    \ of Stilgoe et al. (2013) which provides a set of basic principles \nthat seek\
    \ to maintain novelty and at the same time make it responsible: \nanticipation,\
    \ reflexivity, inclusion, and responsiveness. Anticipation requires \nthat researchers\
    \ and organizations continuously ask ‘what if?’ questions, \nwhich include but\
    \ not limited to what are the likely consequences? What are \npossible unintended\
    \ effects? It requires projection and futuristic thinking in a \nsystematic way\
    \ and consideration of how the EVO is predictable and resilient \nto change. \n\
    \ \nFor example, it provides early warnings of future unfavourable consequences\
    \ \nand estimate risk-based harm of innovations (Hoffmann-Riem & Wynne, \n2002).\
    \ The second dimension, reflexivity, refers to the principle that \ninstitutions\
    \ and organizations must reflect on their activities and assumptions \nand acknowledge\
    \ that the knowledge they produce and use has limitations. \nHow they frame issues\
    \ may not be universally applicable and without \nreflexivity may lead to frame\
    \ conflicts or unresponsiveness of stakeholders \n(Stilgoe, Owen, & Macnaghten,\
    \ 2013; Wynne, 1993). The third dimension, \nChapter 2\n44\ninclusion, refers\
    \ to the need to involve minorities and groups without a voice \nin the innovation\
    \ process (Hajer, 2009; Felt, 2009; Stilgoe et al., 2013). \nWhereas the first\
    \ generation of EVO’s placed limited emphasis on \nstakeholder involvement, responsible\
    \ innovation requires active involvement \nof different groups through dialogue\
    \ and representation throughout the \ninnovation process. The dimension of responsiveness\
    \ as proposed by Stilgoe \net al. (2013) requires that systems of innovation have\
    \ the capacity to change \nor shape direction in response to stakeholder and public\
    \ values and changing \ncircumstances. Also in this article, we use the framework\
    \ to evaluate the \nproposed hydro-climatic EVO. \n \n2.3 Methodology \nIn this\
    \ paper, we address the following research question: How will the \nexisting socio-ecological\
    \ setting in rice production systems in Northern \nGhana promote or hinder a possible\
    \ hydroclimatic EVO design and \noperationalisation? To diagnose our case region\
    \ and analyse the potential for \ndesigning a new EVO, the study adopts a systematic\
    \ approach involving five \nsequential steps (see Fig. 2.1). We gathered data\
    \ from both primary and \nsecondary sources using qualitative methods of data\
    \ collection and analysis. \n \nFigure 2.1: Workflow of the study. \n \nDiagnosing\
    \ the potential of hydro-climatic information Systems\nChapter 2\n45\n2.3.1 Data\
    \ collection \nTo collect data, we made use of three qualitative methods: content\
    \ analysis of \nexisting documents, interviews, and focus group discussions. The\
    \ selection \nof methods provided us insight into the socio-ecological context\
    \ of the case \nstudy, information needs and use as well as the challenges of\
    \ existing systems \nand opportunities for the development of a hydro-climatic\
    \ EVO. \n \na)  Research literature and documents analysis: \nWe collected policy\
    \ documents, donor agency reports, scientific research \narticles and research\
    \ reports from related projects and programs by going \nthrough government and\
    \ non-governmental organizations’ websites and \nonline repositories. We specifically\
    \ focused on analysing local governance \nand institutional documents containing\
    \ rules, structures and arrangements \nabout farming, irrigation and water use\
    \ in Northern Ghana to gain a thorough \nunderstanding of the decision-making\
    \ context and practices. The data \ncollected helped us also to guide the interviews.\
    \ \n \nb)  Interviews \nWe informally engaged in an open conversation with fifteen\
    \ (15) practitioners \nfrom nine different organizations (Table 1). To allow the\
    \ discussion to move \nin the direction preferred by the practitioners, we opted\
    \ not to use a structured \ninterview guide, but rather semi-structured the conversations\
    \ along topics \nemerging from the document analysis. The informal setting allowed\
    \ \nrespondents to speak more freely and openly about their experiences and \n\
    helped in building relationships for future collaborations. The practitioners\
    \ \nwere purposefully selected based on their principal role (civil society \n\
    representatives, policy and decision makers, researchers and farmer \nrepresentatives)\
    \ and expertise in climate, water management and farming. \nThe conversation centered\
    \ on five thematic areas: (i) perception of the \nclimate-water-food production\
    \ problem in northern Ghana; (ii) current \nactions taking by farmers and organizations\
    \ to manage these problems; (iii) \nfarmers’ hydro-climatic informational needs\
    \ and use; (iv) the value of \nseasonal climate forecast; and (v) the feasibility\
    \ of hydro-climatic EVO to \nameliorate the challenges. Each conversation lasted\
    \ for about one hour and \nthe information was recorded digitally and captured\
    \ in a field notebook. \nChapter 2\n46\nTable 2.1: Stakeholders engaged in informal\

    \ challenges farmers experienced through the \nexisting governance arrangements,\
    \ water management practices, information \nmanagement and decision-making, we\
    \ organized seven Focus Group \nDiscussions (FGDs) with farmers who were engaged\
    \ in irrigated and/or \nrainfed rice farming within the Kumbungu District. FGDs\
    \ were held at the \nfarm, community and scheme levels. Discussions at the farm\
    \ level focused on \nthe perception of farmers on problems of the climate-water-food\
    \ production \nnexus and steps taken to manage them. In addition, discussions\
    \ revolved \naround the hydro-climatic informational needs of farmers. \n \nTo\
    \ broaden the scope, the FGDs organized at the community level included \nrice\
    \ farmers, traditional leaders, political representatives and women. This \nallowed\
    \ us to discuss the place of hydroclimatic information in their farming \ncycle,\
    \ as well as the ways in which governance arrangements and decision-\nmaking processes\
    \ at the community and farm level worked. At the scheme \nlevel, similar questions\
    \ were asked to inquire on the activities of rice farmers \nwithin the Bontanga\
    \ Irrigation Scheme about governance, water management \nand how that impacted\
    \ decision-making. Participants were leaders of farmer \nassociations, the manager\

    \ and \nsynthesising key information from the selected literature and documents;\
    \ \nbackground information of rice farmers as well as insight into the socio-\n\
    ecological settings of rice production systems in Northern Ghana. It also \nprovided\
    \ supplementary research data on the importance of rice in the \neconomy of Ghana,\
    \ historical and current climatic variability and change in \nNorthern Ghana as\
    \ well as model projections of these changes and their \nundesirable impact on\

    \ farmers’ activities in Northern Ghana and the \nmanagement framework of the\
    \ irrigation schemes including existing \nhydroclimatic information systems and\
    \ their value to rice farming was \nobtained via literature and document analysis.\
    \ \n \nUsing Atlas.ti (Hwang, 2008), we used open-coding methods and clustered\
    \ \nthe topics of the several themes. The analysis was aimed at first verifying\
    \ our \nfindings from the literature and document analysis to corroborate evidences\
    \ \nand secondly to probe further on arising issues such as practical challenges\
    \ of \nclimate variability and change for farmers and the potential value of hydro-\n\
    climatic information systems for farmers’ adaptive decision making. \n \nFocus\
    \ Group Discussions were similarly transcribed and processed through \nthematic\
    \ analysis. The analysis provided information on the rules of \nengagement and\
    \ decision making among rice farmers, their knowledge of \nexisting hydro-climatic\
    \ information services, information access and \nutilization, challenges of institutional\
    \ linkage and information exchange at \nfarm level.  \n \n \n \n \n \nDiagnosing\

    \ \n2.4.1 Diagnostic analysis of the social-ecological system \nTo analyse the\
    \ current setting, we focus on rice farmers in Northern Ghana \n(Fig. 2). We specifically\
    \ explore the socio-ecological aspects of climate \nchange impacts on crop productivity\
    \ (i.e. yield per unit area) and not 'food \nproduction', as this is dependent\
    \ on many other factors than climate change, \nsuch as quality of land, infrastructure\
    \ investment, available finance, \ninternational trade policy, and food market.\
    \ We analyse this case region by \nsplitting it in two dimensions; the biophysical\
    \ factors (climate and water) and \nsocio-institutional (actors, rules, practices,\
    \ decision-making) parameters \nframing the activities of rice farmers within\
    \ the study area. \n \ni) \nBiophysical context \nFrom the literature analysis\
    \ and interviews, the major The biophysical issues \nin the case area are mapped\
    \ in Fig. 3. The main issue in the North of Ghana \n(∼97,702 km² land area) is\
    \ climate variability which significantly impacts \nagricultural productivity.\
    \ Development of the agricultural sector in this region \nis affected by the climatic\
    \ conditions, such as the long dry season of about six \nto seven months followed\
    \ by five-month rainy season (April/May to \nSeptember/October) usually characterized\
    \ by sporadic droughts and/or floods \n(Amikuzino & Donkoh, 2012; Barry, Obuobie,\
    \ Andreini, Andah, & Pluquet, \n2005). Temperatures in the region are higher compared\
    \ to those in the \nsouthern part of the country. The lowest maximum temperatures\
    \ are around \n26 °C mostly recorded in August and highest temperatures are between\
    \ 40–\n42 °C recorded in March or April (Mdemu, 2008). The climate system of \n\
    Northern Ghana is characterized by distinctive inter-annual and inter-decadal\
    \ \nvariability in precipitation and temperature (Nyadzi, 2016). The area is \n\
    associated with an erratic unimodal rainfall of an annual sum between 400 \nand\
    \ 1200 mm. Changes in the duration of the rainy season have shortened the \nlength\
    \ of the growing season, delaying the onset of planting season in most \ncases,\
    \ while dry season and rainy season temperatures have increased by \nabout 1 °C\
    \ and 2 °C respectively (Acquah, 2011; Kunstmann & Jung, 2005). \n \nChapter 2\n\
    50\nThe northern part of Ghana experiences the greatest rainfall variations and\
    \ \nthis is projected to increase along with increasing temperature (2.1–2.4 °C)\
    \ \nfrom 2010 to 2050 (Owusu & Waylen, 2009). According to Kankam-Yeboah \net\
    \ al. (2011), high temperatures that were previously recorded in March (peak \n\
    of the dry season) are now being recorded also in January. In addition, the \n\
    onset of the rainy season has become more difficult to predict. They also \nindicated\
    \ that in the past, the rainy season started in April and ended around \nlate\
    \ September or early October. However, in recent times, the rainy season \nstarts\
    \ in June or July with extreme heavy rainfall in September or October. \n \nThese\
    \ outcomes indicate a potential increase in the intensity and frequency of \n\
    extreme events, such as droughts and floods and a consequential reduction in \n\
    the crop growing period with serious implications for crop yields and food \n\
    security (Abdul-Rahaman & Owusu-Sekyere, 2017; Kasei, Ampadu, & \nYalevu, 2014).\
    \ Current occurrences and long-term climate patterns create \nfuture uncertainties\
    \ with serious implications for climate prediction and \nagricultural productivity.\
    \ As re-iterated by Antwi-Agyei et al. (2012), climate \nvariability, manifested\
    \ at different time scales and in different ways will \nsignificantly impact the\
    \ agricultural sector of Northern Ghana. \n \nIn addition, large temporal and\
    \ spatial rainfall variability results in high \nvariability in river flow. As\
    \ results, most rivers flow for only a few months a \nyear with limited or no\
    \ flow during the rest of the year (Amisigo & van de \nGiesen, 2005). The combination\
    \ of climate change, intensive land use, \npopulation growth and economic development\
    \ results in increased water \ndemand and more pressure on the available water\
    \ resources (Stanturf et al., \n2011). To cope with climate variability hydraulic\
    \ infrastructure such as small-\nscale reservoirs and large scale irrigation systems\
    \ have been constructed \nmainly for agricultural purposes (Faulkner, Steenhuis,\
    \ De Giesen, Andreini, \n& Liebe, 2008; Amisigo, McCluskey, & Swanson, 2015).\
    \ \n \nUncertainties related to climate variability is a major challenge for both\
    \ rain-\nfed and irrigated farmers and water managers because to productively\
    \ manage \ntheir activities, critical climate sensitive decisions have to be taken\
    \ months \nahead of a season (Asante & Amuakwa-Mensah, 2015). Sustainability of\
    \ rain-\nDiagnosing the potential of hydro-climatic information Systems\nChapter\
    \ 2\n51\nfed farming systems becomes a challenge with severe impacts on crop yields\
    \ \n(Fosu-Mensah et al., 2012; Acquah, 2011). Not only does this affect rain-fed\
    \ \nfarming, it also has a major toll on irrigation schemes. Water levels in the\
    \ dry \nseason are low making it difficult to irrigate farmlands limiting production.\
    \ \nFarmers have reported re-sowing of seeds due to poor germination following\
    \ \ndelay in rains, which increases their cost of production. Irrigation water\
    \ \nmanagers rely on river discharge to decide the frequency, quantity and \n\
    method of water distribution. The uncertainty associated with predicting \nseasonal\
    \ rains and water availability puts farmers in a dilemma when key \nfarming decisions\
    \ are to be made (Ndamani & Watanabe, 2014). \n \nIn the face of these challenges,\
    \ rice is a central crop as it accounts for 15% of \nagricultural output and 45%\
    \ of the total area used in cereal grain production \nin Ghana (Stanturf et al.,\
    \ 2011). Rice is produced under irrigation, rain-fed \nlowland and rain-fed upland\
    \ systems. Studies on climate change project \nincreasing temperatures and declining\
    \ rainfall, resulting in reduced rice \nproduction (see Asante & Amuakwa-Mensah,\
    \ 2015). In a study carried out \nby Knox et al. (2012) rice is projected to experience\
    \ the most variations of all \nstudied crops, since water scarcity, and over reliance\
    \ on unpredictable rainfall \nare the major factors affecting rice production\
    \ in Northern Ghana (Kranjac-\nBerisavljevic, Blench, & Chapman, 2003). \n \n\
    Chapter 2\n52\n \n \nFigure 2.2: Analysis of the main biophysical issues in northern\
    \ Ghana \n \nii) \nSocio-institutional context \nThe North of Ghana is divided\
    \ into three administrative regions: Upper East, \nUpper West and Northern Regions\
    \ (Fig. 2.3). The majority of this area is \nlocated in the Tropical Guinea Savannah\
    \ zone, with small parts (extreme \nnorth of the upper east and west regions)\
    \ sharing border with Burkina Faso in \nthe Sudan Savanna. The north of Ghana\
    \ is the poorest part of the country yet \nrecent reports indicate that about\
    \ 80% of the economically active population \nin this part of Ghana engages in\
    \ agriculture, producing millet, guinea-corn, \nrice, maize, groundnut, beans,\
    \ and sorghum with some few others producing \ndry season tomatoes and onions.\
    \ Livestock and poultry production are also \ncommon in the region. The north\
    \ of Ghana is generally endowed with about \n20 small and large irrigation schemes.\
    \ Rice farming periods and practices are \nsimilar across the three regions, even\
    \ though there are individual preferences \nfor different varieties depending\
    \ on farmer’s own aim of farming  (Braimah \net al., 2014). \nDiagnosing the potential\
    \ of hydro-climatic information Systems\nChapter 2\n53\n \nFigure 2.3: Northern\
    \ sector of Ghana in a black rectangle (A) relative to \nAfrica showing Ghana\
    \ (B) \n \nGovernance in Ghana is characterized by two main governance \narrangements.\
    \ These are traditional and formal arrangements. Formal \ngovernance arrangements\
    \ have been established by legal and structural \ndefinitions captured in the\
    \ constitution and other working documents \ndependent on the context. Traditional\
    \ governance arrangements, although \n‘loosely’ framed are embedded in local and\
    \ community culture expressed in \nthe form of rules, norms and beliefs ( Myers\
    \ & Fridy, 2017). In Northern \nGhana, the activities of rice farmers are informed\
    \ by both governance \narrangements (Nanedo, Prior, de Bruyn, & Marshall, 2014).\
    \ \n \nOur engagements revealed that the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority,\
    \ \nhas the mandate of developing and managing irrigation infrastructure (see\
    \  \nNamara, Horowitz, Nyamadi, & Barry, 2011). The Ghana Meteorological \nAgency,\
    \ Water Resource Commission and the Center for Scientific and \nIndustrial Research\
    \ are also collaborative institutions in meeting information, \n \nChapter 2\n\
    54\nwater security and advice on crop productivity respectively (see also Braimah\
    \ \net al., 2014; Nanedo et al., 2014). The Participatory Irrigation Management\
    \ \nStrategy adopted in the 1990s has served as the framework for a more \ndecentralized\
    \ management of Irrigation Schemes. At the scheme level, the \nmanager is responsible\
    \ for the daily operations of the scheme and thus \nengages farmers and leadership\
    \ of farmer associations in the drafting of \nschedules and assigning of roles\
    \ for effective water management for irrigation \npurposes. Water is thus discharged\
    \ through canals onto farmlands within \ndifferent laterals guided by agreed schedules.\
    \ The manager also coordinates \ndecisions and information exchange amongst all\
    \ actors as part of steps to \nadapt to changing conditions experienced (Namara\
    \ et al., 2011). \n \nRainfed rice farmers operating within communities are also\
    \ guided by \ntraditional governance arrangements aimed at ensuring effective\
    \ engagement \nand resource use. These are in the form of rules and procedures\
    \ which \ncommunity members are expected to adhere to or live by. For example,\
    \ Chiefs \nare custodians of lands and thus farmers who do not have family lands\
    \ would \nhave to consult the leadership for land for farming activities. Water\
    \ is also \nperceived as a communal resource and hence farmers are expected to\
    \ consider \nthe interest of other users in the quest to meet their water needs.\
    \ Chiefs who \nare thus seen to have the highest authority within the community\
    \ legally \nenforce communal decisions. Farmers must thus adhere to agreed rules\
    \ even \nif it does not satisfy their needs. \n \nIn both systems, we found the\
    \ existing governance arrangements to be \narrangements to be faced with multiple\
    \ challenges limiting stakeholder \ninteraction and information exchange. For\
    \ instance, information provision \nthrough Chief are usually aimed at general\
    \ community concerns and activities \nrather than agriculture information required\
    \ for farm decision-making. Most \nfarmers thus took the initiative of obtaining\
    \ information from other farmers \nor platforms such as radio and mobile telecommunication\
    \ service operators \ninvolved in related information provision (see also Alhassan\
    \ et al., 2013). \nCommunity representatives such as Assemblymen are not instrumental\
    \ in \nproviding relevant farm related information. Within the irrigation scheme,\
    \ \npower play and gender imbalance results in bias in engagement. Results of\
    \ \nDiagnosing the potential of hydro-climatic information Systems\nChapter 2\n\
    55\nthe focus group discussions show that access to water was mostly \ncharacterized\
    \ by power play especially during the dry season as only a few \nlaterals upland\
    \ could access water for irrigation from the dam. Thus, lands in \nthe upland\
    \ are allocated to cronies of the irrigation manager, chiefs and heads \nof committees.\
    \ Women are also less represented and hence limited in \naccessing land and obtaining\
    \ relevant information related to farm activities. \nGovernance arrangements within\
    \ the scheme also put the Scheme manager in \ncharge of information directly relevant\
    \ for scheme operations. In some \ncontexts, farmers receive delayed information\
    \ relevant for decision-making \ndue to inactivity on the side of leadership.\
    \ Interviews and FGDs pointed to \nweak institutional collaborations especially\
    \ on information provision and use \n(see also Nugent, 2000). A situation largely\
    \ attributable to negligence, poor \nleadership, weak communication links, inadequate\
    \ resources and logistical \nchallenges. For example, the Ghana Meteorological\
    \ Agency provides \nseasonal climate information only at the start of the season\
    \ and mostly to radio \nstations and irrigation scheme managers with little contact\
    \ with farmers \nthemselves. However, wherever these contacts exist they are inconsistent\
    \ and \ngenerally decrease over the season. Private operators providing hydro-\n\
    climatic information have limited collaboration with the public sector. Thus,\
    \ \nESOKO, MTN and Vodafone only interact with farmers without \nconsideration\
    \ of existing programmes and how their interventions could be \nembedded in them.\
    \ Braimah et al. (2014) allude to complex local socio-\npolitical issues that\
    \ affect relationships within irrigation schemes. These \nrange from power play\
    \ to gender inequalities affecting knowledge exchange \nand resource management.\
    \ \n \nInterviews also revealed that farmers take a number of key decisions in\
    \ \nmanaging changes in climatic conditions and how they affect water \navailability\
    \ and food production. These include when and how to prepare \nfarmlands, when,\
    \ what and how to plant, perform weed control, apply \nfertilizer and harvest.\
    \ Farmers adapt their decisions considering outcomes and \nwhat is deemed appropriate\
    \ in a given context (see also Ndamani & \nWatanabe, 2014). Under irrigated rice\
    \ farming, water managers lead the \ndecision process with the design of an irrigation\
    \ schedule. Farmers however \nare responsible for specific decisions on their\
    \ farms. Under rain-fed systems, \nChapter 2\n56\nthe farmer leads the risk management\
    \ process by exploring how experience \nfrom the previous season and new knowledge\
    \ or information on weather inter \nalia, water availability in their decision-making\
    \ (see also Abdul-Razak & \nKruse, 2017). The survey revealed that adaptive farm\
    \ decisions of farmers are \ngenerally based on information generated from indigenous\
    \ and scientific \nforecasts. While farmers were quick to acknowledge the limitations\
    \ in their \npersonal forecast they however considered it better for decision\
    \ making than \nthe scientific forecast provided by Ghana Meteorological Agency\
    \ as this was \nperceived to be generic and not locally specific to their community\
    \ and needs \n(see also Gwenzi, Mashonjowa, Mafongoya, Rwasoka, & Stigter, 2016;\
    \ \nZuma-Netshiukhwi, Stigter, & Walker, 2013). Information systems within \n\
    the study area were identified to provide scientific forecast information \nwhereas\
    \ indigenous forecasts were tied to farmers observation matched with \nexperience.\
    \ For example, farmers are able predict the beginning of the wet \nseason and\
    \ when to prepare their fields for planting (Ofori-Sarpong, 2001). \nThey base\
    \ their predictions on a set of indicators, each of which has different \nlevels\
    \ of reliability. The flowering of the shea nut tree, migratory patterns of \n\
    birds and position of the constellation Pleiades all help farmers determine \n\
    when the rainy season is due (Benneh, 1970). They are able to predict date of\
    \ \nseasonal rainfall onset and cessation, and whether the season will receive\
    \ \nabove, below and normal rainfall. Also, they are able to make daily weather\
    \ \npredictions of low, medium and high rainfall (Nyantakyi-Frimpong, 2013). \n\
    In the next section, the paper presents findings on information systems and \n\
    how they enable hydroclimatic information access and use. \n \n2.4.2 Hydro-climatic\
    \ information access and use in rice farming systems \nin northern Ghana \nThe\
    \ role of hydro-climatic information in knowledge creation, improved \nadaptation\
    \ and improved agricultural production has been highlighted in \ndifferent studies\
    \ and initiatives (Sam, Osei, Dzandu, & Atengble, 2017; \nOwolade & Kayode, 2012).\
    \ For example, in 2014 and 2015, the Ghana \nMeteorological Agency (GMet, 2016)\
    \ in collaboration with the CGIAR and \nESOKO provided weather and seasonal climate\
    \ information via conventional \nSMS to farmers in two piloted communities. Other\
    \ media such as radio and \nDiagnosing the potential of hydro-climatic information\
    \ Systems\nChapter 2\n57\ntelevision programs are also used to provide relevant\
    \ information in English \nand local languages (i.e. Dagbanli, Frafra, Gonja,\
    \ Kasem, etc.). \n \nIn spite of these interventions, there are still challenges\
    \ in information access \nand interpretation by farmers who are illiterates and\
    \ can’t read text and even \nliterate farmers lack the necessary skills to understand\
    \ technical information \nbecause of the format in which they are presented. Also,\
    \ the extent to which \nthose who could read adopt the information and new knowledge\
    \ received is \nconsiderably questionable (see also Sam et al., 2017). Our inventory\
    \ of \nexisting ICT and media platforms in Ghana as shown in Table 1 reveals some\
    \ \npotential information transfer models, namely radio, mobile apps, websites\
    \ \nand conventional phone-based services (e.g. recorded voice messages and \n\
    SMS texts for more literate farmers). Other non-ICT means of information \ntransfer\
    \ include moving vans, extension officers, water managers and head of \nfarmer\
    \ organizations who disseminate pertinent information to farmers. Table \n2.3\
    \ provides an assessment of strengths and limitations of the main \ncommunication\
    \ tools regarding their  \n utilization in hydro-climatic information services\

    \ with the aim of diagnosing how socio-ecological settings \nof rice farmers in\
    \ northern Ghana could affect the design and \noperationalisation of a hydro-climatic\
    \ EVO. In this section, we draw on the \ninsights from our diagnostic analysis\
    \ to outline the characteristics of our \nhydro-climatic EVO. The design aims\
    \ to overcome the identified challenges \nand capitalize on opportunities identified\
    \ in section 2.5.2. The framework \nconsists of two main parts: the structural\
    \ elements of the framework and the \nprocesses through which it operates. We\
    \ discuss the process of designing the \nEVO through the lens of the four dimensions\
    \ of RI. \n \n2.5.1 Design features: description of the structural elements \n\
    Our diagnostics resulted in different hydro-climatic information needs, \nchallenges\
    \ and opportunities for an EVO. We propose a hydroclimatic EVO \n(Fig. 2.4) consisting\
    \ of three major elements; (i) data sources, (ii) data \nhandling processes, (iii)\
    \ platform for information and data exchange. \n \n \nFigure 2.4: Fundamental\
    \ Architecture of hydro-climatic EVO \n \nDiagnosing the potential of hydro-climatic\
    \ information Systems\nChapter 2\n61\n(i) Data sources \nData will be sourced\
    \ from two main knowledge systems; indigenous and \nscientific knowledge systems\
    \ (see Fig. 4). As explained earlier, Ghanaian \nfarmers use indigenous ecological\
    \ knowledge to understand weather and \nclimate patterns in order to make decisions\
    \ about crop and irrigation cycles \n(Nyantakyi-Frimpong, 2013). Prior to every\
    \ season the EVO will collect \nfarmers’ seasonal forecast of rainfall onset and\
    \ cessation date and, rainfall \namount and degree of temperature forecast expressed\
    \ on a nominal scale of \nbelow, normal or above normal. Also within the season,\
    \ the EVO will collect \nfarmers’ twenty- four (24) hours weather forecast of\
    \ low, medium or high \nrain. \n \nSecond, seasonal temperature and rainfall data\
    \ from European Centre for \nMedium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF-S4) seasonal\
    \ forecasts system \n4 (Molteni et al., 2011) will be analysed to also provide\
    \ same seasonal climate \ninformation on rainfall onset and cessation date, amount\
    \ of rainfall and degree \nof temperature also expressed in a nominal scale of\
    \ below, normal and above \nnormal. ECMWF-S4 is a state-of-the-art seasonal ensemble\
    \ climate model \nthat provides seasonal climate forecast on daily timescale into\
    \ seven months \nahead of time. The daily nature of the data will allow us to\
    \ estimate daily \nrainfall amount of either low, medium and high. \n \n(ii) \
    \ Data handling and processing \nThe second element of the framework is the data\
    \ handling process where \nindigenous and scientific data are collected, processed,\
    \ analysed, and \nvisualized. The collection of data will be partly automated.\
    \ The hydro-\nclimatic-EVO will offer a platform where farmers can regularly upload\
    \ their \nseasonal climate and daily weather forecast information. These indigenous\
    \ \nforecast information from farmers will be complemented with those from \n\
    scientific forecast. \n \nThere are clear differences and limitations of both\
    \ data sources. However, \nseasonal information such as rainfall onset and cessation\
    \ date, above, below \nand normal rainfall generated from the analysis of the\
    \ ECMWF-S4 \ntemperature and rainfall data will be used to complement those predicted\
    \ by \nChapter 2\n62\nfarmers using their indigenous knowledge. In a similar way\
    \ daily weather \ninformation such as low, medium and high rainfall predicted\
    \ by farmers will \ncomplement information estimated from the daily data from\
    \ ECMWF-S4 or \nany other weather model. There is potentially great value in combining\
    \ both \nsources of data. For example, both data sources have inherent value that\
    \ will \ncomplement the weakness exhibited by each without substituting one for\
    \ the \nother and building on their respective strengths. The question that remains\
    \ is \nwhether information from both sources will be provided independently or\
    \ \ncombined. Developing a comprehensive approach to either independently \npresent\
    \ scientific and indigenous forecast information or harmonize them for \nactionability\
    \ remained to be further explored in our next study. \n \n(iii) Information exchange\
    \ for adaptive farm decision-making \nThe hydro-climatic EVO has additional features\
    \ that distinguish it from other \nEVOs. It offers a participatory opportunity\
    \ to actively engage end-users to \nco-create actionable knowledge. Farmers can\
    \ share their forecast information \nand receive tangible information for their\
    \ adaptive farm decision-making. For \nexample seasonal climate information such\
    \ as onset and cessation date, \nrainfall amount (be it above, normal or below\
    \ normal) and seasonal dam water \nlevels, and the degree of temperature per season\
    \ will support: \n \n(i) Pre-season decisions: such as when to buy seeds and which\
    \ variety to buy, \nirrigation land size allocation and Labour size, which weedicide,\
    \ pesticide \nand fertilizer to buy. \n(ii) Land preparation decisions: when to\
    \ clear land, when to harrow and \nplough, \n(iii) \nPlanting decisions: when\
    \ to nurse, transplant and which planting \nmethod to adopt and \n(iv) \nHarvesting\
    \ decision: when to harvest and by which method. \n \nOn the other hand daily\
    \ weather information (be it yes/no rain, low, medium \nor high rainfall) received\
    \ by farmers will support farm decisions such as \n(i) When to fertilize, \n(ii)\
    \ When to apply weedicides and pesticides and \n(iii) \nWhen to carry out supplementary\
    \ irrigation. \nDiagnosing the potential of hydro-climatic information Systems\n\
    Chapter 2\n63\nDetails of information need and decision-making by rice farmers\
    \ are \ndiscussed by Nyamekye et al. (2018) and Nyadzi et al. (2018). The EVO\
    \ \noffers tailor made information that generate actionable knowledge to for \n\
    decision making at different stages of farming. The interface of the Hydro-\n\
    climatic EVO will be carefully designed with close collaboration with end-\nusers\
    \ to ensure effective data and information exchange with a particular \nfocus\
    \ on non-literate users with little or no prior ICT experience. The hydro-\nclimatic\
    \ EVO therefore envisages opportunities for learning and becoming an \nintegral\
    \ part of rice production systems in the region. \n \n2.5.2 Hydro-climatic EVO:\
    \ addressing challenges in existing \ninformation systems \nThe main challenges\
    \ of existing information systems and what our EVO seek \nto do differently is\
    \ summarized in Table 4. Challenges with existing systems \nthat limit their usefulness\
    \ include user unfriendliness of the system, \ninaccuracies of forecast information,\
    \ relevance of information, managing user \nexpectation and weak collaborations.\
    \ \n \n2.5.2.1 Design process: hydro-climatic EVO as responsible innovation \n\
    We build on the responsible innovation framework (Stilgoe et al., 2013) to \n\
    assess the initial steps taken in the process of building a hydroclimatic EVO,\
    \ \nand to identify the challenges ahead. For each cardinal principle, we raised\
    \ \nsome salient questions that seek to guide the development and \nimplementation.\
    \  \n \n(i) Anticipation \nAnticipation involves “systematic thinking aimed at\
    \ increasing resilience, \nwhile revealing new opportunities for innovation and\
    \ the shaping of agendas \nfor socially-robust risk research” (Stilgoe et al.,\
    \ 2013). This relates to \nforecasting, and imagining possible and desirable futures,\
    \ but also to the \n‘ethics of promising’. This dimension of the RI framework\
    \ makes us ask \n‘what if…?’ questions (Ravetz, 1997) to expose the various contingencies\
    \ \nassociated with the development of the hydro-climatic-EVO. From its \nconception,\
    \ the envisaged hydro-climatic EVO anticipates the future by \nChapter 2\n64\n\
    considering the potential impacts of climate variability and change on \nfarmers’\
    \ daily and seasonal farm decision making. Rather than optimizing for \nthe most\
    \ likely future scenario, the hydro-climatic-EVO accounts for the \nassociated\
    \ uncertainty by trying to make variability in water availability \nmanageable\
    \ for different farming purposes. Climate variability and change is \nonly one\
    \ of the potentially relevant future developments. Equally important \nis the\
    \ unintended consequences which could be the future development of \nfarming in\
    \ the region, in terms of economic prospects and farmers’ \naspirations. Will\
    \ farmers move out of agriculture into other occupations if \npossible, or do\
    \ they see a future for themselves and their children that will \nmotivate them\
    \ to further improve their farmer system and embrace new \ntechnologies such as\
    \ an EVO? The approach taken to ensure inclusiveness \nthrough user-centered design\
    \ (see below) creates some challenges for the \n‘ethics’ of promising. Developing\
    \ features that are most relevant to users \nimplies that these may be quite specific\
    \ and/or novel, making it uncertain to \nwhat degree the innovation will be able\
    \ to deliver on the promised usefulness \nof the EVO. \n \n(ii)  Reflexivity \n\
    Reflexivity means “holding a mirror up to one’s own activities, commitments \n\
    and assumptions, being aware of the limits of knowledge and being mindful \nthat\
    \ a particular framing of an issue may not be universally held” (Stilgoe et \n\
    al., 2013). It is about questioning the value systems and theories that shape\
    \ \nscience, innovation and their governance. The envisaged hydro-climatic-\n\
    EVO will be developed through interdisciplinary collaboration, where the \nabsence\
    \ of shared standard ways of operating leads to mutual questioning and \nthus\
    \ some form of reflexivity. This reflexivity prevents the natural scientists \n\
    to retreat into sole modelling, and prevents the social scientists to retreat\
    \ into \nsole analysis of social processes. Reflexivity also requires carefulness\
    \ not to \nviolate the social and cultural ethics of the society in which the\
    \ project is \ncarried out, particularly because different countries and vulnerable\
    \ \npopulations are involved. This was vital especially during our interaction\
    \ with \nfarmers, for example regarding their traditional knowledge and regular\
    \ \nengagement for information exchange. A continuous challenge is to remain \n\
    reflexive about assumptions made in building the EVO, and to what extent \nDiagnosing\
    \ the potential of hydro-climatic information Systems\nChapter 2\n65\nthese are\
    \ aligned with the users’ context. Thus the need for continuous \nscrutiny of\
    \ project activities and dealing with every farmer and situation \ndistinctively.\
    \ \n \n(iii) Inclusion \nThe user-centered design framework (Zulkafli et al.,\
    \ 2017) adopted for the \ndevelopment of the hydro-climatic EVO strongly emphasizes\
    \ inclusion. \nVarious actors and institutions were actively involved in the early\
    \ \ndevelopment process, with particular attention paid to potential end-users.\
    \ \nThe engagement of different actors on the project especially during regular\
    \ \nworkshops and trainings is expected to play a pivotal role in creating a sense\
    \ \nof ownership among the farmers and other actors (public and private sector\
    \ \nagencies, local leaders and chiefs). A clear example of inclusiveness is the\
    \ \ninvolvement of both rainfed and irrigated rice farmers on the project. Each\
    \ of \nthese farmer types has its own need, which must be met. Also the reliance\
    \ on \nboth scientific and indigenous data and knowledge systems to generate \n\
    actionable knowledge enhances the inclusiveness of hydro-climatic EVO. \nInclusion\
    \ is never perfect, however, and pragmatic choices have an impact. \nThe particular\
    \ study area receives considerable attention from development \nactors, partly\
    \ because of its proximity to the city of Tamale and its university. \nFarmers\
    \ with higher literacy levels, fluency in English, and familiarity with \nICT\
    \ are easier to involve in e.g. local smartphone-based data gathering. \n \n(iv)\
    \ Responsiveness \nResponsiveness is the capacity to “change shape or direction\
    \ in response to \nstakeholders, public values, and changing circumstances” (Stilgoe\
    \ et al., \n2013). Funded by a university programme (INREF1) that values “research\
    \ for \ndevelopment”, our hydro-climatic-EVO project has a good starting point\
    \ for \nachieving responsiveness. The user-centered design approach to developing\
    \ \nthe EVO emphasizes the importance of the user context as a starting point\
    \ in \nterms of livelihoods, culture and decision-making. A choice that was made\
    \ \nearly in the project to include the practice of rainfed farming as well as\
    \ \n                                                 \n \n1 See \nhttp://www.wur.nl/en/Research-Results/Projects-and-programmes/\
    \ INREF.htm \nChapter 2\n66\nirrigated farming, was responsive to the importance\
    \ of rainfed farming for \nlarge parts of the rural population, in particular\
    \ the poorer sectors. The design \nand structure of the hydro-climatic-EVO aims\
    \ to meet the needs of users and \nremain flexible enough to respond to future\
    \ changes in circumstances, e.g. \nnew knowledge and emerging perspectives, new\
    \ technical possibilities or \ndemands, as well as changes in livelihoods or cultural\
    \ values. Being a \nuniversity-led project with a limited period (5 years) creates\
    \ some challenges \nfor responsiveness as well. What about responding to changes\
    \ when paid \nproject members are no longer around? Finally, the responsiveness\
    \ to \nstakeholder and public values might be challenged by the responsiveness\
    \ to \nacademic values and incentives, which prioritize modelling, analysis and\
    \ \npublication over stakeholder engagement and practical application. This \n\
    limitation is therefore recognized and in cases where they emerged efforts \n\
    must be put in place to amicably deal with them. For example, we seek to \nunderstand\
    \ indigenous forecast techniques and develop methods to quantify \nthem in order\
    \ to harmonize them with scientific forecast derived from models. \n \n2.6 Conclusion\
    \ \nThe diagnostics study presented here offers a number of important insights\
    \ \nthat help to further refine and implement the hydro-climatic EVO. First, \n\
    participatory design will create a sense of ownership among farmers. This is \n\
    because, being actively involved from the design to production and \nimplementation\
    \ stages of the project is novel, and it increases the likelihood \nthat the hydro-climatic\
    \ information services developed will be useful for \nfarmers. Secondly, the diagnostics\
    \ provides in-depth appreciation of the \nsocio-ecological conditions in which\
    \ the EVO will operate. Thirdly, our \nreflection using the RI framework exposed\
    \ key challenges, which the hydro-\nclimatic EVO development process needs to\
    \ deal with. Asking these \nquestions, however, allowed us to discuss plausible\
    \ solutions at an early stage \nin the design process. \n \nOne of the key challenge\
    \ anticipated is the reliance on stakeholder \nparticipation throughout the project\
    \ cycle. Farmers need incentives and \nmotivation for continuous participation.\
    \ In our case, we argue that both \nrainfed and irrigated farmers are challenged\
    \ by climate variability and limited \nDiagnosing the potential of hydro-climatic\
    \ information Systems\nChapter 2\n67\nwater availability and that urgent action\
    \ is needed. The information services \ndeveloped can help with improving their\
    \ farm decision making in order to \nbetter cope with climate variability. However,\
    \ it remains unclear how much \ntime future users and other stakeholders are prepared\
    \ to devote to the design \nprocess. Close monitoring is needed to find out if\
    \ farmers feel that providing \nregular data and information is too time consuming.\
    \ Limited commitment of \nusers can potentially reduce data availability and quality.\
    \ As a response we \npay specific attention to openness and transparency in the\
    \ design process, to \nallow participants to freely share their opinions and concerns.\
    \ At the same \ntime, researchers need to be proactive. They should be seen as\
    \ and perceived \nto be serious with the process through their active engagement.\
    \ In the context \nof decision-making, our reflections and findings present key\
    \ challenges in \nterms of language, interpretation and usability. The knowledge\
    \ co-creation \nand subsequent provision of actionable knowledge must align with\
    \ literacy \nand user confidence in being able to easily relate to outputs. \n\
    \ \nOur approach and innovation possesses the potential to deal with the socio-\n\
    ecological challenges imposed by climate variability and limited water \navailability.\
    \ We argue that one of the most important drivers of success to our \nproject\
    \ will be the intensive collective interaction of scientist and farmers \ncompelled\
    \ by the structure and mechanism of the hydro-climatic EVO, in \nwhich scientist\
    \ and other stakeholders think, plan and execute together from \ncommon ground.\
    \ In addition, the responsible line of questioning will reduce \nthe possible\
    \ surprises and eventualities that may affect the EVO development. \nImportant\
    \ issues to follow-up on are the performance of indigenous and \nscientific forecast\
    \ to meet the hydro-climatic information needs of rice \nfarmers in Northern Ghana.\
    \ Another issue from our diagnostics is how \ngovernance systems limit information\
    \ flow and interpretation. For our follow \nup studies we aim to investigate governance\
    \ arrangements and how these are \nenabling or inhibiting adaptive decision-making\
    \ amongst farmers and water \nmanagers. Also in the next stage of this project\
    \ is to find out what is the most \npreferred model of information exchange by\
    \ rice farmers. The potential of \nincluding farmers in information collection\
    \ through citizen science \npotentially bridges part of the gap between scientific\
    \ and indigenous expertise \nChapter 2\n68\nand constitutes a novel contribution\
    \ to the field of environmental \nobservations. \n \nWe conclude that the socio-ecological\
    \ conditions in Northern Ghana \nnecessitate the development of an effective second\
    \ generation hydroclimatic \nEVO as this potentially responds to the principles\
    \ of RI expected to drive \ntechnological innovation to manage change in natural\
    \ resource management. \nFinally, the proposed hydro-climatic EVO has potential\
    \ for influencing \nadaptive farm decision making in Northern Ghana in spite of\
    \ identifiable \nchallenges. Using the RI framework has helped us to refine these\
    \ challenges \nand offer concrete suggestions to improve both the design and \n\
    implementation of the proposed platform in a responsible way. \n \n \nAcknowledgements\

    \ 3\n72\nAbstract \nClimate variability has consequences on water availability\
    \ in rice farming \nsystems. In Ghana, rice farmers in the Northern Savannah are\
    \ amongst the \nmost vulnerable to long periods of drought and erratic rainfall\
    \ conditions. \nWithin the Kumbungu district, farmers engaged in both rain-fed\
    \ and irrigated \nrice farming are no exception. Coping with uncertain water availability\
    \ \nconditions requires adaptive decision-making for sustained productivity in\
    \ \nrice cropping. From an adaptive governance perspective, the extent to which\
    \ \nformal and traditional governance arrangements enable adaptive decisions \n\
    amongst rice farmers remains a key question. Using an exploratory research \n\
    design, the study investigates three key questions; what water-dependent \ndecisions\
    \ rice farmers take and how these are adaptive to changing water \navailability\
    \ conditions; what formal and informal governance arrangements \nrice cropping\
    \ decisions are embedded in; and how existing governance \narrangements enable\
    \ or constrain adaptive decision-making. Rice farmers in \ntwelve communities\
    \ around the Bontanga Irrigation Scheme in the \nKumbungu District in the Northern\
    \ region were engaged through individual \ninterviews and focus group discussions.\
    \ The study reveals that farmers take \nsix major water-dependent decisions throughout\
    \ the cropping season; \ndecision to or not to plant rice, land preparation, planting,\
    \ weed control, \nfertilizer application and harvesting. Farmer decisions are\
    \ most adaptive to \nwater availability conditions during planting and fertilizer\
    \ application.  Both \nformal and traditional governance arrangements influence\
    \ the extent to which \nfarmers are able to adapt to changes in water availability\
    \ conditions. The \npaper also reflects on the potential of hydro-climatic information\
    \ and the \nplace of Environmental Virtual Observatories (EVOs) in adaptive governance\
    \ \nand decision-making.  \n \n \n \n \n \nPublished as: Nyamekye, A. B., Dewulf,\

    \ has significant impact on food systems especially in \ndeveloping countries\
    \ posing challenges in decision-making due to \nfluctuations in temperature and\
    \ precipitation levels (Pietrapertosa, Khokhlov, \nSalvia, & Cosmi, 2018; Chaffin\
    \ et al., 2016; Bhave, Conway, Dessai, & \nStainforth, 2016); Buhaug, Benjaminsen,\
    \ Sjaastad, & Theisen, 2015). In \nNorthern Ghana, meeting water needs in rice\
    \ production remains a major \nchallenge amongst rice farmers. This is attributable\
    \ to highly variable and \noften unfavourable climatic conditions, dry spells\
    \ and a mix of technical \ndeficiencies of know-how, farm machinery and institutional\
    \ inefficiencies in \nboth irrigated and rain-fed rice farming systems (Adongo,\
    \ Abagale, & \nKranjac-Berisavljevic, 2015; Kranjac-Berisavljevic et al., 2003).\
    \ The \nNorthern region has a single farming window typical of the Savannah belt\
    \ in \nGhana (Bawayelaazaa Nyuor et al., 2016; Yaro, 2013; Nantui, Bruce, & Yaw,\
    \ \n2012; Donkoh & Awuni, 2011). Model projections suggest worsening \nclimatic\
    \ conditions with anticipated adverse impact on water availability \n(Asante &\
    \ Amuakwa-Mensah, 2015; Yaro, 2013; Laube, Schraven, & Awo, \n2012; Quaye, 2008)\
    \ and land degradation amongst others.  \n \nInterventions by government and private\
    \ actors have sought to improve water \navailability conditions. This has come\
    \ with infrastructure development and \nthe mechanization of farming. Such infrastructure\
    \ include irrigation schemes \nconstructed to support small scale farmers who\
    \ currently dominate farming \nsystems in Northern Ghana. The Bontanga Irrigation\
    \ Scheme in the \nKumbungu district, North-East of the city of Tamale, is one\
    \ of such schemes \nconstructed by government in Northern Ghana. The scheme being\
    \ the largest \nin northern Ghana covers a land area of 570ha and gravitationally\
    \ distributes \nwater unto farmlands within the scheme (Braimah et al., 2014).\
    \ The scheme \nserves about 14 immediate communities with farmers from these \n\
    communities owning and cultivating varying hectares. Main crops cultivated \n\
    include rice, pepper, onion, tomato and okro. The scheme is regulated by the \n\
    Ghana Irrigation Development Authority with the mandate of developing \nirrigation\
    \ infrastructure to improve water and soil conservation practices.  \n \nChapter\
    \ 3\n74\nNot all rice farmers in the Kumbungu district have access to the irrigation\
    \ \nsystem, and those who do often cultivate rice outside the irrigation system\
    \ as \nwell. Water availability is a key concern for rice farmers, affecting numerous\
    \ \ndecisions throughout the cropping cycle. Increasing uncertainty about water\
    \ \navailability conditions requires rice farmers to be adaptive in their decision-\n\
    making by anticipating or responding to early or late onset of the rainy season,\
    \ \nerratic rainfall, dry spells or excessive rainfall. Although rice farmers\
    \ have \nthe final responsibility to make rice cropping decisions, these decisions\
    \ are \nembedded in broader set of decisions by other farmers and other actors,\
    \ as \npart of both formal and traditional governance arrangements. The extent\
    \ to \nwhich these governance arrangements enable adaptive decision-making is\
    \ \nconsiderably under-studied.  \n \nThe study addresses the overall question\
    \ “How do rice farmers adapt their \ndecisions to variability and uncertainties\
    \ in water availability, and how are \nthese decisions embedded in broader governance\
    \ arrangements? The results \nsection of this paper is divided into three parts\
    \ with each part responding to a \nspecific question. The first part is descriptive\
    \ and addresses the question \n“which water-dependent decisions do rice farmers\
    \ take and to what extent are \nthese adaptive to changing water availability\
    \ conditions?” Here, we identify \nkey decisions and adaptive actions to manage\
    \ water challenges. The second \npart probes into governance arrangements and\
    \ establishes the tangle with \ndecision-making by posing the question “what are\
    \ the formal and informal \ngovernance arrangements in which rice farming decisions\
    \ are embedded?’. \nThe third part launches an inquiry into the governance arrangements-adaptive\
    \ \ndecision-making interconnection by posing the question “how do these \ngovernance\
    \ arrangements enable or constrain adaptive decision-making in \nrice production\
    \ systems?’. Following the answering of research questions, we \nfurther reflect\
    \ on the potential of hydro-climatic information and \nEnvironmental Virtual Observatories\
    \ (EVOs) in supporting adaptive \ndecision-making and governance of rice production\
    \ systems. \n \n \n \n \nGovernance arrangements and adaptive decision-making\
    \ \nChapter 3\n75\n3.2 Theoretical framework \nAdaptive governance has been cited\
    \ as a guiding theory for understanding the \ndynamics of social-ecological systems\
    \ and how these can be accounted for in \ngovernance arrangements and decision-making\
    \ processes (Rijke et al., 2012; \nTermeer et al., 2011; Olsson et al., 2006).\
    \ Karpouzoglou et al. (2016b) \nhighlight the strength of adaptive governance\
    \ as a theoretical lens as it \nintegrates governance dimensions of adaptive capacity,\
    \ collaboration, \nscaling, knowledge and learning. Thus, the capacities of social-ecological\
    \ \nsystems to respond and manage uncertain conditions could be better explored.\
    \ \nAdaptive governance further allows for the engagement of both formal and \n\
    informal institutions and cross-scale interactions (Gunderson, Cosens, & \nGarmestani,\
    \ 2016). The concept has been defined in numerous ways. Dietz et \nal. (2003)\
    \ coined the term adaptive governance in their paper on “the struggle \nto govern\
    \ the commons”. They define adaptive governance as “managing \ndiverse human-environmental\
    \ interactions in the face of extreme \nuncertainty”. Walker et al. (2004, p.\
    \ 8) present adaptive governance as “the \nprocess of creating adaptability and\
    \ transformability in socio-ecological \nsystems”. Gunderson et al. (2016) define\
    \ adaptive governance as the set of \ninstitutions and frameworks that facilitate\
    \ and foster adaptive management. \nIn agreeing, Green et al. (2013) posit that\
    \ adaptive governance is one way of \nbridging the dichotomy between legal structures\
    \ that assume away \nuncertainty and adaptive management that focuses on acknowledging\
    \ and \nwinnowing uncertainty. In borrowing from Plummer and Armitage (2007),\
    \ \nand Folke et al. (2005), Munaretto et al. (2014) refer to adaptive governance\
    \ \nas “a continuous problem-solving process by which institutional \narrangements\
    \ and ecological knowledge are tested and revised in a dynamic, \nongoing, self-organized\
    \ process of learning by doing”.  \n \nTermeer et al. (2011, p. 161) define a\
    \ governance arrangement as “the \nensemble of rules, processes, and instruments\
    \ that structure the interactions \nbetween public and or private entities to\
    \ realize collective goals for a specific \ndomain or issue”. They thus acknowledge\
    \ the importance of accounting for \nboth private and public actors, and their\
    \ interactions. We define formal \ngovernance arrangements as “instruments and\
    \ processes established by laws \nand treaties which are documented to be adopted\
    \ as operational conditions in \nChapter 3\n76\na given setting”. Traditional\
    \ governance arrangements on the other hand as \n“culturally defined and sometimes\
    \ undocumented rules and ways of \nbehaviour integral in the social fabric of\
    \ a people” (Termeer, Drimie, Ingram, \nPereira, & Whittingham, 2018; Chen & Zhu,\
    \ 2015; Worden, 2010). \n \nAnother key concept for our analysis is adaptive decision-making\
    \ (Chater & \nOaksford, 2000; Weber & Johnson, 2009). That adaptive governance\
    \ \narrangements will ultimately result in decisions that are adaptive to uncertain\
    \ \nchanges is often assumed but rarely studied. As different from the broader\
    \ \nconcept \nof \nadaptive \ngovernance, \nthere \nis \nno \nreadily \navailable\
    \ \nconceptualization of adaptive decision-making that we can rely on for our\
    \ \npurposes. In essence, decision-making is about making choices between \ndifferent\
    \ decision options. The question here is to what extent the options \nchosen respond\
    \ to observed or anticipated environmental conditions. The \nmore variability\
    \ and uncertainty in relevant environmental conditions, the \nstronger the need\
    \ for decisions to be adaptive. We build on Robert et al. (2016, \np. 2), who\
    \ define adaptation in farm decision-making as “adjustments in \nagricultural\
    \ systems in response to actual or expected stimuli through changes \nin practices,\
    \ processes, and structures and their effects or impacts on \nmoderating potential\
    \ modifications and benefitting from new opportunities”.  \n \nTo make the distinction\
    \ between regular decision-making and adaptive \ndecision-making, we will rely\
    \ on the following operationalization. We \nunderstand regular decision-making\
    \ as choosing standard decision options, \nbased on generalized expectations of\
    \ what to do under normal circumstances, \nbut independent of the observed or\
    \ anticipated environmental conditions that \npresent themselves. In contrast,\
    \ we understand adaptive decision-making as \nchoosing non-standard decision options,\
    \ in response to circumstances that are \nconsidered abnormal or unexpected (Phillips,\
    \ 1997). Thus, the decision-\nmaking process is perceived as a succession of decisions\
    \ to be made, which \ncan be more or less adaptive to changing circumstances.\
    \  \n \nThe provision of relevant and timely information about observed and \n\
    anticipated environmental conditions has the capacity to reduce risks and \nuncertainty\
    \ in farmer decision-making (Lundstrom & Lindblom, 2018; \nGovernance arrangements\
    \ and adaptive decision-making \nChapter 3\n77\nClarke et al., 2017). Information\
    \ systems or observatories creating networks \nand enabling knowledge exchange\
    \ amongst key actors in farming systems \nhave also been central in discourse\
    \ on improving farmer adaptation (Nie & \nSchultz, 2012). We thus reflect on the\
    \ place of Environmental Virtual \nObservatories (EVOs) as discussed in Karpouzoglou\
    \ et al. (2016a). They use \nthe terminology to describe a suite of information\
    \ gathering, processing and \ndissemination technologies supported by World Wide\
    \ Web that facilitate \ncross-fertilization of various sources of knowledge on\
    \ shared virtual \nplatforms. The theoretical framework of the study is graphically\
    \ presented in \nFigure 3.1. \n \n \n \nFigure 3.1: Theoretical framework of the\

    \ research design (Baxter & Jack, 2008; Stake, 2008) was adopted \nin conducting\
    \ the study in Ghana. The study was undertaken in communities \naround the irrigation\
    \ scheme in the Kumbungu district in Northern Ghana. \nThe district is home to\
    \ about 34,341 people with farming as a major economic \nactivity. The Kumbungu\
    \ district was carved out of the then Tolon-Kumbungu \ndistrict in the year 2012.\
    \ The irrigation scheme lies between latitude 90 30” \nand 90 35”N and longitude\
    \ 10 20” and 10 04”W and covers an area of 570ha. \nA total of sixteen farming\
    \ communities were selected from upstream, mid-\nstream and downstream of the\
    \ Bontanga dam. These include Bontanga, \nChapter 3\n78\nWuba, Saakuba, Yiepelgu,\

    \ research questions (Taylor, \nBogdan, & DeVault, 2015; Patton, 2005; Denzin\
    \ & Lincoln, 2008). Study \ncommunities were sampled purposively (Etikan, Musa,\
    \ & Alkassim, 2016; \nDevers & Frankel, 2000). Within each zone, 15 farmers practising\
    \ either rain-\nGovernance arrangements and adaptive decision-making \nChapter\
    \ 3\n79\nfed rice farming only, irrigation rice farming only or both were purposively\
    \ \nchosen and interviewed. In addressing the first specific research question,\
    \ \nfarmers were interviewed using unstructured interview guides (see appendix\
    \ \n3a) (Ruane, 2011; Schensul, Schensul, & LeCompte, 1999) for an average of\
    \ \n35 minutes. Farmers were mostly interviewed in their homes and farms (in a\
    \ \nfew cases). Questions centred on regular decisions farmers take, adaptive\
    \ \nactions pursued in water management and the extent to which these were \n\
    effective under changing conditions. Furthermore, Focus Group Discussions \n(FGDs)\
    \ were organized with groups of an average size of 12 farmers in each \ncommunity\
    \ (see appendix 3b) (Kothari, 2004; Stewart & Shamdasani, 1998). \nThese served\
    \ as avenues to further interrogate feedback received from direct \ninterviews\
    \ with farmers. Leaders of farmer groups, female and male farmers \nmade up Focus\
    \ Groups. FGDs were held at convenient meeting points where \nmost farmers convey\
    \ during leisure. Discussions allowed for brainstorming \nand an understanding\
    \ of how governance arrangements influenced adaptive \ndecision-making. \n \n\
    In probing into existing governance arrangements, farmers and water \nmanagers\
    \ as part of  interviews responded to questions on what governance \narrangements\
    \ were identifiable in communities and within the irrigation \nscheme (see appendix\
    \ 3c). Rain fed rice farmers operated within the \nboundaries of traditional governance\
    \ arrangements (Nchanji, 2017) whereas \nirrigated rice farmers had their activities\
    \ framed around formal arrangements \ndefined by the Ghana Irrigation Development\
    \ Authority and the Ministry of \nAgriculture. As part of FGDs, farmers were engaged\
    \ on what these \ngovernance arrangements are and how these influenced their operations.\
    \ \nChiefs, opinion leaders and local government representatives were also \n\
    engaged. A document analyses was also undertaken to establish meaning \nfrom frameworks\
    \ received from related authorities.  \n \nThe third level of engagement revolved\
    \ around how governance \narrangements enabled or constrained adaptive decision-making.\
    \ This enabled \nframing of the challenge of adaptive decision-making and formed\
    \ an integral \npart of questions posed both during direct interviews and FGDs.\

    \ between themes and for presentation.  \n \n3.4 Results \n3.4.1 What decisions\
    \ do rice farmers take in the Bontanga area? \nFarmers take six major decisions\
    \ in the cropping cycle; decisions on whether \nto engage in rice farming, land\
    \ preparation, planting, weed control, fertilizer \napplication and harvesting\
    \ (see Figure 3.3). These are regular decisions taken \nby farmers irrespective\
    \ of the rice farming system being practiced and the \nvarying conditions under\
    \ which they operate. The sensitivity to water \navailability conditions can also\
    \ be observed. \n \n3.4.1.1 Rain-fed rice farming systems \nDecision-making is\
    \ an intra-household activity with men initiating and \ndirecting the process.\
    \ Women and children almost readily respect and respond \nto the call to duty\
    \ on the farm by the household head. The period between \nMay-October within the\
    \ year is of significance to rain-fed rice farming \nhouseholds as it is the only\
    \ cropping time after which households are unable \nto engage in food production\
    \ due to dry conditions.  \n \nThe first key decision is whether or not to cultivate\
    \ rice. For some households, \nthis decision is the sole prerogative of the head\
    \ (in most cases male) of the \nhousehold. In some contexts, the head and spouse\
    \ (or spouses if polygamous) \ndiscuss privately and communicate to the rest of\
    \ the family. Rice is cultivated \nas a commercial crop thus, the decision is\
    \ strategic and requires allaying all \nfears and risks the household envisions\
    \ to be faced with, especially how to \nmanage water needs on the farm. Household\
    \ heads also consult other rice \nChapter 3\n82\nfarmers in their communities\
    \ in their outlook of the previous season and \nassessment of the prospects of\
    \ the current season (see box 1). Experiential \nand traditional knowledge play\
    \ a key role at this point. Rainfall patterns and \nsoil moisture content significantly\
    \ determine decision outcomes at this point.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n \n \nIn the case where the farmer decides to cultivate rice, the\
    \ next key decision is \nwhen to prepare the land. Rainfall levels and soil moisture\
    \ content could \ninfluence the land clearance method adopted. Land is usually\
    \ prepared when \nsoil moisture content is high or estimated to be sufficient.\
    \ Land preparation \nunder regular conditions is usually done between April-May\
    \ (see also Laube \net al., 2012 for similar findings) using simple tools such\
    \ as machetes and/or \nhoes, bullock-powered ploughs or tractors dependent on\
    \ economic and \nphysical factors. In Yielpegu, Zangbalun and Kpegu-biegu, some\
    \ farmers \nown bullock-powered carts which they use for land clearance and ploughing\
    \ \non their farms. Owners of the aforementioned also render rental services to\
    \ \nother farmers within and around their communities. Farmers pay for services\
    \ \nin kind (2 bags of rice) or an equivalent in cash. In Kumbungu, Bontanga and\
    \ \nWuba, farmers pay between 200 and 450 Ghana cedis to engage tractor \nservices\
    \ for land clearance. An acre of land is averagely cleared in a day, two \ndays\
    \ or four days using a tractor, bullock-powered cart or simple hand tools \nBox\
    \ 1: Decision-making amongst rice farmers  \n“Before the season begins, rice farmers\
    \ engage in dialogue to \ndiscuss \nexpectations. \nDiscussions \nrevolve \naround\

    \ unstructured and could begin with few farmers sitting \naround. We spend more\
    \ time together on Fridays after prayers at \nthe mosque discussing challenges\
    \ over the season with other \nfarmers”-Anonymous \n(Rain-fed \nrice \nfarmer\
    \ \nin \nDalung \nCommunity). \n \n \n \nGovernance arrangements and adaptive\
    \ decision-making \nChapter 3\n83\nrespectively. Farmers’ ability to pay is no\
    \ guarantee of access to services. \nSome farmers engage tractor services outside\
    \ the district at a higher cost. \nWhere necessary, some farmers are selected\
    \ or volunteer to scout for tractor \nservices for their communities.  \n \nFarmers\
    \ proceed to plant after the aforementioned activities have been \ncompleted.\
    \ Planting is usually done in July when there is enough rainfall but \nearlier\
    \ should the rains set in in June. Farm inputs such as labour, seed and \nwater\
    \ (soil moisture) are key pointers informing planting times. Seeds are \nplanted\
    \ directly through dibbering2, broadcasting, or nursed and transplanted \nafter\
    \ a given period.  \n \nWeed is controlled in a single or double phase dependent\
    \ on farmers’ \nfinancial capacity. Pre-emergent weedicides are applied right\
    \ after planting \nto control existing weeds. Post emergent weedicides are applied\
    \ after rice \nbegin to sprout. An average of two bottles of weedicides are applied\
    \ on an \nacre of land by the farmer with the aid of family members.  \n \nThe\
    \ fifth major decision is on the application of fertilizer. Fertilizer is applied\
    \ \nin early August but delayed when rains are erratic. Farmers obtain fertilizers\
    \ \nfrom agro-chemical shops mostly in Kumbungu or Tamale. Fertilizers are \n\
    applied when seeds sprout and also when the rice plant is observed to tassel.\
    \ \nFertilizers applied include NPK and manure from animal droppings. About \n\
    two bags of fertilizer is applied at a time on an acre of rice farm. Soil moisture\
    \ \ncontent or rainfall patterns are important drivers. In some cases, although\
    \ \nfarmers could afford a second phase of fertilizer application, low soil moisture\
    \ \ncontent and erratic rainfall become barriers to undertaking the activity.\
    \  \n \nThe last decision is on the harvest of rice. The activity is undertaken\
    \ between \nthe September and October. Most farmers engage labourers to augment\
    \ \nefforts by the household in harvesting rice manually. Some farmers also \n\
    engage the services of combine harvesters. Rice is then partially boiled or \n\
    \                                                 \n \n2 A dibber is a pointed\
    \ wooden stick for punching holes in the ground. \nChapter 3\n84\ndirectly milled\
    \ after and bagged for sale. Critical factors informing decisions \non harvesting\
    \ include market conditions, financial capacity, and estimated \noutput from the\
    \ farm. \n \n3.4.2 Irrigated rice farming systems \nDecision-making at the scheme\
    \ level is led by the scheme manager guided by \nregulations of the Ghana Irrigation\
    \ Development Authority. The guidelines \nestablishing the scheme present it as\
    \ a semi-autonomous entity thereby giving \nthe manager the right to spearhead\
    \ actions and day-to-day decisions at the \nlocal level. Instructions from the\
    \ regional and national offices of the authority \nare however binding and considered\
    \ in decision-making.  \n \nPeriodic meetings are held at the beginning of the\
    \ year to discuss operations \nunder the scheme. Plans are designed under the\
    \ leadership of the scheme \nmanager with the support of farmers on water use,\
    \ maintenance of laterals \nand effective farm management practices. Consultations\
    \ are also initiated \nwith external experts such as the MSD, ISD, and District\
    \ Assembly amongst \nothers. Nevertheless, the scheme manager has power to decide\
    \ on what \nvolumes of water to be discharged unto farmlands. Block and lateral\
    \ leaders \nare under the instruction of the water manager on the quantities of\
    \ water to be \ndischarged at any given point in time. Farmers within the scheme\
    \ have to \ndecide on whether or not to plant rice in the year. Here, risks are\
    \ perceived to \nbe lower than farming under the rain-fed system.  \n \nFor most\
    \ farmers, the decision to plant is dependent on whether they also \nengage in\
    \ rice farming under rain-fed systems outside the scheme. Under such \ncircumstances,\
    \ resources are split to ensure production in and out of the \nscheme in the year.\
    \ Most farmers within the scheme are able to cultivate rice \nall year round due\
    \ to water availability. The dry season however comes with \na challenge where\
    \ low water levels affects water distribution to farmers \nwhose lands are downstream.\
    \ Irrigation charges and cost of renting lands \nwithin the scheme are also disincentives.\
    \ In the case where farmers have the \nfinancial capacity to acquire land and\
    \ ultimately secure land, the problem of \nwater management is not enough disincentive\
    \ to grow rice.  \n \nGovernance arrangements and adaptive decision-making \n\
    Chapter 3\n85\nThe next major decision is on land preparation. Farmers have access\
    \ to power \ntillers from the irrigation authority and hence are less stressed\
    \ in efforts to \nobtain machinery for land clearance. Furthermore, because lands\
    \ are not left \nfallow for long due to all year round cultivation, farmers have\
    \ little to clear \non the land at any point in time. For farmers who are indigenes\
    \ and live in \ncommunities around the scheme, farm labour required at this point\
    \ is mostly \nprovided by the household. Farmers who are non-indigenes and live\
    \ outside \nthe district hire labour from communities around the scheme when necessary.\
    \  \n \nThe activity of planting is done using the broadcasting method or lines\
    \ and \npegs. In the case where pegs are used, farmers adopt the dibbering method\
    \ \nand plant at intervals along the lines using pointed sticks/dibbers. Seeds\
    \ are \nobtained from agro-chemical shops and in some cases through the leadership\
    \ \nof the scheme where prospective buyers request for a particular variety to\
    \ be \ncultivated. The decision to cultivate a particular variety however remains\
    \ the \nsole prerogative of the farmer. Most farmers however opt for long term\
    \ \nvarieties as these are perceived to have higher yields when water is readily\
    \ \navailable for irrigation. \n \nWeed control is done individually but in some\
    \ cases in consultation with other \nfarmers who share boundaries to avert identified\
    \ diseases which have \ntendencies of spreading. Decisions on disease and weed\
    \ control are \nsometimes discussed collectively at the scheme level when identified.\
    \ In \nconsultation with technical staff at the irrigation authority, farmer decisions\
    \ \nat the farm level are also informed by inputs on the best practices of the\
    \ day \nfor weed and disease control. Farmers also benefit from technical advice\
    \ as \npart of interventions such as the Ghana Commercial Agriculture Project\
    \ \n(GCAP). Labour for weed control is provided by the household or hired. Both\
    \ \npre-emergent and post-emergent weedicides are applied dependent on \nfarmers’\
    \ financial capacities.  \nThe decision on when and what type of fertilizer to\
    \ apply on the farm is taken \nat the farm level. Fertilizers are applied through\
    \ a process of sprinkling or \nstrategic placement across the farmland. Fertilizer\
    \ types used are mostly same \nas those applied under the rain-fed system.  \n\
    \ \nChapter 3\n86\nThe decision on harvesting is made by the farmer guided by\
    \ pre-conditioned \nfactors in instances where there are buyers with specific\
    \ interests. The scheme \nmanager in providing support to farmers also solicits\
    \ for buyers who purchase \nrice in large quantities. Farmers thereby engage in\
    \ collective actions and \ndecision-making at this stage.  \n \n3.4.3 How adaptive\
    \ are decisions to water availability conditions under \nboth systems?  \nWater\
    \ availability is integral for rice production. With uncertainties in rainfall\
    \ \npatterns and weather conditions, farmers (especially under rain fed systems)\
    \ \nhave to adapt to conditions that could affect their productivity and output.\
    \ \nFrom the study, it is evident that farmers at each decision point make choices\
    \ \naimed at managing water scarcity (see Figure 3). The outcomes of decision\
    \ \noptions and how these facilitate adaptive water management on the farm is\
    \ \nfundamentally defined by both controllable and uncontrollable factors.  \n\
    \ \nHydro-climatic information and farmer experiential knowledge are key at this\
    \ \npoint. The absence of or inadequacy of long term information on variability\
    \ \nin weather conditions is detrimental to productivity especially when yields\
    \ \nfrom the previous season are low (see box 2). Farmers at each point have to\
    \ \nbe adaptive in their decision-making to maximize decision outcomes, learning\
    \ \nand attainment of new knowledge where possible. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \n \n \n \n \nBox 2: Weather conditions and adaptive decision-making \n“I relate\
    \ the weather now to exactly what we experienced in the late 1970s. Rains \nhave\
    \ been erratic affecting my farming activities outside the scheme. The rains do\
    \ \nnot come in the month of May when I used to prepare my land. I have to wait\
    \ till \nJune or July after a few rains before preparing my land. This is a major\
    \ challenge \nas I have no control over the rains and hence did not want to invest\
    \ my limited \nprofit into a possible failed harvest. I had to choose whether\
    \ to cultivate rice, \nmaize, raise livestock or support my wife with the money\
    \ in her food vending \nbusiness.”- Anonymous (Rain-fed rice farmer in Gbugli\
    \ Community). \n“A sense of how the weather will be at the beginning of the season\
    \ is all we need \nas we have no options on how to meet water needs on our farms.\
    \ Although my \nland is near the irrigation scheme, I do not have the machinery\
    \ required to pump \nwater from the dam unto my farmland. I therefore look up\
    \ to the gods for a good \nyear. This poses a lot of uncertainties on the way\
    \ forward for us as rice farmers.”- \nAnonymous (Rain-fed rice farmer in Sakuuba\
    \ Community). \n \n \nGovernance arrangements and adaptive decision-making \n\
    Chapter 3\n87\nFollowing the decision to cultivate rice, farmers have to deal\
    \ with the \nchallenge of preparing their lands at the ‘right’ time. Unpredictability\
    \ of \nweather conditions and limited access to some farm inputs make it \nchallenging.\
    \ Under rain-fed systems, the decision to use tractor could come \nwith the risk\
    \ of high cost of service and longer waiting period to access tractor \naffect\
    \ timely land clearance.  Thus access to tractor translates into timely land \n\
    clearance for the rains. For some farmers, a less expensive option will be to\
    \ \nuse bullock-powered carts which although not as quick as tractors are cost\
    \ \nsaving and timely as well. For other farmers manual labour is an option when\
    \ \nland size is smaller. Under irrigated farming systems, the availability of\
    \ water \nfor irrigation presents less stress in adaptive decision-making. Irrespective\
    \ of \nwhich method is used in land clearance, farmers are able to meet water\
    \ needs \non their farms. This however comes at a cost as farmers pay fees for\
    \ irrigation \nservices. However, methods that enable time saving could increase\
    \ the \nchances of the farmer completing the season in good time.  \n \nAdaptive\
    \ decision-making also involves choosing the type of seed variety to \ncultivate.\
    \ Long term varieties are a better hedge against flooding. Maturity \nperiods\
    \ are however longer and present a risk of stunted growth and low \nharvest should\
    \ the rains be erratic. Thus for most rain-fed rice farmers whose \nfarms are\
    \ more than 100 meters from the banks of the Bontanga river, planting \nshort\
    \ term varieties3 is a more adaptive option. Majority of short term \nvarieties\
    \ have higher market value thus an adaptive step could be to face the \nrisk of\
    \ water scarcity and aim at higher returns on sale of produce.  \n \nOn planting,\
    \ the broadcasting or dibbering method is least time consuming \nand best method\
    \ when planting is delayed or rainy days have been missed. \nBoth activities are\
    \ time consuming and could slow adaptation to rainfall \nconditions. Broadcasting\
    \ is common amongst rain-fed rice farmers \nconsidering low financial and labour\
    \ capital requirements. However, farmers \nface difficulty in applying fertilizer\
    \ in due time. Nursing and subsequent \n                                     \

    transplanting is best when preparations are started early and projected rainfall\
    \ \nwill be high.  \n \nFarmers during weedicide application consider soil moisture\
    \ content after \nsowing. Pre-emergent weedicides are applied at least 7 days\
    \ after sowing in \ncase soil moisture content is high and post emergent weedicides\
    \ after seeds \nsprout. Weedicides in some contexts are not applied at all due\
    \ to delayed rains \nand sprouting and thus an anticipated failed harvest. For\
    \ farmers who \ncultivated lands both in and out of the scheme in the season,\
    \ weedicides are \nchannelled only to land cultivated inside the scheme. The post\
    \ weedicide \napplication period is where most farmers lament and hence deem it\
    \ as the \n‘tipping point’ of the season. This is as a result of the inability\
    \ of farmers to \ncontrol conditions on the farm after this point. Thus, unfavourable\
    \ conditions \nwith regards to water availability is a recipe for disaster and\
    \ a sign of a \npossible failed harvest at the end of the year.  \n \nAdapting\
    \ to water scarcity requires a consideration of decision outcomes \nduring fertilizer\
    \ application. The first option is to apply compost within 2 \nweeks after planting.\
    \ Soil moisture content must be high to improve the \nassimilation of fertilizer\
    \ by the crop. This nevertheless does not guarantee \nhigher yields hence the\
    \ need to apply a second fertilizer (Ammonia) within \n25 days after planting\
    \ under good water conditions. For some farmers, risks \nassociated with water\
    \ is so high and hence not worth it applying fertilizer at \nall4 as low or no\
    \ rains result in failed harvests. \n \n \nExpected outcomes at harvest time is\
    \ a bountiful harvest. Water scarcity is \nnot an immediate consideration during\
    \ harvest time. Farmers consider using \ncombine harvesters or manual labour for\
    \ harvesting. Given the fact that \npreceding conditions such as water availability\
    \ and soil fertility have direct \nimpact on yields, adopting the most effective\
    \ method in harvesting to reduce \nlosses is a pre-requisite. Generally, the harvest\
    \ from most rain-fed rice farms \nin 2016/17 is one-fourth of what farmers harvested\
    \ in the wet season the \n                                                 \n\

    \ arrangements and adaptive decision-making \nChapter 3\n89\nprevious year. Thus\
    \ adaptive decisions involve using combine harvesters \nwhich is time efficient\
    \ and reduces crop loss. For other farmers, the evidence \nof failed or a good\
    \ year is predictable relational to activities preceding the \nactivity of harvesting.\
    \ Thus, a manual harvesting method could be used to \nsave financial resources.\

    \ Adaptive decision-making in rice farming systems \n \nGovernance arrangements\
    \ and adaptive decision-making \nChapter 3\n91\n \n \n3.4.4 What governance arrangements\
    \ exist in rice farming systems? \nTwo types of governance arrangements can be\
    \ identified in rice farming \nsystems. Within the irrigated rice farming system,\
    \ formal governance \narrangements with legal orientations can be seen to shape\
    \ activities and \ninteractions. Traditional governance arrangements although\
    \ pre-dominant in \nrain-fed rice farming systems had an impact on activities\
    \ in irrigated rice \nfarming.  \n \n3.4.1.1 Rain-fed farming systems \nUnder\
    \ rain-fed systems, decision-making is less coordinated and centres on \nhousehold\
    \ and community members. At the onset of the season, farmers \nmostly consult\
    \ members of their households in taking decisions. Other \nfarmers within the\
    \ community are also consulted when planning for the \nseason. Farmer decisions\
    \ are shaped by the rules and norms largely defined \nby communities. Communal\
    \ decision-making is led by traditional authorities, \nreligious leaders and locally\
    \ elected leaders such as the Assembly member. \nConflicts amongst farmers are\
    \ also resolved at chief palaces under the \nleadership of chiefs and elders.\
    \ Chiefs as custodians of communal owned \nresources such as land and water resources\
    \ ensure all inhabitants are able to \nmeet water needs. For rice farmers, meeting\
    \ household water needs is equally \na priority as water for irrigation purposes.\
    \ The chief’s palace is thus a safe \nhaven to manage conflicts on water use.\
    \  \nMen wield a lot of authority at the household level as heads of households.\
    \ \nTraditionally, land is willed to male members of the household as women are\
    \ \nexpected to eventually change names after marriage. Household names are \n\
    thus traced through male descendants. This automatically limits the ability of\
    \ \nfemale farmers to access land or expand area under cultivation. Women \ninvolved\
    \ in rice farming mostly work with their spouse. Culturally, women \nare perceived\
    \ as ‘helpers’ and hence are required to support their spouses on \nthe farm rather\
    \ than cultivate vast acres of land. Hence, the potential of \nwomen is limited\
    \ to their engagement by their husbands. The high sense of \ncommunalism serves\
    \ as a useful resource in meeting labour costs on farms. \nHere, rice farmers\
    \ receive labour support from other community members for \nChapter 3\n92\n \n\
    \ \nreciprocation on their farmlands. This is typically the case in smaller \n\
    communities such as Kpegu-Biegu, Voggu and Kpegu-Bagurugu.  \n \n3.4.4.2 Irrigated\
    \ rice farming \nOperations within the scheme are guided by formal governance\
    \ arrangements \nat the national, regional and local levels. At the national level,\
    \ the Ghana \nIrrigation Development Authority (GIDA) gives mandate to operations\
    \ \nwithin the scheme. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the \nWater\
    \ Resources Commissions (WRC) grant user rights on water use for \nirrigation\
    \ purposes. Operations at the scheme level are led by the Manager. \nThe scheme\
    \ manager periodically consults the Ghana Meteorological Agency \n(GMA) for weather\
    \ information which guides decisions on water use. The \nSavannah Research Institute\
    \ (SARI) also provides scientific information to \ninform agronomic practices.\
    \  \n \nThe scheme manager leads decision-making at the scheme level. Technical\
    \ \ndecisions on management of the dam and ancillary facilities within the \n\
    scheme are matters of interest. Farmer associations exist with leadership \nresponsible\
    \ for liaising between farmers and management. Farmlands are put \nin blocks with\
    \ leaders responsible for managing laterals and monitoring water \ndistribution\
    \ for irrigation purposes. A schedule is drafted at the beginning of \nthe year\
    \ on how and when water will be discharged to laterals. Block leaders \nwork closely\
    \ with leaders of their respective farmer associations for farm \nlevel decision-making.\
    \ Sub-committees set up (as part of L.I 350 of the \nIrrigations Development Authority)\
    \ to augment efforts of the manager \ninclude the Maintenance, Finance, Marketing\
    \ and Welfare committees. \nTraditional authorities whose lands fall within the\
    \ catchment area of the dam \nand own farmlands are also primary stakeholders\
    \ in the context of decision-\nmaking on water use. Traditional authorities are\
    \ also consulted by the scheme \nmanager in managing conflicts on water use. \
    \ \n \n \n \n \nGovernance arrangements and adaptive decision-making \nChapter\
    \ 3\n93\n \n \n3.4.5 How do governance arrangements enable or constrain adaptive\
    \ \ndecision-making? \nConsiderably, governance arrangements impact adaptive decisions\
    \ made \nunder both farming systems. These arrangements in some context propelled\
    \ \nand improved adaptive decisions whereas other arrangements appeared as \n\
    limiting factors.  \n \n3.4.5.1 Rain-fed rice farming \nGovernance and decision-making\
    \ are not mutually exclusive under the rain-\nfed system. Farmers who cultivate\
    \ rice under this system operate within the \ncultural and social settings shaping\
    \ norms, rules and beliefs in their \ncommunities. For example, although farmers\
    \ take decisions at the household \nlevel, they are expected to adhere to directives\
    \ from chiefs, unit committee \nmembers, the assembly member, other leaders even\
    \ if unfavourable but in the \ninterest of the community. With the existence of\
    \ multi users of the Bontansi \nRiver, rice farmers are required to consider the\
    \ interests of other users such \nas other crop farmers, livestock keepers and\
    \ households. From section 4.1.1 \nrain-fed rice farmers mostly rely on the weather\
    \ in meeting water needs for \nactivities such as planting. Farmers equally explore\
    \ alternatives such as the \nuse of small water pumps to discharge water from\
    \ tributaries of the Bontansi \nRiver unto their farmlands. The scuffle for water\
    \ by various users sometimes \nresults in pollution of the water making it unwholesome\
    \ for their use. This \nposes a challenge to farmers in meeting water needs and\
    \ adaptive decision-\nmaking. Cultural practices within communities for example\
    \ prohibit women \nfrom leading the decision-making process especially in male\
    \ headed \nhouseholds. This has impact on their input on key decisions. Thus adaptive\
    \ \ndecision-making is male centred limiting the possibility of reducing risks\
    \ and \nsocial learning. As seen in section 4.1.1, land is also mostly owned by\
    \ men \nthereby limiting the ability of women to contribute directly to increasing\
    \ \nproduction under uncertain water sensitive conditions.  \n \nNevertheless,\
    \ the spirit of communalism is an enabler of adaptive decision-\nmaking in some\
    \ circumstances. For example, the fact that rice farmers live \nwithin the same\
    \ community as some owners of bullock-powered ploughs \nChapter 3\n94\n \n \n\
    enable access to their services on credit when they have to prepare their lands\
    \ \nfor planting as presented in 4.1.1. Labour needs during planting are also\
    \ met \nas a result of ‘labour-for-labour’ governance arrangements. Here, farmers\
    \ \ntake turns to support each other during planting, fertilizer application and\
    \ \nharvesting. This enhances the capacity of farmers to adaptively decide their\
    \ \nactions. Strong community cohesion patterned by traditional rules of \nengagement\
    \ also allow for collective decision-making in managing \nchallenges of water\
    \ availability. From section 4.1.1 it is evident that farmers \nspend time interacting\
    \ and sharing knowledge in open spaces at random or \nagreed times at all stages\
    \ of their decision-making. In Sakuuba for example, \ncommunity meetings organised\
    \ by chiefs afford them the opportunity to \ndiscuss water conflicts and how best\
    \ to manage them. Through adaptive \ndecisions, water users within the community\
    \ are able to improve water \nmanagement practices which equally translate to\
    \ better conditions of water \navailability for rice farming. \n  \n3.4.5.2 Irrigated\
    \ rice farming \nThe regulatory framework (L.I 1350- Ghana Irrigation Development\
    \ \nauthority Act, 1987) defining operations within the irrigation scheme explains\
    \ \nauthority and power relations. Here, the Scheme manager is seen as the final\
    \ \nauthority at the scheme level and hence controls water user rights. Under\
    \ the \nleadership of the scheme manager, periodic meetings are held for broad\
    \ \ndecisions which affect all actors within the irrigation scheme. This usually\
    \ \ncomprises of the scheme manager, water bailiffs, block leaders, lateral \n\
    managers and farmers. Thus, key decisions as outlined under section 4.1.2 \nbegin\
    \ with discussions which have water management at the core. Thus \nstrategic water\
    \ dependent adaptive decision-making begins at the managerial \nlevel with most\
    \ tactical decisions taken by farmers at the farm level. For \nexample, from section\
    \ 4.2.2, water bailiffs guided by agreed schedules \ndischarge water to irrigate\
    \ farmlands. Farmers however take the tactical \nadaptive decisions of water sufficiency\
    \ on their farms. Farmers monitor their \nfarms and are able to control inflow\
    \ to avoid flooding. The presence of \nscheduled timelines for irrigation highly\
    \ influences farmer decisions on when \nto plant, apply weedicides and also fertilizer\
    \ on their farmlands.  \n \nGovernance arrangements and adaptive decision-making\
    \ \nChapter 3\n95\n \n \nContrastingly, farmers can also not decide to discharge\
    \ water to irrigate their \nfarms at their own timing but rather follow agreed\
    \ schedules even during \nemergencies. During dry seasons, water discharge comes\
    \ with power play \nwith some chiefs continuously receiving water on their farmlands\
    \ at the \nexpense of other farmers. Also, laterals 1 to 7 conveniently access\
    \ water even \nduring the dry season as opposed to laterals 8 to 14. The exhibition\
    \ of powers \nthus creates a situation where Chiefs, leadership of farmer groups\
    \ and farmers \nfavoured by them are mostly able to secure lands within laterals\
    \ 1 to 7. Thus \nfor farmers with less influence, their decisions must consider\
    \ such risks and \nhow these could be constraints towards adaptive decision-making.\
    \ In essence, \nwater dependent adaptive decision-making is not mutually exclusive\
    \ of rules \nand processes already defined as part of water management strategies\
    \ and \nagreements.  \n \nThe institutional space within which stakeholders relate\
    \ significantly impacts \ndecision making processes and outcomes. These include\
    \ formally entrenched \nframeworks such as constitutions, ad-hoc rules of engagement\
    \ and \norganograms defining hierarchy and power in public and private spheres.\
    \ \nSimilarly, undocumented laws, rules and norms which are usually embedded \n\
    in the cultural fabric of communities explicitly or implicitly construct the \n\
    process of decision-making, framing the boundaries for who, what and when \ndecisions\
    \ could be made. Adapting in a highly volatile environment such as \nthe one in\
    \ which rice farmers operate requires a continuous process of \ncognitive revision\
    \ through experimentation, learning and re-adjustment in \nadaptive decision-making.\
    \  \n \nThe existence of a regulatory framework within the scheme also means that\
    \ \nfarmers operate in line with communication and power symmetries. From \nsection\
    \ 4.2.2, the lateral manager (one voluntary farmer plays this role at a \nparticular\
    \ time) is the first point of contact for farmers should they have \nchallenges\
    \ with water flow on their farmlands. He is then expected to forward \nconcerns\
    \ to the water bailiff in the absence of an immediate solution. With \nthe scheme\
    \ manager at the end of the bureaucratic complaint chain the timing \nof farmer\
    \ decision and implementation of adaptive actions in relation to water \nmanagement\
    \ on their farms is affected. From 4.2.2, farmers, as a rule, are \nChapter 3\n\
    96\n \n \nrequired to desilt canals that convey water unto their farms. Thus,\
    \ for a farmer \ndownstream, the efficient and timely undertaking of this activity\
    \ by another \nfarmer upstream is critical. For example, soil moisture at the\
    \ point of fertilizer \napplication must be high or sufficient. In the case of\
    \ non-adherence by some \nfarmers to desilt canals, those downstream potentially\
    \ are faced with stunted \ngrowth of their rice due to low moisture conditions.\
    \ The weak implementation \nof punitive measures also means that farmers who refuse\
    \ to clear their laterals \ncould only be cautioned by block leaders and/or lateral\
    \ managers. The \nexistence of informal relationships and the culture of respect\
    \ for ‘senior \ncitizens’ within communities limit the ability of lateral managers\
    \ to enforce \nrules to the core. Leaders of farmer associations equally enjoy\
    \ some priority \nwhen farmers are to benefit from interventions such as trainings,\
    \ seminars \nand out-of-farm collaborative arrangements with private institutions.\
    \ The \nabsence of a system for knowledge transfer also means that leaders who\
    \ \nbenefit from such capacity building are not obliged to transfer knowledge\
    \ \nacquired. Hence, some farmers are at risk of losing relevant information \n\
    which could improve their adaptive decision-making.  \n \n 3.5 Discussion \nIn\
    \ this section, we discuss the implications of our results and the relationship\
    \ \nbetween key concepts as studied in both rice farming systems. We further \n\
    attempt a so-called ex ante reflection spelling the potential of hydro-climatic\
    \ \ninformation to inform adaptive decision-making. We further estimate how \n\
    governance arrangements could enable or inhibit information access for \nadaptive\
    \ decision-making. In essence, our conclusions and propositions \nrelated to the\
    \ potential of hydro-climatic information and EVOs in adaptive \ndecision-making\
    \ is based on reflections. \n \n3.5.1 Reflection on key concepts: adaptive governance\
    \ and adaptive \ndecision-making \nIn our attempt to contribute to theoretical\
    \ dispositions on adaptive governance \nof food systems, the study focused on\
    \ governance arrangements and adaptive \ndecision-making in rice farming systems.\
    \ It emerged that governance \narrangements evolved with learning and experimenting\
    \ in adaptive decisions-\nGovernance arrangements and adaptive decision-making\
    \ \nChapter 3\n97\n \n \nmaking. An inverse relationship could also be identified\
    \ with adaptive \ndecisions being streamlined in response to adaptive governance\
    \ arrangements \n(Feola, Lerner, Jain, Montefrio, & Nicholas, 2015). Both conditions\
    \ are due \nto the consistent shift in ecological variables such as river discharge,\
    \ \ntemperature and rainfall rendering supposed solutions expressed in adaptive\
    \ \ndecision-making becoming part of the problem or rather ineffective thereby\
    \ \nrequiring newer strategies and actions. Also, formal and traditional \ngovernance\
    \ arrangements were found to be interwoven given the involvement \nof farmers\
    \ in both systems. In establishing further the place of both \ngovernance arrangements\
    \ in adaptive decision-making, the study concludes \nthat formal governance arrangements\
    \ must have traditional governance \narrangements as sub-structures in their design\
    \ or a complement of both.  \n \nWe conclude that studies on adaptive governance\
    \ of food systems must \nempirically explore the relationship between governance\
    \ arrangements and \nadaptive decision-making (especially in water governance)\
    \ (see also \nRouillard, Heal, Ball, & Reeves, 2013; Dewulf, Mancero, Cárdenas,\
    \ & \nSucozhanay, 2011). We equally admit that although the study stepped out\
    \ to \nstudy adaptive governance, it focused on only two key components of the\
    \ \ntheory; governance arrangements and adaptive decision-making. Thus, our \n\
    conclusion will better reflect the theory only in the context within which it\
    \ \nhas been applied.  \n \n3.5.2 Governance arrangements and the potential of\
    \ hydro-climatic \ninformation  \n3.7.2.1 Under rain-fed systems \nTraditional\
    \ governance arrangements put Chiefs and other community leaders \nat the forefront\
    \ of decision-making within communities. Inhabitants of \ncommunities willingly\
    \ submit to calls from the aforementioned for collective \naction and decision-making\
    \ on matters of importance. The platform created \nby traditional leaders serves\
    \ as a medium for information dissemination \nnecessary for decision-making amongst\
    \ rice farmers. Citizens as part of \nreligious routines pray together at mosques\
    \ and churches located within their \ncommunities. This creates avenues for channelling\
    \ information. Also, farmers \nChapter 3\n98\n \n \nas a result of social networks\
    \ defined by culture and lifestyle meet \nperiodically to socialize and this creates\
    \ an avenue for information sharing \nand exchange.  \n \nOn the other hand, tradition\
    \ also requires that community entry begins with \nconsultation with Chiefs and\
    \ community leaders. This arrangement means \ninformation service providers in\
    \ trying to engage rice farmers must seek \nconsent from Chiefs as they are the\
    \ custodians of the land and rulers of the \npeople. In the instant where permission\
    \ is not granted, rice farmers will lose \nrelevant information which goes a long\
    \ way to improve their decisions. Also, \ncitizens esteem knowledge handed over\
    \ from older generations. In the \ninstance where information from external providers\
    \ contradict their \ntraditional knowledge and processes, some farmers will reject\
    \ new knowledge \nand continue with the old way of doing things. This can translate\
    \ into low \nacceptance and use of new knowledge resulting in knowledge conflicts\
    \ \nputting farmers at crossroads as to the way forward. Thirdly, weak \ninteractions\
    \ between the District Assembly and communities can limit the \nimpact of programmes\
    \ aimed at providing farmers with information through \npublic sector programmes.\
    \ The absence of rice farmer associations in \ncommunities could limit the dissemination\
    \ of hydro-climatic information \nshould they be made available. Although rice\
    \ farmers meet periodically \nwithin communities, activities are less structured\
    \ with no conclusive actions \ntaken in pursuit of hydro-climatic information.\
    \  \n \n3.7.2.1 Within the irrigation scheme \nHydro-climatic information has\
    \ can improve farmer decision on water use. \nSam and Dzandu (2016) also attest\
    \ to information relevance for food \nproduction in Ghana. This is however dependent\
    \ on the extent to which \ngovernance arrangements make such possible. Arrangements\
    \ within the \nscheme present a clear structure for information flow and decision-making.\
    \ \nThe scheme manager as part of overseeing general operations within the \n\
    scheme channels relevant information either through leaders of farmer \nassociations,\
    \ members of ad-hoc committees or directly to farmers at \nmeetings. Such organised\
    \ arrangements create the opportunity for directly \ncommunicating hydro-climatic\
    \ information received for use by farmers. \nGovernance arrangements and adaptive\
    \ decision-making \nChapter 3\n99\n \n \nCurrently, the partnership between GMA\
    \ and GIDA has yielded positive \noutcomes such that GIDA is able to receive information\
    \ on rainfall \nprojections as estimated by GMA. Such information contributes\
    \ to informed \ndecisions on water use within the reservoir. However, the all\
    \ year round \navailability of water in the dam for irrigation purposes within\
    \ the scheme \nlimits the urgency and need for hydro-climatic information. The\
    \ variation in \nwater level nevertheless makes it relevant to track hydro-climatic\
    \ conditions \nvia relevant information sources. Communication processes must\
    \ adopt smart \napproaches such as the use of social platforms for quick dissemination\
    \ of \ninformation where applicable.  \n \n3.5.3 Potential hydro-climatic information\
    \ for adaptive decision-making \nThe availability of timely and reliable hydro-climatic\
    \ information at each \nphase of decision-making can improve adaptation (see also\
    \ Wood, Jina, Jain, \nKristjanson, & DeFries, 2014) efforts in rice production\
    \ systems. Farmers \nrely on traditional knowledge with some receiving information\
    \ on daily \nweather forecasts. However, obtaining information on daily precipitation\
    \ and \ntemperature values which are area specific could improve adaptive decisions\
    \ \nat different decision points (see also Aker, Ghosh, & Burrell, 2016). Hydro-\n\
    climatic information received at the community level informs the planning of \n\
    daily schedules for water discharge for irrigation within the scheme.  \n \nAt\
    \ the onset of the rainy season, the scheme manager together with farmers \nwithin\
    \ the scheme design a daily schedule for water discharge from the dam \nunto farmlands.\
    \ Here, information on rainfall and temperature values can \ncontribute to a more\
    \ precise strategy and outcome (see also Fosu-Mensah et \nal., 2012; Kemausuor,\
    \ Dwamena, Bart-Plange, & Kyei-Baffour, 2011). For \nexample, the water manager\
    \ will be able to estimate likely water volumes \nwithin the dam. Plans on supplementary\
    \ irrigation could be improved as \ninformation from GMA and private institutions\
    \ show the periods where the \narea is likely to experience heavy rainfall. Information\
    \ on temperature values \nfor the area could also come in handy during the dry\
    \ season when the rains \nhave seized for effective planning on water use from\
    \ the dam.  \n \nChapter 3\n100\n \n \nFor farmers under rain-fed systems, information\
    \ on daily and seasonal rainfall \nvalues could guide their decisions on whether\
    \ or not to engage in rice farming \nas most rely on the rains directly to meet\
    \ water needs on their rice farms. \nChiefs, religious leaders, radio and local\
    \ political representatives such as the \nAssembly member could serve as channels\
    \ for information dissemination to \nfarmers within communities (see also Aker\
    \ & Fafchamps, 2015; Sam et al., \n2017). During land preparation, information\
    \ on rainfall is equally relevant for \nfarmers under rain-fed systems. Here,\
    \ farmers are able to plan the number of \ndays they have to use in clearing their\
    \ lands to avoid being caught up in heavy \ndownpour which makes it difficult\
    \ to use machinery such as tractors and \ntillers on the land. During planting\
    \ farmers decide on whether to cultivate \nshort term or long term varieties guided\
    \ by experience and projections on \nrainfall for the season. Readily available\
    \ information on daily precipitation \ncomes in handy in making choices on variety\
    \ to plant. The story at the point \nof fertilizer application is no different.\
    \ Information on precipitation has the \ntendency of guiding decisions on what\
    \ quantities of fertilizer to apply and \nwhen. This will curb the situation where\
    \ fertilizer applied is washed away by \nthe rains adding up to cost burdens and\
    \ losses mostly borne by the farmer and \nhis household.  \n \n 3.5.4 EVOs and\
    \ adaptive governance  \nTechnology based platforms are today being developed\
    \ to support natural \nresource \ngovernance \nthrough \ninformation \nmanagement,\
    \ \nimproved \nstakeholder interaction and decision-making (see also Termeer &\
    \ Bruinsma, \n2016; Pimm et al., 2014; Buytaert et al., 2014). Decisions on irrigation\
    \ and \nwater use for example can be improved if farmers and water managers have\
    \ \naccess to timely information from relevant institutions. In adaptive decision-\n\
    making discourse, information must not just be available but also timely and \n\
    relevant for farmers and water managers. \n \nCurrently, two systems of governance\
    \ exist in rice production systems in the \nBontanga area with an enormous number\
    \ of stakeholders involved. The \nsituation has resulted in poor and unregulated\
    \ interaction limiting the ability \nto deal with complex challenges faced by\
    \ rice farmers. As it emerged, the \nBontansi River is central to the activities\
    \ of all rice farmers irrespective of \nGovernance arrangements and adaptive decision-making\
    \ \nChapter 3\n101\n \n \nwhich system they operated in. Hence creating the opportunity\
    \ for \nstakeholder collaboration in water management could be beneficial. As\
    \ \nargued by Termeer and Bruinsma (2016) however, there is the need to bridge\
    \ \nphysical, cognitive and social boundaries. EVOs thus present an opportunity\
    \ \nfor collaborative governance by providing the platform for interactive \n\
    engagement, information sharing and the leap over social boundaries \n(Karpouzoglou\
    \ et al., 2016a).  \n \nIn the case of water management, an EVO that provides\
    \ timely information \nand enables stakeholders to consolidate observed changes\
    \ in weather \nconditions can essentially improve decisions on water use for irrigation.\
    \ Here, \nthe MSD, ISD, water managers and farmers can directly contribute to\
    \ \npredicting weather indices irrespective of their location and rice production\
    \ \nsystem being practiced. Local knowledge used by farmers in predicting the\
    \ \nweather could be synthesised with scientific knowledge to improve \npredictability\
    \ and make adaptation more locally relevant. Chiefs and leaders \nin communities\
    \ studied could sensitize and stir interest of all stakeholders in \ncommunities\
    \ to contribute to information gathering, discussions and creation \nof new knowledge\
    \ for adaptive decision-making. Given that stakeholders \nunder both systems admit\
    \ to water dependent decision-making, a coordinated \nprocess which brings stakeholders\
    \ together could be the beginning of \nrealising the goal of an operational EVO\
    \ for water management.  \n \n3.6  Conclusions \nThe study establishes a correlation\
    \ between governance arrangements and \nadaptive decision-making in adaptive governance.\
    \ Evidence from the field \nsuggests that adaptive decision-making within irrigated\
    \ and rain-fed rice \nproduction systems vary. Farmers under both systems operate\
    \ within different \ngovernance arrangements which are both enablers and inhibitors\
    \ given \nconditions. For adaptive governance of rice farming systems within the\
    \ area, \nthere must be a synergy of both formal and traditional governance \n\
    arrangements as these are not mutually exclusive. Following our ex ante \nevaluation\
    \ on the place of information in adaptive decision-making, we point \nto the need\
    \ for further research on information access and use, power play, \ngender and\
    \ information systems enabling information exchange and \nChapter 3\n102\n \n\
    \ \nknowledge creation which essentially influence water dependent adaptive \n\
    decision-making.  \n \nIn Bontanga, bottlenecks to information exchange must be\
    \ considered in the \ndesign of Environmental Virtual Observatories. Much appropriately,\
    \ research \non what information systems exist and how these are operationalised\
    \ within \ncurrent governance arrangements is critical. Water availability is\
    \ central in \nboth the design of governance arrangements and adaptive decision-making\
    \ \nwithin the study area. This emphasises the significance of hydro-climatic\
    \ \ninformation in the area hence the need to study what information exists, the\
    \ \nknowledge they provide and the systems being deployed to disseminate them.\

    Abstract \nFarmers in rice farming systems in Northern Ghana face uncertainties\
    \ \nresulting from variation in climatic and social conditions and hence the need\
    \ \nto adapt their decisions. The paper presents what substantive and institutional\
    \ \nuncertainties farmers face and the underpinning logics evident in adaptive\
    \ \ndecision-making. The paper poses the overall question “What uncertainties\
    \ \nand corresponding decision logics inform farmer adaptive decision-making?”\
    \ \nUsing an exploratory design, 135 rice farmers from 9 communities in the \n\
    Kumbungu District were engaged through interviews and focus group \ndiscussions.\
    \ The study showed that both the logic of consequentiality and the \nlogic of\
    \ appropriateness are underpinning factors in farmer adaptive decision-\nmaking.\
    \ Some adaptive decisions underpinned by the logic of \nconsequentiality include:\
    \ multi-cropping; cultivating inside and outside the \nirrigation scheme and;\
    \ vary planting date based on forecast. Adaptive \ndecisions where the logic of\
    \ appropriateness comes into play include: \ncultivating rice by convenience under\
    \ defined land user rights and; adopting \nplanting method used by other farmers.\
    \ We conclude that hydro-\nmeteorological forecast can help farmers manage substantive\
    \ uncertainty by \nmeeting information needs such as rainfall onset and distribution\
    \ as well as \nhydrological information on dam water levels within the scheme.\
    \ Also, \nforecast information provided without recognition of institutional uncertainty\
    \ \nwithin farming systems could end up being ignored by some farmers. \n \n \n\

    Chapter 4\n107\n \n \n4.1 Introduction \nClimate variability in the form of change\
    \ in rainfall patterns and temperature \nresults in water scarcity, drought and\
    \ flooding pose threats to agriculture and \nfood production in sub-Saharan Africa.\
    \ Most especially, smallholders suffer \nseverely in meeting food and income needs\
    \ from farming due to water \nscarcity, soil infertility and long periods of droughts\
    \ (Cooper et al., 2008; \nInder et al., 2017; Morton, 2007). In Ghana, climate\
    \ variability threatens the \nactivities of rural farmers in the Northern part\
    \ of the country (Asare-Bediako \net al., 2007; Donkoh & Awuni, 2011; Etwire,\
    \ Al-Hassan, Kuwornu, & Osei-\nOwusu, 2013; Laube et al., 2012; Nyadzi et al.,\
    \ 2019; Nyamekye, Dewulf, \nVan Slobbe, Termeer, & Pinto, 2018). The region falls\
    \ within the guinea \nsavannah zone and experiences long periods of drought, high\
    \ temperatures \nand erratic rainfall conditions, presenting farmers with numerous\
    \ \nuncertainties in decision-making at the farm level (Antwi-Agyei, Fraser, \n\
    Dougill, Stringer, & Simelton, 2012; Armah et al., 2011; Codjoe, 2007; \nLançon\
    \ & Benz, 2007). Recent studies (Mase & Prokopy, 2014; Roco, \nEngler, Bravo-Ureta,\
    \ & Jara-Rojas, 2014) point to how the provision of \nhydro-meteorological information\
    \ can minimize uncertainties and improve \nfarmer adaptive decision-making. However,\
    \ understanding what objects of \nuncertainty exist, and how these are reflected\
    \ in farmer adaptive decision-\nmaking is crucial in determining farmer information\
    \ needs. \n \nIn the Kumbungu district in the Northern region of Ghana, rice farmers\
    \ \ncultivating rainfed or irrigated rice often need to adapt their decisions\
    \ to meet \nwater needs when relying on rainfall or supplementary irrigation.\
    \ Adapting \ntheir decisions means that farmers must observe and attempt to manage\
    \ \nuncertainties about future events especially regarding the availability of\
    \ \nwater. Here, the pursuit of information on weather and seasonal forecasts\
    \ \nfrom both scientific and indigenous sources is of priority to farmers \n(Balehegn,\
    \ Balehey, Fu, & Liang, 2019; Kanno et al., 2013; Nyadzi et al., \n2019).  \n\
    \ \nIncreasingly, research on uncertainty and adaptive decision-making in \nfarming\
    \ is on the ascendancy (Beckford, 2002; Dittrich, Wreford, Topp, Eory, \n& Moran,\
    \ 2017; Li, Guo, Bijman, & Heerink, 2018). This is attributable to \nChapter 4\n\
    108\n \n \nthe high sensitivity of farming activities to volatile conditions such\
    \ as climate \nchange, environmental degradation, resource conflict, urbanisation\
    \ and \ninstitutional change (Crush & Battersby, 2016; Daher & Mohtar, 2015; Eakin,\
    \ \n2005; Nyadzi et al., 2018). Similarly, numerous studies have pointed to the\
    \ \nneed for reliable and timely provision of relevant seasonal and weather \n\
    forecast in managing uncertainties in farming systems (Ali & Kumar, 2011; \nJones,\
    \ 1993; Kabir, Cramb, Alauddin, & Gaydon, 2019; Mase & Prokopy, \n2014; Pannell,\
    \ 2003; Zheng et al., 2011) to improve farmer decision-making. \nHowever, defining\
    \ seasonal and weather forecast also requires accounting for \nthe interaction\
    \ between uncertainties, information needs and farm level \nadaptive decision-making.\
    \ Firstly, the forms or objects of uncertainty that \nfarmers are faced with in\
    \ adaptive decision-making is under-researched. \nRecent studies have focused\
    \ on biophysical aspects of climate uncertainty \nthrough improved modelling (Berliner,\
    \ 2003; Burnham, Ma, Endter-Wada, & \nBardsley, 2016; Kundzewicz et al., 2018;\
    \ Xia et al., 2017). The works of Heal \nand Millner (2013) and Drouet and Emmerling\
    \ (2016) are a few that point to \nbroad socio-economic uncertainties relating\
    \ to climate change. Secondly, \nalthough research on adaptive decision-making\
    \ has gained traction, much \nemphasis is placed on decision options and not the\
    \ logics underlying farmer \nadaptive decision-making (Gebrehiwot & van der Veen,\
    \ 2013; Moller, \nDrews, & Larsen, 2017).  \n \nThe paper aims to contribute to\
    \ literature on how uncertainty impacts adaptive \ndecision-making and how the\
    \ provision of relevant hydro-meteorological \ninformation can improve farmers’\
    \ adaptive decision-making in rice farming \nsystems. The paper also explores\
    \ the logics of decision-making underneath \nadaptive decision-making at the farm\
    \ level in better interpreting decisions. \nThe paper makes reference to two decision\
    \ logics: the logic of \nconsequentiality and the logic of appropriateness anchored\
    \ on the work of \nMarch, (1991). Both logics provide a pathway to understanding\
    \ adaptive \ndecision-making given uncertainty and information. Most studies have\
    \ used \neconomic models (Güth, 2004; Pascucci et al., 2015; Risbey et al., 1999)\
    \ \nwhich rather make it difficult to measure the complexity of human behaviour\
    \ \n(Ascough, Maier, Ravalico, & Strudley, 2008; Karali, Rounsevell, & \nDoherty,\
    \ 2011). Other studies also opine that decision-making is not always \nUncertainty,\
    \ decision logics and adaptive decision-making\nChapter 4\n109\n \n \nprofit oriented\
    \ but follows multiple pathways induced by economic, social, \npsychological,\
    \ biophysical and ecological issues (Robert et al., 2017; Moller \net al., 2017).\
    \ However, there is the need for a framework ‘that enables the \nuncertainties\
    \ associated with human inputs to be accounted for explicitly’ \n(Ascough et al.,\
    \ 2008) in adaptive decision-making. \n \nA key question is do farmers in their\
    \ response to abnormal or unexpected \nconditions consider the outcome of their\
    \ choices (logic of consequentiality) \nor rather the practice driven by changing\
    \ rules (logic of appropriateness) in \nadaptive decision-making? In addressing\
    \ this scientific gap the paper poses \nthe overall question “What uncertainties\
    \ and corresponding decision logics \ninform farmer adaptive decision-making?”.\
    \ In line with this the study poses \nfour (4) specific questions:  \ni. \nwhich\
    \ decision logics guide farmers’ decisions?  \nii. \nwhat uncertainties do farmers\
    \ face when taking those decisions?  \niii. \nwhich decision options are more\
    \ adaptive?  \niv. \nwhat information can inform these decisions?  \n \n4.2 Theoretical\
    \ framework \nUncertainty within social and ecological systems is the reason why\
    \ decision \nmakers have to adapt their choices and actions in order to optimize\
    \ utilities. \nFocusing on decision-making, Brugnach et al. (2008) conceptualised\
    \ \nuncertainty as ‘a knowledge relationship between a decision maker and the\
    \ \nsocio-techno-environmental system at hand’ due to unpredictability, \nincomplete\
    \ knowledge and multiple knowledge frames. Dewulf and \nBiesbroek (2018) in conceptualizing\
    \ uncertainty posit 9 types of uncertainties \nwith reference to the works of\
    \ Kwakkel et al. (2010), and Koppenjan and \nKlijn (2004). Dewulf and Biesbroek\
    \ (2018) discuss the nature of uncertainty \nby including ambiguity to those already\
    \ discussed (epistemic and ontological \nuncertainty) in literature, and discuss\
    \ institutional and strategic uncertainty as \nobjects of uncertainty in addition\
    \ to substantive uncertainty evident in other \nstudies (Brugnach, Dewulf, Pahl-Wostl,\
    \ & Taillieu, 2008; Kwakkel, Walker, \n& Marchau, 2010).  \n \nChapter 4\n110\n\
    \ \n \nThis paper focuses on two of the objects of uncertainty: substantive \n\
    uncertainty and institutional uncertainty. Koppenjan and Klijn (2004) define \n\
    substantive uncertainty as uncertainty regarding the content of decisions due\
    \ \nto either the lack of information or diverging frames about the information.\
    \ \nDosi and Egidi (2000) attribute substantive uncertainty to the lack of \n\
    information about environmental events. Substantive uncertainty is also \nassociated\
    \ with gaps and conflicting understanding in knowledge with the \nconsequence\
    \ that there is limited understanding of the nature of a problem \n(Head, 2014).\
    \ Institutional uncertainty refers to ‘uncertainty about the rules \nof the game\
    \ in decision-making’ (Koppenjan & Klijn, 2004) and how they \ntransform. Institutional\
    \ uncertainty is a result of expected change in \ninstitutional arrangements.\
    \  \n \nWe also draw from decision-making literature anchored on the seminal works\
    \ \nof March and Olsen on neo-institutionalism (March, 2011; March & Olsen, \n\
    2004; Olsen, 2007). The authors introduce two logics characterising decision-\n\
    making: Logic of Consequentiality (LoC) and the Logic of Appropriateness \n(LoA).\
    \ They relate the LoC to standard theories of choice which perceive \ndecision-making\
    \ as intentional in the presence of knowledge of alternatives, \na knowledge of\
    \ consequences, a consistent preference ordering and decision \nrules. It is the\
    \ logic of calculation and ‘rational choice’ among alternatives \n(Rommetvedt,\
    \ 2006). Decision-making is ‘consequential-and within the \nlimits imposed by\
    \ information constraints and conflict-intendedly rational’ \n(March, 1991). On\
    \ the other hand, LoA perceives human action to be driven \nby rules of exemplary\
    \ behaviour, organised into institutions (March & Olsen, \n2004). March and Olsen\
    \ earlier somewhat prioritized the logic of \nappropriateness over the logic of\
    \ consequentiality until recently \n(Rommetvedt, 2006). LoA contends that decisions\
    \ are shaped by situational \ncontexts, one’s identity and the application of\
    \ rules (Weber & Johnson, 2009).  \n \nWe assume a relationship between uncertainties\
    \ and logics of decision-\nmaking in adapting to changing conditions in rice farming\
    \ systems. Cleary, \nLoC assumes that decision makers consider what alternatives\
    \ they have and \ntheir possible outcomes considering information available. Koppenjan\
    \ and \nKlijn (2004) point to substantive uncertainty as the lack of information\
    \ or \nUncertainty, decision logics and adaptive decision-making\nChapter 4\n\
    111\n \n \ndivergent frames of information. Such substantive uncertainty is of\
    \ \nimportance to decision-making aligning with the logic of consequentiality.\
    \ \nThe reference to institutional uncertainty points to uncertainty about rules\
    \ and \nhow they serve as underpinnings of decision-making in line with the logic\
    \ of \nappropriateness (Dewulf, Klenk, Wyborn, & Lemos, 2020). Thus, decision-\n\
    making in rice farming systems can be adaptive in response to substantive \nuncertainties\
    \ surrounding decision choices based on the logic of \nconsequentiality or in\
    \ response to institutional uncertainties pertaining to \ndecision rules based\
    \ on the logic of appropriateness.  \n \nPredominantly, studies aimed at understanding\
    \ decision-making emphasise \nthe rationalist logic of consequentialism rather\
    \ than institutionalist logic of \nappropriateness (Beckford, 2002; Börzel & Risse,\
    \ 2003; Best, 2009; \nMichelsen, 2009). However, farmer behaviour is also “entangled\
    \ in on-going \nprocesses of social-ecological change and their associated politics”\
    \ (Manuel-\nNavarrete & Pelling, 2015, p. 559) suggesting that decisions could\
    \ also be \naligned with rules of behaviour influenced by the social context.\
    \ Farmers \nmake tactical decisions based on the socio-political and cultural\
    \ setting of \ntheir region. Establishing whether farmers are adaptive also requires\
    \ \nintroducing into the debate how other logics rather than the consideration\
    \ of \nconsequences brings them closer to being adaptive and what this necessitates\
    \ \nin terms of information needs.  \n \nWe draw on the work of Nyamekye et al.\
    \ (2018) who differentiate between \nregular decision-making and adaptive decision-making.\
    \ They define regular \ndecision making as “the process of choosing standard decision\
    \ options, based \non generalized expectations of what to do under normal circumstances,\
    \ but \nindependent of the observed or anticipated environmental conditions that\
    \ \npresent themselves”. They contrast adaptive decision-making to mean the \n\
    “process of choosing non-standard decision options, in response to \ncircumstances\
    \ that are considered abnormal or unexpected”. Given the \ncontext of this study,\
    \ we define adaptive decision-making as “ taking into \naccount substantive uncertainty\
    \ when assessing consequences or taking \naccount into institutional uncertainty\
    \ when assessing appropriateness”. Given \nthat some decisions could be non-adaptive,\
    \ we also conceptualise non-\nChapter 4\n112\n \n \nadaptive decision-making.\
    \ The conceptual framework is summarised in Table \n4.1.  \n \nTable 4.1: Understanding\

    \ exploratory approach (Jebb, Parrigon, & Woo, 2017; \nNuzzo, 2014; Patton, 2005;\
    \ Patton, 1990) to ascertain hydro-meteorological \ninformation needs and decision-making\
    \ contexts in rice farming systems. The \napproach sought to inquire as to how\
    \ these key variables are interconnected \nin rice farming systems. The longitudinal\
    \ study involved direct participation \nand engagement with farmers over a period\
    \ of 6 months of the cropping \nseason.  \n \n4.3.1.1 Case study \nThe Kumbungu\
    \ district, located within the Northern region of Ghana was \nselected for the\

    \ experiences a mono-modal rainy season between May \nand October (Quaye, Adofo,\
    \ Madode, & Abizari, 2009). The district is \nlocated in the Northern flank of\
    \ the region with a land mass of approximately \n1,599km sq. The period of July\
    \ to September is the peak period of rainfall \n(average rainfall of 1000mm) with\
    \ the district experiencing flooding in some \ncommunities (NDPC, 2019) whereas\
    \ the rest of the year is dry. The district \ncomprises 115 communities with Kumbungu\
    \ as capital. The District shares \nboundaries to the north with Mamprugu/Moagduri\

    \ \nwithin the catchment area of the Bontanga Dam (Zakaria et al., 2013). \nAgricultural\
    \ activities dominate livelihoods in the district and is practiced \nmainly on\
    \ seasonal and subsistence levels. Crops and vegetables cultivated \ninclude rice,\
    \ sorghum, maize, millet, cowpea, groundnut, tomatoes and \npepper (Quaye et al.,\
    \ 2009). We present a map of the district in Figure 1. \n \n \nFigure 4.1: Map\
    \ showing sampled communities in the Kumbungu district \nChapter 4\n114\n \n \n\
    4.3.1.2 Data collection  \nData was gathered between the months of May and September,\
    \ 2018 during \nthe main cropping season. A total of 9 communities within the\
    \ district were \npurposively selected given the presence of rice farmers involved\
    \ in either \nirrigated or rainfed rice farming or both. Communities selected\
    \ include \nBontanga, Wuba, Yiepelgu, Dalung, Voggu, Tibung, Zangbalun, Kpegu-\n\
    Biegu and Kpegu-Bagurugu. A total of 135 farmers were engaged through \ndirect\
    \ interviews and Focus Group Discussions (FGDs). Frey (2018) defined \na focus\
    \ group as ‘a type of group discussion about a topic under the guidance \nof a\
    \ trained group moderator’. In the context of interviews, a sample of 27 \nfarmers\
    \ (3 from each community) were directly engaged using interview \nguides with\
    \ open-ended questions to obtain in-depth contexts of farmer \nadaptive decision-making\
    \ (Magnusson & Marecek, 2015; George Mwangi & \nBettencourt, 2017; Patton, 2005;\
    \ Taylor et al., 2015). Furthermore, an average \nof 12 farmers were engaged in\
    \ FGDs in each community for broader \ndiscussions and clarifications following\
    \ individual interviews (Denzin & \nLincoln, 2008; Kvale, 1996; Silverman, 2016).\
    \ Three FGDs each were \norganised in all nine communities during the rainy season.\
    \ FGDs were held \nin open spaces within communities and lasted an average of\
    \ 45 minutes.  \n \n4.3.1.3 Data analysis  \nData gathered was analysed using\
    \ a deductive content analysis as described \nby Frey (2018). The method allows\
    \ for confirming, expanding or refining \nexisting understanding of a phenomenon.\
    \ The process involved three stages: \nfamiliarization with data, initial coding\
    \ and the generation of themes. To \nfamiliarize with the data, researchers reviewed\
    \ responses from direct \ninterviews and field notes taken during FGDs. The process\
    \ allowed for the \nbetter framing of thoughts on how to approach the analysis.\
    \ The second stage \ninvolved data coding through an iterative process. Here,\
    \ key words and \nparagraphs in responses were grouped to condense data and obtain\
    \ deeper \nmeaning from the data (Krippendorff, 2018; Mayring, 2004; Neuendorf,\
    \ \n2016). A consistent unit of codes were generated for further analysis. Codes\
    \ \ninclude for example, rules, choices, options, decisions, information needs,\
    \ \nadaptive, non-adaptive, and uncertainty. The third stage entailed clustering\
    \ of \nUncertainty, decision logics and adaptive decision-making\nChapter 4\n\
    115\n \n \ncodes into themes such as appropriateness, consequentiality, adaptive\
    \ \ndecision-making, non-adaptive decision-making, substantive uncertainty and\
    \ \ninstitutional uncertainty. Further narratives were put together explaining\
    \ \nresults.  \n \n4.4 Results \n4.4.2 Logic of consequentiality and adaptive\
    \ decision-making  \nIn this sub-section, farmer adaptive decisions underpinned\
    \ by the logic of \nconsequentiality are highlighted. Reference is also made to\
    \ what substantive \nuncertainty farmers faced and choices available to them to\
    \ manage them.  \n \nD1: What crop to cultivate \nPre-season preparations also\
    \ involves decision-making on what to grow. \nFarmers with reference to seasonal\
    \ forecast received take a decision on \nwhether to grow rice as well as other\
    \ crops such as maize, millet, cowpea, \ntomatoes and pepper. Based on consequential\
    \ considerations farmers choose \neither to cultivate rice only, or rather other\
    \ crops or both. Guided by the \nconsequentiality logic, farmers make an adaptive\
    \ decision to cultivate \nmultiple crops as a hedge against crop failure under\
    \ bad seasonal and weather \nconditions. Here, farmers can harvest other crops\
    \ should rice fail due to bad \nseasonal and weather conditions. The non-adaptive\
    \ choice is to cultivate rice \nonly irrespective of expected changes in seasonal\
    \ conditions. Thus, under \nwet, dry or normal conditions, such farmers continuously\
    \ cultivate rice.  \n \nD2: Cultivate rice both within and outside the irrigation\
    \ scheme  \nRice farmers who owned or had access to land both within and outside\
    \ the \nirrigation scheme have to take a critical decision on cultivating rice\
    \ both \nwithin and outside the scheme. For those who practice rainfed rice farming\
    \ \nbut decide to plant under irrigation as well, the pursuit for land access\
    \ within \nthe irrigation scheme also becomes a priority. Such decision is underpinned\
    \ \nby the logic of consequentiality as farmers consider information available\
    \ and \nconsequences of the choice they make. Choices include cultivating rice\
    \ under \nirrigation only or rainfed only or both. Given substantive uncertainty\
    \ \nassociated with seasonal forecast (wet, dry or normal), the adaptive choice\
    \ \nChapter 4\n116\n \n \nmade by farmers is to cultivate under irrigation within\
    \ the scheme in addition \nto cultivating rice under rainfed. The availability\
    \ of water for supplementary \nirrigation from the dam within the scheme minimizes\
    \ the risk of crop failure \nunder unfavourable seasonal and weather conditions.\
    \ Non-adaptive choices \non the other hand include sticking to a constant practice\
    \ of rice farming under \nrainfed only or irrigation only irrespective of substantive\
    \ uncertainty in \nforecast.  \n \nD3: How to prepare land for cultivation \n\
    As earlier indicated, farmers take initiatives to prepare their lands for \ncultivation\
    \ when the season begins. Weather forecast received at this point is \ncrucial\
    \ as farmers need very conducive conditions in terms of soil moisture \ncontent\
    \ to prepare their lands. Here, farmer decision in terms of what method \nto use\
    \ is anchored on consequences of the choice in terms of it enabling the \nfarmer\
    \ to prepare the land in time towards planting. Choices available to \nfarmers\
    \ include the use of tractor, bullock powered cart or manual labour in \npreparing\
    \ the land. Here, an adaptive choice is to vary the clearance method \nconsidering\
    \ observed and anticipated weather conditions. Thus, farmers opt \nfor a tractor\
    \ to plough the land when large acres of land is to be cleared under \nlimited\
    \ time before heavy rains. The choice to use bullock powered cart is \napplied\
    \ when smaller acres of land has to be cleared also under less wet \nconditions.\
    \ On the other hand, manual labour is used when farmers begin land \npreparation\
    \ early and have ample time to prepare their lands before the rains \nfinally\
    \ set in fully. Varying the method for land preparation in view of \nforecast\
    \ information puts farmers in a better position to manage substantive \nuncertainty\
    \ regarding suitable soil moisture conditions. Contrastingly, using \nmanual labour\
    \ irrespective of seasonal conditions as indicated by some \nfarmers is a non-adaptive\
    \ choice with implications on productivity. For \ninstance in the context of high\
    \ soil moisture and wet conditions, the use of \nmanual labour is less effective\
    \ as compared to a tractor resulting in prolonged \ndelay in completing land clearance.\
    \  \n \nD4: When to plant rice  \nAlthough the rainy season begins in the month\
    \ of May, the decision on when \nto plant could be varied depending on seasonal\
    \ and weather forecast \nUncertainty, decision logics and adaptive decision-making\n\
    Chapter 4\n117\n \n \ninformation on rainfall and temperature as estimated through\
    \ indigenous \nobservations or what is received via information systems. Planting\
    \ is mostly \ndone between the last week of May and late June. Farmers make a\
    \ choice \nbetween sticking to their regular planting times as done in previous\
    \ years or \nrather vary planting dates (either earlier or later) based on their\
    \ knowledge of \nevents and consequences of each choice. Substantive uncertainty\
    \ exists here \nas to whether enough rains will be experienced between May and\
    \ June and if \nso its distribution. The varying of planting date is perceived\
    \ as a more \nadaptive choice than sticking to a particular time in spite of anticipated\
    \ or \nobserved conditions. Under rainfed rice farming systems especially, \n\
    obtaining relevant information at this point is essential to making an adaptive\
    \ \nchoice. Within irrigated rice farming systems however, supplementary \nirrigation\
    \ makes it less sensitive of a decision on when to plant as farmers are \nmostly\
    \ able to meet soil moisture needs and water for irrigation.   \n  \n D5: How\
    \ to and what rice variety to plant \nFarmers mostly plant rice in the last week\
    \ of May through till the end of June. \nHere, decision on the method for planting\
    \ and variety of rice to plant of \nplanting is sometimes defined by substantive\
    \ uncertainty considering weather \nand seasonal forecast. Farmers choose between\
    \ broadcasting seeds; using the \ndibbling method or nursing and transplanting\
    \ later. The adaptive choice is to \nvary the planting method depending on estimated\
    \ water availability \nconditions based on observed and forecast and soil moisture\
    \ content. The \nchoice of nursing and transplanting is pursued when normal or\
    \ dry conditions \nare expected and hence nursing and transplanting later improves\
    \ the resilience \nof crops to harsh or dry conditions. Farmers also nurse and\
    \ transplant when \nlate onset of rains are expected. In the case where rains\
    \ set in early and \nfarmers have limited time for planting, they opt to broadcast\
    \ seeds to avoid \nmissing the period of heavy rains and wet conditions necessary\
    \ for rice to \nsprout. Farmers opt for dibbling when soil moisture is high and\
    \ not much \nluxury is available in terms of time. A few farmers used the same\
    \ method of \nplanting irrespective of how this affects their productivity and\
    \ ability to adapt \nto future weather variation. A non-adaptive choice is to\
    \ stick to broadcasting \nirrespective of conditions. Such farmers are at higher\
    \ risk of seeds being \nwashed away especially under wet conditions. Although\
    \ this probably works \nChapter 4\n118\n \n \nunder normal conditions, the practice\
    \ is mostly ineffective under extremely \nwet conditions. The stage also involves\
    \ choice making on variety of rice to \ncultivate. Tying the decision on what\
    \ variety to cultivate to conditions at each \npoint in time is an adaptive choice\
    \ to make. Hence given the factor of \nsubstantive uncertainty associated with\
    \ seasonal forecast information, \nchoices here include sowing drought resistant\
    \ varieties when the season is \nexpected to be dry, and a flood resistant variety\
    \ when it is expected to be wet. \nThis enhances probabilities of good harvest\
    \ and returns on investment.  \n \nD6: How to control weed \nWeed control also\
    \ requires farmer sensitivity to substantive uncertainty about \nrainfall conditions.\
    \ Under conditions of uncertainty, farmers can choose \nbetween applying only\
    \ pre-emergent weedicides or both pre-emergent and \npost-emergent weedicides.\
    \ In the context of a wet season and normal \nconditions, farmers applied both\
    \ pre-emergent and post-emergent weedicides. \nA non-adaptive choice made by farmers\
    \ irrespective of consequences is to \nonly apply pre-emergent weedicides with\
    \ less recourse to meteorological \nforecast. \n \nD7: How to fertilize soil \
    \ \nThe point of fertilizer application is one of the sensitive and crucial stages\
    \ of \nthe cropping cycle. Farmers have to ensure there is enough soil moisture\
    \ for \nfertilizer absorption by crops but at the same time require some level\
    \ of \ncertainty on the timing of the rain to avoid the fertilizer being washed\
    \ away. \nFarmers make a choice of either applying compost only, compound fertilizer\
    \ \nonly or both. According to the farmers, the adaptive choice is to apply both\
    \ \nfertilizers. Here, farmers apply compost fertilizer 2 weeks after planting\
    \ and \nNPK (nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium) within 25 days after planting.\
    \ \nFarmers manage substantive uncertainty evident with weather conditions and\
    \ \nchange especially on rainfall amount and distribution when they make this\
    \ \nchoice. Thus, farmers in dealing with such uncertainty plan for a double \n\
    phased fertilizer application much more also when seasonal forecasts point to\
    \ \nnormal or dry conditions during the main cropping season. However, a few \n\
    farmers make a non-adaptive choice of applying only compost within the first \n\
    25 days of planting rice.  \nUncertainty, decision logics and adaptive decision-making\n\
    Chapter 4\n119\n \n \nD8: How to harvest rice \nThe season ends with the harvesting\
    \ of farm produce. The pursuit of \nmeteorological information is for insight\
    \ into the cessation of rainfall which \nis relevant in deciding on how to harvest.\
    \ Farmers make a choice between \nusing manual labour or engaging the services\
    \ of a combine harvester. \nHarvesting using manual labour requires more labour\
    \ days hence mostly \nopted for when there is enough time after cessation of rains.\
    \ A combine \nharvester is a better choice when cessation delays and farmers have\
    \ limited \ntime for season closure. Adaptive decision-making involves choosing\
    \ a \nmethod based on cessation as presented in a forecast. A non-adaptive choice\
    \ \nis where farmers stuck to using manual labour always. \n  \n4.4.2 Logic of\
    \ appropriateness and adaptive decision-making \nAdaptive decision-making in some\
    \ contexts also showed evidence of the logic \nof appropriateness at play by accounting\
    \ for institutional uncertainty in \ndecision-making. Adaptive decision-making\
    \ in the logic of consequentiality \naccounting for institutional uncertainty\
    \ due to change in rules over a period \nof time.  \n \nD9: Cultivate rice inside\
    \ irrigation scheme with defined rules \nLand ownership and tenure within the\
    \ irrigation scheme is also a matter of \nconcern especially amongst non-resident5\
    \ rice farmers who patronize the \nirrigation scheme during the cropping season.\
    \ Although resident farmers can \nlease lands, there is no clear formal arrangement\
    \ or guideline on the process. \nFor non-resident farmers such flexibility is\
    \ shrouded in institutional \nuncertainty that they have to manage amidst the\
    \ unavailability of information \non any new arrangements as such occur at the\
    \ farm level. Uncertainty about \nsuch rules means that non-resident rice farmers\
    \ face the risk of not securing \nland within the scheme in a particular season\
    \ unless they have full knowledge \nand can predict how these arrangements evolve.\
    \ Thus rice farming for such \nfarmers is highly tied to land access and user\
    \ rights pushing them to adapt \n                                            \
    \     \n \n5 Farmers living outside the district who only come to farm within\
    \ the irrigation scheme \nunder agreed arrangements.  \nChapter 4\n120\n \n \n\
    their decision to cultivate within the irrigation scheme along these conditions.\
    \ \nThus having clear arrangements with resident farmers in the rainy season on\
    \ \nland tenure is seen as the ideal practice and the most appropriate thing to\
    \ do. \nAn adaptive choice is to cultivate only when land tenure and rental conditions\
    \ \nare clearly defined. A second scenario occurs during the dry season where\
    \ \nplots located within laterals 8 to 14 (upstream) within the irrigation scheme\
    \ \nhave limited supply of water when water levels in the dam reduce. \n \nThus\
    \ farmers whose plots fall within laterals 8 to 14 or are non-resident resort\
    \ \nto lobbying for land located within laterals 1 to 7 (downstream and mid-\n\
    stream areas). The absence of clear rules about the process of allocation \ncomes\
    \ with uncertainty pertaining to access to land in the context of the \naforementioned\
    \ groups of farmers. Such institutional uncertainty impacts the \ndecision-making\
    \ process in line with the logic of appropriateness. Farmers \nwhose lands are\
    \ located within laterals 8 to 14 have to adapt by putting up \nrental arrangements\
    \ to secure lands within laterals 1 to 7. Under the above \nscenarios, the non-adaptive\
    \ choice is to cultivate rice within the scheme only \nwhen it is convenient to\
    \ do so. Here, less attention is paid to how these rules \nare evolving but rather\
    \ when the farmer determines is conveniently possible \nto farm.  \n \nD10: Prepare\
    \ land based on practices  \nSome farmers adapt by observing their neighbouring\
    \ farmers. Such instances \noccur during land preparation where choice making\
    \ is based on what is \nconsidered the appropriate choice. The choice to use manual\
    \ labour or obtain \na tractor is mostly collectively done as both options require\
    \ greater numbers \nin making a case for such services. Farmers individual choices\
    \ have a sense \nof reference to collective practices. Labour arrangements require\
    \ wider \nconsultation with other neighbouring farmers and households. Also, some\
    \ \nfarmers made a non-adaptive choice of using only manual labour due to the\
    \ \ndominance of the practice amongst farmers and it being perceived as \nappropriate.\
    \  \n \n \n \nUncertainty, decision logics and adaptive decision-making\nChapter\
    \ 4\n121\n \n \nD11: Plant seeds considering practices \nJust like land preparation\
    \ in some contexts, we see wider consultation with \nother farmers at the point\
    \ of planting in decision-making on the method to \nadopt in planting or sticking\
    \ to common practice as broadcasting which is \nknown amongst farmers over the\
    \ years. Common to farmers is the need to \nmanage uncertainty about communal\
    \ labour arrangements needed to support \nthe activity of planting. As necessary,\
    \ this requires a conscious pursuit \ndefined by rules of engagement of the services\
    \ of labour from their own \ncommunities.  \n \nD12: Choose harvesting method\
    \ informed by practice \nFarmer decision on what method to use in harvesting is\
    \ also based on \nperceived practices common to them at a point in time. Farmers\
    \ pursuit of \nlabour or combined harvester is based on collective practice. A\
    \ non-adaptive \npractice however is the use of manual labour due to instituted\
    \ labour \narrangements with neighbours.  \n \n4.4.3 Information needs and managing\
    \ uncertainties in adaptive \ndecision-making \nGiven institutional and substantive\
    \ uncertainty identified, our results also \npoint to information needs relevant\
    \ to improve farmer adaptive decision-\nmaking. Current meteorological information\
    \ made available to farmers paid \nlittle attention to what different adaptive\
    \ decisions farmers made, thereby \nlimiting the degree to which information is\
    \ interpreted as relevant and hence \nits subsequent use in decision-making. There\
    \ is however the need for an \nelaborate outline of what specific forecast information\
    \ farmers need and why \ntheir provision is eminent.  \n \n4.4.3.1 Information\
    \ needs, substantive uncertainty and adaptive decision-\nmaking \nHere, we infer\
    \ what information is needed to reduce substantive uncertainty \nin current meteorological\
    \ forecast made available to farmers over the farming \nperiod with reference\
    \ to specific adaptive decisions identified.  \n \nChapter 4\n122\n \n \na. What\
    \ crop to cultivate \nAlthough the decision to multi-crop is an adaptive-decision\
    \ made by farmers, \nthey indicated some information gaps exist which when provided\
    \ could \nimprove dealing with substantive uncertainty in adaptive decision-making.\
    \ \nFarmers indicated the need for information on rainfall amount (wet, dry or\
    \ \nnormal) and distribution at the local scale. Given the high water requirement\
    \ \nof rice and the low to average water requirement for other crops such as maize\
    \ \nand sorghum, a sense of what rainfall amount to expect and its distribution\
    \ \ninforms the decision on what crops to cultivate to reduce risk of crop loss\
    \ and \ncapital cost. Information on rainfall onset and cessation at the local\
    \ scale will \nalso improve choice making on what crops to plant.  \n \nb. Cultivate\
    \ rice both inside and outside the irrigation scheme \nFarmers were also quick\
    \ to indicate that cultivating rice both within and \noutside the scheme was risky\
    \ due to unpredictability of rainfall and \ntemperature conditions during both\
    \ pre-season and in-season. Farmers \nindicated that forecast information must\
    \ communicate rainfall onset and \nrainfall amount for the season (wet, dry or\
    \ normal) at a local scale to improve \nadaptive decision-making. For farmers,\
    \ this better informs their decision on \nthe size area of land to cultivate especially\
    \ under rainfed to reduce risk of crop \nloss.  \n \nc. How to prepare land for\
    \ cultivation \nDeciding on how prepare the land for rice cultivation is important.\
    \ Key \ninformation required at this stage is onset, rainfall amount and distribution.\
    \ A \nsense of the onset of the rains is deterministic for choice-making on what\
    \ \nmethod to adopt in land clearance since for example clearing the land with\
    \ \nmanual labour is time consuming and hence not the best alternative when time\
    \ \nis not a luxury with reference to rainfall onset. A sense of rainfall distribution\
    \ \nis a good indicator of when land preparation should have been completed and\
    \ \npreparations for planting started. Equally, information on rainfall amount\
    \ in \ntiming of the activity to avoid saturation and difficulty during land clearance.\
    \  \n \n \n \nUncertainty, decision logics and adaptive decision-making\nChapter\
    \ 4\n123\n \n \nd. How to and what rice variety to plant \nAs an adaptive decision,\
    \ the choice to vary planting times is hinged on \ninformation on rainfall onset.\
    \ With such information farmers consider which \ntimes will be most favourable\
    \ to plant with an expectation of enough rainfall \nto minimize crop failure.\
    \ Although current meteorological information \ncommunicated comes with information\
    \ on probabilities, farmers indicated \nthat rainfall amount is highly relevant\
    \ in choice-making on what variety of \ncrop to cultivate. Knowing if the season\
    \ will be wet or dry is a good pointer \nin deciding whether to cultivate a flood\
    \ tolerant variety which is long term or \ndrought resistant variety which is\
    \ short term. Probabilities communicated at \nthe local scale will also inform\
    \ the decision of cultivating either a drought \nresistant or flood tolerant variety.\
    \ \n \ne. How to fertilize soil \nThe point of fertilizer application comes is\
    \ one of the most sensitive and water \ndependent stages requiring critical decision-making.\
    \ Farmers indicated that \ninformation on rainfall amount and distribution is\
    \ also relevant in decision-\nmaking on fertilizer use. Information on rainfall\
    \ distribution informs adaptive \ndecision-making on the timing for fertilizer\
    \ application. The amount of \nrainfall shows intensity for which farmers could\
    \ consider in determining \nwhen to undertake their activities.  \n \nf. How to\
    \ harvest rice \nA sense of rainfall cessation based on forecast is required for\
    \ choice making \non what method to use in harvesting. Combine harvesters are\
    \ mostly used \ncessation is anticipated to delay. An early cessation affords\
    \ the use of manual \nlabour in harvesting.  \n \n4.4.3.2 Information needs, institutional\
    \ uncertainty and adaptive decision-\nmaking \nIn a similar vein, respondents\
    \ indicated what information could improve \nadaptation to institutional uncertainty\
    \ conditions within rice farming systems. \nAlthough, hydro-meteorological information\
    \ is not the only needed \ninformation, farmers indicated that it is relevant\
    \ in pursuance of other relevant \ninformation relating to land use and water\
    \ management.  \nChapter 4\n124\n \n \na. Cultivate rice inside irrigation scheme\
    \ with defined rules  \nFarmers also require information on land lease arrangements\
    \ to deal with \nassociated uncertainty due to flexibility in rules within the\
    \ irrigation scheme. \nFor non-resident farmers who do not own permanent plots\
    \ within the scheme, \nmaking such information available will considerably inform\
    \ their decision-\nmaking. Leadership of the irrigation scheme should aim to collate\
    \ and publish \nsuch information during the pre-season period to better position\
    \ prospective \nfarmers as part of their pre-season preparations.  \n \nb. Prepare\
    \ land based on practices \nLand clearance using labour is also a traditional\
    \ communal practice common \nin study communities although this is currently not\
    \ done in an organised way. \nEssentially, labour arrangements will be better\
    \ coordinated when structured \nand communicated. A good step will be to make\
    \ information on who is \nwilling to engage in labour arrangements available so\
    \ farmers can better \nmobilise themselves in shared support arrangement for mutual\
    \ benefit.  \n \nc. Plant seeds considering practices \nNon-resident farmers although\
    \ forming a minority group amongst rice \nfarmers operating within communities\
    \ studied indicated that receiving \ninformation on rainfall distribution is necessary\
    \ for investment decision-\nmaking pertaining to rice. A greater insight on the\
    \ hydrology of the dam also \ncontributes to certainty of supplementary irrigation\
    \ being possible and hence \nthe pursuit of irrigated rice farming as an agenda.\
    \ \n \nd. Choose harvesting method informed by practices \nAs indicated during\
    \ land preparation, harvesting also involves labour \narrangements and hence the\
    \ need to attempt making such information \navailable so as to deal with uncertainty\
    \ as to rules of engagement which \nequally affects farmer decision-making.  \n\

    This study focused on establishing how uncertainty is accounted for and what \n\
    logics are evident in in farmer adaptive decision-making in rice farming \nsystems.\
    \ Study findings as earlier discussed point to the significance of hydro-\nmeteorological\
    \ information for adaptive decision-making. Other scholarly \nworks such as Adiku\
    \ and Stone (1995), Chaudhury et al. (2012) and Jost et \nal. (2016) point to\
    \ farmer need for hydro-meteorological information in \nGhana. In this section,\
    \ we discuss the implications of study findings on \nconceptualising adaptive\
    \ decision-making and situate the research in \nempirical evidence on the subject\
    \ in farming systems. We also discuss the \nimplications of the findings on meeting\
    \ information needs of farmers.  \n \nThe study findings establish that both logic\
    \ of consequentiality and logic of \nappropriateness are evident in farmer adaptive\
    \ decision-making as Kristensen \nand Jakobsen (2011) identified in their study\
    \ of decision-making amongst \ndairy farmers with factors such as identity and\
    \ risks shaping farmer adaptive \ndecision-making. Other scholarly works like\
    \ Roberts (2015) and Qamer et al. \n(2019) confirm that farmer adaptive decision-making\
    \ follows an intentional \nprocess of identifying alternatives and estimating\
    \ outcomes amidst \ninformation uncertainties which is fundamental in the logic\
    \ of \nconsequentiality. There is also the evidence of adaptive decision-making\
    \ \nunderpinned by the logic of appropriateness as long as rules continue to \n\
    change in a given context (see Karami, 2006). \n \nA major outcome of this study\
    \ is that forecast information must also \nencompass institutional uncertainty\
    \ within farming systems (see also \nNakasone, Torero, & Minten, 2014; Ozowa,\
    \ 1995). Hence information \nservice providers aiming to provide relevant hydro-meteorological\
    \ \ninformation to deal with substantive uncertainty must also aim at addressing\
    \ \ninstitutional uncertainty to enhance information uptake and impact through\
    \ \nadaptive decision-making.  \n \nThe study establishes that the logic of consequentiality\
    \ and logic of \nappropriateness can be explored in decision-making theory especially\
    \ at the \nfarm level in understanding how institutional and substantive uncertainty\
    \ is \nChapter 4\n128\n \n \nmanaged in adaptive decision-making. Both logics\
    \ present a deeper \ninterpretation of how adaptive decision-making occur rather\
    \ than just \nmeasuring the point to which one particular decision is adaptive\
    \ or otherwise. \nThey provide interpretation for farmer behaviour as studied\
    \ in other contexts \n(see Alarcon, Wieland, Mateus, & Dewberry, 2014; Singh et\
    \ al., 2018). \n \nThe study highlights that not only does substantive uncertainty\
    \ inform \nadaptive decision-making but institutional uncertainty as well. Findings\
    \ \ninclude the fact that variation in rules over time create institutional \n\
    uncertainty which farmers have to manage. Nyamekye et al. (2018) also \nestablished\
    \ this relationship showing how governance arrangements informed \nadaptive decision-making\
    \ in rice farming systems in the Kumbungu district. \nIt is worth noting that\
    \ making information available on rules as and when they \nchange is a necessary\
    \ step to managing institutional uncertainty.  \n \nWe propose that further studies\
    \ be undertaken in locations where information \nneeds identified here can be\
    \ also accounted for and what substantive and \ninstitutional uncertainties farmers\
    \ in those contexts have to deal with. \nFurthermore, it will be important to\
    \ establish in other circles which of the two \nlogics of decision-making studied\
    \ here is evident in farmer adaptive decision-\nmaking. Lastly, research further\
    \ explore how both institutional and \nsubstantive uncertainties can be accounted\
    \ for in the design of climate \ninformation services especially in the context\
    \ of Sub-Saharan Africa.  \n \n4.6 Conclusion \nThis study highlights that hydro-meteorological\
    \ information is significant in \nmanaging uncertainties in rice farming systems\
    \ although it is not the only \ncritical input. The paper also points to the existence\
    \ of uncertainty about rules, \nalternative choices and their outcomes which rice\
    \ farmers must manage. The \noutcomes of the study also affirm that adaptive decisions\
    \ occur in a thought \nprocess underpinned by both logics of appropriateness and\
    \ consequentiality. \nHowever, it can be concluded that uncertainty varies depending\
    \ on what \nfarming system and structures are set up as well as the degree to\
    \ which these \nstructures evolve due to change in social and environmental systems.\
    \ The \nstudy also provides further insight into farmer information needs to address\
    \ \nUncertainty, decision logics and adaptive decision-making\nChapter 4\n129\n\
    \ \n \nuncertainty in adaptive decision-making. This paper contributes to the\
    \ \nconceptual debate on how adaptive decisions occur and the underpinning \n\
    logics of thinking. In a nutshell, the paper provides empirical evidence in \n\
    northern Ghana emphasising the information-uncertainty-adaptive-decision-\nmaking\
    \ relationship in rice farming systems.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAcknowledgements\

    \ Ghana\nChapter 5\nChapter 5\n132\n \n \nAbstract \nInformation systems contribute\
    \ to information provision and actionable \nknowledge creation in farming systems.\
    \ In Northern Ghana, rice farmers \ninteract with information systems through\
    \ various media to access \nagricultural information for their decision-making.\
    \ Of interest here is the \ndegree to which knowledge derived from such interaction\
    \ is actionable by \nfarmers. Using an exploratory design, the paper addresses\
    \ the overall \nquestion: what information systems are currently providing agricultural\
    \ \ninformation to rice farmers, and to what extent does this result in actionable\
    \ \nknowledge? Using Kumbungu District in Northern Ghana as the case study, \n\
    99 rice farmers from nine communities were engaged in interviews and focus \n\
    group discussions. Information systems identified were Mobile-based-only \nPlatforms,\
    \ Commercial Radio, Community Radio, and Farmer-to-Farmer. \nThe study examined\
    \ knowledge actionability by assessing the salience, \ncredibility, and legitimacy\
    \ of knowledge created from farmer-information \nsystem interactions; and it revealed\
    \ that Farmer-to-Farmer systems contribute \nmost to actionable knowledge creation.\
    \ Mobile technology as a mode of \nengaging farmers and transmitting agricultural\
    \ information emerged as the \nmost desirable for information exchange because\
    \ it eliminated geographical \nbarriers and facilitated reach. We conclude that\
    \ systems integration and local \nactor participation are essential for maximising\
    \ knowledge creation in \ninformation systems.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ \nInformation systems and actionable knowledge creation\nChapter 5\n133\n \n\
    \ \n5.1 Introduction \nAgriculture in developing countries is vulnerable to numerous\
    \ environmental \nconditions such as weather variability, water scarcity, and\
    \ land degradation \n(Nyadzi et al., 2018; Nkegbe, Abu, & Issahaku, 2017; Regmi\
    \ & Paudel, 2017; \nMechlem, 2004). Small-scale farmers mostly have to deal with\
    \ complexities \nassociated with climate variability (Deressa, Hassan, Ringler,\
    \ Alemu, & \nYesuf, 2009; Thomas, Twyman, Osbahr, & Hewitson, 2007). In Ghana,\
    \ the \nNorthern Savannah region is highly characterised by drought and erratic\
    \ \nrainfall consequent to high temperatures and low precipitation (Laube et al.,\
    \ \n2012; Armah et al., 2011). Low technology adoption and use make it even \n\
    more difficult for small-scale farmers to maximise productivity on their farms\
    \ \n(Akudugu et al., 2012; Conley & Udry, 2001). Rice farmers are amongst the\
    \ \nmost vulnerable group of farmers because of their reliance on rain to meet\
    \ \nwater needs (Nyamekye et al., 2018). \n \nDiscussing the role of technology\
    \ in environmental governance, Mol (2006) \nintroduces the concept of informational\
    \ governance to refer to the idea that \ninformation (and informational processes,\
    \ technologies, institutions, and \nresources linked to it) fundamentally restructures\
    \ processes, institutions, and \npractices of environmental governance in ways\
    \ different from those of \nconventional modes of environmental governance. Here,\
    \ information is not \nonly a conduit but also a resource with transformational\
    \ power. Informational \ngovernance is dependent on environmental information\
    \ generation, \ntransmission, access and application with ICT support. The informational\
    \ \ngovernance concept has been further applied in environment and \nsustainability\
    \ literature (Soma, Termeer, & Opdam, 2016; Lehtonen, \nSebastien, & Bauler, 2016;\
    \ Termeer & Bruinsma, 2016; Hoefnagel, de Vos, \n& Buisman, 2013). In the context\
    \ of agriculture, a positive correlation has \nbeen identified between homegrown\
    \ technological solutions and complex \nproblem management (Juma, 2015; Muriithi,\
    \ Bett, & Ogaleh, 2009). \nTechnological solutions designed to support information\
    \ collation and use \nhave gained prominence, with a proliferation of information\
    \ systems \n(Hounkonnou et al., 2012; Nikkila, Seilonen, & Koskinen, 2010). In\
    \ Ghana, \nrice farmers find themselves in an information environment in which\
    \ public \nand private, ICT-based and non-ICT-based systems all play a role \n\
    Chapter 5\n134\n \n \n(Posthumus, Aarnoudse, & Stroek, 2013; Dittoh, Van Aart,\
    \ & De Boer, \n2013). Being in a web of information systems presents opportunities,\
    \ but, for \ninformed decision-making, farmers must make sense of the information\
    \ \ncommunicated.  \n \nTo investigate when and how information from these different\
    \ systems \ncontributes to farm decision-making, we espouse on the concept of\
    \ actionable \nknowledge. Actionable knowledge is knowledge that leads to immediate\
    \ \nprogress on a current assignment or project (Cross & Sproull, 2004); \nknowledge\
    \ that is ‘pragmatic’ (Carlile, 2002), ‘transforming’ (Carlile, 1998); \nor ‘usable’\
    \ (Lemos & Dilling, 2007). Kirchhoff et al. (2013) point to a \npersistent gap\
    \ between information production and use and hence the need to \ndistil, both\
    \ theoretically and empirically, what could constitute actionable \nknowledge\
    \ in a given context. To study actionable knowledge in relation to \ninformation\
    \ systems, the concept needs to be further refined. We do so by \ntranslating\
    \ three key factors that have been shown to be relevant at the \nscience-policy\
    \ interface in farming decision-making: salience, credibility and \nlegitimacy\
    \ (Cash et al., 2003). We explore how these apply to the scientific \nand indigenous\
    \ knowledge produced in rice- farming systems. The study \naddresses the overall\
    \ question: what information systems are currently \nproviding agricultural information\
    \ to rice farmers, and to what extent does \nthis result in actionable knowledge?\
    \ In this paper, three specific questions are \naddressed in answering the overall\
    \ question: i) Which information systems \nprovide agricultural information? ii)\
    \ How do information systems enable \nactionable knowledge creation? iii) Which\
    \ information systems contribute \nmost to actionable knowledge creation?  \n\
    \ \n5.2 Conceptual framework \nInformational governance conceptually provides\
    \ a lens to discuss the \ntransformative power of information. Mol (2006) highlights\
    \ not only \ninformation, but also other factors such as informational processes,\
    \ \ntechnologies, institutions, and practices in informational governance. \n\
    Informational governance focuses on two interrelated processes: i) steering \n\
    through information and ii) changes in information flows affecting \ngovernance.\
    \ Mol (2006) draws from Castells’ (1996) ‘information economy’ \nInformation systems\
    \ and actionable knowledge creation\nChapter 5\n135\n \n \nto discuss the role\
    \ of information in economic processes, specific forms of \nsocial organisation\
    \ in information generation, processing, and transmission, \nas fundamental sources\
    \ of productivity and power.  \n \nRather than unpack the black-box of the technical\
    \ design of information \nsystems, we investigate how these systems enable information\
    \ collation and \ninteractivity \ntowards \nknowledge \ncreation \nfor \ndecision-making.\
    \ \nAcknowledging the difference between data, information and knowledge and \n\
    applying the concepts differently, we define data as facts or numbers; \ninformation\
    \ as processed data communicated with meaning; and knowledge \nas applicable information\
    \ (Kettinger & Li, 2010; Benjamin Martz Jr & \nShepherd, 2003; Alavi & Leidner,\
    \ 2001). We operationalise information as \nthe immediate output of information\
    \ systems based on data collated and \nprocessed. We understand knowledge as the\
    \ outcome of the cognitive process \nof making information relevant and involving\
    \ further interaction between \nend-users of information and systems. Thus, we\
    \ interpret the process as \nbeginning with data entered into information systems\
    \ from which information \nis produced, channelled, and subsequently incorporated\
    \ into relevant \nknowledge that may be actionable for decision-making (Lemos,\
    \ 2015).  \n \nCross and Sproull (2004) posit that information seekers do not\
    \ only strive to \nobtain input from providers, but also go through a process\
    \ of constructing an \nunderstanding based on social and physical circumstances.\
    \ Similarly, Dewulf \net al. (2005) highlight that part of the question of knowledge\
    \ actionability lies \nin for ‘whom’ that knowledge is actionable or has ‘implementable\
    \ validity’. \nCash et al. (2003) identify three key characteristics of the knowledge-creation\
    \ \nprocess in making information useful: salience, credibility and legitimacy.\
    \ \nFor these authors, salience refers to scientific information being made \n\
    responsive and context-sensitive to decision-makers’ needs; credibility means\
    \ \nthat information is accurate, of high quality, and scientifically valid; and\
    \ \nlegitimacy refers to information produced in an open and unbiased process.\
    \ \nAlthough Cash et al. (2003) do not conclude that the three aforementioned\
    \ \nfactors constitute how information translates into action and use by decision-\n\
    makers, the three factors are strong indicators of what could drive information\
    \ \nuptake. Some authors postulate that salience is a critical factor if knowledge\
    \ \nChapter 5\n136\n \n \nis intended for decision-making (Clark et al., 2016)\
    \ and that transparency \nabout the uncertainty of knowledge increases its credibility\
    \ (Steingrover, \nGeertsema, & van Wingerden, 2010). Kirchhoff et al. (2013) argue\
    \ that \nknowledge production moves from a low (production to increase fundamental\
    \ \nknowledge) to a high (production to solve societal problems) point in the\
    \ \nspace of user participation as users of knowledge become active agents. These\
    \ \nauthors refer to scientific information rather than including indigenous \n\
    information in their discussion on knowledge.  \n \nIn studying rice-farming systems\
    \ in Ghana, we expand on Cash et al. (2003)’s \ndefinitions of the three factors\
    \ (salience, legitimacy, credibility) to account \nfor contextual factors within\
    \ which rice farmers operate in Northern Ghana. \nIndigenous knowledge has been\
    \ accounted for as applicable knowledge \ninstitutionalized in local settings\
    \ and based on environmental indicators \n(Chand, Chambers, Waiwai, Malsale, &\
    \ Thompson, 2014; Kaniki & \nMphahlele, 2002). Particularly, our (re)definition\
    \ considers both scientific \nand indigenous information that guides farmers’\
    \ actions. We define salience \nas locally relevant, timely, and relatable scientific\
    \ and indigenous knowledge; \ncredibility as knowledge that is trustworthy and\
    \ can be based on scientific \nevidence or trust in the experience (indigenous\
    \ knowledge) of fellow farmers; \nand legitimacy as scientific and indigenous\
    \ knowledge produced in a fair, \nbalanced, and transparent way. We thus define\
    \ actionable knowledge as \nindigenous and scientific knowledge that is locally\
    \ relevant, trustworthy, and \nproduced in a fair, transparent way. Knowledge\
    \ that is actionable should \ntranslate into uptake and use in decision-making.\
    \ Thus, the definitions of \nthese terminologies shift the focus from just information\
    \ to how the farmer-\ninformation system interaction produces knowledge for uptake.\
    \ Hence, \ninformation is not the only defining factor. With the availability\
    \ of indigenous \nand scientific knowledge, we operationalise the actionability\
    \ of knowledge as \nbased on one knowledge system or a complement of both. An\
    \ element of \ncontinuity is established through the application of knowledge\
    \ and the \nprovision of feedback in the information-knowledge-decision making\
    \ system \n(see Figure 5.1).  \n \n \nInformation systems and actionable knowledge\

    5.3 Research methodology \n5.3.1 Research design \nThe study adopts an exploratory\
    \ design (Kumar, 2019; Maxwell, 2012; \nKothari, 2004) to gain insights into how\
    \ information systems make \ninformation available and how user interaction with\
    \ information produces \nactionable knowledge in rice-farming systems. An exploratory\
    \ approach is \nespoused to enable an in-depth understanding of variables in the\
    \ \ncontextualised study essential for validating scientific conclusions (Jebb\
    \ et \nal., 2017; Stebbins, 2001).  \n \n \n \nInformation System \nKnowledge\

    \ and analysis \nThe study involved interaction with selected farmers within the\
    \ Kumbungu \nDistrict (see Figure 2) where farmers experience water stress throughout\
    \ the \nseason (April-November, 2017). Researchers engaged farmers from nine \n\
    communities within the district: Sakuuba, Dalung, Kusibo, Yipelgu, Kpegu-\nBieggu,\
    \ Wuba, Voggu, Tibung and Kpalsegu. Twenty-seven farmers (three \nfrom each community)\
    \ were engaged through direct interviews using \ninterview guides over the period\
    \ (see appendix 5a). Furthermore, three focus \ngroup discussions (FDG) (Parker\
    \ & Tritter, 2006) were held at the onset, \nmidway, and end of the season with\
    \ selected actors in each community (see \nappendix 5b). Community leaders (chiefs,\
    \ assembly members, unit \ncommittee members, etc) were also engaged in interviews\
    \ (see appendx 5d). \nPower play was managed as most chiefs and assembly members\
    \ were also \nfarmers and hence not a substantive impact of data quality. Thus\
    \ the strategy \nof engaging farmers and community leaders allowed for a comprehensive\
    \ \ndiscussion of key issues bridging boundaries between socio-cultural \nconditions\
    \ and information and knowledge creation. Observations were also \nmade of how\
    \ farmers went about information access and use (see appendix \n5e). In all, ninety-nine\
    \ (99) farmers participated in the study.  \nInformation systems and actionable\
    \ knowledge creation\nChapter 5\n139\n \n \n \nFigure 5.2: Map showing sampled\
    \ communities in Kumbungu district \n \nKey actors within public and private institutions\
    \ were also interviewed (see \nappendix 5c) including the Ghana Irrigation Development\

    \ of \nAgriculture, Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet), Savannah Research \nInstitute,\
    \ Dalung Radio, Savannah Radio, and the District Agricultural \nDevelopment Unit.\
    \  \n \nData analysis was undertaken in two stages. The first stage involved cleaning\
    \ \nthe data from interviews and FGDs. Audio recordings from interviews were \n\
    transcribed. Field notes were also edited and organised (Maanen, 2011; \nWolfinger,\
    \ 2002; Sanjek, 1990). Data editing entailed reviewing responses to \nquestions\
    \ as captured and ensuring clarity of thoughts, replacement of \nshorthand notes\
    \ with full expressions, and clarifying of constructs and \nsentences (Dey, 2003;\
    \ Miles, Huberman, Huberman, & Huberman, 1994).  \nChapter 5\n140\n \n \n \n Table\
    \ 5.1: Degree to which information system enabled actionable \nknowledge creation\
    \ \n \n \nThe second stage was a thematic analysis, which sought to interpret\
    \ data in \nrelation to key themes of interest. Themes included i) information\
    \ system \ncharacteristics, ii) Information flow and actionable knowledge creation,\
    \ iii) \nknowledge actionability. Analysis deducing the results on information\
    \ \nsystems identified relatable expressions such as mobile technology, radio\
    \ \nsystems, communication channel, and information transfer, amongst others.\
    \ \nFor actionable knowledge, expressions such as trust, useful, transparent,\
    \ \nopen, true, local, indigenous, scientific were used to guide the analysis.\
    \ The \ndegree to which information systems enabled actionable knowledge creation\

    \ knowledge  \nThe study identified four types of information systems: Community\
    \ Radio, \nCommercial Radio, Mobile-based-only platforms, and Farmer-to-Farmer.\
    \ \nAlthough these systems had similarities, there were clear differences in their\
    \ \nset-up. Each information system also engaged end-users differently in \ninformation\
    \ provision and interaction towards creating actionable knowledge.  \nChapter\
    \ 5\n142\n \n \na.  Community radio \nCommunity Radio is an integral part of the\
    \ information set-up at community \nand district level. Community Radio such as\
    \ Simli Radio operates from \nDalung with a mission to create a platform for information\
    \ sharing and \ndiscuss issues relevant for local economic development. Targeted\
    \ listeners \nare community members within the Kumbungu District, and about 70\
    \ percent \nof activities focus on the local agricultural economy. The radio is\
    \ managed \nby inhabitants with a human resource capacity of about 10 people,\
    \ mostly \nvolunteers. Programmes are broadcast in Dagbanli (90%) and English\
    \ (10%). \nProgramme plans are designed and periodically updated throughout the\
    \ year \nin response to demand and funding. Transmission takes place via Frequency\
    \ \nModulation through radio systems. Agricultural information is gathered from\
    \ \nindigenous and scientific sources and disseminated to farmers by radio.  \n\
    \ \nCommunity Radio contributes to actionable knowledge creation relevant for\
    \ \ndecision-making. Firstly, farmers are consulted directly during radio \nprogrammes\
    \ for relevant data such as predicted seasonal conditions based on \ntraditional\
    \ indicators such as movement of clouds, ants, and temperature. \nCommunity Radio\
    \ programme hosts compare this with scientific forecasts \nprovided by institutions\
    \ such as GMet and the Ministry of Agriculture. \nDeliberations in the studio\
    \ involving hosts and experienced farmers further \nallow for knowledge synthesis\
    \ based on information received. Discussions \nbegin with special signature tunes6\
    \ to attract listeners’ attention. Experienced \nfarmers are engaged at this stage\
    \ in studio panel discussions to further \ninterpret information towards the production\
    \ of actionable knowledge during \nspecial transmissions,7 although emerging knowledge\
    \ is not farm specific, \ncrop-specific agronomic advice is sometimes provided.\
    \ For example, rice \nfarmers benefit from knowledge on how forecasted seasonal\
    \ rainfall \nconditions could affect rice cultivation; or farmers are advised\
    \ by the in-\nstudio panel as to when to prepare their lands for early or late\
    \ rains and what \n                                                 \n \n6 Example:\
    \ ‘Dandi kugmani kambong –lana’ which means ‘the one who buys is not equal \n\
    with the one who produces/farms’. \n7 Entitled Best Farmer Programme. \nInformation\
    \ systems and actionable knowledge creation\nChapter 5\n143\n \n \nvarieties to\
    \ cultivate. In-studio panel discussions continue throughout the \nseason providing\
    \ relevant information. Drama is used in some instances to \ncommunicate information\
    \ deemed relevant at particular junctures. During the \nprogramme, farmers can\
    \ phone in and contribute to discussions. \nCommunicating in Dagbanli makes it\
    \ easier for farmers to interpret new \nknowledge and increases the extent of\
    \ actionability or uptake.  \n \nb. Commercial radio \nCommercial Radio stations\
    \ are mostly set up with a regional or national rather \nthan a community or district\
    \ focus. Programmes cut across current affairs, \nwhich can be social, political,\
    \ or environmental. Savannah Radio, a subsidiary \nof the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation\
    \ (GBC) set up to disseminate \ninformation in the northern zone of the country,\
    \ is an example of Commercial \nRadio. Programmes are broadcast by the station\
    \ in English, Gonja and \nDagbanli, the major languages spoken within the zone.\
    \ The station, given its \nscope of transmission and status as a public entity,\
    \ benefits from partnerships \nwith development organisations implementing programmes\
    \ within the \nregion. Interactions with the programme’s director revealed that\
    \ only 10 \npercent of the station’s programmes focus on agriculture. Furthermore,\
    \ of its \ndaily operational hours, only four hours are presented in the local\
    \ languages \n(2 hours each in Dagbanli and Gonja). Partners sponsoring agriculture-related\
    \ \nprogrammes include the United State Agency for International Development \n\
    (ADVANCE programme), Farm Radio, and some agricultural service \nproviders. Private\
    \ individuals dealing in agricultural inputs also support \nagriculture-related\
    \ programmes.  \n \nCommercial Radio also provides agricultural information and\
    \ platforms for \nknowledge exchange and framing towards providing actionable\
    \ knowledge. \nProgrammes have limited agricultural content because of the scope\
    \ of \nactivities run by the radio stations. Savannah radio, for instance, dedicates\
    \ \nonly 4 hours a week to agriculture programmes. Any extra agriculture \nprogrammes\
    \ aired are sponsored and tailor-made depending on the sponsor’s \ninterest. In\
    \ some instances, willingness to pay is no guarantee that a \nprogramme will be\
    \ aired because there are numerous traditional programmes \nthat the radio stations\
    \ must consider and choose from. Broadcasting \nChapter 5\n144\n \n \nagricultural\
    \ programmes for only four hours a week means that farmers can \nonly access weekly\
    \ information relating to their practices. Agricultural \ninformation ranges broadly\
    \ from weather and seasonal forecasts for the region \nto information on input\
    \ suppliers in the regional capital. This platform \nprovides less opportunity\
    \ for in-depth discussion. Phone-in sessions during \nin-studio discussion are\
    \ limited to 15 minutes. The limited time allotted for \nagriculture programmes\
    \ affects the degree to which hosts and in-studio panels \ncan engage farmers\
    \ for more locally contextualised input in discussions. \nListeners are provided\
    \ with information on fertiliser and weedicide types and \napplication methods.\
    \ Programme formulation is thus mostly top-down, and \nfarmers are perceived as\
    \ listeners only. Regional market information is also \ncommunicated during the\
    \ harvesting period. This sometimes proves useful \nfor farmers to decide on when\
    \ to harvest their crops.  \n \nc. Mobile-based-only platforms  \nMobile-based-only\
    \ platforms, including ESOKO, MTN, and Vodafone, also \nplay an important role\
    \ in information service delivery. These operate from \nset-ups outside the region\
    \ and disseminate relevant information to farmers via \nmobile technology through\
    \ Short Message Services (SMS) and Interactive \nVoice Response (IVR), with fewer\
    \ face-to-face interactions. Farmer clubs \nhave been created as part of the set-up\
    \ enabling interaction between and \namongst farmers for free as part of club\
    \ membership. SMS is packaged in \nEnglish and thus farmers in some cases rely\
    \ on their children, educated family \nmembers, or literate farmers to make sense\
    \ of information received as \ninformation is communicated in numbers and texts\
    \ and not graphics. Farmers \ncan dial assigned short codes to place calls directly\
    \ to interact with operators \nof these platforms. About 80 percent of farmers\
    \ interviewed either owned \nmobile phones or had at least one family member who\
    \ owned a phone through \nwhich they could access information. Although mobile\
    \ technology ownership \nis high, farmers have yet to benefit from its huge potential\
    \ in the agricultural \nspace. Periodically, Mobile-based-only operators call\
    \ farmers directly, \nespecially at the beginning of the season as part of data\
    \ collation.  \n \nMobile-based-only Platforms provide pre-season forecasts directly\
    \ to farmers \nthrough their mobile phones in both voice and text formats. Farmers\
    \ who are \nInformation systems and actionable knowledge creation\nChapter 5\n\
    145\n \n \nsigned up to farmer clubs formed by Vodafone receive free tailored\
    \ voice or \ntext messages. Registration to join a farmer club involves stating\
    \ the preferred \nlanguage of communication. Farmers are thus able to understand\
    \ voice \nmessages sent to them. ESOKO partners with Vodafone to disseminate \n\
    information on seasonal forecasts and varieties of crops to cultivate. With the\
    \ \nplatform allowing free calls between club members, farmers have the \nopportunity\
    \ to deliberate on what is communicated to them. Farmers can have \nfollow-up\
    \ consultations with Vodafone using a short code (550) known club \nmembers. Farmers\
    \ are able to consult ESOKO on all networks (short code \n1900). The interaction\
    \ allows for the creation of actionable knowledge given \nlocally observed indigenous\
    \ information and knowledge and expert \ninterpretations mostly informed by scientific\
    \ information. Farmers are thus \nable to obtain actionable knowledge over the\
    \ farming season to inform their \ndecision-making.  \n \nd. Informal farmer-to-farmer\
    \ systems \nFarmer-to-Farmer systems are framed around communities’ existing social\
    \ \nstructures. They comprise mostly unstructured social gatherings for face-to-\n\
    face interactions within open spaces in communities. Communication is \nusually\
    \ in Dagbanli, in mostly a male-dominated gatherings in the late \nafternoon almost\
    \ every day throughout the year. In a few cases women meet \nto deliberate on\
    \ the side. Experienced farmers in the main drive the \ndiscussions. The stage\
    \ opens with salutations asking about health and well-\nbeing. As most farmers\
    \ practise multi-cropping or mixed farming, discourse \nis not usually crop focused.\
    \ Experiential knowledge, observed conditions, and \npredictions all inform discourse\
    \ in this case. Younger farmers defer to older \nones to share their experiences.\
    \ Key questions are posed, such as: What will \nthe rains be like this season?\
    \ How do we secure farm inputs? How will this \nseason fare in comparison with\
    \ last season given observed factors? How do \nwe share labour efforts?. What\
    \ crops and varieties will be best to cultivate in \nthis season? Expressions\
    \ sometimes involve community-specific locally \ncoined names and words for crops\
    \ and practices. With farmers joining in and \nmoving out of gatherings, discussions\
    \ usually continue till late in the evening.  \n \nChapter 5\n146\n \n \nReflections\
    \ during Farmer-to-Farmer gatherings continuously improve \navailable agricultural\
    \ knowledge. In gatherings that are mostly unstructured \nbut guided by social\
    \ constructions of engagement and interaction, farmers \nperiodically connect\
    \ and consciously or unconsciously formulate knowledge \nthat drives action. The\
    \ framing of knowledge directly related to practices and \nobservations contributes\
    \ to actionable knowledge upon which farmers can act \non. Farmers with questions\
    \ receive the best input from more experienced \nfarmers who equally understand\
    \ the soil type, disease characteristics, and safe \npractices in the community\
    \ context. Younger farmers thus obtain trustworthy \nknowledge and are able to\
    \ consult other farmers within the community at an \nopportune time. For example,\
    \ rice farmers who cultivate similar varieties \ncontinuously interact with their\
    \ neighbours and share knowledge on observed \nconditions and the best water management\
    \ and farm maintenance practices to \nadopt, including knowledge on tried and\
    \ tested weedicides and pesticides. \nThis process continues over the season,\
    \ allowing validation of experiential \nknowledge that becomes actionable for\
    \ the next step towards a productive \nseason.  \n \n5.4.2 How information systems\
    \ create actionable knowledge \nThis section presents findings on how each independent\
    \ information system \nfits into the broader network of systems framing knowledge\
    \ with reference to \nfarmer and system interactions. Rice farmers within the\
    \ study area interact \nwith all information systems identified, depending on\
    \ which medium the \nfarmer owns or can access. The information systems are characterised\
    \ broadly \nas engaging farmers in gathering similar information and knowledge\
    \ content, \nalthough through different media.  \n \nThe network of information\
    \ systems as a single unit thus further enables \nactionable knowledge creation\
    \ in rice-farming systems, although this is not \nconsciously structured and regulated.\
    \ For instance, farmer engagement with \nCommercial Radio, Community Radio, and\
    \ Mobile-based-only platforms \nprovides them with insightful information that\
    \ also guides discussion and \nactionable knowledge creation in Farmer-to-Farmer\
    \ systems. For example, \nexperienced farmers who act as panellists in Community\
    \ Radios like Simli in \nInformation systems and actionable knowledge creation\n\
    Chapter 5\n147\n \n \nDalung also partake in meetings held in communities as part\
    \ of Farmer-to-\nFarmer interactions. As indicated by one farmer in Biegu: \n\
    \ \nWe listen to radio for relevant agricultural information every day. When we\
    \ \nmeet with other farmers within the community, we discuss what such \ninformation\
    \ means for our farming practice for the season. Out of this \ndiscussion, complementing\
    \ and contrasting views emerge, which also helps \nin concluding on the way forwards\
    \ as to what knowledge is best and must be \nadopted. Some farmers amongst us\
    \ also serve as panellists on radio and \nprovide us with insightful feedback\
    \ when related to our farm practices. \n \nThus, Farmer-to-Farmer systems serve\
    \ as the point for final deliberation, \nconsidering available agricultural information,\
    \ which can be scientific or \nindigenous. Actionable knowledge here is thus informed\
    \ by knowledge \nemerging from other systems. Similarly, in airing their views\
    \ during phone-\nin sessions on the radio, farmers make reference to the actionable\
    \ knowledge \nthat emerges from Farmer-to-Farmer interactions to support their\
    \ arguments. \nThus, the creation of locally relevant knowledge in a transparent\
    \ and \ntrustworthy way is best attained in Farmer-to-Farmer systems.  \n \n5.4.3\
    \ Information system contribution to actionable knowledge creation \nGiven the\
    \ existence of a network of information systems, actionable \nknowledge creation\
    \ is not limited to a particular system, as farmers engage \nwith all systems\
    \ identified within the study area. However, as shown in Table \n5.3, the degree\
    \ to which information systems contribute to actionable \nknowledge creation varies.\
    \ It is essential to identify which system contributes \nmost to actionable knowledge\
    \ creation in order to inform discussions on \ninformation uptake and the key\
    \ factors that are significant in ensuring uptake.  \n \nOverall, Farmer-to-Farmer\
    \ systems emerged as enabling most the creation of \nactionable knowledge, followed\
    \ by Community Radio, Commercial Radio, \nand Mobile-based-only platforms. Farmer-to-Farmer\
    \ systems provide the \nmost apposite opportunity for farmers to access local\
    \ agricultural information \neasily relatable to their practices and food systems.\
    \ Contextually valid \nknowledge is also created with specific outcomes on what\
    \ and when to \nChapter 5\n148\n \n \nimplement at farm level. As there are no\
    \ barriers to participation in \ndiscussions, actionable knowledge is finetuned\
    \ in terms of its salience, \ncredibility, and legitimacy. Community Radio is\
    \ the second platform that \ncontributes most to actionable knowledge creation.\
    \ Although Community \nRadio does not allow similar room for discourse and participation\
    \ as Farmer-\nto-Farmer systems, it strongly enables the creation of actionable\
    \ knowledge \nhighly applicable at community and farm level. Commercial Radio\
    \ systems \nand Mobile-based-only platforms contribute least to actionable knowledge\
    \ \ncreation. Neither system creates much room for continuous validation of \n\
    knowledge and the provision of timely localised knowledge valid at farm \nlevel.\
    \ Thus, although most farmers have access to mobile phones, their \npotential\
    \ has yet to be maximised, especially on Mobile-based-only \nPlatforms. In Table\
    \ 5.3, we present in qualitative terms the extent to which \ninformation systems\
    \ enable actionable knowledge creation in rice-farming \nsystems.  \n \n \nTable\
    \ 5.3: Capacities of information systems to create actionable knowledge \n \n\

    \ participatory process of \nknowledge creation.  \nInformation systems and actionable\
    \ knowledge creation\nChapter 5\n149\n \n \nsystems also differs. Information\
    \ systems that are highly participatory and \ninteractive help greatly to produce\
    \ actionable knowledge. Here, we discuss \nsuch systems and identify lessons for\
    \ the design of information services in \nrice-production systems.  \n \n5.5.1\
    \ Towards conceptualizing actionable knowledge \nIn our interpretation of actionable\
    \ knowledge, we explore the factors of \nsalience, credibility, and legitimacy.\
    \ A thrust of our research is that actionable \nknowledge is context dependent\
    \ (see also (Brunet et al., 2018; Geertsema et \nal., 2016; Zakaria & Nagata,\
    \ 2010; Okigbo, & Igboaka, 2008; Meinke et al., \n2006). Secondly, actionable\
    \ knowledge constitutes a question of process and \ncontent framed around local\
    \ and external conditions. Although Cash et al. \n(2003) amongst others (see also\
    \ Dilling & Lemos, 2011; Feldman & Ingram, \n2009; Meinke & Stone, 2005) focus\
    \ on scientific information and how that \ncan be made relevant, our approach\
    \ identifies two types of information as \nestablished in other works (see Nyasimi\
    \ et al., 2017; Gilles & Valdivia, 2009). \nOur study establishes the existence\
    \ of both process and content questions (see \nalso Ha et al., 2008), indicating\
    \ the need to study not only the ‘what’ of \ninformation but also the ‘how’ in\
    \ knowledge discussions. Our study points to \na transitioning from information\
    \ to knowledge to decision-making in making \ninformation applicable (see also\
    \ Aker et al., 2016). Also, when actionable \nknowledge is being created from\
    \ information, uncertainty must be discussed, \ngiven that change is continuous\
    \ and thus the actionability of knowledge is tied \nto time and change in environmental\
    \ and socio-cultural conditions. \n(Eernstman & Wals, 2009) affirm this by asserting\
    \ that knowledge systems \nare not static. \n \nActionable knowledge can result\
    \ from more than one knowledge system. \nOther scholarly works acknowledging this\
    \ phenomenon express it in terms \nsuch as hybrid knowledge (Pauli, Barrios, Conacher,\
    \ & Oberthur, 2012) and \nintegrated knowledge (see also Restrepo, Lelea, & Kaufmann,\
    \ 2018; \nKniveton et al., 2015) pointing to the strength in complementary actionable\
    \ \nknowledge rather than only indigenous independent knowledge (see also \nDujardin,\
    \ Hermesse, & Dendoncker, 2018; Akullo et al., 2007; Mbilinyi, \nChapter 5\n150\n\
    \ \n \nTumbo, Mahoo, Senkondo, & Hatibu, 2005; Altieri, 1996; Veraart, \nKlostermann,\
    \ van Slobbe, & Kabat, 2018; Biggelaar, 1991). \n \nFurthermore, studying and\
    \ interpreting actionable knowledge in the ICT \ncontext requires the pursuance\
    \ of system questions about these integrative \nplatforms and their framing in\
    \ the context of other environmental and social \nconditions in the current information\
    \ age. We discuss this in the next section \nwith reference to our findings, amongst\
    \ others. \n \n5.5.2 Improving actionable knowledge creation: a systems perspective\
    \ \nEarlier works suggest that farmers decide on what information to adopt \n\
    depending on what information system is involved (see Adegbola & \nGardebroek,\
    \ 2007; Moser & Barrett, 2006). Although the factors of trust and \ninterpretation\
    \ are significant here, our study points to a basic fact that farmers \ndo not\
    \ interact with a single information system (see Figure 5.3). Farmers \ninteract\
    \ concurrently with multiple information systems, hence the \nactionability of\
    \ knowledge is a question of the whole. Cash et al. (2003) \nindicate the need\
    \ for information to be made salient, credible, and legitimate, \nbut there is\
    \ also need for a criterion that allows the monitoring of how the \ndifferent\
    \ information systems jointly enable knowledge creation for use by \ndecision-makers\
    \ (see Figure 3). We thus propose that considerable attention \nbe paid to the\
    \ degree of systems integration as an indicator of how information \nsystems enable\
    \ actionable knowledge creation. We define systems integration \nas the degree\
    \ of differences or commonalities between information systems in \nterms of structure,\
    \ function and approach to user engagement, information \nprovision and how this\
    \ translate into actionable knowledge creation. In the \ncase of organisational\
    \ data management, Fong (2006) mentions schema \nintegration and data integration\
    \ as methods through which conflicts in data \ncan be managed towards improving\
    \ information provided. The Unified Multi-\nChannel Service Model cited by Zhang\
    \ et al. (2016) in their study of \ninformation dissemination models in China\
    \ is typical of a formal system \nregulated by a formalised institution to engage\
    \ multiple models in a single \nsystem. In farming systems however, the absence\
    \ of a single regulatory body \ngarnering private and public efforts at information\
    \ dissemination leaves \nactionable knowledge from a systemic perspective to the\
    \ farmer. This thus \nInformation systems and actionable knowledge creation\n\
    Chapter 5\n151\n \n \nsuggest the need for institutions to attempt to engage both\
    \ public and private \ninformation system operators in a conscious integration\
    \ process for end-users \nlike farmers to be able to benefit significantly and\
    \ improve actionable \nknowledge creation. Therefore, in section 5.3, we explore\
    \ the synergistic \nopportunities available in the systems we studied to improve\
    \ actionable \nknowledge creation from a systems perspective. \n \nSecondly, the\
    \ process of knowledge creation within farming systems is \nembedded in socio-cultural\
    \ community settings. For example, the extent to \nwhich farmers interact with\
    \ information systems in the study area is \ninfluenced by how these systems are\
    \ aligned to traditional ways of \ninformation exchange and decision-making. Knowledge\
    \ towards decision-\nmaking is led by men. Thus, although information systems\
    \ aim to ensure an \neffective engagement process with end-users, the skewness\
    \ of interactions \nand non-sensitivity as to who is involved in decision-making\
    \ could limit the \napplication of supposed actionable knowledge. Consequently,\
    \ gender \ndynamics and information access and actionable knowledge creation amongst\
    \ \nrice farmers is a key factor that must be further investigated. With women\
    \ \nplaying a limited role in information access and use, women farmers, \nalthough\
    \ few, are not only limited in accessing the right information at the \nright\
    \ time, but also not usually involved in the knowledge creation process. \nThus,\
    \ we propose that local actor participation be examined in studying how \ninformation\
    \ translates into actionable knowledge for decision-making in the \ncontext of\
    \ information systems. We define local actor participation as the \nextent to\
    \ which information systems define roles for local actors permanently \nor otherwise\
    \ in the design and operationalisation of information systems. \nKlerkx et al.\
    \ (2012) reiterate that farming systems are constructed by farmers, \ndepending\
    \ on their material resources and structures of which technology is \npart.  \n\
    \ \nAlthough Cash et al. (2003) indicate that users’ values and beliefs should\
    \ be \nconsidered in legitimising knowledge, we propose that attention be placed\
    \ not \njust on users’ values and beliefs, but also on defining roles guided by\
    \ local \ngovernance arrangements (see also Termeer, Dewulf, & Biesbroek, 2017).\
    \ \nThe salience factor significantly determines actionability in farming systems\
    \ \nChapter 5\n152\n \n \nbecause of contextualised knowledge (see also Dewulf\
    \ et al., 2005). As \ndiscussed by (Geertsema et al., 2016) in their study on\
    \ ecological \nintensification in agriculture, stakeholder participation is fundamental\
    \ to \ndefining what is relevant and actionable. The classification of farmers\
    \ as ‘end-\nusers and information systems operators as producers limits the co-creation\
    \ \nfactor relevant for producing actionable knowledge. Klerkx et al. (2012) \n\
    argue for a shift from knowledge development to learning and adaptive \ncapacity\
    \ framed through collaboration (Kristjanson et al., 2009).  \n \n \nInformation\

    \ \nknowledge? \nIn the current discussion on big data in agriculture, technology\
    \ provides a \ngreat potential for data management and knowledge creation in farming\
    \ \nsystems (Stephen Sonka, 2015; S. Sonka, 2014). Of the four information \n\
    systems identified, we discuss potential interdependencies that, when \nharnessed,\
    \ could improve knowledge made available for decision-making in \nrice-farming\
    \ systems (see Table 5.4). \n \nIn discussing opportunities for synergies, Community\
    \ Radio and Farmer-to-\nFarmer systems for example, can collaboratively engage\
    \ farmers within \ncommunities in informal meetings as part of knowledge creation\
    \ processes. \n(Hudson, Leclair, Pelletier, & Sullivan, 2017) talk about Participatory\
    \ Radio \nProgramme which they describe as a planned series of radio programs\
    \ \nbroadcasted to a targeted farming population over a specific period of time.\
    \ \n(Diedong & Naaikuur, 2014) point to local ownership as a key challenge of\
    \ \nCommunity Radio systems in Ghana. Evidence from our study buttresses the \n\
    need to further engage community members directly within their community \nsettings.\
    \ Operators of Community Radio systems should liaise with \nleadership of community\
    \ groups for radio discussions to be organised within \nlocal farmer-to-farmer\
    \ meetings to strengthen the sense of belongingness and \nownership.   \n  \n\
    Etwire et al. (2017) also outline the potential of Mobile-based-only platforms\
    \ \nsuch as ESOKO in agriculture information provision, whilst agreeing, we \n\
    propose possible opportunities for collaboration between Mobile-based-only \n\
    platforms and other platforms amongst others as explored in other studies \n(See\

    \ \n \n5.6 Conclusion \nThis paper has argued that the role of information systems\
    \ in rice-farming \nsystems is vital. The study has revealed that information\
    \ systems function \ndifferently in creating actionable knowledge relevant for\
    \ decision-making. \nOur study concludes that actionable knowledge is most attainable\
    \ in Farmer-\nto-Farmer systems because of the degree of interactivity that occurs\
    \ within \nsuch systems and the extent to which scientific and experiential knowledge\
    \ \ncollectively informs the process. However, a systems perspective suggests\
    \ \nthat it is essential to have a framework establishing the synergy between\
    \ \nsystems and regulating collaborative actionable knowledge creation. The \n\
    study has also revealed that the process through which information translates\
    \ \ninto actionable knowledge occurs differently in the various information \n\
    systems. Nevertheless, mobile phones are instrumentally used in the \ninteractive\
    \ process of knowledge creation between farmers and information \nsystem operators.\
    \ This is further justified by the argument that local actor \nparticipation in\
    \ the functionality of information systems is crucial. The \ninsights gained from\
    \ this study will thus be of relevance to the scientific \ncommunity who aim to\
    \ understand the pitfalls and success conditions relevant \nfor operating information\
    \ systems for impact. The most important limitation \nof the study is its non-consideration\
    \ of other farmers producing other crops \nwhose experience and input might differ.\
    \ With most information systems \nshifting between different crop-farming systems,\
    \ further studies on how the \nresearch questions could be answered in different\
    \ farming systems could \ncontribute to a more holistic understanding of the wider\
    \ subject. The study \nalso limits the research to operationalisation of information\
    \ systems in the \ncontext of local governance arrangements, although regional\
    \ and national \nlevels have an impact on what is workable or not. Further research\
    \ on multi-\nlevel interactions and how they shape communication and information\
    \ flow \nis of the essence.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \nChapter 5\n158\n \n \nAcknowledgements\

    Information systems and actionable knowledge creation\nChapter 5\n159\nForecast\
    \ probability, lead time and \nfarmer decision-making in rice\nfarming systems\
    \ in northern Ghana\nChapter 6\nChapter 6\n162\n \n \nAbstract \nRice farmers\
    \ in Northern Ghana are susceptible to climate variability and \nchange with its\
    \ effects in the form of drought, water scarcity, erratic rainfall \nand high\
    \ temperatures. In response, farmers resort to weather and seasonal \nforecast\
    \ to manage uncertainties in decision-making. However, there is \nlimited empirical\
    \ research on how forecast lead time and probabilities \ninfluence farmer decision-making.\
    \ In this study, we posed the overall \nquestion: how do rice farmers respond\
    \ to forecast information with different \nprobabilities and lead times? We purposively\
    \ engaged 36 rice farmers (12 \nrainfed, 12 irrigated and 12 practising both)\
    \ in Visually Facilitated Scenario \nMapping Workshops (VFSMW) to explore how\
    \ lead times and probabilities \ninform their decision-making. Results of the\
    \ VFSMW showed rainfed rice \nfarmers are most sensitive to forecast probabilities\
    \ because of their over \nreliance on rainfall. An increase in forecast probability\
    \ does not necessarily \nmean farmers will act. The decision to act based on forecast\
    \ probability is \ndependent on which farming stage there is. Also, seasonal forecast\
    \ \ninformation provided at 1 month lead time significantly informed farmer \n\
    decision-making compared to a lead time 2 or 3 months. Also, weather \nforecast\
    \ provided at a lead time of 1 week is more useful for decision-making \nthan\
    \ at a 3 day or 1 day lead time. We conclude that communicating forecasts \ninformation\
    \ with their probabilities and at an appropriate lead time can help \nfarmers\
    \ manage risks and improve decision-making. We propose that climate \nservices\
    \ in Northern Ghana should aim at communicating weather and \nseasonal climate\
    \ forecast information at 1 week and 1month lead times \nrespectively. Farmers\
    \ should also adapt their decisions to the timing and \nprobabilities of the forecast\
    \ provided.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nManuscript under review: Nyamekye,\

    \ \n \n6.1 Introduction \nAgriculture development in many parts of Africa is heavily\
    \ impacted by \nclimate variability and change (Benin et al., 2011; Müller et\
    \ al., 2011). The \nincreasingly unpredictable and erratic nature of weather and\
    \ climate \nconditions on the continent is expected to compromise agricultural\
    \ production \nand rural livelihoods, especially in smallholder systems with little\
    \ adaptive \ncapacity (Kurukulasuriya et al., 2006; Cooper et al., 2008). For\
    \ instance, \nchanges in rainfall onset, duration and cessation have already caused\
    \ \nsignificant adjustment to farming activities (Jotoafrika, 2013; Salack et\
    \ al., \n2015). \n \nGhana is one example of such countries facing these challenges.\
    \ An enormous \nnumber of its farmers rely solely on rainfall, with less than\
    \ 1% of land under \nirrigation ( World Bank, 2010; Armah et al., 2011; De Pinto\
    \ et al., 2012). The \nSavanna belt of the country is most impacted throughout\
    \ the year with \nirregular rainfall, high temperatures and water scarcity conditions(Akudugu\
    \ \nM. A. Dittoh S., 2012; Quaye W., 2008; Rademacher-Schulz, Schraven, & \nMahama,\
    \ 2014). The advent of climate variability and change has deepened \nthe woes\
    \ of farmers who mostly rely on rainfall to meet water needs at the \nfarm level.\
    \ Irrigated farmers are equally threatened when water levels in \nreservoirs are\
    \ too low for irrigation (E. Nyadzi et al., 2018)et al. 2018). As a \nresult,\
    \ rice production in the north of Ghana is severely impacted due to its \nhigh\
    \ crop water requirement (Kranjac-Berisavljevic & Blench 2003). Yet, \nrice is\
    \ a staple food and the need to meet demand under rapidly changing and \nvarying\
    \ climatic conditions in the area is a major concern(SARI, 2011). \n \nAs part\
    \ of efforts to manage uncertainties, rice farmers seek forecast \ninformation\
    \ on weather and seasonal climatic conditions (rainfall amount, \nrainfall distribution,\
    \ onset, cessation etc.) for informed decision-making \n(Grothmann & Patt, 2005;\
    \ Nyamekye et al., 2018). Forecast information is \nexpected to improve farmer\
    \ decision-making by informing choices on how \nand when to plant, fertilize and\
    \ plan supplementary irrigation, amongst others \n(Defiesta et al., 2014; Risbey,\
    \ Kandlikar et al.,1999).  \n \nChapter 6\n164\n \n \nCurrently, farmers in Northern\
    \ Ghana obtain forecast information from the \nGhana Meteorological Services and\
    \ private information service providers \nsuch as ESOKO and Farmerline (Nyamekye\
    \ et al., 2019). However, the \nassumption that all seasonal and weather forecast\
    \ information made available \nto farmers are useful and used in decision making\
    \ has been questioned due to \na number of challenges (Adiku et al., 2007). First\
    \ is the timeliness of \ninformation. Meteorological information are not made\
    \ available at the right \ntime could be of limited value to farmers in decision-making.\
    \ Second is the \nreliability of meteorological information and how the probability\
    \ of an event \noccurring also informs farmer decision-making. Important questions\
    \ that \nmust be addressed include: How does lead time inform farmer decision-\n\
    making? At what probability will farmers decide to act or otherwise given \nmeteorological\
    \ information received? Thus, establishing how farmers make \nsense of meteorological\
    \ information considering lead times and probabilities \nis valuable in ensuring\
    \ information uptake.  \nIn this study, we build onto the work of Nyadzi et al.\
    \ (2019) and Nyamekye \net al. (2018) who studied forecast information needs and\
    \ decision making in \nthe Kumbungu district in Northern Ghana respectively. From\
    \ Nyadzi et al. \n(2019) we see rice farmers considering hydro-climatic information\
    \ needs \naffirming challenges of unreliability and non-applicability of information\
    \ \ncurrently made available especially rainfall. Nyamekye et al. (2018), also\
    \ \nexplored farmer adaptive decision-making and re-iterate how choice making\
    \ \namongst farmers is highly dependent on the type of meteorological \ninformation\
    \ available. Both studies affirm the need to understand the \ninformation-decision-making\
    \ relationship in rice farming systems in \nNorthern Ghana to improve productivity\
    \ at the farm level. Building on these \nstudies, we address the overarching question\
    \ “how do rice farmers respond to \nforecast information with different probabilities\
    \ and at different lead times?” \nTo answer this, we pose three specific research\
    \ questions: \n1. How does forecast probability influence farmers’ willingness\
    \ to \ntake decisions? \n2. How does seasonal forecast lead time influence farmers’\
    \ decisions? \n3.  How does weather forecast lead time influence farmers’ decisions?\
    \ \n \nForecast probability, lead time and farmer decision-making\nChapter 6\n\
    165\n \n \n6.2 Theoretical framework \nIn farming systems, farmers as decision\
    \ makers aim to understand complex \nconditions such as climate variability and\
    \ change and its consequences on \ntheir choices in their effort to maximize utility\
    \ (Gigerenzer & Selten, 2002; \nOlsson et al., 2004; Smit & Wandel, 2006; Buytaert\
    \ et al., 2010; Termeer et \nal., 2011). Thus, meteorological information as a\
    \ resource informs decision \ndynamics through a process of (re)framing to reduce\
    \ risks (Barnes et al., \n2013; Wallace & Moss, 2002). Where available, the degree\
    \ to which \nmeteorological information, especially on rainfall, is timely and\
    \ reliable \ndetermines farmers’ willingness to act and the kind of decisions\
    \ they take ( \nVerbeke, 2005; Weaver et al., 2013; Dewulf & Biesbroek, 2018;\
    \ Gbangou et \nal., 2019). In climate change literature, uncertainty and forecast\
    \ lead times \nhave been highlighted in bridging climate information usability\
    \ gaps in \ndecision-making( Podestá et al., 2002; Lemos et al., 2012; Mase &\
    \ Prokopy, \n2014; Roudier et al., 2014). \n \nThis study sought to test three\
    \ hypotheses in understanding the relationship \nbetween meteorological information\
    \ (focusing on rainfall) and farmer \ndecision-making although there are a lot\
    \ of factors that determine farmer use \nof meteorological forecast(Vogel, 2000;\
    \ Ziervogel, 2004). First, that the \nhigher the probability associated with a\
    \ forecast, the more farmers are willing \nto act on their decision at every stage\
    \ of decision-making within the farming \ncycle. In this case, although the probability\
    \ of a forecast cannot be 100 \npercent, farmers irrespective of practising rainfed\
    \ or irrigated farming will act \nout their intended decision when rainfall probability\
    \ is high. Weisheimer and \nPalmer (2014) opine that probabilistic reliability\
    \ should be the foremost \nmeasure of the ‘goodness’ of a forecast. Herewith,\
    \ the ‘goodness’ of a \nforecast is a contextual question requiring the positioning\
    \ of its interpretation \nin specific farming systems. Letson et al. (2001) concur\
    \ with reference to their \nfindings on obstacles to greater use of climate information.\
    \ Langford and \nHendon (2013) affirm and buttress how unreliability remains an\
    \ impediment \nto the uptake of climate related information.  \n \nOur second\
    \ hypothesis is that seasonal forecast communicated at different \nlead times\
    \ has consequences on the choices farmers make in seasonal \nChapter 6\n166\n\
    \ \n \ndecision-making. Thirdly, we also posit that weather forecast made available\
    \ \nat different lead times significantly drives in-season decision making. \n\
    Forecast communicated with a ‘sufficient’ lead time has a positive correlation\
    \ \nwith productivity (Zinyengere et al., 2011). Seasonal climate forecast has\
    \ no \nintrinsic value except for their ability to influence decisions of users\
    \ \n(Hammer, 2000). Sub-seasonal-to-seasonal forecasting range seen as \n‘predictability\
    \ desert’ due to initial difficulties has gained attention in the bid \nto bridge\
    \ the gap between weather forecasts and seasonal outlooks (Vitart et \nal., 2012).\
    \ Randomizing probability, seasonal and weather information \nvariables in the\
    \ context of rice farming systems requires holding other \nconditions (finance,\
    \ land, labour, etc.) that influence decision-making \nconstant.  \n \n6.3 Methodology\
    \ \n6.3.1 Study area \nThe study was undertaken in the Kumbungu District in the\
    \ Northern region \nof Ghana as shown in Figure 6.1. The district, located within\
    \ the Guinea \nSavannah agro-ecological zone covers a land area of 1,599km2 with\
    \ \nKumbungu as its capital. The District shares boundaries to the north with\
    \ \nMamprugu/Moagduri district, Tolon and North Gonja districts to the west, \n\
    Sagnerigu Municipal to the south and Savelugu Municipal to the east (Abdul-\n\
    Malik & Mohammed, 2012). Farming is the mainstay of inhabitants \ncultivating\
    \ cereals, tubers and vegetables including rice, millet, sorghum, \ngroundnut,\
    \ tomatoes and pepper. Average annual rainfall is 1000mm with the \nmain cropping\
    \ season stretching over the period of May to late October \n(Quaye et al., 2009).\
    \ The temperature is warm, dry and hazy between \nFebruary and April. The district\
    \ is drained by the White Volta and other \nsmaller rivers and their tributaries\
    \ with most drying up in the dry season. The \nBontanga Irrigation Scheme located\
    \ within the district also supports irrigated \nfarming with crops such as rice\
    \ and vegetable mostly produced within the \nscheme.  \nForecast probability,\
    \ lead time and farmer decision-making\nChapter 6\n167\n \n \n \nFigure 6.1: Map\
    \ showing the study location \n \n6.3.2 Research design \nScenario Workshops (SW)\
    \ have roots in technological assessments and \noriginally designed to facilitate\
    \ engagement between scientists and citizens in \nthe appraisal of new technologies\
    \ (Andersen & Jaeger, 1999). SWs have also \ndominated planning circles for giving\
    \ a participatory foresight to resource \nmanagement and also used in engaging\
    \ citizens in testing technological \nsolutions(Andersen & Jæger, 1999; Mayer,\
    \ 1997; Rinaudo et al., 2012). The \nstudy adopted a Visual Facilitated and Scenario\
    \ Mapping Workshops \n(VFSMW) (Hatzilacou et al., 2007; Mexa, 2002) focused on\
    \ three main \ngroupings of farmers; irrigated, rain fed and those who practised\
    \ both. \nChapter 6\n168\n \n \nA total of five workshops were organised. The\
    \ first workshop was a kick-off \nworkshop with the objective to select and familiarise\
    \ with the participants and \nexplain to them the rationale of the study. The\
    \ kick-off workshop also aimed \nat grouping farmers, setting up the environment\
    \ with the required tools as \nwell as agreeing on dates for the rest of the activities.\
    \ In addition, rules of \nengagement were communicated to the participants and\
    \ opportunities created \nfor questioning and clarifications. The second, third\
    \ and fourth workshops \nwere the VFSMW specifically focused on engaging different\
    \ farmer groups \ndirectly to test the different information variables and what\
    \ they mean for \nfarmer decision-making. Here, farmers were given a cardboard\
    \ and spinning \nwheels showing the source of information, certainty and forecast\
    \ lead-times. \nOn the cardboard was a matrix showing the cropping cycle for easy\
    \ \nrepresentation and understanding considering literacy levels of the \nparticipants.\
    \ Individually, participant(s) were taken through seven decision \npoints of the\
    \ cycle (see appendix 6a).  \nParticipant(s) were randomly exposed to three spinning\
    \ wheels with each \nwheel focusing on a key information variable (probability;\
    \ lead time \n(seasonal); lead time (weather). Each variable also had three main\
    \ indicators \nfor which farmers were required to indicate what decision they\
    \ will make \nconsidering these indicators. The purpose of the wheel is to allow\
    \ for \nrandomization of the information to be tested. The fifth workshop was\
    \ a \nvalidation and feedback workshop. At this workshop, preliminary results\
    \ \nwere communicated and discussed. Participants feedback on key findings \n\
    were also noted. The process for VFSMW is summarized in Figure 6.2. A \ndetailed\
    \ manual on design and steps of the VFSMW is presented in appendix \n6d. \n \n\

    \ \n \nFigure 6.2: Stepwise approach to the VFSMW \n \n6.3.3 Sample and sampling\
    \ approach \nWith the support of the leadership of farmer associations and the\

    \ from each \ncommunity engaged in either rainfed, irrigated or both) were purposively\
    \ \nsampled from 12 different communities for the VFSMW workshops (See \nFigure\
    \ 1). The VFSMW was used to test three (3) main variables and twelve \n(12) indicators\
    \ fashioned out of research questions. The variables include; (i) \nProbability\
    \ of rainfall forecast information for decision-making (ii) Lead \ntimes of weather\
    \ forecast for decision-making (iii) lead times of seasonal \nclimate forecast\
    \ for decision-making. For each of these three variables, a \ncouple of indicators\
    \ and their influence on decision-making was established \nfocusing on rainfall\
    \ and what prevails under normal conditions. Farmers were \nengaged in what decisions\
    \ they will take under different scenarios. The \nexperiment was carried out in\

    \ Interactions were based on the assumption that \nit will rain but at these different\
    \ probabilities. For each of these probabilities, \nwe recorded whether farmers\

    \ in data analysis. The \ndata gathered from the workshop were coded and entered\
    \ into SPSS version \n23 for analysis. The decisions gathered during the workshop\

    \ \n \n6.4 Results  \n6.4.1 Forecast probability as a determinant of risk acceptance\
    \ level \nOur study findings point to different sensitivities to probability depending\
    \ on \nwhat activities farmers had to undertake. The study showed a positive \n\
    correlation between forecast probabilities and farmers’ decision to act in the\
    \ \npre-season and planting. It emerged that, as probability increased, farmers\
    \ \nwere willing to take action on forecast information received (see Figure \n\
    6.3A). However, an inverse relationship between forecast probability and \ndecision\
    \ making was observed during the remaining stages of the farming \ncycle. Farmers\
    \ would rather withhold intended action at the point of land \npreparation, weed\
    \ control and fertilizer application when the probability of \nrainfall forecast\
    \ is high (see Figure 6.3B). Clearly, the aforementioned \nfarming stages are\
    \ very sensitive to the rains and cannot be favourably \ncompleted when rains\
    \ are expected. For example, farmers indicated that \nfertilizers do take a while\
    \ to be absorbed in the soil and undertaking such in \nthe moment of expected\
    \ rainfall could result in the fertilizer being washed \naway. Thus, although\
    \ high probability is a good indicator of rainfall \noccurrence, it also results\
    \ in non-action taking as a response.  \n \nChapter 6\n172\n \n \n \nFigure 6.3:\
    \ The general influence of forecast probabilities on farmers’ \ndecision to act\

    \ weed control, 1st and 2nd fertilizer application and \nharvesting] \nA further\
    \ disaggregation given different farming type showed that irrigated \nrice farmers\
    \ and to an extent those who practised both were least sensitive to \ndifferent\
    \ forecast probabilities compared to rainfed farmers. For irrigated \nfarmers,\
    \ this can be alluded to the option of meeting water needs through \nsupplementary\
    \ irrigation. Farmers who practised both might also have lesser \nrisk since they\
    \ may still count on their irrigated farms should the rains failed. \nRainfed\
    \ farmers however, remain sensitive because they have no option \nexcept to face\
    \ their lost and thus are sceptical in their decision making. \nAt the pre-season\
    \ and planting stages in Figure 6.4A, irrigated farmers will \nact irrespective\
    \ of the probability of the forecast information given. More \nrainfed farmers\
    \ and both will act given a forecast information with higher \nprobability. However,\
    \ during land preparation, weed control and fertilizer \napplication forecast\
    \ with high probability were faced with negated action by \nall group of farmers\
    \ (see Figure 6.4B). For example, irrigated farmers will \nalso not fertilize\
    \ if rainfall expectations are high because will result in \nwashing away of fertilizer\

    \ with farmers at the group level provided further \nevidence to the results obtained\
    \ at the individual level decision making. A \nhigher probability (above 0.75)\
    \ helps farmers in concreting their decision-\nmaking through choice making on\
    \ whether to take action or withhold \nundertaking an intended activity with the\
    \ ultimate aim of maximizing yield \nand productivity. Thus, farmers’ respond\
    \ to communicated forecast \nprobabilities depends on farmers estimated risk aversion.\
    \ Nevertheless, \nseveral external factors including financial capacities and\
    \ personal attributes \n(family size, belief, gender) also frame farmer decision-making.\
    \ Outcomes of \ngroup engagement also suggest that uncertainty in forecast information\
    \ which \nis currently not communicated to farmers by service providers such as\
    \ \nESOKO and Ghana Meteorological Agency is the reason for non-uptake as \ncompared\

    \ \nThe results of the study showed seasonal forecast provided at a 1 month lead\
    \ \ntime significantly informed farmer decision-making as part of preparatory\
    \ \narrangements before the season begins. Much also, irrespective of farming\

    \ farmer decision-making \nThe results revealed that farmers take different decisions\
    \ given weather \nforecast information at different lead times (see Table 6.1\
    \ and appendix 6c). \nAt the point of land preparation, 89% of all farmers indicated\
    \ given rainfall \nforecast information at a 1 day lead time, they will prepare\
    \ their lands using \na tractor. Similarly, 75% of farmers engaged still indicated\
    \ they will clear \ntheir farmlands using a tractor should they receive rainfall\
    \ forecast at a 3 day \nlead time. However, 73% indicated that they will use manual\
    \ labour to clear \ntheir lands when rainfall forecast is provided at a one week\
    \ lead time. \nRegarding decision-making on planting, majority of farmers showed\
    \ a \npreference for broadcasting seeds. The findings showed that 89% of farmers\
    \ \nwill broadcast their seeds when rainfall forecast is provided at a lead time\
    \ of \n1 day. Also, 70% and 64% will broadcast upon receiving rainfall information\
    \ \nat a lead time of 3 days and 1 week respectively.  \nThe decision on fertilizer\
    \ application is one of the most sensitive to water \navailability conditions.\
    \ Majority of farmers (97% at 1 day lead time, 83% at \n3 days lead time) will\
    \ apply fertilizer rather after rainfall using placement \nmethod and sprinkle\
    \ in case they intend to apply fertilizer before the rain \nwhen such information\
    \ is communicated. However, given rainfall forecast \ninformation at one week\
    \ lead time, farmers will apply fertilizer by placement. \nThus, a 1 week lead\
    \ time offers much flexibility in decision-making. \nThe application of weedicide\
    \ was less sensitive to rainfall with about 92%, \n97 % and 100% indicating they\
    \ will apply weedicide before rainfall when \nforecast information is communicated\
    \ at a 1 day, 3 days and 1 week \nrespectively. This is attributable to the fact\
    \ that farmers only need a few \nminutes to a couple of hours to complete the\
    \ task of spraying weedicides \nalthough that is also dependent on the size of\
    \ farmland under cultivation. \nThe second stage of fertilizer application also\
    \ pointed to the need for soil \nmoisture or ample time to apply fertilizer before\
    \ the rains. The results suggest \nsimilar practices as the first phase of fertilizer\
    \ application. Here, 89% of \nfarmers indicated they will apply fertilizer by\
    \ placement after the rains when \nForecast probability, lead time and farmer\
    \ decision-making\nChapter 6\n177\n \n \nforecast information is communicated\
    \ at a 1 day lead time. Similarly, more \nfarmers (56% and 60%) will prefer to\
    \ apply fertilizer by placement after \nrainfall given forecast at a lead time\
    \ of 3 days and 1 week respectively. Thus, \nthe sensitivity of farmer decision\
    \ to water availability conditions is more \nsevere at the first stage of fertilizer\
    \ application than the second. Farmers face \na greater risk of crop loss within\
    \ the period of the first fertilizer application \nthan the second. \nFarmers\
    \ indicated that harvesting is less sensitive to rainfall conditions but \nmore\
    \ defined by access to harvesting tools and machinery. In effect, given \nforecast\
    \ information, 75% of farmers will harvest with a combine harvester \nat a 1 day,\
    \ 3 day time and 64% of farmers will use the same method at 1 week \nlead time.\
    \ \nIndicatively, weather forecast provided at different lead times came with\
    \ \nchoices farmers found most appropriate that minimise their risk and chances\
    \ \nof completing activities at each stage in time. At no point did farmers point\
    \ \nto not do anything given forecast at different lead times. Table 1 presents\

    \ lead time and farmer decision-making\nChapter 6\n179\n \n \n6.5 Discussion \n\
    This paper sets out to understand how different forecast sources, lead times \n\
    and probabilities influence farmer’ decision making. We explored this \nrelationship\
    \ using different information scenarios and groups of farmers \nwithin rice farming\
    \ systems in a bid to investigate how seasonal and weather \ninformation could\
    \ be tailored to farmer information needs in farming systems. \nIn this section,\
    \ we discuss inferences from our research findings in relation to \nother scholarly\
    \ works on addressing weather and seasonal climate \ninformation needs in rice\
    \ farming systems in Northern Ghana.  \nFirstly, our findings reveal that communicating\
    \ forecast information with \ndifferent probabilities in Northern Ghana significantly\
    \ informs farmer \ndecision-making thereby addressing the research question 1.\
    \ We, however, \nreject the first hypothesis that claims that the higher the probability\
    \ associated \nwith a forecast, the more farmers are willing to act on their decision\
    \ at every \nstage of decision-making within the farming cycle. This hypothesis\
    \ was \nrejected because framers respond to different forecast probabilities is\
    \ \ndependent on the farming type. For instance, there is a positive correlation\
    \ \nbetween increasing forecast probability and farmers’ decision to act during\
    \ \npre-season and planting stages. Meanwhile, a negative correlation exists \n\
    between increasing forecast probability and the decision to act during Land \n\
    Preparation, weed control, fertilizer application and harvesting. Furthermore,\
    \ \nwe discover that farmers understood that 100% certainty in weather and \n\
    seasonal climate forecast information is non-achievable due to the erratic \n\
    nature of events and are thus adaptive in their response to forecast \nprobabilities.\
    \ Breuer et al. (2000) and O’Brien and Vogel (2003) concur that \nthe probabilistic\
    \ nature of weather and seasonal climate forecasts present \nparticular challenges.\
    \ Hence, for effective use of forecast information, \ndecision-making must take\
    \ into account the probability of forecast. Also, \nalthough all farmers expressed\
    \ the need to minimize uncertainty, farmer \nresponse varied and was dependent\
    \ on the farming system being practised and \nthe estimated risk that had to be\
    \ managed. For instance, due to water \navailability for supplementary irrigation\
    \ within the irrigation scheme, rice \nfarmers operating within the scheme face\
    \ lower risk levels and will act even \nwhen forecast probabilities are less than\
    \ 0.5. This was contrary in the case of \nChapter 6\n180\n \n \nrainfed farmers.\
    \ Thus, forecast probabilities must be clearly communicated to \nfarmers.  \n\
    In communicating forecast probabilities one needs to reflect on the ways in \n\
    which they are presented. From our experience, using simple graphics with \nappealing\
    \ colours to represent forecast probabilities is an effective way of \nmaking\
    \ farmers understand what is been communicated. For instance, each \nfarmer type\
    \ deals with forecast probability differently and so forecast \nprobability could\
    \ be communicated based on different types of farmers. Less \nsophisticated farmers\
    \ will prefer simpler information. Moreover, how one \ndescribes forecast probabilities\
    \ must fit into the domain of farmers’ local \nknowledge, therefore it is essential\
    \ to understand how farmers generate and \ndescribe probabilities. More so, ascertain\
    \ whether their personal feelings of \nrisk and vulnerability influence their\
    \ definition. It is important to also \ncommunicate change in probabilities in\
    \ simple terms and in languages that \nare best understood by farmers. Further\
    \ follow-ups on how a change in \nprobability impact farmer decision-making or\
    \ practices will enhance our \nunderstanding of the pros and cons of a failed\
    \ forecast on farmers’ livelihood. \nSecondly, the study outcome also confirms\
    \ a part of our first hypothesis given \nthe findings that given different lead\
    \ times of weather and seasonal climate \nforecast, farmers made different decisions.\
    \ However, not all lead times \ncontribute to a change in decision-making. For\
    \ example, seasonal forecast \ninformation provided 3 months ahead of time is\
    \ irrelevant in taking pre-\nseason decisions. What is strongly recommended is\
    \ seasonal forecast \ninformation at a lead time of 1 month. In our context, this\
    \ is the period within \nwhich most pre-season arrangements (farm machinery, labour,\
    \ seeds, etc.) \nand decisions happen. Crane et al. (2010) following their engagement\
    \ with 38 \nfarmers in Northern Georgia made similar conclusions that farmers\
    \ are less \nlikely to rely on seasonal forecast with longer lead time. They acknowledge\
    \ \nthat lead time must conform to users’ needs and priorities. Essentially, the\
    \ \nlead time for communicating seasonal forecast must be estimated through the\
    \ \nlens of farmers. Similarly, not all lead times for communicating weather \n\
    forecast information can contribute to informed farmer decision-making \n(Stone\
    \ et al., 2006; Mase & Prokopy, 2014) . As evident in our results, \nForecast\
    \ probability, lead time and farmer decision-making\nChapter 6\n181\n \n \nactivities\
    \ such as fertilizer application and planting are highly sensitive and \ndifficult\
    \ to undertake when forecast information is communicated with a 3 \nday or 1 day\
    \ lead time. Also, the period of fertilizer application is the most \nwater sensitive\
    \ stage of the farming season. Thus, a lead time of 1 week offers \nmore flexibility\
    \ for farmers to react to weather forecast information. This is \nhowever of least\
    \ significance in the context of decision-making on weed \ncontrol and harvesting.\
    \ \nThe use of Visually Facilitated Scenario Mapping Workshops also renders \n\
    the opportunity to explore how a future functioning hydroclimatic virtual \nobservatory\
    \ providing farmers with forecast information under different \nconditions could\
    \ inform their decision-making. The approach creates a \nhypothetical environment\
    \ for establishing farmer response to information \nfrom climate services or hydroclimatic\
    \ virtual observatory as proposed by \nNyadzi et al. (2018). Therefore, the results\
    \ from this exercise could slightly \ndiffer from real time events depending on\
    \ conditions where social and \nbiophysical conditions of farmers could vary.\
    \ Scenario workshop \nmethodologies originated in technological assessments and\
    \ were designed to \nfacilitate engagements between scientists and citizens in\
    \ the appraisal of new \ntechnologies ( Mayer, 1997; Andersen et al., 1999). We\
    \ give more of a visual \nspin to the methodology which can be applied in other\
    \ contexts in co-\nproduction and citizen science experiments on climate services.\
    \  \nOur methodology also had a number of limitations. First, maintaining other\
    \ \nexternal factors (finance and resource availability, etc.) constant could\
    \ not \ndepict a vivid environment for which farmers make decisions. Results could\
    \ \nbe different should we consider the interaction of these factors. Secondly,\
    \ , \nthe experiment focused on rainfall without consideration for other \natmospheric\
    \ variables (temperature, humidity, etc.) which also could have \ninfluence farmers’\
    \ decision outcomes. Hence, a similar study with a broader \nlook at other variables\
    \ could produce different results in different contexts. \nThirdly, our test of\
    \ focused on farmers decision making under normal \nconditions performing this\
    \ experiment under extreme situations could afford \nthe opportunity to analyse\
    \ comparatively what decisions farmers take under \ndifferent situations.  \n\
    Chapter 6\n182\n \n \nIn a nutshell, the results of this study have critical implications\
    \ for the design \nand operation of climate services particularly in Northern\
    \ Ghana and also \nanswers our third research question. First, the results confirm\
    \ that different \nfarm types (irrigated, rainfed and both) in the study area\
    \ requires forecast \ninformation at specific lead times and probabilities. Hence,\
    \ operators of \nweather and seasonal climate information services must understand\
    \ their \naudience. Also, for effective decision making, farmers have much preference\
    \ \nfor weather and seasonal climate information at 1 week and 1 month lead \n\
    times respectively. This means in the provision of information, emphasis must\
    \ \nbe placed on the quality of forecast information at these lead times in order\
    \ to \nmeet farmers’ needs. This nevertheless is valid in rice farming systems\
    \ and \nhence could though hardly vary in other systems. Thirdly, communicating\
    \ \nforecast probabilities to farmers is essential. Different types of farmers\
    \ relate \ndifferently to forecast uncertainty or probabilities. Farmers especially\
    \ those \ninto rainfed farming have little room for taking huge risk and will\
    \ only use \nforecast information with higher probabilities. Hence understanding\
    \ these \ndynamics can extensively improve acceptance and uptake of weather and\
    \ \nseasonal information making climate services more useful and impact \noriented.\
    \ \n \n6.6 Conclusion \nBased on the evidence provided in this study, we conclude\
    \ that \ncommunicating forecast information at the appropriate lead times and\
    \ \nprobabilities has the potential of making climate services more useful for\
    \ \nfarmers. More specifically, we discover that, first, an increase in forecast\
    \ \nprobability does not necessarily mean farmers will act. The decision to act\
    \ is \nalso dependent on which farming stage there is. Secondly, weather and \n\
    seasonal climate forecast information at 1 week and 1 month lead time \nrespectively\
    \ most conveniently informed farmer decision making. Secondly, \nfertilizer application\
    \ and planting decisions stages of rice farming are most \nsensitive to rainfall.\
    \ Thirdly, irrigated rice farmers have comparatively lower \nrisk level and will\

    \  \nThis dissertation sought to engage irrigated and rainfed rice farmers, water\
    \ \nmanagers, and other stakeholders in rice farming systems in communities \n\
    located in the vicinity of the Bontanga Irrigation Scheme in Kumbungu \nDistrict\
    \ (Ghana), over four years. The aim was to find out how existing \ninformation\
    \ systems contribute to actionable knowledge creation for \ndecision-making in\
    \ rice farming and to inform the design of a new generation \nof climate information\
    \ systems. In doing so, this dissertation has contributed \nto debates on information\
    \ systems, actionable knowledge, uncertainty, and \ndecision-making, as can be\
    \ seen in Chapters 2 to 6. \nChapter 2 presents a reflection on climate information\
    \ systems by engaging \nwith existing debates on responsible innovation and environmental\
    \ virtual \nobservatories (EVOs). The guiding question is: Which principles could\
    \ guide \nthe design and operationalisation of climate information systems in\
    \ rice \nfarming systems in Northern Ghana? (RQ 1). The study reflects on empirical\
    \ \nsocial and technological conditions identifiable in the study area and what\
    \ \nthese imply for the design and operationalisation of a new breed of climate\
    \ \ninformation systems. The chapter sets the tone for a deep dive into governance\
    \ \narrangements and decision-making contexts in the study area. It also provides\
    \ \nan entry point to the necessity of understanding information systems.  \n\
    In the studies in Chapters 3 and 4, emphasis is placed on understanding \ngovernance\
    \ arrangements, be they formal or informal, and decision-making \ncontexts by\
    \ addressing the key question: How do governance arrangements \ninfluence farmer\
    \ adaptive decision-making given uncertainty and information \nneeds? (RQ 2).\
    \ The chapters provide an empirical analysis of governance \narrangements and\
    \ adaptive decision-making (Chapter 3) and an empirical \nGeneral discussion and\
    \ conclusion\nChapter 7\n187\n \n \nanalysis of the role of different decision\
    \ logics and types of uncertainties in \nfarmer adaptive decision-making (Chapter\
    \ 4).  \nFrom a thorough understanding of the farmers’ decision-making context,\
    \ the \nstudies in Chapters 5 and 6 then interrogate information needs and knowledge\
    \ \ncreation processes in rice farming systems. The key question here is: How\
    \ do \nexisting information systems enable actionable knowledge creation and what\
    \ \ninformation could improve decision-making in rice farming systems? (RQ 3).\
    \ \nHere, I was able to establish what information systems exist, their \ncharacteristics,\
    \ and their role in actionable knowledge creation, borrowing \nstrongly from the\
    \ work of Cash et al. (2003). \nIn this final chapter, I seek to answer the research\
    \ questions by highlighting \nthe empirical outcomes and theoretical contributions\
    \ of the thesis, but also to \ncontribute to broader scientific debates on these\
    \ topics. Areas for further \nresearch are proposed, and the limitations of the\
    \ study and how these could \nhave directly or indirectly influenced the study\
    \ outcomes are outlined.  \n7.2 Towards a new generation of climate information\
    \ systems (RQ 1, \nChapter 2) \n7.2.1 Designing climate information systems in\
    \ Ghana \nFor information systems to contribute better to knowledge creation and\
    \ \ndecision-making, it is necessary to establish how their design can contribute\
    \ \nto this objective. Given the current emphasis on digitalisation of the \n\
    agricultural sector in Ghana, it is timely to address gaps in technical questions\
    \ \nregarding the architecture of climate information systems in order to improve\
    \ \nthe interaction and participation of farmers and other local actors. In Chapter\
    \ \n2, I indicate that, for climate information systems to better support decision-\n\
    making in farming systems, a new structure must be explored in which \ndifferent\
    \ types of data can be collated and actionable knowledge created. The \nproposed\
    \ architecture is discussed along three broad lines: data definition; \ninformation\
    \ provision and use; and feedback. \n \n \n \nChapter 7\n188\n \n \nData definition\
    \ \nThe diagnostics in Chapter 2 establish the relevance of both scientific and\
    \ \nindigenous forecasts in estimating seasonal and weather conditions. Farmers\
    \ \nin Bontanga and its environs rely not only on scientific forecasts received,\
    \ but \nalso on ecological knowledge using local indicators such as the movement\
    \ of \nbirds, direction of the wind, movement of ants, amongst others. However,\
    \ \nexisting information systems mostly do not include this local knowledge in\
    \ \ntheir forecast information. We see a weak collaboration between current \n\
    information service providers and farmers. Furthermore, the limited \nengagement\
    \ of farmers translates into difficulty in managing farmer \nexpectations in the\
    \ area, with farmers losing trust in information especially \nwhen inaccuracies\
    \ are observed. Also, some farmers perceive that non-\ntimeliness of information\
    \ and limited engagement of farmers also affect \ninformation relevance and uptake\
    \ for decision-making. Hence, in Chapter 2, \nI draw attention to the need for\
    \ a new generation of climate information \nsystems that improve forecast certainty\
    \ and relevance by combining both \nscientific and indigenous data in seasonal\
    \ and weather forecasts, as explored \nin other contexts (Kalanda-Joshua, Ngongondo,\
    \ Chipeta, & Mpembeka, \n2011; Mahoo et al., 2015; Masinde & Bagula, 2011).  \n\
    In a study by Kalanda-Joshua et al. (2011), respondent farmers in Malawi \nindicated\
    \ that current weather and climate forecasts were not useful because \nindigenous\
    \ knowledge is not incorporated into forecasts that are made \navailable. Grothmann\
    \ and Patt (2005) found that farmers’ acceptance of \nseasonal climate forecasts\
    \ increased when they were provided as part of local \nindigenous climate forecasts.\
    \ Hence, Chapter 2 of this dissertation proposes \nthat, in the definition of\
    \ data, farmers should be engaged in data collection \nusing indigenous forecast\
    \ indicators either independently or with the support \nof extension officers.\
    \ Because of farmers’ low literacy levels, the data \ncollection process should\
    \ be closely monitored to minimise errors. Here, \nmobile technologies could be\
    \ used to engage farmers in data collection using \nsimple interfaces of imagery\
    \ and a binary logic of a ‘yes’ or a ‘no’ response.  \nIn addition, the design\
    \ of climate information systems must not only account \nfor biophysical changes\
    \ but also recognise social and cultural transformations \nGeneral discussion\
    \ and conclusion\nChapter 7\n189\n \n \n(Agrawal & Perrin, 2009; Vaughan & Dessai,\
    \ 2014). Although social and \ncultural conditions might not be directly included\
    \ as datasets, interaction \nbetween scientists and farmers must involve further\
    \ probing how these factors \ncould be dependent variables and deterministic of\
    \ what data or information \ncould be of relevance and eventually used in decision-making.\
    \ \n \nInformation provision and use \nIn Chapter 2, the diagnostics show that\
    \ farmers in the Bontanga area have \ndifficulties interpreting information received\
    \ via information systems given \ntheir low literacy levels and challenges in\
    \ interacting with technology. \nMeteorological information provided is not always\
    \ in the local dialect and \nhence, for the non-literate farmer population in\
    \ the area, further consultation \nis needed to make sense of what is received.\
    \ Secondly, most farmers in the \nBontanga area use simple-feature phones or non-smart\
    \ phones, which are \nonly SMS and voice message compatible. It also emerged that\
    \ information \nsystems operate independent of each other. Nevertheless, the diagnostics\
    \ also \noutline some opportunities that could be leveraged to increase information\
    \ \naccess and use in the study area. For example, there currently exist agri-\n\
    focused radio stations such as Radio Tongu and Simli Radio, which provide \nagricultural\
    \ information to farmers in local languages. Furthermore, there is \na high rate\
    \ of radio listenership in communities within the study area and \nacross the\
    \ region. Such potential presents the opportunity to collaborate in the \nprovision\
    \ of meteorological information. The results in Chapter 2 refer to the \ncommunal\
    \ practice of informal social meetings amongst farmers that also \nserve as avenues\
    \ for information exchange and hence could be leveraged by \ncommunity radio services.\
    \  \nGiven this background, the chapter also discusses how a proposed climate\
    \ \ninformation system could be differently framed whilst capitalising on \nopportunities\
    \ and eliminating existing barriers. For this, it is recommended \nthat, when\
    \ information is being packaged, the architecture must explore the \nuse of more\
    \ graphics and less text and also seek to adopt local symbols and \nimages that\
    \ are relatable to farmers. Here, digital technology that can help \nbridge physical\
    \ barriers to information sharing and communication must be \nChapter 7\n190\n\
    \ \n \nsimple regarding representation and interface to ensure compatibility with\
    \ \nmost phones owned by farmers. Thus, farmers’ ability to decode information\
    \ \nfrom the system and the extent to which feedback from farmers to the system\
    \ \ncan be decoded are critical in the architecture. \nMisaki et al. (2018) concur\
    \ that a language barrier makes it difficult for \nfarmers to interpret information\
    \ provided to them through mobile technology. \nAlso, the synergy between both\
    \ loops is highly dependent not only on the \nmode or technology used but also\
    \ on the extent to which co-design is pursued. \nThus, co-production must begin\
    \ with co-design in setting the tone towards \nenhancing the use of climate information\
    \ (Bremer et al., 2019; Christel et al., \n2018; Tall et al., 2014). Vaughan et\
    \ al. (2016, p. 2) reiterate the need for an \niterative process of co-discovery,\
    \ co-development, and co-evaluation of \nclimate information systems.  \nIn Chapter\
    \ 2, I outline possible communication tools and their limitations, \ngiven current\
    \ applications in other information systems. The climate \ninformation system\
    \ architecture must include guidance on how mobile \ntechnology, the web, radio,\
    \ and other non-ICT models can be embedded in \nthe system design (Houghton, 2010;\
    \ Mittal, 2016). The design process must \ntake cognisance of how these tools\
    \ can support the content, packaging, and \npresentation of information and enhance\
    \ the process of transforming \ninformation into relevant knowledge for application.\
    \  \n \nFeedback mechanisms \nChapter 2 also proposes a two-way communication\
    \ framework, where the \narchitecture of climate information systems allows for\
    \ feedback from farmers \nfollowing the receipt and use of information, expressed\
    \ through decisions \nabout dealing with uncertainties in seasonal and weather\
    \ conditions. A \nsupporting finding in a study by Archer (2003) in South Africa\
    \ confirmed that \nfarmers, especially women, were quick to indicate their preference\
    \ for a two-\nway information system that allowed them to ask questions rather\
    \ than the \none-way system used by most information service providers in \ncommunicating\
    \ meteorological information. Hence, I indicate in Chapter 2 \nthat climate information\
    \ systems should be designed to support interaction in \nGeneral discussion and\
    \ conclusion\nChapter 7\n191\n \n \nlocal languages in a continuous interactive\
    \ feedback process. As much as \npossible, the iterative process should make room\
    \ for unlimited engagement to \nensure timely responses and reformulation and\
    \ interpretation of information \nto make it more applicable in a given context.\
    \  \n \nInsight: For climate information systems to have impact, they should \n\
    be user-centred in design, anchored on the principle of interactivity, \nand fitted\
    \ into the local context.  \n \n7.2.2 Reflections on the conceptualisation of\
    \ climate information systems \nClimate information systems are extensively discussed\
    \ in the current \nliterature, using multiple approaches underpinned by theories\
    \ of decision-\nmaking, environmental and business management, technology, and\
    \ \ninnovation (Feldman & Ingram, 2009; Fraisse et al., 2006). The Global \nFramework\
    \ on Climate Services set out by the World Meteorological Agency \npresents Climate\
    \ Service Information Systems (CSIS) as the operational core \nof the framework.\
    \ The framework highlights the objective of CSIS as the \nprocessing and generation\
    \ of relevant data and knowledge. It also prioritises \nthe timely dissemination\
    \ of information at all scales (WMO, 2014). The \nunderlying pillars of the framework\
    \ indicate direct delivery of CSIS product \nfor uptake or through interfaces\
    \ that seek to integrate the information into \nend-user decision-making.  \n\
    The discussion on user-centred design emphasises contextualisation and what \n\
    that means for the potential of climate information systems (Jancloes et al.,\
    \ \n2014; Pulwarty & Sivakumar, 2014; Singh et al., 2018). Vaughan and Dessai\
    \ \n(2014) highlight contextualisation and institutionalisation as key for impact.\
    \ \nDutton (2002) contends that weather and climate services are becoming \nvaried\
    \ thanks to advances in information technology and broader demand. In \nthe agriculture\
    \ sector, the relevance of forecast information at seasonal and \nsub-seasonal\
    \ scales for improving adaptive decision-making – especially at \nlocal level\
    \ – makes it essential to align the constructs in the climate \ninformation systems\
    \ framework in terms of how they respond to the timely \nprocessing of data and\
    \ dissemination of information and knowledge through \ncollaboration or co-production.\
    \ \nChapter 7\n192\n \n \nIn Chapter 2, I discuss the climate information systems\
    \ framework through \nthe lens of second generation EVOs, which allows for further\
    \ framing of the \nconcept kick-started by Karpouzoglou et al. (2016a). For this,\
    \ participation, \nas a pillar of the climate services framework, is promoted\
    \ to maximise efforts \nat knowledge co-creation. Drawing on informational governance,\
    \ adaptive \ngovernance, and actionable knowledge reiterates the significance\
    \ of aligning \nthe architecture of climate information systems in agriculture\
    \ with \ngovernance as a practice. Hence, expanding the scope of climate information\
    \ \nsystems to account for not only environmental information, but also social\
    \ \nchange through governance, enhances their transformative capabilities. \n\
    Informational governance encompasses not only technologies, but also an \nappreciation\
    \ of informational processes, institutions, and resources linked to \ninformation.\
    \ In the framing of their architecture, second generation climate \ninformation\
    \ systems should reflect a scenario where climate information \ncommunicated ‘becomes\
    \ a crucial resource with transformative powers for a \nvariety of actors and\
    \ networks’ (Mol, 2006, p. 5).  \nThis dissertation underwrites the conceptualisation\
    \ of second generation \nclimate information systems with reference to Karpouzoglou\
    \ et al.’s (2016) \nargument by adding that information and knowledge processes\
    \ must be \nstandardised as part of the architecture of climate information systems\
    \ rather \nthan being perceived as mere inputs or by-products of the process.\
    \ Such a \npremise proposes that information with reference to data must be recognised\
    \ \nas ‘soft’ architecture without which climate information systems could \n\
    contribute less to knowledge creation. I indicate the need for information to\
    \ \nconstitute not only scientific but also indigenous knowledge to ensure \n\
    consideration of end-user practices.  \nI also contend that, in addition to the\
    \ element of interactivity as postulated by \nKarpouzoglou et al. (2016a), it\
    \ is essential to embrace the elements of \nreflexivity and anticipation (Stilgoe\
    \ et al., 2013) in unpacking the pillars of \nadaptive governance. Reflexivity\
    \ is understood in the sense that developers \nof climate information systems\
    \ acknowledge the limits of their knowledge \nand are mindful that their framing\
    \ of the problem may not be universally held; \nhence, what could be treated as\
    \ data must go through a reflexive process to \nGeneral discussion and conclusion\n\
    Chapter 7\n193\n \n \nembrace other perspectives. It also means that forecast\
    \ information from the \nsystem is driven not only by projected change (anticipation),\
    \ but also by the \nmonitoring of current social-ecological change and how farmers\
    \ respond \n(responsiveness). \nDesigning a second generation information system\
    \ also necessitates \nembracing the concept of actionable knowledge and the mindful\
    \ pursuit of it \n(Karpouzoglou et al., 2016). Here, there is much reference to\
    \ participatory \nmethodologies and a bottom-up approach to integrating multiple\
    \ user needs \nand local experiences. The framework must interpret actionable\
    \ knowledge \nfrom multiple perspectives, thereby also enhancing the probability\
    \ of \nensuring that reflexivity is built into the knowledge co-creation process.\
    \ As \nhighlighted in Chapter 2, the architecture of a second generation climate\
    \ \ninformation system must seek also to establish how stakeholder reflexive \n\
    processes contribute to knowledge formulation (Adams et al., 2015; Brandsen \n\
    & Honingh, 2016; Meadow et al., 2015; Tall et al., 2014). I make reference \n\
    to the concept of citizen science as an approach to engage farmers and other \n\
    actors in climate data collation in second generation climate information \nsystems.\
    \ Citizen science should be a conceptual overlay in the co-design \nprocess or\
    \ any form of collaborative arrangements in positioning climate \ninformation\
    \ systems in rice farming systems. \nIn Chapter 2, the dissertation also brings\
    \ to bear the element of feedback, with \nthe argument that the uptake of information\
    \ for decision-making creates new \nknowledge from practice; this is relevant\
    \ for further understanding change in \nfood systems at farm level. Hence, a feedback\
    \ loop allows for outcomes of \npractice to be channelled back into the system\
    \ as new data. This informs the \nsystemic thinking in defining the architecture\
    \ of climate information systems \n(Hewitt et al., 2012; Lourenco et al., 2016;\
    \ Weaver et al., 2013; Yousefpour \net al., 2017). \n \nInsight: The architecture\
    \ of second generation EVOs has the potential \nto result in more productive climate\
    \ information systems. \n \n \nChapter 7\n194\n \n \n7.3 Uncertainty and adaptive\
    \ decision-making in rice farming systems \n(RQ 2, Chapters 3 and 4) \n7.3.1 Adapting\
    \ to seasonal and weather variability \nInformation systems can contribute to\
    \ adaptive decision-making by providing \na measurable indicator of how such systems\
    \ can improve adaptive governance \nin farming systems (Gadgil, Rao, & Rao, 2002;\
    \ Ali & Kumar, 2011). \nAdaptive decision-making within rice farming systems remains\
    \ a challenge \nbecause of changes in social and bio-physical conditions, and\
    \ uncertainty \nabout the near future. Chapter 3 of the dissertation shows that\
    \ irrigated and \nrainfed rice farmers are amongst the most vulnerable in Kumbungu\
    \ District \nbecause of the changes in water levels in the Bontanga dam and rainfall\
    \ \npatterns. It emerged that farmers make decisions about what to cultivate,\
    \ how \nto prepare the land, how and what to plant, how to control weeds, how\
    \ to \nfertilise crops, and how to harvest. The findings in Chapter 3 show that\
    \ farmer \ndecisions are most sensitive to water availability conditions during\
    \ planting \nand fertiliser application. Farmers adapt during planting by choosing\
    \ decision \noptions such as varying planting dates or planting only when soil\
    \ moisture is \nhigh (see also Abid et al., 2016). Farmers also operate within\
    \ a context guided \nby formal and informal rules that have an impact on their\
    \ practices and \ndecisions. Effectively, adaptive decision-making in dealing\
    \ with uncertainties \nencompasses not only uncertainties about biophysical conditions,\
    \ but also \nrules defining interactions and resource use in the Bontanga area.\
    \ \nHence in Chapter 4, by focusing on two logics of decision-making: the logic\
    \ \nof appropriateness and the logic of consequentiality and how these are \n\
    reflected in farmer adaptive decision-making, the dissertation establishes how\
    \ \nuncertainties are accounted for. In Chapter 4, we see farmers taking adaptive\
    \ \ndecisions by considering substantive uncertainty associated with forecasts\
    \ \nreceived and the consequences of choices. For example, during the pre-season\
    \ \nperiod, farmers have to decide on what crop to cultivate. With reference to\
    \ \nthe seasonal forecast received, farmers choose between multi-cropping or \n\
    growing only rice or other vegetables. We observe that the adaptive choice is\
    \ \nto multi-crop as a hedge against rainfall onset and distribution varying from\
    \ \nthe expected. Non-adaptive choices, however, include cultivating rice only\
    \ or \nGeneral discussion and conclusion\nChapter 7\n195\n \n \nother crops only.\
    \ Farmer behaviour is a function of attitudes, norms, habits, \nand expectation\
    \ (Willock et al., 1999). Chapters 3 and 4 show that \ninstitutional uncertainty\
    \ occurs as a result of lateral leaders not conforming to \nrules on water discharge\
    \ as scheduled within the Bontanga scheme. Farmers \nadapt by undertaking farming\
    \ activities when water is discharged onto their \nfarmlands. Hence, as supported\
    \ by Kristensen and Jakobsen (2011), the \n‘irrational’ farmer could be guided\
    \ by rules and how they transform rather \nthan by the consequence of alternative\
    \ decision-making choices. In Chapter \n4, we see that flexible rules on land\
    \ rental and tenure within the Bontanga \nscheme present difficulties for non-indigenous\
    \ rice farmers in their bid to \nsecure land for farming. The informal approach\
    \ to land rental arrangements \npresents uncertainty about negotiation outcomes.\
    \ Thus, although the presence \nof an irrigation facility in the district could\
    \ be described as a robust \nintervention by government, the variability in rules\
    \ and uncertainty in \noutcomes of these rules exacerbate farmer woes, to which\
    \ they have to adapt \nthrough decision-making.  \nChapter 4 shows that determining\
    \ farmer information needs could begin with \nunderstanding what uncertainties\
    \ exist, the logics of decision-making, and \nhow these play a role in adaptive\
    \ decision-making. Arguably, drawing on \nadaptive decision-making by ascertaining\
    \ uncertainties and logics of \ndecision-making is a better way of interpreting\
    \ information needs. However, \nmost information service providers pay little\
    \ attention to understanding \ndecision-making contexts in farming systems that\
    \ they serve. When they aim \nto deduce information needs, the new generation\
    \ of climate information \nsystems must be sensitive to substantive and institutional\
    \ uncertainty evident \nin farming systems and probe adaptive decisions taken\
    \ by farmers.  \n \nInsight: Farmers’ adaptive decision-making is as much about\
    \ dealing \nwith uncertainty about rules as it as about dealing with uncertainty\
    \ \nabout environmental conditions in rice farming systems. \n \n \n \nChapter\
    \ 7\n196\n \n \n7.4 Reflections on the conceptualisation of adaptive decision-making\
    \ \nFrom adaptive management to adaptive decision-making, it is evident that,\
    \ \neven in an abundance of knowledge, uncertainty about future conditions \n\
    remains a gap that must be filled in relation to natural resource (Lal et al.,\
    \ \n2002). Increasingly, the aforementioned analogy has resulted in renderings\
    \ \non the concept of adaptive decision-making in scholarly works on bounded \n\
    rationality and a discounting of classical rationalist thinking (Payne, Bettman,\
    \ \n& Johnson, 1997). Rational decision theory, borrowing from Neumann and \n\
    Morgenstern’s (1947) expected utility theory, assumes that decision makers \n\
    attempt to maximise their expected utility and hence make choices that offer \n\
    the highest utility weighted by the probability of acquiring that option. That\
    \ \nhuman behaviour is predictable has been (re)-framed as biased by context,\
    \ \nexperience, and the variation in options available for decision-making \n\
    (Camerer, Loewenstein, & Rabin, 2004; Kacelnik, 2006), hence the argument \nthat\
    \ rationality is bounded and imperfect given incomplete information about \nalternatives,\
    \ uncertainty, rules, and codes of conduct, limiting the ability of \ndecision-makers\
    \ to estimate the best course of action (March, 1978; Nilsson \n& Dalkmann, 2001;\
    \ Simon, 1972). \nThe neo-institutionalist approach conceived by James G. March\
    \ and Johan P. \nOlsen, where two logics (the logic of appropriateness and the\
    \ logic of \nconsequentiality) are contrasted, brought a new perspective and contribution\
    \ \nto behavioural decision-making (Goldmann, 2005). They present a logic of \n\
    action by which human behaviour can be interpreted. An action is said to \nfollow\
    \ the logic of consequentiality when ‘it is driven by subjective \nassessment\
    \ of outcomes of alternative courses of action’, and the logic of \nappropriateness\
    \ ‘when it is shaped by rules relevant to the current situation’ \n(Schulz, 2014).\
    \ Both logics characterise the difference between deliberate and \nhabitual action\
    \ and have also been interpreted in the theories of bounded \nrationality (Schulz,\
    \ 2014). However, the theories of bounded rationality in \nclassical rational\
    \ thinking assume the logic of consequences. A number of \ncriticisms have been\
    \ raised against what March and Olsen attempt to portray, \nincluding what Schulz\
    \ (2014) points to as the persistence and shifts in logics: \nthe reality that\
    \ an action sometimes shifts between both logics along the path.  \nGeneral discussion\
    \ and conclusion\nChapter 7\n197\n \n \nThe studies in Chapters 3 and 4 contribute\
    \ to the adaptive decision-making \nliterature by discussing the transformational\
    \ power of information in rice \nfarming systems, with much reference to the neo-institutionalist\
    \ logics of \nconsequentiality and appropriateness. Scholarly research on adaptive\
    \ \ndecision-making in food systems has gained traction with significant \nempirical\
    \ references (Beckford, 2002; Fosu-Mensah et al., 2012; Gbetibouo, \n2009) but\
    \ few attempts at conceptualisation. In Chapters 3 and 4, the \ndissertation makes\
    \ a significant contribution to the conceptualisation of \nadaptive decision-making,\
    \ given an observable intersect between the two \nlogics of decision-making (March,\
    \ 2011; March & Olsen, 2004) and the \nobjects of uncertainty (Dewulf & Biesbroek,\
    \ 2018; Koppenjan & Klijn, 2004) \nfaced by rice farmers in Kumbungu District.\
    \ This provides a deepened \nunderstanding of how information systems might not\
    \ be impactful in \ninstances where information communicated is devoid of a recognition\
    \ of the \nobjects of uncertainty with which farmers are faced. Thus, the relationship\
    \ \nbetween uncertainties and logics of decision-making helps in interpreting\
    \ \nadaptive decisions. In Chapter 4, I (re)-conceptualise adaptive decision-\n\
    making by defining the concept as a process of choosing non-standard \ndecision\
    \ options underpinned by the logic of consequentiality taking into \naccount substantive\
    \ uncertainty when assessing consequences, or, in line with \nthe logic of appropriateness,\
    \ taking into account institutional uncertainty \nwhen assessing appropriateness.\
    \ Willock et al. (1999) and Ohlmer et al. \n(1998) whilst discussing farmer decision-making\
    \ paid little attention to socio-\neconomic and psychological variables; this\
    \ reinforces the need for re-framing \nto encompass psychological factors and\
    \ to interpret farmer decision-making \nas a process rather than an event.  \n\
    Consequently, adaptive decision-making is empirically contextual in food \nsystems\
    \ but can be universally conceptualised. However, I do agree that, \ngiven the\
    \ interaction between rice farmers and other actors at \nfarm/community level\
    \ and how strategic choices occur, an expansion of the \nconceptualisation of\
    \ adaptive decision-making to include strategic \nuncertainty (uncertainty about\
    \ the actions of other actors) (Dewulf & \nBiesbroek, 2018) could provide more\
    \ insight into adaptive decision-making. \nFor example, within irrigation farming\
    \ systems, strategic decisions at \nChapter 7\n198\n \n \nmanagement level consequent\
    \ to change in government policy and \nprogrammes could present farmers with the\
    \ challenge of having to deal with \nthe uncertainty associated with such choices.\
    \  \n \nInsight: Institutional uncertainty and the logic of appropriateness are\
    \ \napparent in adaptive decision-making just as substantive uncertainty \nand\
    \ the logic of consequentiality also are.  \n \n7.5 Climate information systems,\
    \ information needs and actionable \nknowledge creation (RQ 3, Chapters 5 and\
    \ 6) \n7.5.1 Creating actionable knowledge through information systems \nA key\
    \ element of second generation information systems is the emphasis on \nactionable\
    \ knowledge creation in social and ecological systems (Lourenco et \nal., 2016;\
    \ Reinecke, 2015; C. Vaughan & Dessai, 2014). In food systems, \ndealing with\
    \ uncertainties and water availability challenges through climate \nforecast information\
    \ provision requires climate information systems to pursue \nan agenda of making\
    \ information applicable in a given context. This involves \nensuring that information\
    \ provided meets the needs of end-users, with the \npotential of translating it\
    \ into actionable knowledge for use in decision-\nmaking. In Chapter 5 of this\
    \ dissertation, I explored how existing information \nsystems enable actionable\
    \ knowledge creation in rice farming systems in \nKumbungu District. It emerged\
    \ that information systems, be they digital or \nnon-digital, support actionable\
    \ knowledge creation in rice farming systems \n(Jayaraman et al.,  2015; Ospina\
    \ & Heeks, 2012). However, applying Cash et \nal.'s (2003) factors of salience,\
    \ credibility, and legitimacy shows differences \nin how these information systems\
    \ support actionable knowledge creation. \nFurthermore, Furman et al. (2011) reiterate\
    \ that salience, credibility, and \nlegitimacy are socially constructed, shaped\
    \ by users’ identity and beliefs and \nthe value that users associate with a given\
    \ piece of information. As shown in \nthe chapter, to address the question of\
    \ actionability in climate information \nsystems, insight is required into the\
    \ specific seasonal and weather information \nthat is relevant for farmers and\
    \ into how uncertainty and timing influence \nuptake for decision-making. Hence,\
    \ in the study in Chapter 6, visually \nGeneral discussion and conclusion\nChapter\
    \ 7\n199\n \n \nfacilitated scenario workshops were used to explore how uncertainty\
    \ and \nseasonal and weather lead times inform farmer decision-making.  \nThe\
    \ analysis in Chapter 5 revealed that farmer-to-farmer systems most enable \n\
    the creation of actionable knowledge. As discovered by Feder et al. (2004) \n\
    for pest management training in Indonesia, farmer-to-farmer systems diffuse \n\
    information extensively. Such systems most enable the creation of salient \nknowledge\
    \ thanks to their focus on local contexts in aligning information and \nmaking\
    \ it usable. In this dissertation, the focus on the application of \ninformation\
    \ at farm level enabled the raising of relevant questions such as: \nHow is this\
    \ information relevant to us as rice farmers in the area? What are \nthe implications\
    \ of the information received about farm activities given the \ntime factor? Equally,\
    \ in the effort to produce credible knowledge, farmer-to-\nfarmer systems induced\
    \ the legitimising of knowledge through open \nparticipation and sharing. Hence,\
    \ every rice farmer could participate in \ninformal meetings held in open spaces\
    \ where farmer concerns were discussed. \nAlso, farmer-to-farmer systems advanced\
    \ the credibility of outcomes of \ndeliberations by drawing on both indigenous\
    \ and scientific information (see \nalso Kniveton et al., 2015; Victoria, 2008).\
    \ \nIn Chapter 5, it is shown that community radio systems (Jost et al., 2016;\
    \ Tall, \n2010) strongly support cross-fertilisation of knowledge by engaging\
    \ \nexperienced farmers in knowledge brokerage where both scientific and \nindigenous\
    \ knowledge are considered during studio discussions. Simli Radio \nuses local\
    \ languages in discussions and has periodic phone-in sessions, and \nthese promote\
    \ local listenership, participation, and the creation of salient \nknowledge.\
    \  \nMobile-based-only platforms have also gained traction in enabling actionable\
    \ \nknowledge creation in food systems (Evans et al., 2017; Asenso-Okyere & \n\
    Mekonnen, 2012). The analysis in Chapter 5 reveals that a major shortcoming \n\
    of existing mobile-based platforms is that the limited attention to, and \nrecognition\
    \ of, indigenous knowledge has a significant impact on the \ncredibility of knowledge\
    \ produced. Despite the success in breaking physical \nbarriers to communication\
    \ by using mobile technology, the focus on national \nand regional levels and\
    \ only scientific forecasts limits the salience of \nChapter 7\n200\n \n \nemerging\
    \ knowledge. Here, we see an emphasis on credibility rather than \nlegitimacy\
    \ and salience.  \nChapter 5 points to questions on how the independent operation\
    \ of each of \nthese systems puts the farmer in a quandary in making sense out\
    \ of what is \ncommunicated as information and largely what emerges as actionable\
    \ \nknowledge. Although propositions are not offered on how a systems \nintegration\
    \ could be pursued in the form of joint architecture, opportunities \nfor synergy\
    \ and collaborative delivery of information aided by all systems are \ndiscussed.\
    \  \nChapter 6 highlights the components of meteorological information that are\
    \ \nrelevant for farmer decision-making, with substantial insight into what \n\
    climate information systems could do differently to enhance uptake under \n‘normal’\
    \ conditions. The chapter contributes significantly to elucidating the \nrisks\
    \ that farmers are willing to take based on the information they receive. \nRegarding\
    \ probabilities, the study shows that forecasts indicating a higher \nprobability\
    \ of rainfall occurring are not always favourable for farmers, with \nthe possibility\
    \ of farmers changing dates for carrying out intended activities \nsuch as land\
    \ preparation, weed control, and fertiliser application because of \ntheir sensitivity\
    \ to water conditions. Thus, climate information systems \navailable in Kumbungu\
    \ District must integrate these dynamics to better \ninterpret what information\
    \ eventually becomes actionable. In further \nestablishing what lead times are\
    \ best for communicating seasonal forecasts, \nit is evident in Chapter 6 that\
    \ a 1-month lead time informs farmer decision-\nmaking better relative to a 2-\
    \ or 3-month lead time. Thus, irrespective of \nfarming type practiced, farmers\
    \ are emphatic that a 3-month lead time is of \nno significance. Regarding weather\
    \ forecasts, it emerged that a 1-week lead \ntime is preferred over a 3-day or\
    \ a 1-day lead time for in-season decision-\nmaking. However, providing forecasts\
    \ within these lead times is technically \nchallenging.  \nThus, in Chapters 5\
    \ and 6, the dissertation provides critical input on farmers’ \ninformation needs\
    \ and their implications for actionable knowledge creation. \nFor example, information\
    \ provided can be scientifically valid or credible but \nnot used if provided\
    \ at an unfavourable lead time. Also, higher probability \nGeneral discussion\
    \ and conclusion\nChapter 7\n201\n \n \ndoes not necessarily translate into action\
    \ at farm level when farmers are \nconvinced that undertaking a particular activity\
    \ could be counterproductive \nin their particular circumstances.  \n \nInsight:\
    \ Knowledge is most actionable when its credibility is based \non scientific and\
    \ indigenous knowledge through a participatory \nprocess of legitimisation that\
    \ results in knowledge that is locally \nsalient. \n \n7.5.2 Reflections on conceptualisation\
    \ of actionable knowledge  \nActionable knowledge is broadly represented in scholarship\
    \ in management \nand organisation studies on how to bridge the gap between theory\
    \ and practice \n(Antonacopoulou, 2007; Cassell, Denyer, & Tranfield, 2006; David\
    \ & \nHatchuel, 2007; Hatchuel, 2005). However, recent studies on how science\
    \ \nand technology can improve the attainment of sustainability indices have \n\
    drawn on the concept in connecting knowledge to action, with a predominant \n\
    contribution by Cash et al. (2003) in science and policy studies, and other \n\
    scholarship purporting to understand the transformational power of \ninformation\
    \ in environmental management (Cross & Sproull, 2004; Evans et \nal., 2017; Ginige,\
    \ 2016; Horan & Wells, 2005; McCampbell et al., 2018). The \nterm, actionable\
    \ knowledge, comprises two key words – knowledge and \naction – and has been defined\
    \ differently in science and technology studies in \nan attempt to elucidate what\
    \ information systems or knowledge systems have \nbeen and could be (Córdoba‐Pachón\
    \ & Paucar‐Caceres, 2019; Evans et al., \n2017).  \nEvans et al. (2017, p. 72)\
    \ define actionable knowledge as ‘knowledge that can \nbe acted upon and applied\
    \ to solve a real-world problem’. Geertsema et al. \n(2016) define actionable\
    \ knowledge as knowledge that supports stakeholder \ndecision-making and consequent\
    \ actions. Carlile (2002) contends that \nactionable knowledge is produced with\
    \ an underlying layer of expectation to \ntransform conditions towards an expected\
    \ end. Thus, the aforementioned \nauthors relate actionable knowledge to that\
    \ which commands uptake and is \njustified to the degree to which it informs decision-making.\
    \ However, \nChapter 7\n202\n \n \nHassard and Kelemen (2002, p. 333) remind us\
    \ that the study of the \nproduction of knowledge should also consider the consumption\
    \ of knowledge \nas this ‘fuels the creation of new knowledge while new knowledge\
    \ acquires \nits status as “knowledge” only when selected for consumption by important\
    \ \nplayers’. Thus, they argue that the study of knowledge (and what could thus\
    \ \nbe actionable) should address questions not only on its production but also\
    \ on \nits consumption, indirectly affirming the need to define the bridge between\
    \ \nproduction and consumption in the form of actionable knowledge.  \nBringing\
    \ this into the discussion on climate change and agriculture, some \nscholarly\
    \ works discuss actionable knowledge with an emphasis on scientific \nknowledge\
    \ but not on indigenous knowledge systems (Kirchhoff et al., 2013), \nwhich equally\
    \ influence the degree to which climate information is \ntransformed into actionable\
    \ knowledge. Hence, a re-conceptualisation of \nactionable knowledge in light\
    \ of emerging concerns on climate change and \nthe use of climate information\
    \ towards creating relevant knowledge makes \nthe inclusion of indigenous knowledge\
    \ systems essential. In Chapter 3, I \ndefine actionable knowledge as indigenous\
    \ and scientific knowledge that is \nlocally relevant, trustworthy, and produced\
    \ in a fair, transparent way. To this \neffect, knowledge production results from\
    \ a fusion of both knowledge types, \nwith reference to scientific and indigenous\
    \ information. I point to the need \nnot to limit the definition of actionable\
    \ knowledge to scientists but also to \ninclude users of information systems,\
    \ with an emphasis on co-creation \nthrough a process of continuous interaction\
    \ and re-definition enabled by \ninformation systems (Bentley, Van Mele, & Acheampong,\
    \ 2010; Nyantakyi-\nFrimpong, 2013). Actionable knowledge must encompass integrated\
    \ \nscientific and indigenous salient and credible knowledge, produced through\
    \ a \nlegitimised process of fairness and inclusiveness. Essentially, not detaching\
    \ \nknowledge production from consumption acknowledges the importance of \ncollaborative\
    \ framing of information needs, data requirements, and \ninformation towards creating\
    \ actionable knowledge. Actionable knowledge, \nwhen implemented, has the tendency\
    \ to generate new information, which \nfeeds back into information systems and\
    \ better validates new data with \nempirical evidence. As evident in Chapter 3,\
    \ farmer-to-farmer systems most \nenabled the creation of actionable knowledge\
    \ compared to community radio, \nGeneral discussion and conclusion\nChapter 7\n\
    203\n \n \nmobile-based-only platforms, or commercial radio as a result of openness\
    \ in \nengagement, empirical references, and justifications for new knowledge,\
    \ \ngiven implementation in decision-making at farm level and the cycle of \n\
    reflecting on the validity and salience of both scientific and indigenous \nknowledge.\
    \ Hence, information systems, be they technologically driven or \notherwise, must\
    \ aim not only to bridge geographical and communication \nbarriers, but also to\
    \ improve actionable knowledge creation.  \n \nInsight: Actionable knowledge is\
    \ an indicator of the potential of \ninformation to influence decision-making\
    \ in food systems.  \n \n7.6 Limitations  \n7.6.1 Methodology \nThe study contributes\
    \ to scholarly research on how information systems could \ntransform productivity\
    \ in rice farming systems. However, a number of \nlimitations can be highlighted.\
    \ \nFirstly, using an interdisciplinary approach necessitated the alignment of\
    \ the \nwork of PhD candidates addressing either the technical or the social aspects\
    \ \nof the case study. This called for continuous brainstorming and engagement\
    \ \noutside the immediate research questions throughout the period of the study.\
    \ \nPhD candidates are expected to also collaborate in addressing research \n\
    questions. For example, addressing RQs 1 and 3 involved periodic \nconsultations\
    \ between the two PhD candidates on this case and supervision \nteams. Although\
    \ the approach provided multiple perspectives to answer \nresearch questions,\
    \ the process was time consuming in juggling between \ntechnical and social lenses.\
    \ \nSecondly, the fact that this research was part of the bigger EVOCA \nprogramme\
    \ placed it in a frame of multiple concepts, and hence the PhD \ncandidates had\
    \ to reflect on other concepts not directly related to their \nresearch questions.\
    \ For most of these concepts, they stayed on the fringes, \nwithout rendering\
    \ an in-depth scientific inquiry into them. For example, the \nEVOCA programme\
    \ revolved around the concepts of citizen science, \nresponsible innovation, connective/collective\
    \ action, EVOs, and decision-\nChapter 7\n204\n \n \nmaking. However, this dissertation\
    \ did not encompass an in-depth inquiry \ninto the subjects of citizen science\
    \ and connective/collective action. Thus, \nalthough the programme allowed for\
    \ studies into other concepts (citizen \nscience, social learning, collective\
    \ action, connective action), the approach is \na long iterative learning process\
    \ transcending the duration of the PhD study.  \nThirdly, the EVOCA programme\
    \ sought an action research design to address \nthe research questions. It is,\
    \ however, worth noting that moving between the \nNetherlands and Ghana, given\
    \ the sandwich arrangement of PhD \nprogrammes, limited the chances of addressing\
    \ research questions through \naction research related to seasonality.  \n \n\
    7.6.2 Testing a functional EVO \nThe study, whilst adding to how existing information\
    \ systems contribute to \nknowledge creation and decision-making, points to a\
    \ new course of action in \nrelation to the design and framework of climate information\
    \ systems. \nHowever, testing a new second generation climate information system\
    \ would \nhave provided justification, insights, and learning relevant for literature\
    \ on \nclimate information systems. Although this was not attainable over the\
    \ four-\nyear period of the PhD study, an experiment in the study context or another\
    \ \ncontext must be pursued. With an emphasis on user-centred designs in the \n\
    current discourse on climate information systems, studies such as this must \n\
    aim to leverage outcomes not only for scientific purposes, but also for societal\
    \ \nchange in local contexts.  \n \n7.6.3 Generalisation of study outcomes \n\
    This study, using an exploratory approach, offers case-specific insights into\
    \ \ninformation systems and the transformation of food systems through \nknowledge\
    \ creation to support decision-making. The framing of actionable \nknowledge,\
    \ for example, is dependent on indigenous, context-sensitive \nknowledge and its\
    \ application. Furthermore, the existence of institutional \nuncertainty and substantive\
    \ change means that the outcomes of this study \nmight not hold scientifically\
    \ true in other contexts with different \nenvironmental and institutional conditions.\
    \ Nevertheless, the study’s findings \nhold true and are applicable in the Ghanaian\
    \ context and provide pointers for \nGeneral discussion and conclusion\nChapter\
    \ 7\n205\n \n \nSahelian regions where farmers are faced with water scarcity conditions\
    \ \nimpacting their productivity at farm level.  \n \n7.7 Future research outlook\
    \ \nAdapting to climate variability and change in food systems is a complex \n\
    subject with numerous unanswered questions. Although this dissertation \naddressed\
    \ a number of these and the theoretical and empirical expositions \nhave provided\
    \ insights, it also raises further questions that must be \ninvestigated to improve\
    \ the impact of information systems.  \nIn Chapter 2, the study launches into\
    \ design thinking on second generation \nclimate information systems. Although\
    \ the ex-ante approach used here points \nto a possible framework that could enable\
    \ the integration of indigenous \nknowledge and scientific information, improved\
    \ participation, and usability \nof information, further studies are needed to\
    \ take the debate further. \nSpecifically, the relationship between concepts such\
    \ as responsible \ninnovation, citizen science, and virtual observatories for\
    \ environmental \nmonitoring in food systems must be investigated and not limited\
    \ to climate \ninformation provision and use.   \nIn Chapters 3 and 4, I present\
    \ findings related to framing adaptive decision-\nmaking with reference to rules\
    \ and institutional uncertainty (see also \nEdwards-Jones, 2006). Hence, frameworks\
    \ on adaptive decision-making \nmust consider appropriate rules of behaviour and\
    \ not just environmental \nchange. A next step will be to develop an index for\
    \ measuring adaptive \ndecision-making based on rules of behaviour. Exploring\
    \ this in other contexts \nwill provide much insight into how best to index rules\
    \ and their \ntransformation and institutional uncertainty as a component of farmer\
    \ \nadaptive decision-making to better contribute to scientific debates.  \nIn\
    \ Chapter 5, I discuss how existing information systems in Northern Ghana \nare\
    \ enabling actionable knowledge creation for decision-making. The \ndissertation\
    \ also presents reflections on opportunities for collaboration \nbetween information\
    \ systems to improve actionable knowledge creation. I \nalso point to the need\
    \ for further research on how a systems integration \nChapter 7\n206\n \n \napproach\
    \ could be explored to improve information synthesis and actionable \nknowledge\
    \ creation in rice farming systems (see also Murakami et al., 2007). \nAs shown\
    \ in the chapter, information systems operated with limited \ncollaboration, resulting\
    \ in instances of duplication of functionality and \nservices. Although a competitive\
    \ atmosphere is healthy, there is need for \nfurther research on how the network\
    \ of systems could improve the timely and \naccurate delivery of information.\
    \ This, however, is a question not only about \nthe architecture of systems, but\
    \ also about how the process can enhance the \nuse of information in farming systems\
    \ in Ghana. Given the agenda to enhance \ninteroperability within existing telecommunication\
    \ networks in Ghana, it is \nworth exploring how such infrastructure could improve\
    \ productivity in the \nagriculture sector through ICT (see also Alemna & Sam,\
    \ 2006; Al-Hassan, \nEgyir, & Abakah, 2013). \nFurther research is also needed\
    \ on conceptualising and operationalising \nactionable knowledge in farming systems\
    \ to create value from information, \nas highlighted in Chapter 5. In this dissertation,\
    \ much reference is made to \nCash et al. (2003) on actionable knowledge, with\
    \ a (re)-framing of salience, \ncredibility, and legitimacy in Chapter 5 to encompass\
    \ both indigenous and \nscientific knowledge. Nevertheless, an integration of\
    \ both knowledge systems \nmust be a conscious process undertaken by information\
    \ service providers. \nCurrently, most information systems operating in Ghana\
    \ rely on scientific \ninformation to provide seasonal and weather forecasts to\
    \ farmers. Integrating \nboth knowledge systems enhances the actionability of\
    \ knowledge (see also \nKalanda-Joshua et al., 2011). However, the potential for\
    \ integrating both \nindigenous and scientific data is still a grey area that\
    \ needs further studies in \nGhana.  \n \n7.8 Societal relevance \nIn this dissertation,\
    \ I make a substantial contribution to addressing the \nclimate–water–food security\
    \ challenge in the study area and in Ghana in \ngeneral, detailing how information\
    \ systems could be used to transform \nproductivity in farming systems. A summary\
    \ of the societal relevance of the \nstudy for the district, country, and global\
    \ community is presented below. \nGeneral discussion and conclusion\nChapter 7\n\
    207\n \n \nThe study findings point to areas of synergy that information service\
    \ \nproviders can explore to maximise their economic benefits and also enhance\
    \ \noutcomes and impacts of their operations in Bontanga and its environs. \n\
    Service providers are implored to recognise farmers and other end-users as \n\
    key players in defining their operations in the area. Mobilising farmer support\
    \ \nfor data gathering can be strongly pursued at limited cost and compensation\
    \ \nto investigate the potential of indigenous forecasts and knowledge. The PhD\
    \ \ncandidate engaged farmers directly in establishing what indigenous \nknowledge\
    \ could be relevant for use in information systems. From the study, \nfarmers’\
    \ quest for solutions to uncertainties and water management \nchallenges resulted\
    \ in their willingness to support any intervention that \nreduced the uncertainties\
    \ that they encounter given the consequences of \nclimate variability for their\
    \ farm practices.  \nAlso, this dissertation offers greater insight for food governance\
    \ at district \nlevel. With government’s effort to support rice production to\
    \ meet country \nlevel demand in Ghana, insights from this study provide a lead\
    \ for the District \nAgriculture Development Unit (DADU) on how best to strategically\
    \ support \nrice farmers within its district to increase output and productivity\
    \ at farm \nlevel. It also points to the institutions with which the unit should\
    \ collaborate \nfor mutual investment and benefit. As emphasised, one key challenge\
    \ that \nfarmers have to manage is how to make sense of information accessed from\
    \ \ndifferent sources. Here, by engaging all actors in healthy dialogues through\
    \ \nworkshops and seminars, DADU can take up the agenda of how best to \nenhance\
    \ collaborations.  \nThe dissertation brings into perspective the impact of climate\
    \ change in the \nrice sector in Ghana, providing empirical evidence of the transformative\
    \ \npower of technology and information relevant for policy decision-making. \n\
    With the current drive towards a digital economy and the adoption of a \ntechnological\
    \ strategy to transform the agriculture sector, this dissertation \nadds to the\
    \ discussion by highlighting how addressing design, knowledge, \nand decision-making\
    \ dynamics can accelerate change at local level. The \ndissertation emphasises\
    \ how a participatory process can be pursued to \nenhance local participation\
    \ in, and acceptance of, digital innovations when \nChapter 7\n208\n \n \nframed\
    \ through conscious policymaking and implementation. Policy \nstrategies emphasising\
    \ partnership between private and public institutions \noperating within the space\
    \ of agriculture information provision is clearly \nencouraged given the outcomes\
    \ of this study. In effect, rural economies, \nwhich serve as the food basket\
    \ for the country, could be transformed, with \nimpacts on livelihoods and externalities\
    \ in the form of strong local economies \nnegating poverty indices and levels\
    \ of youth unemployment.  \nAlso, within the agenda of agriculture transformation\
    \ using technology, the \ndissertation elaborates on relevant areas for consideration\
    \ and points to the \nneed to create the opportunity for indigenous innovations.\
    \ It also highlights \nthe need to think of the digital space as an ecosystem\
    \ entailing not only \ntechnical but also socio-cultural and institutional infrastructure,\
    \ without \nwhich technological solutions could fail. Thus, entrepreneurs must\
    \ be \nencouraged to work in teams comprising different disciplines, enabling\
    \ \nreference to both a social and a technical lens to develop ideas into scalable\
    \ \nproducts. With the private sector estimated to set the pace as the engine\
    \ of \ngrowth, government policy and programmes should create an enabling \nenvironment\
    \ for agri-tech companies, especially indigenous enterprises, to \nmaximise growth\
    \ and eliminate instances where entrepreneurs have to fold \nbecause of financial\
    \ incapacities fuelled by high taxes. As much as possible, \ngovernment must partner\
    \ with private enterprises for shared learning, \nexperimenting, and upscaling\
    \ innovations in the agriculture sector in Ghana. \nFor independent investors\
    \ aiming to enter the digital space in Ghana, the \ndissertation provides relevant\
    \ resources that could inform their decision-\nmaking and investment strategy.\
    \ The need for tailor-made solutions \nresponsive to the Ghanaian context is promoted,\
    \ given the results of this \nstudy. This insight points to the need for strategic\
    \ collaboration with existing \ninformation service providers to improve information\
    \ uptake and the \nachievement of investment priorities.  \nThe dissertation makes\
    \ reference to a very significant but untapped resource: \ncitizens (in this case\
    \ smallholder farmers) living in rural areas who could be \nengaged directly in\
    \ the drive to transform the agriculture sector in Ghana. As \nelaborated in Chapter\
    \ 3, indigenous knowledge acquired through the years in \nGeneral discussion and\
    \ conclusion\nChapter 7\n209\n \n \nthe field could strongly inform data collated\
    \ by institutions such as Ghana \nMeteorological Agency, the Ministry of Food\
    \ and Agriculture, and associated \nagencies and departments to improve the accuracy\
    \ of weather and seasonal \nforecasts. The dissertation acknowledges the role\
    \ of citizen science for which \nthe ministries, departments, and agencies have\
    \ yet to set as an agenda. \nAlthough perceived as an expensive process, establishing\
    \ a clear framework \nanchored on civic principles of volunteerism and responsible\
    \ citizenry could \nhelp reduce cost components of data collation over the long\
    \ term to transform \nagriculture and food security indices in the country.  \n\
    With a global drive towards smart agriculture and digitalisation of the food \n\
    chain, the findings from this research render insights, especially in the context\
    \ \nof the global South. From the dissertation’s outcomes, I establish how \n\
    knowledge creation is critical to ensuring the bridge between agriculture \ninformation\
    \ provision and use. I also point to how socio-cultural dynamics \nframe the digital\
    \ ecosystem, suggesting the need for global efforts to \nemphasise a bottom-up\
    \ approach towards transforming the agriculture \nlandscape using technology.\
    \ Equally, solutions at a global scale must be \nmonitored to establish the trickle-down\
    \ effect of their adoption and use \namongst farmers in communities. Hence, a\
    \ comprehensive global approach \nto ensuring food sufficiency through technology\
    \ involves identifying and \nsetting up the right governance framework anchored\
    \ on the principles of \nparticipation and balance of power, whilst addressing\
    \ barriers that inhibit \nprogress in this regard.  \n \n7.9 Conclusions \nIn\
    \ this dissertation, I set out to achieve two main objectives: to provide an \n\
    understanding of the information–knowledge–decision-making relationship \naided\
    \ by information systems in dealing with the climate–water–food \nchallenge in\
    \ rice farming systems in Ghana; and to discuss how climate \ninformation systems\
    \ can improve farmers’ ability to adapt to changes in water \navailability conditions\
    \ in rice farming systems by supporting the generation \nof actionable knowledge\
    \ to support farmer decision-making.  \nChapter 7\n210\n \n \nI have contributed\
    \ to the climate information systems framework, drawing on \nthe concept of EVOs.\
    \ I have also contributed thoughts on responsible \ninnovation in highlighting\
    \ the need for information systems to prioritise \nparticipation, reflexivity,\
    \ responsiveness, and anticipation whilst exploring \nthe possible engagement\
    \ of citizens as scientists in the design and \noperationalisation of information\
    \ systems. I have pointed to strengths and \nlimitations of existing information\
    \ systems in the study area and what could \nbe done differently to enhance productivity\
    \ in the rice farming systems \nstudied. A key suggestion highlighted is for new\
    \ information systems to \nexplore how they can be embedded in existing information\
    \ setups with greater \ninclusivity and community ownership as driving factors.\
    \ I have also \nilluminated how indigenous data could be combined with scientific\
    \ data to \nimprove the accuracy of weather and seasonal forecasts, which is a\
    \ grey area.  \nSecondly, I have provided the insight necessary for deepening\
    \ the \nunderstanding of the concepts of actionable knowledge and adaptive \n\
    decision-making, which are key elements of second generation EVOs. In the \ntransition\
    \ towards improving the usability of data and information, attention \nto the\
    \ aforementioned concepts will enhance the transforming power of \ninformation\
    \ in information systems. For this, I have (re)-conceptualised the \naforementioned\
    \ concepts in the context of rice farming systems and proposed \na new framework\
    \ for climate information systems to make them more useful.  \nI have pointed\
    \ to the need for further discussions on leveraging existing \ninformation and\
    \ technology ecosystems in rural areas in developing countries \n(using Ghana\
    \ as a case), as a first step to improving knowledge in the sector. \nIndirectly,\
    \ I have added to the discourse on the potential of rural areas, which \nare currently\
    \ central to food production and food security in the country. I \nhave added\
    \ to how digital technologies can transform the agriculture sector \nin developing\
    \ economies and hence propose replication of this study in other \njurisdictions\
    \ with similar characteristics. \nI have highlighted decision complexities by\
    \ establishing the interlinkage \nbetween uncertainty and decision logics, thereby\
    \ furthering scientific \nresearch on understanding farmer decision-making in\
    \ food systems. In an era \nwhere data and information are the new oil, it must\
    \ be acknowledged that \nGeneral discussion and conclusion\nChapter 7\n211\n \n\
    \ \nobtaining the right data to support decision-making and transformation in\
    \ \nfarming systems will require establishing decision dynamics in appropriating\
    \ \ndata. Clearly, uncertainty can only be managed and not eliminated, and hence\
    \ \nthe degree to which data and information can bring certainty about the \n\
    uncertainty faced by farmers promises assurance on return on investment and \n\
    the collective goal of improving food security, especially in deprived regions\
    \ \nof the world. Adaptation is a data question, an information question as well\
    \ \nas a decision-making question, also bringing to bear the need to establish\
    \ the \nright governance structures to support information service delivery. \n\

    \ in rice farming \nsystems in Northern Ghana.  \nPreliminary phases of the PhD\
    \ work were aimed at identifying and \nunderstanding key issues such as governance\
    \ arrangements, information \naccess and use, climate forecast from both indigenous\
    \ and scientific sources \nas well as decision-making dynamics.  This workshop\
    \ is expected to be a \nbuild-up on critical issues identified and purposely focus\
    \ on how different \naspects of climate information will influence farmer decision-making.\
    \ It is \nanticipated that the outcomes of the study will significantly shape\
    \ the final \ndesign of a hydro-climatic Environmental Virtual Observatory following\
    \ the \nhighly participatory process of citizen science, collective decision-making\
    \ \nand a bottom-up innovation process. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n274\n\
    \ \n \nStep 1: Setting Up \nThe workshop must be organised in a congenial atmosphere.\
    \ Facilitators must \nensure a number of conditions are in place for a successful\
    \ workshop.  \nA. Venue \nThe venue for the workshop is important. Although the\
    \ settings of most rural \nareas makes it difficult to access well-furnished state\
    \ of the art facilities, most \nrural communities have facilities such as community\
    \ centres, durbar grounds, \nlocal administrative assembly meeting halls and classrooms.\
    \  Facility chosen \nas venue for the workshop must be: \ni. \nSpacious and comfortable\
    \ for participants \nii. \nEnclosed to avoid distraction from movement within\
    \ the immediate \nenvironment outside the venue \niii. \nComfortable seats for\
    \ participants  \niv. \nWell ventilated with enough lighting \n \nB. Logistics/Materials\
    \ \nA number of logistics must be made available as inputs for the workshop. \n\
    These include:  \n- \nFlip charts, Markers, Spiral wheel (3), Solution tape, Tables,\
    \ Cameras, \nRecorder, Name tags (optional), Registration desk \n-The setting\
    \ must have a table and chairs for the facilitators. Farmers do not \nnecessarily\
    \ need a table but just comfortable chairs to sit on. At some points, \nthe arrangement\
    \ could be restructured to allow for sub-groups to work \nindependently. Tables\
    \ and chairs could be arranged in the theatre style, u-\nshaped style or in a\
    \ circle where convenient. Other arrangements could be \nconsidered depending\
    \ on how convenient. Facilitators must set up the spiral \nwheels, flip charts,\
    \ registration desk and all basic requirements. This is to \navoid any distractions\
    \ during the main workshop.  \nKey participating groups are: Facilitators, rapporteurs\
    \ and farmers. \n \n \n \n \n \nSupplementary material\n275\n \n \nWorkshop set-up\

    \ \n \nStep 2: Communicate workshop agenda \nDo not read: Ask all present to take\
    \ their seats. As much as possible, try to \nget participants to mix up irrespective\
    \ of gender.  \nRead: You are all welcome to today’s workshop. My name is………….and\
    \ \nI will be the facilitator for the opening session of the workshop. I will\
    \ like the \nfacilitators and every other participant to introduce him or herself\
    \ after which \nI will take over to communicate to you the objective of the workshop.\
    \ In your \nintroduction, kindly state your full name, your community and what\
    \ type of \nrice farming you practice. \nDo not read: Allow a few minutes for\
    \ introduction \nRead: Thank you for the wonderful introduction. Today we are\
    \ gathered here \nfurther continue what we as researchers and you as farmers have\
    \ been \nworking together on…ie. Helping manage water needs in rice farming by\
    \ \nproviding a climate information system which can be used by you the farmers\
    \ \nwith our support. So far, we have all understood the challenges you face as\
    \ \nfarmers in your decision-making under the different farming systems. We \n\
    have come to know that water is fundamental to your activities as rice farmers\
    \ \nand hence for today’s workshop, our objective is to further engage with you\
    \ \n276\n \n \non how best to use your indigenous knowledge and scientific information\
    \ to \nimprove information precision and reduce uncertainties that you face from\
    \ \nweather variability and its consequences on rainfall and water availability.\
    \ \nThis workshop promises to be an exciting session and we hope that we all \n\
    enjoy it. As your facilitator I am in charge of this workshop and hence I will\
    \ \ndirect how proceedings will go. By way of protocol, if anyone wants to make\
    \ \na point the person may kindly raise his hand and draw my attention. Also,\
    \ \nwhen anyone one is on the floor making a suggestion or input, please do not\
    \ \ninterrupt by making any further contribution until you are asked to do so.\
    \  \nDo not read: You can demonstrate the last bit of observing decorum by \n\
    using mentioning names of participants…   “For example, if Mr………raises \nhis hand\
    \ to make a point, as a facilitator I have the right to give him or her \nthe\
    \ opportunity to speak. When I do, I do not expect Mr…….to also be \ntalking on\
    \ the side in the audience.” \nRead: At this point, I will want to ask if anyone\
    \ has a question or is not \nclear as to why we are gathered here.  \nDo not read:\
    \ Give a minute for any question….. \n \nStep 3: Update on PhD field research\
    \ so far \nDo not read: Facilitators should present to the audience the phases\
    \ of the \nproject and what has been done s far. This could be a PowerPoint \n\
    presentation or an oral presentation. \nRead: At this point, I will invite my\
    \ other colleague facilitator to give you an \noverview of how far we have come\
    \ with this project based on our engagement \nwith you for the past three years.\
    \ We encourage everyone to be attentive and \nfocused so you can ask any questions\
    \ you have after the presentation. This \npart is very important before we get\
    \ to the main activity for the workshop. \nShall we welcome him with a hand of\
    \ applause… \nDo not read: Presentation should not exceed 10 minutes and must\
    \ address \nthe following questions… \nSupplementary material\n277\n \n \ni. \n\
    What is the nature of the climate-water-information-decision-\nmaking challenge?\
    \ \nii. \nWhy is addressing this important to researchers and farmers? \niii.\
    \ \nHow will this workshop contribute to managing the challenge? \nRead: Thank\
    \ you Mr…….for your presentation. At this point, I will open the \nfloor for any\
    \ questions. Please raise your hand if you have any question. \nRemember to mention\
    \ your name first and then you follow it up with your \nquestion. Please try as\
    \ much as possible to be clear in your thoughts and be \nspecific with the question.\
    \ In case you have any point or question, do not \ncondemn another for his or\
    \ her question, you can just make your point or ask \nyour question without condemning\
    \ another.  \nDo not read: Please check from time to time with rapporteur if he\
    \ or she has \nbeen able to capture questions, suggestions and responses or explanations.\
    \  \n--------10 mins break---- \n \nStep 4: Introduce Visual based Exercise \n\
    Read: This stage of the workshop is very participatory and hence we will \nencourage\
    \ everyone to get on board. So far, the workshop has been interesting \nwith an\
    \ excellent presentation and questions. At this stage, we as facilitators \nwill\
    \ engage you in an interactive exercise. The objective of the exercise is to \n\
    create scenarios which you as farmers are faced with regarding information \n\
    and what decisions you will take in response to them. Once again, we \nencourage\
    \ you all to participate in this exercise.  \nDo not read: facilitator should\
    \ move to the items to be used in the exercise \nand explain what each one is\
    \ to be used for and how that ultimately \ncontributes to the entire exercise.\
    \ \nDo not read:  Explain the certainty and uptake wheel (Wheel 1) \nRead: This\
    \ wheel has many colours with each colour representing something \nimportant for\
    \ the exercise. The wheel will be used to determine the level of \ncertainty associated\
    \ with information we will be giving you. Since the \ncertainty level will not\
    \ be fixed, one of you will be made to spin the wheel so \n278\n \n \ndetermine\
    \ the level of certainty at each point in time. As written and shown \nby the\
    \ colours, Green represents a certainty of 75% or above. Yellow \nrepresents a\
    \ certainty of between 50% and 75% and Red represents a certainty \nless than\
    \ 50%. Thus green means the likelihood of the event happening is \n75% or above,\
    \ whereas yellow means the likelihood of the event happening \nis between 75%\
    \ and 50%. Red means the likelihood of the event happening \nis 50% or less. \
    \ \nDo not read: Explain wheel 2 and 3 \nRead: Now both of these wheels represent\
    \ the lead times we want to \nexperiment. We intend to establish how seasonal\
    \ and weather forecast lead \ntimes inform your choice and decisions under the\
    \ different circumstances and \nconditions. \nDo not read: now explain the season\
    \ cardboard \nRead: The season board as shown details out the standard major decisions\
    \ \nthat you as rice farmers make in the season. We have added pictures that \n\
    further explain the decisions. The season cardboard is very important for this\
    \ \nstage of the workshop. Our discussions will go through the seven stages of\
    \ \nkey decisions as shown on the cardboard.   \nDo not read: Lastly is the computer\
    \ which has the list of adaptive decisions \nfarmers are likely to take at each\
    \ stage of the farming season. Farmers should \nnot be told this to avoid the\
    \ thought of being graded based on what adaptive \ndecisions they end up making.\
    \  \nRead: Does anyone have any questions at this stage please? \n \nStep 5: Visual\
    \ based Mapping \nRead: We now need you to be more attentive. We will have to\
    \ get one \nvolunteer to spin wheel 1 which shows the level of certainty and wheel\
    \ 2 and \n3 also showing seasonal and weather forecast lead times respectively.\
    \ After \nspinning each wheel, we will engage with you individually on what decisions\
    \ \nyou will take and also what decision you will also take as a group for the\
    \ \nvarious decision phases of the farming season. We will allow you sometime\
    \ \nSupplementary material\n279\n \n \nwhen it is time to take the collective\
    \ decisions so you discuss amongst \nyourselves what decisions to take and why.\
    \ On the individual decisions \nhowever, we do not expect you to discuss anything\
    \ but rather we will engage \nyou one-on-one to know what decisions you will take\
    \ and why. After this then \nwe discuss what decisions you will make as a group\
    \ based on this. The \nexercise will be done over seven decision stages. The collective\
    \ decisions you \nmake at each stage will be written out clearly on a flip chart\
    \ and discussed at \nthe end of each decision stage.  \nDo not read: The facilitators\
    \ can demonstrate this by going through the \nphases of the exercise practically\
    \ for farmers to see. The literate farmers \ncould be made to provide interpretation\
    \ support at each phase of the exercise.  \nDo not read: Facilitate the process\
    \ over the seven rounds with discussions \non what adaptive decisions farmers\
    \ make and why. Observe how group \ndecisions are made. Do a few hijack the decision-making\
    \ process? Do women \nfarmers contribute? Are the experienced farmers dominating\
    \ the discussion?   \n \nStep 6: Discussion and conclusion \nRead: Thank you for\
    \ participating in the exercise. We appreciate your \nefforts and involvement.\
    \ At this point we all want to discuss a few things to \nbetter understand how\
    \ and what informed your decisions as well as the way \nforward in designing a\
    \ climate service to provide relevant information for \nyour use. We have about\
    \ 5 questions we will want you to answer.  \nI. \nWhat are your impressions about\
    \ the methods we used in this \nexercise to ascertain how information informs\
    \ your decision-\nmaking? \nII. \nDo you think the approach gave you enough opportunity\
    \ and \ntime to brainstorm or better express yourself on what you wanted \nto\
    \ communicate at each stage? If Yes or No, explain your \nanswer. \nDo not read:\
    \ Now facilitators can ask the following questions if observed. \n280\n \n \n\
    III. \nHijack of decision-making process: It appears a few persons \n(mention\
    \ names if possible) dominated the decision-making \nprocess within the group.\
    \ Could there be a reason for that? \nIV. \nGendered decision-making: Were women\
    \ given enough \nopportunity to contribute to the decisions by the group? If not\
    \ \nwhy? \n \nClosing…. \nRead: We will like to take this opportunity to thank\
    \ each and every one of \nyou for availing yourself to participate in this important\
    \ workshop. It serves \nan important input to designing the information system\
    \ which we all are \naiming at. There is refreshment after we close. Please do\
    \ avail yourselves for \nany subsequent workshop what we will be organising in\
    \ the coming weeks or \nmonths. We have some refreshment for you. Thank you once\
    \ again.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSummary\n282\n \n \n\
    The adverse impacts of climate variability and change on water availability \n\
    in food systems continuously present farmers with the challenge of adapting \n\
    their practice and decisions to better manage uncertainties with which they \n\
    are faced. This includes the pursuit of information on seasonal and weather \n\
    conditions so as to establish what choices to make to ensure that water needs\
    \ \nare met. In rice farming systems in Ghana, farmers practising rainfed and\
    \ \nirrigated farming rely on forecasts made available through information \n\
    systems operated by institutions in the public and the private sector. Although\
    \ \nthe provision of meteorological forecast information is expected to reduce\
    \ \nrisks faced by farmers, the reverse has been the case in some contexts because\
    \ \nof not only the limited availability of information at scale, but also the\
    \ \nchallenge of interpretation as well as the trustworthiness of information.\
    \ With \nnumerous information systems operational in the sector, farmers are also\
    \ \nburdened with having to make sense of each system, how it operates, and \n\
    what can be collectively deduced from all these systems towards informed \ndecision-making.\
    \ A fundamental argument for the failure of information \nsystems to make the\
    \ needed impact is the limited engagement of users and \nthe lack of a highly\
    \ participatory process of monitoring environmental \nchange, defining what should\
    \ constitute information, and how best to make \nsense of information for decision-making.\
    \ In addition, institutional change \nand the existence of documented and undocumented\
    \ rules framing social \ninteraction and practices in farming systems present\
    \ uncertainties in some \ncontext with direct and indirect impacts on land tenure,\
    \ access to water for \nirrigation, and labour dynamics.  \n \nRecent literature\
    \ has suggested that a new crop of information systems must \nbe developed, emphasising\
    \ inclusive design, collaborative data gathering, and \nthe cross-fertilisation\
    \ of knowledge to enhance uptake in decision-making. In \nthis context, environmental\
    \ virtual observatories, which refer to a suite of \ninformation \ngathering,\
    \ \nprocessing, \nand \ndissemination \ntechnologies \n(infrastructure, tools,\
    \ and software) supported by World Wide Web that can \nenable cross-fertilisation\
    \ of different sources of knowledge on shared virtual \nplatforms, have been cited.\
    \ To investigate this, this dissertation addresses \nthree key questions to understand\
    \ how climate information systems could \nserve as enablers of greater productivity\
    \ in rice farming systems: \nSummary\n283\n \n \n \nRQ 1. What empirical and theoretical\
    \ dispositions could guide the design \nand operationalisation of climate information\
    \ systems in rice \nfarming systems in Northern Ghana? (Chapter 2) \n \nRQ 2.\
    \ How do governance arrangements inform farmer adaptive decision-\nmaking given\
    \ uncertainty and information needs? (Chapters 3 and \n4) \n \nRQ 3. How do existing\
    \ information systems enable actionable knowledge \ncreation and what information\
    \ could better improve decision-\nmaking in rice farming systems? (Chapters 5\
    \ and 6) \n \nThe dissertation adopts an interdisciplinary approach and a case\
    \ study \nresearch design. It also employs qualitative research methods such as\
    \ focus \ngroup discussions, interviews, workshops, and observations. The dissertation\
    \ \ncomprises five academic articles, with article 1 focused on RQ 1; articles\
    \ 2 \nand 3 addressing RQ 2; and articles 4 and 5 answering RQ 3.  \n \nUsing\
    \ an ex-ante approach, Chapter 2 establishes a possible climate \ninformation\
    \ systems framework that responds to the tenets and principles of \nresponsible\
    \ innovation. This comprises an assessment of existing information \nsystems,\
    \ their challenges, and what could be done differently. The chapter \nalso entails\
    \ insight into governance arrangements and a proposition of \nstructural elements\
    \ for climate information systems. The assessment revealed \nthat emphasis on\
    \ a participatory design as a principle will enhance ownership \nand involvement\
    \ of local actors, more especially farmers, thereby increasing \nthe chances of\
    \ acceptance and usage of the climate information system. In \nmeeting the principle\
    \ of anticipation, the proposed climate information \nsystem addresses farmer\
    \ concerns about future variability in seasonal and \nweather conditions. An emphasis\
    \ on reflexivity through a collaborative \nprocess between natural and social\
    \ scientists and a recognition of \nuncertainties about what information is to\
    \ be provided will ensure the delivery \nof realistic output devoid of failed\
    \ expectations. Included, among other \n284\n \n \nthings, is a discussion on\
    \ how citizen science could potentially enhance the \npotential of drawing on\
    \ both indigenous and scientific information within the \nsystem.  \n \nChapter\
    \ 3 investigates further governance arrangements in irrigated and \nrainfed rice\
    \ farming systems and how these significantly inform adaptive \ndecision-making.\
    \ The empirical study shows that formal and informal \narrangements guide the\
    \ design of irrigation plans, land distribution and \nownership, and labour arrangements.\
    \ For example, the degree to which labour \narrangements could be made informed\
    \ the adaptive decisions that farmers \ntake during land preparation. Secondly,\
    \ although formalised regulations \ndefined how supplementary irrigation should\
    \ be done, weak supervision of \nthe operations of lateral leaders resulted in\
    \ unfair water distribution, pushing \nfarmers to adjust their practices and decisions\
    \ in this regard.  \n \nChapter 4 discusses in-depth the substantive and institutional\
    \ uncertainties \nfaced by farmers in choice-making and the underlying logics\
    \ of decision-\nmaking evident in farmer adaptive decision-making. The chapter\
    \ reveals that \nboth the logic of consequentiality and the logic of appropriateness\
    \ evidently \ncharacterised farmer adaptive decision-making. The chapter highlights\
    \ \ninformation needs of rice farmers, given adaptive decisions. It also identifies\
    \ \nthe adaptive decisions that are common amongst rice farmers.  \n \nChapter\
    \ 5 examines information systems and how they contribute to \nactionable knowledge\
    \ creation in rice farming systems. It emerged that \nfarmer-to-farmer systems\
    \ strongly support the creation of actionable \ninformation thanks to a highly\
    \ participatory process of information and \nknowledge sharing through dialogue\
    \ and considerable reference to both \nscientific and indigenous information in\
    \ a face-to-face setting. The chapter \nalso adds to the literature on the conceptualisation\
    \ of actionable knowledge \nwith reference to both scientific and indigenous knowledge.\
    \ It is emphatic on \nthe fact that, although mobile technology as a tool has\
    \ helped to overcome \nphysical barriers to communication and to ease the interaction\
    \ between \ninformation service providers and users, its transformative power\
    \ is yet to be \nfelt in the broader framing of actionable knowledge. \nSummary\n\
    285\n \n \n \nChapter 6 draws on outcomes of Chapter 2, adding to discussions\
    \ on farmers’ \ninformation needs, given how these inform farmer decision-making.\
    \ Using a \nvisually facilitated scenario modelling workshop, the study in this\
    \ chapter \nexplored how probabilities and lead times (seasonal and weather) shaped\
    \ \nfarmer decision-making. Findings from the empirical study suggest that a \n\
    seasonal forecast provided at a 1-month lead time rather than earlier is \nsignificant\
    \ for farmers to act through decision-making. Also, farmers \npreferred weather\
    \ information provided at a 1-week lead time rather than at a \n3-day or 1-day\
    \ lead time, as this affords farmers enough room to take and \nimplement decisions\
    \ in the form of practice.  \n \nThis dissertation thus strongly contributes to\
    \ scientific explorations of how \ninformation systems can better help farmers\
    \ deal with uncertainties in the \nform of climate variability and change, for\
    \ which there is no end in sight. It \nalso contributes to conceptualisations\
    \ of the concepts of uncertainty, \nactionable knowledge, and adaptive decision-making.\
    \ More broadly, it adds \nto current discourse on suitable frameworks for climate\
    \ information systems. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n286\n\

    \ knowledge. Chasing \nafter a PhD came with lots of ups and downs moments. These\
    \ moments have \nchanged me and did so for good. Indeed, writing a PhD dissertation\
    \ is meant \nto be an independent process that develops an individual into a formidable\
    \ \nscientist. Yet, the journey can be awfully long and near impossible without\
    \ \nthe support of mentors, colleagues, family and friends. I am extremely \n\
    grateful to all who have supported me in diverse ways, but there are some \npeople\
    \ I would like to thank in particular. \n \nMy greatest appreciation goes to my\
    \ supervision team for their patience, \nunderstanding and unflinching support\
    \ throughout my PhD trajectory.  \n \nTo my promotor, Prof. Dr. Fulco Ludwig,\
    \ I am very grateful for your sense \nof responsibility, commitment and availability\
    \ towards me. You were always \nthere to listen, guide and advise me. Your humour,\
    \ smartness and depth of \nunderstanding of issues is something I have always\
    \ admired. You have always \nencouraged me to be the fiercest critic of my own\
    \ work, though difficult a \ntask, I have grown to appreciate this a lot.  I am\
    \ indeed excited to continue \nworking with you as a post-doctoral researcher.\
    \ I can’t think of any other \nopportunity than to be under your tutelage.  \n\
    \ \nTo my daily supervisor, Dr. Saskia Werners, you have been a gem in my PhD\
    \ \njourney. I am extremely grateful for your genuine interest in both my \nacademic\
    \ and personal life. You have always been my first point of contact \nin difficult\
    \ moments; you make it easy for me to discuss my most disturbing \nissues and\
    \ you provided tangible suggestions, which most often are the best \nsolutions.\
    \ I have learnt a lot from you. You pushed me to think out of the box. \nThough\
    \ I must confess this was challenging in the beginning, it is a skill I \nnow\
    \ greatly cherish. I am highly indebted to you for all that you have done \nfor\
    \ me to reach this milestone.  \n \nTo my co-supervisor Dr. Robbert Biesbroek,\
    \ you taught me many things and \nfor that I am grateful. Your constructive comments\
    \ and feedback have helped \nme considerably to improve my scientific skills.\
    \ Since my research was more \ninterdisciplinary, you helped me to better understand\
    \ the social research \ntechniques and methodologies. Your door was always open\
    \ when I had \nquestions. Thanks for all your good suggestions and input, and\
    \ your \npragmatic opinions.  \n \nAcknowledgements\n10\n \nThroughout my PhD\
    \ trajectory, I had the opportunity to work and interact \nwith people in three\
    \ main research groups at Wageningen University: The \nWater Systems and Global\
    \ Change Group, Knowledge Technology and \nInnovation Group and the Public Administration\
    \ and Policy group.  Within \nthese groups, I have met many people from different\
    \ parts of the world and \nlearned about diverse cultures. I have also developed\
    \ a rather broad line of \nthinking about complex societal problems and arguably\
    \ become a better \nscientist. While I would like to thank everyone who supported\
    \ me in these \ngroups, I would in a special way like to thank certain individuals\
    \ who \ncontributed immensely to this success. I wish to thank the following people\
    \ \nin the Water Systems and Global Change Group. Prof. Dr. Carolien Kroeze, \n\
    you were very helpful first as my initial promotor until Prof. Fulco took over.\
    \ \nEven when you were no more my promotor you always stayed in touch and \ninquired\
    \ regularly if everything was going well. To Wietse Franssen, you \nplayed an\
    \ instrumental role in fixing my scripts and programming challenges. \nTo Dr.\
    \ Erik van Slobbe, Dr. Iwan Supit, Dr. Long Hoang and Maartje \nSijtsema, I would\
    \ like to thank you all for the diverse ways you have \nsupported me. Also in\
    \ the Knowledge Technology and Innovation Group, I \nwish to thank Prof. Dr. Cees\
    \ Leeuwis, Vera Mentzel, Inge Ruisch and Mirjam \nCevat for their patient and\
    \ support. You people were the backbone of all the \nadministrative arrangement\
    \ that came with my PhD. You were always ready \nto answer my questions and provided\
    \ advice, for this I am grateful. \nAdditionally, in the Public Administration\
    \ and Policy group I would like to \nthank prof. Dr. Katrien Termeer, Prof. Dr.\
    \ Art Dewulf and Maarit Junnikkala \nfor their invaluable support. \n \nMy stay\
    \ in Wageningen was made special by the number of students and \npeople I came\
    \ into contact and share special moments with. Special thanks to \nAndy Bonaventure\
    \ Nyamekye for been an incredible project partner, without \nyou the journey would\

    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAbstract\nAbstract\n15\n \nAbstract \n \nClimate variability\
    \ and its impacts on the agriculture system is clearly evident \nin Ghana. Weather\
    \ and seasonal climate forecast information service has been \nin operation for\
    \ some time in the country. However, farmers generally do not \nfind the information\
    \ useful for their farm-level decision making. Forecast \naccuracy, untimeliness,\
    \ and mismatch of forecast information and needs are \noften reported constraints\
    \ for farmers to use weather and climate information. \nConsequently, the majority\
    \ of farmers rely on their indigenous ecological \nknowledge to predict weather\
    \ and seasonal climate patterns. At the same time, \ncurrent weather and seasonal\
    \ climate forecast information systems in Ghana \nface serious constraints in\
    \ how they are used (if at all) because of the one-\ndirectional assumption behind\
    \ its development; where only science produces \nnew knowledge and makes it accessible\
    \ for end-users with no or limited \ninvolvement of the end-users. In this context,\
    \ this study addresses the central \nquestion: How can climate information services\
    \ be improved through the co-\nproduction of farmers and scientist? It aims at\
    \ improving the reliability and \nacceptability of forecast information by integrating\
    \ indigenous and scientific \nforecast. In this dissertation, I used a multi-method\
    \ research approach, \nconsisting of social participatory methods, mental modelling\
    \ methods, \nforecast verification methods, and the principle of citizen science\
    \ for data \ngathering and analysis. Initial diagnostics revealed certain issues\
    \ that limit the \nuptake of climate information services in Northern Ghana: (1)\
    \ the mismatch \nbetween forecast information provided and the farmers' information\
    \ need (2) \npoor quality of forecast information, (3) the disconnect between\
    \ forecast \nproviders (researchers) and farmers, (4) management of unrealistic\
    \ \nexpectations of farmers. In response, I proposed a framework for second \n\
    generation climate services that have the potential to facilitate co-production\
    \ \nof relevant and accurate weather and seasonal climate forecast information\
    \ \nand manages user expectation while strengthening the collaboration between\
    \ \ninformation providers and users. Results of our analysis show that farmers’\
    \ \ninformation needs are linked to the type and timing of farm-level decision\
    \ \nmaking. Also, model-based seasonal forecasts have the potential to provide\
    \ \nrelevant information at farmers most preferred lead time.  \n \nFindings also\
    \ show that in addition to historical rainfall patterns, farmers also \nuse observational\
    \ changes in certain indigenous ecological indicators to \npredict the coming\
    \ season. In particular, there is a cognitive relationship \nbetween the observational\
    \ changes and the predicted rainfall event. I observed \nthat farmers’ indigenous\
    \ forecasting skills and techniques are not intuitive but \nrationally developed\
    \ and improve with age and experience. Results also show \nAbstract\n16\n \nthat\
    \ farmers and Ghana Meteorological agency are on average able to \naccurately\
    \ forecast one out of every three daily rainfall events. Similar results \nwere\
    \ obtained at the seasonal timescale. Furthermore, I recognized that \nforecast\
    \ reliability and usefulness can be improved if indigenous forecast data \nare\
    \ quantitatively collected and integrated with the scientific forecast using \n\
    the proposed integrated probability forecast method. Finally, this dissertation\
    \ \ncontributes to the calls for a more integrated, co-learning, and co-production\
    \ \napproach to climate services that move away from the current focus on \nscience-driven\
    \ and user-informed climate services. The approach developed \nin this dissertation\
    \ is relevant for managing the impact of climate variability \nand change, particularly\
    \ because it includes the knowledge of indigenous \npeoples which is often overlooked.\

    21\n \nChapter 1 \nGeneral Introduction \n \n1.1 Background and problem outline\
    \ \n \nIn Africa, extreme weather conditions such as droughts and floods are \n\
    projected to occur more frequently and more intense, affecting all sectors but\
    \ \nespecially agriculture (Schlenker & Lobell, 2010). Over the last years, periods\
    \ \nof extreme heat and erratic rainfall in Ghana has caused crop failures leading\
    \ \nto yield reduction and, food insecurity in the region (Müller-Kuckelberg,\
    \ \n2012). Smallholder farmers are disproportionately affected by climate \nvariability\
    \ and change (Jalloh et al., 2013; Niang et al., 2014; Sarr et al., \n2015). Rainfall\
    \ variability is a particular problem for Ghanaian farmers; both \nirrigated and\
    \ rain-fed farmers in the Northern part of the country are impacted \nby these\
    \ changes because of the difficulties to predict the weather and \nseasonal climate,\
    \ leaving serious implications for food production (Kranjac-\nBerisavljevic’ et\
    \ al., 2003; Asante & Amuakwa-Mensah, 2015).  \n \nThe unpredictability of weather\
    \ and seasonal climate influences the precision \nof farm-level decisions that\
    \ need to be taken from daily to weekly and in \nmonths ahead of a season (Asante\
    \ & Amuakwa-Mensah, 2015; Asante & \nAmuakwa-Mensah, 2015; Lawson et al., 2019).\
    \ For example, farmers have to \nre-sow seeds several times due to delay in rains\
    \ which affect germination, \nincreasing the cost of production and straining\
    \ their livelihood (Ndamani & \nWatanabe, 2013). Irrigation managers and farmers\
    \ rely on river discharge \ninformation to decide the frequency, quantity, and\
    \ method of water \ndistribution to farms. However, their limited ability to predict\
    \ the rains and \nriver discharge ahead of the season put them in a dilemma (Ndamani\
    \ & \nWatanabe, 2013). Growing concerns about the impacts of climate variability\
    \ \nand change on agriculture have attracted the attention of the national and\
    \ \ninternational community to strengthen weather and climate information \n(Gumucio\
    \ et al., 2019). Developing weather and climate services is therefore \nsuggested\
    \ as an important element to manage the risk of climate variability \nand change\
    \ (Vaughan & Dessai, 2014; Ouédraogo et al.,2015). \n \nHereafter, I use the term\
    \ climate services as a combination of weather services \nand seasonal climate\
    \ services although both are distinct in their definition. \nWhile weather service\
    \ provides information on the condition of the \natmosphere at a given time and\
    \ place for up to about 14 days (Fleming, 2008), \nseasonal climate services deliver\
    \ information about the average weather \nChapter 1\n22\n \nconditions from one\
    \ month to six months period (Bazile et al., 2017). \nBorrowing from the definition\
    \ of Climate Services Partnership, climate \nservices are the production, translation,\
    \ transfer, and use of weather and \nclimate knowledge and information in weather\
    \ and climate-informed decision \nmaking and climate-smart policy and planning\
    \ (CSP, 2011).  \n \nStudies show that current weather and climate information\
    \ services for \nagriculture are facing serious constraints in how they are used\
    \ (if at all). First, \nmost farmers do not find forecast information useful for\
    \ farm decision making \nbecause of forecast inaccuracy, language barriers, use\
    \ of technical forecast \nterminologies which are difficult to understand, inconsistency\
    \ and \nuntimeliness of information provision, as well as forecast not matching\
    \ their \nneeds (Luseno et al., 2003; Onyango et al., 2014; Feleke, 2015). Secondly,\
    \ \nclimate services in many parts of the world, including Ghana, are developed\
    \ \nin a one-directional manner; where science produces new knowledge and \nmakes\
    \ it accessible for end-users with no or limited involvement in the \nproduction\
    \ of knowledge. This limits the acceptability and use of forecast \ninformation\
    \ (Cash et al.,2003; Okello et al., 2012; Karpouzoglou et al., 2016). \nConsequently,\
    \ local farmers across Africa highly depend on indigenous \nforecasts for most\
    \ farm decision making, including in Ghana (Gyampoh et \nal., 2009; Nyantakyi-Frimpong,\
    \ 2013), Zimbabwe (Gwenzi et al., 2016), \nBurkina Faso (Roncoli et al., 2002)\
    \ and South Africa (Zuma-Netshiukhwi et \nal., 2013).  \n \nIn line with the above,\
    \ the discourse on climate services as tool to support \nadaptation has stimulated\
    \ scholars to study it from different angles: improving \nthe skills of scientific\
    \ forecast models for agriculture decisions (Hammer, \n2000; Hansen, 2005; Esquivel\
    \ et al., 2018), increasing co-production of \nclimate services (Bovaird, 2007;\
    \ Dilling & Lemos, 2011; Enengel et al., \n2012), exploring the value of indigenous\
    \ knowledge for forecasting and \nintegrating indigenous and scientific forecast\
    \ (Zuma-Netshiukhwi et al., \n2013; Jiri et al., 2015; Radeny et al., 2019). Despite\
    \ progress, scholarship on \nthe topic is still at its infancy and critical questions\
    \ remain. First, studies have \nsuggested that climate services can be made more\
    \ reliable and acceptable \nwhen indigenous forecast (IF) and scientific forecast\
    \ (SF) are integrated \n(Gagnon & Berteaux, 2009). While this has been acknowledged\
    \ in the \nacademic literature, very few studies have explored the possibility.\
    \ Therefore, \nthe question that still remains is whether integration is possible\
    \ considering \nthe significant differences between IF and SF? Secondly, Buytaert\
    \ et al., \n(2014), suggest that citizen science (see also section 1.3) has the\
    \ potential to \ncomplement more traditional ways of scientific data collection\
    \ and \nGeneral introduction\n23\n \nknowledge generation. Citizen science has\
    \ been applied in different fields of \nstudy, yet to the best of my knowledge,\
    \ no studies have explored citizens \nscience as a way of increasing co-production\
    \ in climate services. The \nquestion, therefore, is how can citizen science contribute\
    \ to co-production of \nclimate services? In this dissertation, I aim at making\
    \ weather and seasonal \nclimate information services useful for the decision\
    \ making of farmers’ in \nNorthern Ghana, by integrating scientific and indigenous\
    \ forecast. \n \nThe remainder of this chapter presents the current state of knowledge\
    \ on \nclimate services for agriculture decision making (section 1.2), the conceptual\
    \ \nframework used for this study (section 1.3), Emerging key knowledge gaps,\
    \ \nthe research objective and questions (section 1.4), an overview of the research\
    \ \nmethodology used for the study, including study area and research design \n\
    (section 1.5), and the structure of this dissertation (section 1.6). \n \n1.2\
    \ Climate services for agriculture \n \nIn general, climate services support a\
    \ variety of interventions aimed at \nbuilding resilience by providing basic knowledge\
    \ about the local climate, \ninform farmers and institutional decision-making\
    \ about future changes, as \nwell as creating an enabling setting for adopting\
    \ new practises such as \nclimate-smart agriculture (Hansen et al., 2019).  \n\
    \ \nThe early development of agricultural climate services can be traced back\
    \ to \nthe dual ambition of matching seasonal climate forecasting to agricultural\
    \ \nsystems and including agriculture into the development of seasonal climate\
    \ \npredictions. In the early to mid-1990s, north-eastern Australian agricultural\
    \ \nresearchers developed the first decision support tools to translate climate\
    \ \ninformation for agricultural management decisions (Hayman, 2004).  In \nAfrica,\
    \ the 1997/98 El Niño event saw an increase of investment and research \non agricultural\
    \ applications of seasonal climate prediction. At the same time, \nthe Regional\
    \ Climate Outlook Forums was also launched (RCOF). Climate \nservices in most\
    \ parts of the continent are currently connected to RCOF \n(Hansen et al., 2019).\
    \  \n \nConsidered as an integral part of climate change adaptation agenda, climate\
    \ \nservices have recently received a great deal of attention especially because\
    \ \nforecasting capability has been improved in the past two decades (Orlove et\
    \ \nal., 2004). A number of frameworks and programs have been proposed for \n\
    climate services (Lourenço et al., 2016), to provide timely, tailored \nChapter\
    \ 1\n24\n \ninformation and knowledge to a variety of users including smallholder\
    \ \nfarmers to adapt and increase resilience (Vaughan & Dessai, 2014).  \n \n\
    Despite the value of climate information services in making the agriculture \n\
    sector more resilient to climate variability and change, Ghana has made \nlimited\
    \ progress. This can be traced back to the dominating role of climate \nscientist\
    \ who focuses on producing and evaluating the quality of weather and \nclimate\
    \ information, rather than understanding the use of the information \ncreated\
    \ (McNie, 2013). As the demand in climate services for agriculture \nincreases\
    \ in the country, a number of challenges emerge which complicated \nthe generation,\
    \ dissemination, and use of forecast information for decision \nmaking. These\
    \ challenges are not unique for Ghana but are found for many \ndeveloping countries\
    \ in the global south, in particular, sub-Saharan Africa \n(Vaughan et al., 2019).\
    \ \n \nIn the remainder of this section, I present the use of climate services\
    \ for \nagriculture in Ghana, elaborating the reasons for increased demand for\
    \ \nclimate information services as well as the emerging challenges and proposed\
    \ \nsolutions that come as a consequence. \n \n1.2.1 Climate services for agriculture\
    \ in Ghana  \n \nIn Ghana, climate services have received little attention in\
    \ agricultural policy \n(Naab et al., 2019). The Ghana Meteorological Agency (GMet)\
    \ is the only \nnational provider of climate information working with the Ministry\
    \ of Food \nand Agriculture (MoFA), the Ministry of Environment, Science, Technology\
    \ \nand Innovation (MESTI), Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the \nNational\
    \ Climate Change Committee (NCCC), and the Council for Scientific \nand Industrial\
    \ Research (CSIR). As a result of the increasing demand in \nquality forecast\
    \ information, a number of private sector providers have \nemerged providing tailor\
    \ made forecast information to farmers. Arguably, the \nprivate sector involvement\
    \ in agriculture climate services signals that forecast \ninformation provided\
    \ by GMet has not been sufficiently useful for farmers. \nFor example, GMet provides\
    \ weather and seasonal climate forecast to the \ngeneral Ghanaian public yet focus\
    \ more on the aviation, defence and marine \nsectors with little to no attention\
    \ to farmers (Naab et al., 2019). Therefore, \nclimate services for agriculture\
    \ in Ghana encounter several challenges.  \n \n1.2.2 Challenges for successful\
    \ delivery of agriculture climate services in \nGhana \n \nGeneral introduction\n\
    25\n \n \n \n \nnot properly communicated and forecast provides false alarm, farmers\

    information to adapt their farming practises; for example, types of crops to\n\

    Secondly, for climate information to be useful and integrated into farm-level\n\
    consequently, on the economy.\nforecasts may lead to harmful consequences to farmers’\
    \ livelihoods and\nfarmers. According to Tall et al. (2018), the resulting “wrong”\
    \ climate\nclimate information at a national and regional scale which is less\
    \ relevant to\nimprove the forecast. As a result, GMet provides weather and seasonal\n\
    stations. This makes it difficult to properly evaluate forecast quality and\n\
    historical climate data available due to poor monitoring and broken weather\n\
    necessary for rigorous spatial analysis. Moreover, there is incomplete\nGhana,\
    \ for example, sparse weather stations provide limited coverage of areas\nrainfall\
    \ remains a challenge (Johnston et al., 2004; Hansen et al., 2019). In\nFirst\
    \ of all, prediction with a high level of accuracy of forecasts especially\nclimate\

    \ developing countries including Ghana vulnerable to\n2015). The challenges of\
    \ climate information services have kept many\ndoes not necessarily reflect their\
    \ specific needs (Onyango et al., 2014; Feleke,\nimproved over the years, studies\
    \ show that information provided to end-users\ntechnology for generating and disseminating\
    \ reliable climate information has\nstorage data and sharing problem (NADMO, 2015;).\
    \  Even though the\nsystems are limited in their operations due to  institutional\
    \ data collection,\nclimate related hazards, such as drought and flood. Yet current\
    \ early warning\nGhana like many other countries in the sub-region is faced with\
    \ similar\nChapter 1\n26\n \nand trust in the scientific forecast are impacted\
    \ (NRC, 2006). Contrary to the \nassumption that non-experts do not understand\
    \ the probability of \nuncertainties, recent research suggests that non-experts\
    \ can make effective \nuse of probabilistic uncertainty estimates in weather and\
    \ climate forecasts \n(LeClerc, 2014). Non-experts made better weather and climate\
    \ related \ndecisions when forecasts and projections include uncertainty estimates,\
    \ \nalthough some expressions of uncertainty were more effective in some \nsituations\
    \ than others (LeClerc, 2014). In Ghana, GMet does not \ncommunicate forecast\
    \ information with its probability. Most users, therefore, \ninterpret the information\
    \ as if it was absolutely certainty, and when it fails \nthey complain,  and doubt\
    \ the quality of information and the relevance of the \nGMet institution itself.\
    \  \n \nIn addition to the above challenges, the World Meteorological Organisation\
    \ \n(WMO) has listed some more challenges that limit the generation and the \n\
    dissemination of climate information at the required quantity, quality and \n\
    timeliness. These include existing data policies that inhibit free and open data\
    \ \ndissemination; unavailability of digitised climate archives that includes\
    \ all \nclimate elements; improper data quality checks; existing gaps in climate\
    \ \nobservations due to malfunctioning of meteorological stations and lack of\
    \ \ncapacity in using satellite data services (WMO, 2006). These challenges are\
    \ \nalso found to be affecting climate services for agriculture in Ghana (Ndamani\
    \ \n& Watanabe, 2013; Codjoe et al., 2014; Nkrumah et al., 2014; Asante & \nAmuakwa-Mensah,\
    \ 2015; Naab et al., 2019). \n \n1.2.3 From first to second generation climate\
    \ services in Ghana  \n \nThe above mentioned challenges emerge to a large extent\
    \ from the first \ngeneration of climate services used in Ghana. The first generation\
    \ of climate \nservices is built on the assumption that if access to climate data\
    \ is improved, \ndecision making will improve also (Okello et al., 2012; Anoop\
    \ et al., 2015; \nEtwire et al., 2017). However, Harvey et al., (2019) argue that\
    \ for climate \nservices to be successful, there is the need to move towards a\
    \ demand-driven \nand science-informed approach. Further, they mention the need\
    \ for providers \nto understand and adopt the terminology, regulatory, and cultural\
    \ conditions \nof the end-users, rather than the other way around. To do this\
    \ requires an \napproach that is more collaborative with effective and regular\
    \ communication \nbetween scientists and end-users. \n \nKarpouzoglou et al. (2016),\
    \ raised a similar argument for shifting to a more \ninclusive second generation\
    \ Environmental Virtual Observatories in general.  \nGeneral introduction\n27\n\
    \ \nEVOs describe the infrastructure, tools and software used for gathering, \n\
    processing and dissemination information and can enable cross fertilization \n\
    of different sources of knowledge on shared virtual platforms (Karpouzoglou \n\
    et al., 2016, Pp 40). The first generations of these information systems failed\
    \ \nto deliver a strong knowledge co-creation component and consequently failed\
    \ \nto empower local communities to manage their environmental change using \n\
    actionable knowledge (Dewulf et al., 2005). Therefore a second generation \nEVOs\
    \ has been proposed to emphasizes knowledge co-creation between \nscientists and\
    \ societal actors, and bidirectional information flows, so as to \ncreate actionable\
    \ knowledge that can support decision-making.  \n \nWhile co-production of climate\
    \ services is increasingly acknowledged, it is \nnot used in the design and dissemination\
    \ of climate services in Ghana. Several \nreasons for the lack of progress exist.\
    \ First, there is lack of co-ordination \namong the many organisations and actors\
    \ who play a role in the generation, \ndissemination and use of climate forecast\
    \ in Ghana (Naab et al., 2019). \nSecondly, farmers who are the main users of\
    \ agriculture climate services are \nrarely involved in the process because of\
    \ the limited appreciation of their local \nknowledge. \n  \nTherefore, the objective\
    \ of this dissertation is to improve weather and \nseasonal climate forecast information\
    \ services in Ghana through co-\nproduction by integrating scientific and indigenous\
    \ forecasts to support farm \ndecision making. In doing so, this dissertation\
    \ aims to contribute to a second \ngeneration of climate services for agriculture\
    \ in Ghana. \n \n1.3 Conceptual framework  \n \nThe conceptual framework of this\
    \ study is depicted in Figure 1.1.  The central \nconcept in the dissertation\
    \ is co-production. Other key concepts include \ncitizen science, second-generation\
    \ climate services, indigenous and scientific \nknowledge/forecast, and integration.\
    \ The framework conceptualises the \ninteraction between scientist and rice farmers\
    \ (dash double side arrow) \nthrough citizen science to collect forecast data\
    \ combined into an integrated \nforecast. In this process, farmers contribute\
    \ their knowledge about forecast \ninformation needs and decision making which\
    \ inform scientists’ forecast \nevaluation. In the remaining of this section,\
    \ I explain the key concepts and \nhow they link to each other in the dissertation.\
    \ \nChapter 1\n28\n \n \n \nFigure 1.1: Conceptual framework of the study. \n\
    \ Co-production \nThe concept of co-production is used as the direct involvement\
    \ of clients’ or \ncitizens’ in public or private sectors production (Parks et\
    \ al., 1981). It has \nbeen used primarily within the fields of participatory\
    \ development, science \nand technology studies, and science policy studies (Miller\
    \ & Wyborn, 2018). \nRecently, co-production has increasingly become a relevant\
    \ research area in \nwhich producers and users of knowledge collaboratively engage\
    \ each other \nto address complex societal problems (van Kerkhoff & Lebel, 2015;\
    \ Wyborn, \n2015). Co-production highlights the need to encourage the power balance\
    \ \nbetween producers and users of knowledge in order to create an enabling \n\
    environment for collaborative knowledge production (Vincent et al., 2018). \n\
    Rice (2002), emphasizes that in co-production, the efforts of end-users are \n\
    recognized and forms an important part in the production of the output. \nTherefore,\
    \ co-production calls for joint efforts between two parties (the \nproducer and\
    \ end-user) who jointly determine the output of their \ncollaboration.  \n \n\
    The logic of co-production may seem simple at first sight but practice shows \n\
    it is rather challenging.  This is particularly true for responding to climate\
    \ \nGeneral introduction\n29\n \nchange impacts. As noted in section 1.2, scholars\
    \ have suggested that to \nachieve co-production in climate services a shift from\
    \ supply-driven to \ndemand-driven approach where scientist and end-users engage\
    \ in a regular \nand sustained interaction to produce forecast information is\
    \ needed (Dilling \n& Lemos, 2011; Kirchhoff et al., 2013; Nel et al., 2016).\
    \ \n \nDrawing from the definitions and characteristics of co-production, I define\
    \ \nand apply the concept of co-production as the active involvement of farmers\
    \ \nand scientists in designing, creating and producing climate services to address\
    \ \nthe complex problem of climate variability and change in a way that \nrecognises\
    \ and uses different knowledge systems and expertise in forecasting. \nThe concept\
    \ of co-production as used in this study is expected to enhance the \ninclusiveness\
    \ required for successful climate services delivery, thus pushing \nfor a second-generation\
    \ climate services that centre on co-production. \n \nSecond generation climate\
    \ services \n \nCo-production is an important element of the second generation\
    \ climate \nservices. Building on the arguments of Karpouzoglou et al. (2016),\
    \ \nnotwithstanding the significant advancement in the development of \ninnovative\
    \ information systems, there still exist several instances where the \nexpertise\
    \ of end-users are isolated from the design and development process.  \nCash et\
    \ al. (2003), also indicate that less involvement of users in the \ndevelopment\
    \ of information systems will result in lack of trust in data and \nlimited ownership\
    \ of the outputs which are essential values for the success of \nthe system. As\
    \ a result, the one-directional model (where farmers are \ninformed, not involved)\
    \ of providing weather and climate services has shown \nto be flawed, making farmers\
    \ not to trust scientific information and thus \nrelying on their indigenous forecast\
    \ (Letson et al., 2001). In most cases, \ntraining farmers to adopt this one-directional\
    \ model of providing weather and \nclimate information services fail to improve\
    \ climate information uptake \n(Manyanhaire & Chitura, 2015b). A key reason for\
    \ this is that scientists often \nhave little understanding of farmers’ contexts\
    \ and needs (Artikov et al., 2006). \n \nAside from the regular meetings and workshops\
    \ with farmers, the unique \napproach adopted in this research is the use of citizen\
    \ science.  \n \nCitizen science \n \nCitizens’ involvement in science is not\
    \ necessarily a new term, although it \ngained a lot of traction in the last decade.\
    \ Citizen science can be traced back \nChapter 1\n30\n \nto the 19th century (Silvertown,\
    \ 2009).  The term is described by Bonney et \nal. (2009), as “an approach where\
    \ scientific insight is gained by individuals \nwho do not work professionally\
    \ in the relevant scientific field, with or without \nthe support of professional\
    \ researchers”. Buytaert et al. (2014) define it as “an \napproach whereby non-scientists\
    \ are actively involved, at differing degrees, \nin the generation of new scientific\
    \ knowledge, from which they \nalso actively stand to benefit either intrinsically\
    \ (e.g. increased scientific \nliteracy) or extrinsically (e.g. increased social\
    \ capital)”. The term has also \nbeen associated with concepts such as crowd-sourced\
    \ data (Lowry & Fienen, \n2013), community-based management (Keough & Blahna,\
    \ 2006), \ncommunity-based monitoring (Palmer Fry, 2011). However, the element\
    \ of \n“active” engagement distinct citizen science from other forms of public\
    \ \nparticipation in scientific research (Wiggins & Crowston, 2011). \n \nIn the\
    \ context of this dissertation, I define citizen science as the participation\
    \ \nand collaboration of farmers in the collection, sharing and interpretation\
    \ of \ndata (e.g. rain forecast and observational data) generated at a finer resolution\
    \ \nwhich otherwise could be impossible to achieve by scientist only.  \n \nCitizen\
    \ science, in general, has many challenges; (1) organizational issues; \nlack\
    \ of volunteer interest, networking, funding opportunities and information \n\
    access (Whitelaw et al., 2003; Milner, 2007; Conrad & Daoust, 2008), (2) \ndata\
    \ collection issues; include data fragmentation, data inaccuracy, and lack \n\
    of participant objectivity and inadequate training (Whitelaw et al., 2003) and\
    \ \n(3) data use issues; including, adequacy of sample size, credibility, non-\n\
    comparability and completeness of the data (Bradshaw, 2003; Gouveia et al., \n\
    2004; Sharpe & Conrad, 2006; Conrad & Daoust, 2008).  \n \nCitizen science, however,\
    \ has several benefits for science, society and \nparticipants (See Table A1 of\
    \ supplementary material for details on the \nbenefit of citizens science) (Pettibone\
    \ et al., 2016). Generally, citizen science \nprojects have been more successful\
    \ in advancing scientific knowledge. Such \nprojects involve non-scientist in\
    \ gathering large amounts of data in different \nlocations for a longer period\
    \ of time. Recent applications of citizen science \nincludes water quality monitoring\
    \ (Canfield et al., 2002; NYCWTA, 2014), \nmapping spatially non-continuous permanent\
    \ rivers (Turner & Richter, \n2011), examining populations distribution and change\
    \ of birds (Bonter & \nHarvey, 2008; Bonter et al., 2010), the spread of infectious\
    \ diseases among \nwild animal populations (Hochachka et al., 2004; Dhondt et\
    \ al., 2005), \ncommunity monitoring of poaching (Stevens et al., 2013), effect\
    \ of acid rain \non bird populations (Hames et al., 2002), modelling ecological\
    \ systems \nGeneral introduction\n31\n \n(Hochachka et al., 2007; Kelling et al.,\
    \ 2009) and planning and management \nof local ecosystems (Pollock & Whitelaw,\
    \ 2005). In meteorology and \natmospheric science, however, the adoption has been\
    \ relatively limited with \nsome applications for precipitation measurement (CoCoRaH,\
    \ 2010).  \n \nThe novelty of applying citizen science in this study is not particularly\
    \ for \nadvancing theories on citizen science, but as part of the approach to\
    \ actively \ninvolve non-scientists in the process of generating integrated forecasts.\
    \ \nIntegrating both indigenous and scientific forecast has the potential of making\
    \ \nforecast information useful for farmers (Gagnon & Berteaux, 2009).  \n \n\
    Indigenous knowledge / forecast \n \nThe concept of indigenous knowledge has been\
    \ widely used in different \nstrands of literature and no commonly accepted definition\
    \ exists. It is \ntherefore valuable to explore the various circumstances under\
    \ which the term \nhas been used (for example, Mafongoya & Ajayi (2017), Orlove\
    \ et al., (2010), \nGray & Morant, (2003), Berkes et al., (2000) and Ruddle &\
    \ Johannes (1989). \nThe term indigenous knowledge is often used in reference\
    \ to knowledge and \nknow-how that is generated by several generations to guide\
    \ their \nunderstanding and interactions with their surrounding environment \n\
    (Mafongoya & Ajayi, 2017). Indigenous knowledge can also be defined as a \ncumulative\
    \ body of knowledge, practice and belief, evolving by adaptation \nprocesses and\
    \ handed down through generations by cultural transmission, \nabout the relationship\
    \ of living beings (including humans) with their \nenvironment (Berkes et al.,\
    \ 2000). Nonetheless, indigenous knowledge is \ntagged by different names in literature;\
    \ local knowledge, traditional \nknowledge, farmers’ \nknowledge, traditional\
    \ ecological knowledge, \nethnoscience, folk knowledge, rural knowledge and indigenous\
    \ science. \nAlthough these terms may have different connotations, they are used\
    \ \ninterchangeably throughout the literature (Nyota & Mapara, 2008; \nMafongoya\
    \ & Ajayi, 2017).  \n \nGenerally, indigenous knowledge evolves from long term\
    \ observations of the \nlocal environment and adapted to the specific requirements\
    \ of local people \nand conditions; involving a creative, experimental process\
    \ continuously \nintegrating external influences and internal innovations to meet\
    \ new \nconditions (Kassa & Temesgen, 2011). Some scholars have explored the \n\
    value of indigenous knowledge in natural resource management, water \nresource\
    \ management, fisheries and aquatic conservation, risk and disaster \nChapter\
    \ 1\n32\n \nmanagement, health among others (Gray & Morant, 2003; Desbiez et al.,\
    \ \n2004; Cabrera et al., 2007; David & Ploeger, 2014; Ngodigha et al., 2015).\
    \  \n \nIn this dissertation, I focus on the use of indigenous knowledge for weather\
    \ \nand seasonal climate forecasts referred to here as indigenous forecast. Here,\
    \ I \ndefine “indigenous” as native or local and “forecasting” as a prediction\
    \ of a \nfuture occurrence or condition. Indigenous forecasting techniques revolve\
    \ \naround the native ways of making predictions based on a body of knowledge\
    \ \nbuilt up by a group of people living in close contact with nature (Steiner,\
    \ \n2008; Muita et al., 2016). Before modern scientific weather and climate \n\
    forecast systems were developed, people made regular forecasts based on past \n\
    experiences and compared them to current observations (Olsson et al., 2004; \n\
    Orlove et al., 2010). Indigenous ecological indicators such as the behaviour \n\
    of insects, birds, and mammals, and positions of the sun and moon and \nassociated\
    \ shadows, wind speed and direction, cloud position and vegetation \nphysiological\
    \ changes are used as sources for local people to generate \nforecasts (Chang'a\
    \ et al., 2010).    \n \nScientific knowledge/forecast \n \nScientific knowledge\
    \ (SK) is generally referred to as “modern knowledge” \n(Ajibade & Shokemi, 2003).\
    \ This type of knowledge aims to understand and \nexplain how the natural world\
    \ works and how it got to its current state \n(Nickels, 1998). Scientific knowledge\
    \ is organized in a way that provides \ntestable explanation and predictions.\
    \ From this perspective, people are \nseparated from their environment and can,\
    \ therefore, observe from the outside \n(Settee, 2013). Scientific knowledge has\
    \ transformed the understanding and \ncontrol of the world around us, and in the\
    \ process transformed itself. \nScientific knowledge has grown to its present\
    \ state and reputation through its \napplication to different types of problems\
    \ in different fields (Ravetz, 1973) \nincluding weather and climate for society.\
    \ The advancement of the scientific \nmethod now makes it possible to provide\
    \ scientific forecast information at \ndifferent timescales to various sectors\
    \ including agriculture (Hansen, 2005). \nWeather and climate forecast generated\
    \ from SK are hereafter called \nscientific forecast. \n \nIn this dissertation,\
    \ a scientific forecast refers to the use of modern techniques \n(models and statistics)\
    \ to predict the conditions of the atmosphere for a given \nlocation and time\
    \ at different time scales. For the purposes of this study, I \nfocused on daily\
    \ and seasonal climate forecasts. \n \nGeneral introduction\n33\n \nIntegration\
    \ of indigenous and scientific knowledge  \n \nThe shift to a second generation\
    \ of climate services can benefit from \nintegrating indigenous and scientific\
    \ knowledge. It is important to \nacknowledge that different views on knowledge\
    \ integration, in general, exist.  \nBerggren et al. (2001), define knowledge\
    \ integration as a combination of \nspecialized knowledge with the aim of reaching\
    \ considerable results. \nOkhuysen & Eisenhardt (2002), define the concept of\
    \ knowledge integration \nas a process of transforming individual knowledge into\
    \ collective knowledge.  \nGenerally, indigenous and scientific knowledge presents\
    \ unique features that \nmake one different from the other, although some similarities\
    \ exist. \nAccording to Tsuji & Ho (2002), some of the differences between indigenous\
    \ \nand scientific knowledge have been overstated in literature and in most cases\
    \ \nthe assumptions for the distinctions are incorrect. For example, it is argued\
    \ \nthat indigenous knowledge is mostly holistic in nature while scientific \n\
    knowledge is a system-based approach, which is not necessarily true as some \n\
    community members possess specialized knowledge and skills (Ferguson & \nMessier,\
    \ 1997). Another dichotomy is that unlike scientific knowledge which \nis driven\
    \ by curiosity and desire to understand for the sake of understanding, \nindigenous\
    \ knowledge is obtained for the sake of survival. This difference \ncreates a\
    \ stereotypical view of indigenous knowledge, since studies have \nsuggested that\
    \ indigenous people do possess scientific curiosity, and thus \nstudy a phenomenon\
    \ that is not of only immediate practical interest (Berkes, \n1993). \n \n Agrawal\
    \ (1995), argued that there are no real differences between indigenous \nand scientific\
    \ knowledge, and rather the accepted differences are political \nrather than epistemic\
    \ factors. Table A2 in the supplementary material details \nsome distinct characteristics\
    \ and similarities of both indigenous and scientific \nforecast. The similarities\
    \ make it easier to see how the knowledge from both \nsystems can be combined\
    \ to create a better understanding of the natural world \n(Tsuji & Ho, 2002).\
    \ It is important to note that the debate about integrating \nindigenous and scientific\
    \ knowledge is not new. Scientists have always \nrecognised the fact that their\
    \ work is a conscious and critical revision of \nindigenous knowledge, often considered\
    \ superstitious (Rist et al., 2006). It is \ntherefore not surprising that several\
    \ scholars have called for ways to \nharmonise both knowledge systems for the\
    \ benefit of society (Gagnon & \nBerteaux, 2009; Ziervogel & Opere, 2010; Plotz\
    \ et al., 2017). \n \nFollowing the above discussion, I operationalised the concept\
    \ of knowledge \nintegration as a collective process of synthesising or combining\
    \ specialized \nChapter 1\n34\n \nyet differentiated indigenous and scientific\
    \ knowledge possessed by farmers \nand scientists into a common knowledge that\
    \ is efficient, flexible and within \nscope to improve farm decision making. \
    \ However, both indigenous and \nscientific forecasts have benefits and limitations,\
    \ and integrating them can \nproduce forecasts information that is reliable and\
    \ acceptable among farmers. \nHere, reliability refers to a forecast that is timely\
    \ provided, accurate or skilful \nin its value and locally relevant for farmers’\
    \ decision making.  Acceptability \nrefers to a forecast that is trusted and used\
    \ by farmers. \n \n1.4 Research Objective and questions \n \nGiven the extent\
    \ of the many issues raised in the previous sections (1.1, 1.2 \nand 1.3) of this\
    \ chapter, it is clear that weather and seasonal climate \ninformation plays a\
    \ significant role in shaping agriculture in Ghana. I \nidentified three main\
    \ knowledge gaps that are central to this dissertation:  \n \n1. There is limited\
    \ knowledge on socio-ecological issues that has the \npotential to hinder (or\
    \ promote) climate information services for \nfarmers.  \n \n2. There is a mismatch\
    \ between forecast information provided and \nfarmers’ information needs.  \n\
    \ \n3. There is limited knowledge on how to integrate indigenous knowledge \n\
    with scientific knowledge to improve forecast reliability and \nacceptability.\
    \  \n \nThese knowledge gaps have hampered the development of second generation\
    \ \nof climate services in Ghana. This PhD research aimed to address the \nknowledge\
    \ gaps mentioned above. Therefore, the objective of this \ndissertation was: \
    \ \n \nTo improve climate services in Ghana through co-production by integrating\
    \ \nscientific and indigenous forecasts to support farm decision making. \n \n\
    \ The results of this dissertation will serve as an important building block to\
    \ \nformulate strategic ways to improve climate services in Ghana, and in doing\
    \ \nso potentially help alleviate food insecurity while increasing farmers’ \n\
    economic status. This dissertation also contributes to the literature on \nintegrating\
    \ indigenous and scientific forecast and, more specifically, to the \nresearch\
    \ on co-production of climate services. Moreover, the use of citizen \nGeneral\
    \ introduction\n35\n \nscience to collect and handle indigenous forecast and observed\
    \ rainfall \nprovides insights that can be used for future engagement of citizens\
    \ in the \nfield of meteorology and atmospheric science.  \n \nThe overarching\
    \ research question therefore is;  \n \nHow can climate information services be\
    \ improved through the co-production \nof farmers and scientist?    \n \nOut of\
    \ the overarching question I formulated the following five research \nquestions\
    \ using Northern Ghana as a case: \n \nRQ1. What is the potential of climate information\
    \ services to support rice \nfarming systems? (Chapter 2) \n \nThis research question\
    \ aims to diagnose the core problems in the study area \nand position these problems\
    \ within the context of climate variability and \nchange. The question helps explore\
    \ the empirical evidence for both \nbiophysical and societal-institutional issues\
    \ necessary for developing a \nsecond generation climate service. It further helps\
    \ to reveal how farmers \nexperience and give meaning to these problems as well\
    \ as the ways in which \nthe problems are currently been dealt with. Ultimately,\
    \ this question helps to \nidentify and refine the challenges as well as to reflect\
    \ and re-examine the \nfeasibility of the initial climate service. Answers to\
    \ this question suggest ways \nto improve both the design and implementation of\
    \ the second generation \nclimate service. \n \nRQ2. How successful can seasonal\
    \ climate forecast meet farmers’ \ninformation needs? (Chapter 3) \n \nThis question\
    \ aims to first identify specific weather and seasonal climate \ninformation needs\
    \ of farmers and to ascertain whether the state-of-the-art \nseasonal climate\
    \ forecast models have enough skills to meet these needs.  In \nthis regard, I\
    \ identify which information is more important to farmers and \nwhen they require\
    \ such information for decision making. Also, the spatial and \ntemporal performance\
    \ of seasonal climate forecast is determined. Answers to \nthis question help\
    \ to develop a demand driven climate service that is \nacceptable and used by\
    \ the end-users. \n \nRQ3. What are the skills of indigenous and scientific forecasts\
    \ to promote \neffective climate services? (Chapter 4) \nChapter 1\n36\n \n \n\
    The essence of this question is to determine the performance of indigenous \n\
    and scientific forecast in the study area. I examine how indigenous forecast is\
    \ \ngenerated and its accuracy for climate service. The accuracy of the scientific\
    \ \nforecast is also determined. Answers to this question provided confidence\
    \ and \nserve as a foundation for integrating indigenous and scientific forecast.\
    \  \n \nRQ4. Can the integration of indigenous and scientific forecast improve\
    \ \nreliability and acceptability of climate information services? (Chapter 5)\
    \ \n \nThis research question guides the process of testing the possibility of\
    \ \nquantitatively integrating indigenous and scientific forecast. The process\
    \ \nresults in a proposed integrated probability forecast method. Further, I \n\
    investigate the skills in the indigenous and scientific forecast and examine the\
    \ \nvalue of integrating them to improving forecast accuracy and acceptability\
    \ \namong farmers. Insights from this question play an important role in further\
    \ \ndiscussions on the integration of indigenous and scientific forecast for \n\
    weather and climate services.  \n \nRQ5. How do weather and climate information\
    \ influence farmers’ decision \nmaking? (Chapter 6) \n \nThis research question\
    \ aims to unravel the practicality of how end-users \n(farmers) use the different\
    \ kinds of forecast information given to them. In \nparticular, the question helped\
    \ to determine the decision dynamics of farmers \ngiven forecast with different\
    \ forecast probabilities and lead-times. This \nprovides evidence of potential\
    \ forecast usage and value for decision making. \nThe insights obtained from this\
    \ question will help the design of climate \nservices in a manner that they become\
    \ more actionable.  \n \n1.5 Methodology  \n1.5.1 Study Area  \n \nThis study\
    \ was conducted in the Kumbungu district of the Northern region of \nGhana (see\
    \ figure 1.2). Agricultural production in the area is already \nnegatively affected\
    \ by the climatic conditions with six to seven months dry \nseason and five months\
    \ rainy season (April/May to September/October) \n(Barry et al., 2005; Amikuzuno\
    \ & Donkoh, 2012). The northern region of \nGhana, including the Kumbungu district,\
    \ is a tropical Savannah zone with a \nsingle rainfall season (Boogaard et al.,\
    \ 2012; Alhassan et al., 2013). \nAccording to Owusu & Waylen (2009), by 2050\
    \ the region is projected to \nGeneral introduction\n37\n \nexperience an increase\
    \ in rainfall intensity with a decrease in rainfall \nfrequency in addition to\
    \ increasing temperatures. As a result, crop yields are \nlikely to reduce, thereby\
    \ having a negative impact on food security in the \nregion (Antwi-Agyei et al.,\
    \ 2012).  \n \nThis dissertation focuses on rice farming for two main reasons.\
    \ First, demand \nfor rice has steadily increased but with limited growth in supply,\
    \ resulting in \nhigh importation of rice up to an average of USD 450 Million\
    \ annually \n(MOFA, 2009; CARD, 2010; Angelucci et al., 2019). This is projected\
    \ to \nincrease even further as a result of economic growth, and impacts of climate\
    \ \nchange on future crop yields. Secondly, compared to other crops in Ghana \n\
    rice will be severely hit by climate variability and change because of the \n\
    projected water scarcity and over reliance on unpredictable rainfall (Asante \n\
    & Amuakwa-Mensah, 2015b). Therefore, Ghanaian policy makers are \nconcerned about\
    \ increasing production, allowing smallholder farmers \nespecially those in Northern\
    \ Ghana to shift attention to rice production. \n \nRice production takes place\
    \ in all the ten regions of Ghana, yet the northern \nregion is ranked as highest\
    \ in terms of production per region (Angelucci et \nal., 2019). According to Donkoh\
    \ et al., (2010) rice production has an \nenormous potential in reducing poverty\
    \ levels in Northern Ghana. Rice \nproduction just like other crops in Ghana is\
    \ cultivated by smallholder farmers, \nwith most of them having farms of less\
    \ than one hectare in size (Angelucci et \nal., 2019) and have limited access\
    \ to climate information to manage their farm \nrisk (Ndamani & Watanabe, 2013).\
    \  \n \nThe Bontanga irrigation scheme in the Kumbungu District where most of\
    \ this \nresearch was carried out is a decentralised irrigation scheme managed\
    \ by \ncommunities at local level. The district has a total population of roughly\
    \ \nthirty-nine thousand (50% males and 50% females). About 95% of \nhouseholds\
    \ in the District are engaged in agriculture and 98% thereof are \ninvolved in\
    \ crop farming. A large part of the district is rural with about 26% \nbeing literate\
    \ and 74% non-literate (GSS, 2014).  \n \nThe area has one of the most prominent\
    \ and largest gravity-fed public \nirrigation schemes in the country, the Bontanga.\
    \ This is built on the tributaries \nof the White Volta River with an irrigable\
    \ area of up to 570 ha and a total \nwater requirement of 11 million m3 per annum.\
    \ The scheme has 525 farmers \nfrom 13 different communities with an average landholding\
    \ of about 0.6 ha \nper farmer. There are also a number of small scale irrigation\
    \ systems in the \narea (WRCG, 2008). These small-scale reservoirs and large scale\
    \ irrigation \nChapter 1\n38\n \nsystems were developed to support agriculture\
    \ production against climate \nvariability (Faulkner et al., 2008; Amisigo et\
    \ al., 2015). In this area, there are \nthree different groups of farmers (i.e.\
    \ those into irrigated rice production only, \nrainfed only, and both irrigated\
    \ and rainfed rice production) to be considered \nin the study. \n \n \n \nFigure\
    \ 1.2: Map of Study Area: panel “A” shows the location of Ghana in \nWest Africa.\
    \ “B” shows the map of Ghana (with annual average rainfall from \n1981-2010) indicating\
    \ the location of Northern region and Kumbungu \ndistrict. “C” shows the detailed\
    \ map of Kumbungu district. The seasonal \nforecast verification in chapter 3\
    \ covered the entire Northern region. All other \nresearch activity was carried\
    \ out in Kumbungu district.  \nNB: As at January 2019, the regions of Ghana were\
    \ further divided and the \nnumber changed from 10 to 16 regions (See Figure A1\
    \ for the map of Ghana \nshowing the new regional divisions). Yet for consistency\
    \ of the chapters we \nmaintain this map  \n \n \nGeneral introduction\n39\n \n\
    1.5.2 Research Design \n \nThis dissertation uses a multi-method approach to explore\
    \ the possibility of \nmaking weather and seasonal climate forecast information\
    \ useful for decision \nmaking in rice farming systems. This research design allowed\
    \ the exploration \nof both the theoretical and empirical perspectives on the\
    \ main research \nobjective. The research is designed in an iterative manner with\
    \ the outcome \nof each research question informing the next (see figure 1.3).\
    \ Here, I describe \nin summary the framework of methods and techniques used to\
    \ answer the \ndifferent research questions. Since each dissertation contains\
    \ published or \nsubmitted articles, each chapter has specific sections that explain\
    \ the method \nused in more detail. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\
    \ \nChapter 1\n40\n \n \nFigure 1.3: Schematic representation of methodological\
    \ framework \n \nGeneral introduction\n41\n \nMulti-method research design is\
    \ a methodology for collecting, analysing and \nintegrating quantitative and qualitative\
    \ research methods to provide a better \nunderstanding of the research problem\
    \ than either of each alone (Greene et al, \n1989). Creswell (2003), indicated\
    \ that the choice for each method in multi-\nmethod research design is based on\
    \ ‘what works’ and which research \nquestions are addressed. Therefore, the research\
    \ design as used in this \ndissertation incorporates a mix of quantitative and\
    \ qualitative methods in the \nstages of the study to answer the overall research\
    \ question. This is done for \nseveral reasons. \nFirst, multi-methods are appropriate\
    \ for applied research because it has a \ncomplementary value that tries to neutralize\
    \ the weakness of each method \n(Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2007; Brewer & Hunter,\
    \ 2012). For instance, in \nRQ1, I used literature review, expert interviews,\
    \ focus group discussion, and \na feedback workshop to assess and establish the\
    \ core socio-ecological issues \nfarmers perceive as key challenges that require\
    \ the development of weather \nand seasonal climate information services. Each\
    \ method was used to collect \ndata that complement the other and allowed me to\
    \ check the accuracy and \ncomprehensiveness of the other data collected.  \n\
    \ \nSecond, the methods adopted enhance understanding and provide insight into\
    \ \ncomplex problems while confirming and informing the choice of next method\
    \ \nin the same study (Brewer & Hunter, 2012; Byrne and Humble, 2007). For \n\
    example, in RQ2, qualitative methods (interviews) were used to initially \nassess\
    \ farmers’ information needs which informed which forecast lead times \nto select\
    \ for the performance assessment of seasonal forecast using \nquantitative methods\
    \ (i.e. forecast verification methods). \n \nThird, the complexity of climate\
    \ variability and change on social systems \nrequires that different methods are\
    \ employed to understand these \ncomplexities (Byrne & Humble, 2007) and in doing\
    \ so, increase confidence \nin the validity of the findings (Onwuegbuzie et al.,\
    \ 2011). Therefore, due to \nthe complex nature of the problem and the interdisciplinary\
    \ nature of the \nstudy, I employed different methods for different aspect and\
    \ stages of the \nstudy depending on their suitability.  In RQ3, for example,\
    \ I used qualitative \nmethods (workshop and interviews) to identify the indigenous\
    \ ecological \nindicators farmers use for forecasting and explored the techniques\
    \ behind \nindigenous forecast while using the quantitative method (forecast verification\
    \ \nmethods) to evaluate the performance of both indigenous and scientific \n\
    weather and seasonal climate forecast data. Similarly, in RQ4, I utilized \nquantitative\
    \ methods (weighted arithmetic mean and forecast verification \nmethods) to integrate,\
    \ validate and estimate the reliability of integrated \nChapter 1\n42\n \nforecast\
    \ compared to indigenous and scientific forecasts. I also used a \nqualitative\
    \ method (interviews) to evaluate the acceptability of the three \nforecasts among\
    \ farmers. To answer RQ5, I employed visually facilitated \nscenario workshop\
    \ as a method for testing the impact of forecast probabilities \nand lead times\
    \ on farmers’ decision making.   \n \nFinally, employing the multi-method research\
    \ design allowed for the \nexploration of different perspectives that will lead\
    \ to a more complete \nunderstanding and explanation of claims for reliable and\
    \ acceptable forecast \ninformation that is useful for farmers.  \n \n1.6 Structure\
    \ of the dissertation \n \nThis dissertation has seven chapters (Figure 1.5).\
    \ Following a general \nintroduction, the main body of this dissertation consists\
    \ of five chapters made \nup of papers, which are either published or submitted\
    \ to academic journals. \n \n \nFigure 1.4: Dissertation structure showing the\

    \ of how farmers \nuse indigenous ecological indicators to forecast rainfall at\

    \ \n2.1 Introduction \n \nDue to increased anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions,\
    \ the global \ntemperatures are rising with a change in the global water cycle\
    \ resulting in \nmore erratic precipitation patterns. Consequently, both soil\
    \ and surface water \navailability is becoming less reliable (IPCC, 2014). This\
    \ increased climate \nvariability is affecting smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan\
    \ Africa. Currently, \nmore than 600 million people in rural communities in sub-Saharan\
    \ Africa \ndepend on agriculture for their livelihoods (Rockström et al., 2014).\
    \ Many \nfarmers are struggling to cope with challenging conditions, which result\
    \ in \nlow yields and food insecurity (Falco et al., 2011). One of the main problems\
    \ \nfor food production in Africa is large-scale climate variability. Both inter-\n\
    annual and seasonal rainfall variability are a challenge for farming decision-\n\
    making in Sub-Saharan Africa. Future climate change caused by increased \ngreenhouse\
    \ gas emissions are likely to result in changing rainfall patterns. \n \nSimilar\
    \ to other countries within Guinea and Sudan Savanna agro-ecological \nzones,\
    \ Ghana is vulnerable to climate variability and change (Africa \nPartnership\
    \ Forum, 2007). The agricultural sector depends heavily on rainfall \nthat varies\
    \ annually and seasonally. This significantly affects soil water \navailability\
    \ for crops and increases the risks for low crop production and \nfailure (Jung\
    \ & Kunstmann, 2007; Asante & Amuakwa-Mensah, 2015). \nMeanwhile, the agriculture\
    \ sector is very important for the economy of \nGhana, employing 44% of the work-force\
    \ and accounts for nearly one-quarter \nof GDP(CIA, 2012). The degree of community\
    \ vulnerability and crop failure \nis greatest in its three northern regions,\
    \ namely Upper East, Upper West, and \nthe Northern region. Farmers in these regions\
    \ are faced with many \nuncertainties prior to every growing season, most of which\
    \ are attributed to \nwater and climate variability (Gbetibouo et al., 2017).\
    \ \n \nDue to increasing climate variability farmers struggle about decisions\
    \ such as \nseed variety to plant, when to plant, when to fertilize, when to do\
    \ \nsupplementary irrigation and sometimes when to harvest. According to \nNdamani\
    \ & Watanabe (2013), a farmer usually starts to make preparations \nfor planting\
    \ crops with the onset of the rainy season. After months of drought, \nthe soil\
    \ is dry and hard. In the month of May, the farmer starts to look into \nthe sky\
    \ every day expecting the first rain clouds to appear, which would \nindicate\
    \ the beginning of the major production season. When the rain finally \ncomes,\
    \ the farmer starts to plough his land and plants his crops. But his mind \nis\
    \ filled with worry. How much rain will there be this year? Will there be \nanother\
    \ dry spell shortly after the first rain, which could destroy the seedlings? \n\
    Chapter 2\n48\n \nWould it be better to wait and start seeding later? He recalls,\
    \ however, that \ntwo years ago, there was no dry period in May and heavy rain\
    \ washed away \nthe seeds that he had planted too late. \n \nFinding solution\
    \ to these dilemmas of a typical farmer is vital and urgent. \nSeveral studies\
    \ have predicted the future climate of Ghana to be more variable \nand uncertain,\
    \ making the agriculture sector more vulnerable (WRC, 2010; \nObuobie et al.,\
    \ 2012; Kankam-Yeboah et al., 2013). Recent progress in \nclimate modeling has\
    \ increased the ability to predict rainfall from a few days \nto seasonal forecasts(Njau,\
    \ 2010). Being able to predict the weather and \nclimate especially rainfall is\
    \ indispensable for guiding water users, especially \nfarmers in their planning\
    \ and decision making (Logah et al., 2013). Empirical \nstudies have shown that\
    \ climate forecasts can help farmers reduce their \nvulnerability to drought and\
    \ climate extremes, while also allowing them to \nmaximize opportunities when\
    \ favourable conditions are predicted \n(Rosenzweig et al.,  2001; Patt et al.,\
    \ 2005; Roncoli et al., 2009; Crane et al., \n2010). \n \nThe underlying assumption\
    \ in the current practices of hydro-climatic \ninformation services is that if\
    \ we provide the farmer with more and better \ninformation, they would be able\
    \ to improve their farming practices (Okello et \nal., 2012; Anoop et al., 2015;\
    \ Etwire et al., 2017). This one-directional model \nof providing climate services\
    \ has shown to be flawed, as farmers tend not to \ntrust scientific information\
    \ and experience difficulties in interpreting and \nusing it. They are therefore\
    \ confident that their indigenous systems work \nbetter (McNew, et al., 1991;\
    \ Hartmann et al., 1999; Letson et al., 2001). \nEfforts to train farmers to adopt\
    \ this model of providing climate services \ngenerally fail to improve the uptake\
    \ of climate information (Manyanhaire & \nChitura, 2015; Patt & Gwata, 2002),\
    \ because providers also have little \nunderstanding of users, and what drives\
    \ the influence of indigenous forecasts \n(Artikov et al., 2006). \n \nWe, however,\
    \ argue that science should not be a one-directional effort, where \nscience produces\
    \ new knowledge and information and makes it accessible for \nend-users. Instead,\
    \ the process should be interactive, where science and \npractice co-design, co-create\
    \ and co-produce knowledge by bringing in \ndifferent forms of expertise. The\
    \ latter would result in a better appreciation of \nthe scientific expertise as\
    \ well as indigenous knowledge necessary to improve \nsocietal resilience to climate\
    \ change (Hiwasaki et al., 2014; Mazzocchi, \n2006). Increasingly there are calls\
    \ for involving farmers not only as end-user, \nPotential of hydro-climatic information\
    \ services to support rice farming\n49\n \nbut as an active participant who is\
    \ not only involved in the use of the \ninformation, but also in the creation\
    \ of it. \n \nEnvironmental Virtual Observatories (EVOs) aim to enable cross fertilization\
    \ \nof different sources of environmental knowledge on web based virtual \nplatforms,\
    \ incorporating information gathering, processing and dissemination \ntechnologies\
    \ (Karpouzoglou et al., 2016). The first generations of these \nsystems aimed\
    \ to support the scientific process of knowledge creation and \nmainly targeted\
    \ scientific audiences. They failed to deliver a strong \nknowledge creation component\
    \ especially in information generation and \ndissemination projects that seek\
    \ to empower local communities to manage \ntheir environmental change using actionable\
    \ knowledge (Dewulf et al., 2005). \nHence, several authors have proposed second\
    \ generation EVOs that \nemphasize knowledge co-creation between scientists and\
    \ societal actors, and \nbidirectional information flows, so as to create actionable\
    \ knowledge that can \nsupport decision-making (Karpouzoglou et al., 2016). However,\
    \ these \nsystems are place based and context sensitive, requiring a thorough\
    \ \nunderstanding of the potential to uptake co-develop, co-produce and co-\n\
    implement such hydro-climatic information systems. \n \nAs part of a larger endeavour,\
    \ we aim to design a “second generation” \ninformation system in the form of a\
    \ hydro-climatic information system called \na hydro-climatic Environmental Virtual\
    \ Observatory. This system will use \ndata from the scientific seasonal climate\
    \ forecast ECMWF-4 (European \nCentre \nfor \nMedium-Range \nWeather \nForecasts-system\
    \ \n4) \nmodel, \ncomplemented with farmers indigenous forecast collected through\
    \ citizen \nscience (Pettibone et al., 2016) to generate actionable knowledge\
    \ for adaptive \ndecision making in rice farming systems. Karpouzoglou et al.\
    \ (2016) indicate \nthat in the context of emerging open-technologies for information\
    \ exchange, \nadded value can be achieved by removing institutional and geographical\
    \ \nbarriers associated with information flow. \n \nIn this paper, we aim to diagnose\
    \ the socio-ecological settings of rice farming \nsystems in northern Ghana in\
    \ the context of climate variability and change to \nensure effective design and\
    \ operationalisation of hydroclimatic EVO. We first \nconduct a diagnosis of the\
    \ socio-ecological settings of the rice production \nsystem in Northern Ghana\
    \ in the context of climate variability and change. In \nthe next step, we elaborate\
    \ the diagnostics by focused on hydro-climatic \ninformation needs and use in\
    \ rice based farming systems. Based on these \ndiagnostic steps, we identify the\
    \ specific challenges and opportunities \nidentified in our case region, which\
    \ could be meaningfully addressed by a \nChapter 2\n50\n \npotential EVO. We used\
    \ the four dimensions of Responsible Innovation to \nreflect on the robustness\
    \ of the design and processes of hydro-climatic EVO \nto deal with the challenges\
    \ and opportunities faced in a responsible way. The \noutcome of our study is\
    \ a framework for the hydro-climatic EVO outlining \nits properties and processes.\
    \ \n \n2.2 Conceptual framework \n \nStudies show that crop management strategies\
    \ of farmers (e.g. timing of \nplanting, weeding, fertilizing, application of\
    \ pesticides) are shaped by \npredictive weather/climate information. Traditionally\
    \ farmers make use of \nindigenous knowledge to produce seasonal and weather forecast\
    \ (Svotwa et \nal., 2007). Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) is known by\
    \ a wide \nvariety of terms, including indigenous knowledge (IK), local knowledge\
    \ (LK) \nand traditional knowledge (TK). It has many definitions and there is\
    \ no \nconsensus on an operational definition applicable across disciplines. \n\
    Huntington et al., (2004) for example, understands TEK as ‘…the knowledge \nand\
    \ insights acquired through extensive observations of an area or species’ \n(Huntington\
    \ et al., 2004). In contrast Berkes et al., (1995) in an attempt to \nmore fully\
    \ incorporate indigenous world views, broadens the scope of TEK \nand define it\
    \ as ‘…a cumulative body of knowledge, practice, and belief, \nevolving by adaptive\
    \ processes and handed down through generations by \ncultural transmission, about\
    \ the relationship of living beings (including \nhumans) with one another and\
    \ with their environment (Berkes et al., 1995). \nIn the context of this study,\
    \ the emphasis is placed on “indigenous”, which is \ndefined as native or local\
    \ knowledge that is passed on from generation to \ngeneration. Such knowledge\
    \ is used for “forecasting”, i.e. the prediction of a \nfuture occurrence or condition\
    \ (Nation, 2017). Indigenous forecasts are based \non farmers’ experience of changes\
    \ in certain biophysical indicators. Literature \nshows that African farmers are\
    \ using various local weather indicators such as \nplants, animals, insects, the\
    \ solar system and wind in predicting the weather \nand climate (Roncoli et al.,\
    \ 2002; Speranza et al., 2010; Tarhule & Lamb, \n2003; Ziervogel & Opere, 2010).\
    \ Studies have therefore suggested that \nparticularly in Africa indigenous knowledge\
    \ has the potential to enhance \nfarmers’ adaptation to climate variability and\
    \ change ( Mikkelsen & Langohr, \n2004; Naess, 2013; Derbile et al., 2016). However,\
    \ it is plausible that \nindigenous knowledge is not sufficient anymore because\
    \ of projected climate \nchange. \n \nIncreasingly, scientific projections are\
    \ developed to further inform farmers \nabout short, medium and long-term climate\
    \ variability and change, \nPotential of hydro-climatic information services to\
    \ support rice farming\n51\n \nparticularly for rainfall. It is important, however,\
    \ to acknowledge that weather \nand climate forecast systems have limited value\
    \ unless they can directly \ninfluence decisions and have an impact on the systems\
    \ under consideration \n(Hammer, 2000). (Manyanhaire & Chitura, 2015) argue for\
    \ the integration of \nindigenous knowledge systems with climate change science\
    \ as a basis for \ncomprehensive community based response to the impacts of climate\
    \ change. \nIt is argued that farmers are more likely to adopt new ideas when\
    \ these can be \nseen in the context of their existing practices. Patt and Gwata\
    \ (2002) for \nexample observed that farmers’ willingness to use seasonal climate\
    \ forecasts \nincreased when the forecasts presented are combined and compared\
    \ with local \nindigenous forecasts. \n \nAs indicated in the introduction, creating\
    \ conditions that allow for knowledge \nexchange between scientists, decision-makers\
    \ and citizens is becoming \nincreasingly necessary for building resilience and\
    \ responding to \nenvironmental change (Mol, 2006; Folke et al., 2010; Buytaert\
    \ et al., 2014; \nUN, 2014). The concept of Environmental Virtual Observatories\
    \ (EVOs) \noffers the opportunity to bring together scientific and indigenous\
    \ knowledge \n(Karpouzoglou et al., 2016). Examples of the first generation of\
    \ these EVOs \nare (Wilkinson et al., 2015) for communicating flood risk to catchment\
    \ \nstakeholders and cloud technology for connecting and integrating fragmented\
    \ \ndata, models, and tools to deliver new holistic approaches to environmental\
    \ \nchallenges (Emmett et al., 2014). They have paid less emphasis on how \nenhanced\
    \ participation of a variety of users can be achieved via a virtual \nplatform.\
    \ In many cases, projects that seek to generate and disseminate \ninformation\
    \ that provides actionable knowledge for empowering local \ncommunities and enhancing\
    \ environmental management, for example, have \nachieved limited success (Dewulf\
    \ et al., 2005). \n \nDespite considerable progress in recent years, many cases\
    \ exist where \nknowledge and perspectives of certain groups of people are either\
    \ not \nincluded or under represented (Karpouzoglou et al., 2016). This is particularly\
    \ \nchallenging for EVOs that exist on the interface between scientists and non-\n\
    expert users. Similarly, most of the first generation EVO’s are developed and\
    \ \ncommunicated, using mostly top down approaches. For example, local \nfarmers\
    \ are considered as end users of forecast products developed by \nscientist from\
    \ universities and or research institutions. In most cases, farmers \ndo not contribute\
    \ to the process of developing weather and climate forecast \nproducts (Ouédraogo\
    \ et al., 2015).  As a result, the communicated forecasts \nare often not locally\
    \ specific or applicable and therefore contribute to limited \nChapter 2\n52\n\
    \ \naction. Second generation EVOs seek to resolve this problem by enhancing \n\
    the participation of all relevant stakeholders. \n \nWhile first generation EVOs\
    \ are primed for scientists, second generation \nEVOs have a benefit to include\
    \ knowledge co-creation and resilience through \ntheir participatory design. Second\
    \ generation EVOs such as those proposed \nby Karpouzoglou et al. (2016) have\
    \ a stronger focus on the processes of \nknowledge co-creation and interaction\
    \ between stakeholders. An important \naspect of this knowledge co-creation EVO\
    \ is its potential to achieve greater \nrelevance by engaging with stakeholders.\
    \ In some cases, citizens become \nactive contributors to science (Buytaert et\
    \ al., 2014) and EVO’s offer the \npossibility to connect scientist and local\
    \ farmers via a virtual platform where \ninformation is exchanged and knowledge\
    \ created to support farm decision-\nmaking. Active engagement of farmers can\
    \ range from short-term collection \nof data to intensive engagement in creating\
    \ new knowledge with scientists \nand/or other volunteers (Pettibone et al., 2016).\
    \ \n \nIntroducing new innovations such as EVO’s should be undertaken \nresponsibly,\
    \ especially when directed at socially desirable and socially \nacceptable ends\
    \ (Stilgoe et al., 2013). Designing these EVOs responsibly \nmeans acknowledging\
    \ that such frameworks are not only technical but are \nalso socially and politically\
    \ constituted(Carpenter & Winner, 1978). \nInnovative technologies that underlie\
    \ EVO’s might have great benefits for \nsociety, but unforeseen impacts are not\
    \ just possible but probable. To guide \nthe design and evaluation of our EVO,\
    \ we build onto the responsible \ninnovation concept. We make use of the responsible\
    \ innovation (RI) \nframework of Stilgoe et al. (2013) which provides a set of\
    \ basic principles \nthat seek to maintain novelty and at the same time make it\
    \ responsible: \nanticipation, reflexivity, inclusion, and responsiveness. Anticipation\
    \ requires \nthat researchers and organizations continuously ask ‘what if?’ questions,\
    \ \nwhich include but not limited to what are the likely consequences? What are\
    \ \nthe possible unintended effects? It requires projection and futuristic thinking\
    \ \nin a systematic way and consideration of how the EVO is predictable and \n\
    resilient to change. \n \nFor example, it provides early warnings of future unfavourable\
    \ consequences \nand estimates risk-based harm of innovations (Hoffmann-Riem &\
    \ Wynne, \n2002; EEA, 2001, 2013). The second dimension, reflexivity, refers to\
    \ the \nprinciple that institutions and organizations must reflect on their activities\
    \ and \nassumptions and acknowledge that the knowledge they produce and use has\
    \ \nlimitations. How they frame issues may not be universally applicable and \n\
    Potential of hydro-climatic information services to support rice farming\n53\n\
    \ \nwithout reflexivity may lead to frame conflicts or unresponsiveness of \n\
    stakeholders (Wynne, 1993; Stilgoe et al., 2013). The third dimension, \ninclusion,\
    \ refers to the need to involve minorities and groups without a voice \nin the\
    \ innovation process (Felt, 2009; Hajer, 2009; Stilgoe et al., 2013). \nWhereas\
    \ the first generation of EVO’s placed limited emphasis on \nstakeholder involvement,\
    \ responsible innovation requires active involvement \nof different groups through\
    \ dialogue and representation throughout the \ninnovation process. The dimension\
    \ of responsiveness as proposed by Stilgoe \net al. (2013) requires that systems\
    \ of innovation have the capacity to change \nor shape direction in response to\
    \ stakeholder and public values and changing \ncircumstances. Also in this article,\
    \ we use the framework to evaluate the \nproposed hydro-climatic EVO. \n \n2.3\
    \ Methodology \n \nIn this paper, we address the following research question:\
    \ How will the \nexisting socio-ecological setting in rice production systems\
    \ in Northern \nGhana promote or hinder a possible hydroclimatic EVO design and\
    \ \noperationalisation? To diagnose our case region and analyze the potential\
    \ for \ndesigning a new EVO, the study adopts a systematic approach involving\
    \ five \nsequential steps (see Figure 2. 1). We gathered data from both primary\
    \ and \nsecondary sources using qualitative methods of data collection and analysis.\
    \ \n \nFigure. 2.1: Workflow of the study \n \nChapter 2\n54\n \n2.3.1 Data collection\
    \ \n \nTo collect data, we made use of three qualitative methods: content analysis\
    \ of \nexisting documents, interviews, and focus group discussions. The selection\
    \ of \nmethods provided us insight into the socio-ecological context of the case\
    \ \nstudy, information needs and use as well as the challenges of existing systems\
    \ \nand opportunities for the development of a hydro-climatic EVO. \n \na)  Research\
    \ literature and documents analysis \n \nWe collected policy documents, donor\
    \ agency reports, scientific research \narticles and research reports from related\
    \ projects and programs by going \nthrough government and non-governmental organizations’\
    \ websites and \nonline repositories. We specifically focused on analysing local\
    \ governance \nand institutional documents containing rules, structures and arrangements\
    \ \nabout farming, irrigation and water use in Northern Ghana to gain a thorough\
    \ \nunderstanding of the decision-making context and practices. The data \ncollected\
    \ helped us also to guide the interviews. \n \nb)  Interviews \n \nWe informally\
    \ engaged in an open conversation with fifteen (15) practitioners \nfrom nine\
    \ different organizations (Table 1). To allow the discussion to move \nin the\
    \ direction preferred by the practitioners, we opted not to use a structured \n\
    interview guide, but rather semi-structured the conversations along topics \n\
    emerging from the document analysis. The informal setting allowed \nrespondents\
    \ to speak more freely and openly about their experiences and \nhelped in building\
    \ relationships for future collaborations. \n \nThe practitioners were purposefully\
    \ selected based on their principal role \n(civil society representatives, policy\
    \ and decision makers, researchers and \nfarmer representatives) and expertise\
    \ in climate, water and farming. The \nconversation cantered on five thematic\
    \ areas: (i) perception of the climate-\nwater-food production problem in northern\
    \ Ghana; (ii) current actions taking \nby farmers and organizations to manage\
    \ these problems; (iii) farmers’ hydro-\nclimatic informational needs and use;\
    \ (iv) the value of seasonal climate \nforecast; and (v) the feasibility of hydro-climatic\
    \ EVO to ameliorate the \nchallenges. Each conversation lasted for about one hour\
    \ and the information \nwas recorded digitally and captured in a field notebook\n\

    \ the challenges farmers experienced through the \nexisting governance arrangements,\
    \ water management practices, information \nmanagement and decision-making, we\
    \ organized seven Focus Group \nDiscussions (FGDs) with farmers who were engaged\
    \ in irrigated and/or \nrainfed rice farming within the Kumbungu District. FGDs\
    \ were held at the \nfarm, community and scheme levels. Discussions at the farm\
    \ level focused on \nthe perception of farmers on problems of the climate-water-food\
    \ production \nnexus and steps taken to manage them. In addition, discussions\
    \ revolved \naround the hydro-climatic informational needs of farmers. \n \nTo\
    \ broaden the scope, the FGDs organized at the community level included \nrice\
    \ farmers, traditional leaders, political representatives and women. This \nallowed\
    \ us to discuss the place of hydroclimatic information in their farming \ncycle,\
    \ as well as the ways in which governance arrangements and decision-\nmaking processes\
    \ at the community and farm level worked. At the scheme \nlevel, similar questions\
    \ were asked to inquire on the activities of rice farmers \nwithin the Bontanga\
    \ Irrigation Scheme about governance, water management \nand how that impacted\
    \ decision-making. Participants were leaders of farmer \nassociations, the manager\
    \ and representatives of committees (see Table 2.2). \n \n2.3.2 Data analysis\
    \ \n \nLiterature and available Documents were analysed in two stages; we first\
    \ \nscanned existing literature and documents for relevant information from \n\
    empirical and theoretical perspectives. Next was a synthesis of information \n\
    Secondly, we thoroughly examined them by reading, extracting and \nsynthesising\
    \ key information from the selected literature and documents; \nbackground information\
    \ of rice farmers as well as insight into the socio-\necological settings of rice\
    \ production systems in Northern Ghana. It also \nprovided supplementary research\
    \ data on the importance of rice in the \neconomy of Ghana, historical and current\
    \ climatic variability and change in \nNorthern Ghana as well as model projections\
    \ of these changes and their \nundesirable impact on farmers (see Section 4.1a).\
    \ In addition, arrangement \nand rules governing rice farmers’ activities in Northern\
    \ Ghana and the \nmanagement framework of the irrigation schemes including existing\
    \ \nhydroclimatic information systems and their value to rice farming was \nobtained\
    \ via literature and document analysis (Section 4.1b). \n \nPotential of hydro-climatic\
    \ information services to support rice farming\n57\n \nUsing Atlas.ti (Hwang,\
    \ 2007), we used open-coding methods and clustered \nthe topics of several themes.\
    \ The analysis was aimed at first verifying our \nfindings from the literature\
    \ and document analysis to collaborate evidence \nand secondly to probe further\
    \ on arising issues such as practical challenges of \nclimate variability and\
    \ change for farmers and the potential value of hydro-\nclimatic information systems\
    \ for farmers’ adaptive decision making. \n \nFocus Group Discussions were similarly\
    \ transcribed and processed through \nthematic analysis. The analysis provided\
    \ information on the rules of \nengagement and decision making among rice farmers,\
    \ their knowledge of \nexisting hydro-climatic information services, information\
    \ access and \nutilization, challenges of institutional linkage and information\
    \ exchange at \nfarm level (see Section 4.1b and 4.2). \n \n2.4 Results \n \n\
    The section outlines the results of the diagnostic analysis (Section 4.1), and\
    \ \nthe key challenges reported by farmers (Section 4.2). \n \n2.4.1 Diagnostic\
    \ analysis of the socio-ecological system \n \nTo analyse the current setting,\
    \ we focus on rice farmers in Northern Ghana \n(Figure 2.2). We specifically explore\
    \ the socio-ecological aspects of climate \nchange impacts on crop productivity\
    \ (i.e. yield per unit area) and not 'food \nproduction', as this is dependent\
    \ on many other factors than climate change, \nsuch as quality of land, infrastructure\
    \ investment, available finance, \ninternational trade policy, and food market.\
    \ We analyse this case region by \nsplitting it into two dimensions; the biophysical\
    \ factors (climate and water) \nand socio-institutional (actors, rules, practices,\
    \ decision-making) parameters \nframing the activities of rice farmers within\
    \ the study area. \n \nChapter 2\n58\n \n \n \nFigure 2.2: Northern sector of\

    2.4.1.2 Biophysical context \n \nFrom the literature analysis and interviews,\
    \ the major The biophysical issues \nin the case area are mapped in Figure 2.3.\
    \ The main issue in the North of \nGhana (∼97,702 km² land area) is climate variability\
    \ which significantly \nimpacts agricultural productivity. Development of the\
    \ agricultural sector in \nthis region is affected by the climatic conditions,\
    \ such as the long dry season \nof about six to seven months followed by five-month\
    \ rainy season (April/May \nto September/October) usually characterized by sporadic\
    \ droughts and/or \nfloods (Barry et al., 2005; Amikuzuno, & Donkoh, 2012). Temperatures\
    \ in \nthe region are higher compared to those in the southern part of the country.\
    \ \nThe lowest maximum temperatures are around 26 °C mostly recorded in \nAugust\
    \ and the highest temperatures are between 40–42 °C recorded in March \nor April\
    \ (Mdemu et al., 2012). The climate system of Northern Ghana is \ncharacterized\
    \ by distinctive inter-annual and inter-decadal variability in \nprecipitation\
    \ and temperature (Emmanuel Nyadzi, 2016). The area is \nassociated with an erratic\
    \ unimodal rainfall of an annual sum between 400 \nand 1200 mm. Changes in the\
    \ duration of the rainy season have shortened the \nlength of the growing season,\
    \ delaying the onset of planting season in most \ncases, while dry season and\
    \ rainy season temperatures have increased by \nPotential of hydro-climatic information\
    \ services to support rice farming\n59\n \nabout 1 °C and 2 °C respectively (Acquah\
    \ & Acquah, 2011; Kunstmann & \nJung, 2005). The northern part of Ghana experiences\
    \ the greatest rainfall \nvariations and this is projected to increase along with\
    \ increasing temperature \n(2.1–2.4 °C) from 2010 to 2050 (Owusu & Waylen, 2009).\
    \ According to \nKankam-Yeboah et al. (2011), high temperatures that were previously\
    \ \nrecorded in March (peak of the dry season) are now being recorded also in\
    \ \nJanuary. In addition, the onset of the rainy season has become more difficult\
    \ \nto predict. They also indicated that in the past, the rainy season started\
    \ in April \nand ended around late September or early October. However, in recent\
    \ times, \nthe rainy season starts in June or July with extremely heavy rainfall\
    \ in \nSeptember or October. \n \nThese outcomes indicate a potential increase\
    \ in the intensity and frequency of \nextreme events, such as droughts and floods\
    \ and a consequential reduction in \nthe crop growing period with serious implications\
    \ for crop yields and food \nsecurity (Abdul-rahaman & Owusu-Sekyere, 2017; Kasei\
    \ et al., 2014). \nCurrent occurrences and long-term climate patterns create future\
    \ uncertainties \nwith serious implications for climate prediction and agricultural\
    \ productivity. \nAs re-iterated by(Antwi-Agyei et al., 2012), climate variability,\
    \ manifested at \ndifferent time scales and in different ways will significantly\
    \ impact the \nagricultural sector of Northern Ghana. \n \nIn addition, large\
    \ temporal and spatial rainfall variability results in high \nvariability in river\
    \ flow. As results, most rivers flow for only a few months a \nyear with limited\
    \ or no flow during the rest of the year (Amisigo & van de \nGiesen, 2005). The\
    \ combination of climate change, intensive land use, \npopulation growth and economic\
    \ development results in increased water \ndemand and more pressure on the available\
    \ water resources (Stanturf et al., \n2015). To cope with climate variability,\
    \ hydraulic infrastructure such as \nsmall-scale reservoirs and large scale irrigation\
    \ systems have been \nconstructed mainly for agricultural purposes (Amisigo et\
    \ al., 2015; Faulkner \net al., 2008). \n \nUncertainties related to climate variability\
    \ is a major challenge for both rain-\nfed and irrigated farmers and water managers\
    \ because to productively manage \ntheir activities, critical climate sensitive\
    \ decisions have to be taken months \nahead of a season (Asante and Amuakwa-Mensah,\
    \ 2015). Sustainability of \nrain-fed farming systems becomes a challenge with\
    \ severe impacts on crop \nyields (Acquah & Acquah, 2011; Fosu-Mensah et al.,\
    \ 2012). Not only does \nthis affect rain-fed farming, but it also has a major\
    \ toll on irrigation schemes. \nWater levels in the dry season are low making\
    \ it difficult to irrigate farmlands \nChapter 2\n60\n \nlimiting production.\
    \ Farmers have reported re-sowing of seeds due to poor \ngermination following\
    \ the delay in rains, which increases their cost of \nproduction. Irrigation water\
    \ managers rely on river discharge to decide the \nfrequency, quantity and method\
    \ of water distribution. The uncertainty \nassociated with predicting seasonal\
    \ rains and water availability puts farmers \nin a dilemma when key farming decisions\
    \ are to be made (Ndamani & \nWatanabe, 2013). \n \n \n \nFigure 2. 3: Analysis\
    \ of the main biophysical issues in Northern Ghana. \n \nIn the face of these\
    \ challenges, rice is a central crop as it accounts for 15% of \nagricultural\
    \ output and 45% of the total area used in cereal grain production \nin Ghana\
    \ (Stanturf et al., 2011). Rice is produced under irrigation, rain-fed \nlowland\
    \ and rain-fed upland systems (SARI, 2016). Studies on climate \nchange project\
    \ increasing temperatures and declining rainfall, resulting in \nreduced rice\
    \ production (e.g. Asante and Amuakwa-Mensah, 2015). In a \nstudy carried out\
    \ by Knox et al., (2012) rice is projected to experience the \nmost variations\
    \ of all studied crops, since water scarcity, and over reliance on \nunpredictable\
    \ rainfall are the major factors affecting rice production in \nNorthern Ghana\
    \ (Kranjac-Berisavljevic et al., 2003). \n \n2.4.1.2 Socio-institutional context\
    \ \n \nThe North of Ghana is divided into three administrative regions: Upper\
    \ East, \nUpper West and Northern Regions (Figure 2.2). The majority of this area\
    \ is \nlocated in the Tropical Guinea Savannah zone, with small parts (extreme\
    \ \nPotential of hydro-climatic information services to support rice farming\n\
    61\n \nnorth of the upper east and west regions) sharing border with Burkina Faso\
    \ in \nthe Sudan Savanna. The north of Ghana is the poorest part of the country\
    \ yet \nrecent reports indicate that about 80% of the economically active population\
    \ \nin this part of Ghana engages in agriculture, producing millet, guinea-corn,\
    \ \nrice, maize, groundnut, beans, and sorghum with some few others producing\
    \ \ndry season tomatoes and onions. Livestock and poultry production are also\
    \ \ncommon in the region (Ghana Statistical Service (GSS), 2014). The north of\
    \ \nGhana is generally endowed with about 20 small and large irrigation schemes.\
    \ \nRice farming periods and practices are similar across the three regions, even\
    \ \nthough there are individual preferences for different varieties depending\
    \ on \nthe aim of farming (GIDA, 2011, 2016).  \n \nGovernance in Ghana is characterised\
    \ by two main governance arrangements. \nThese are traditional and formal arrangements.\
    \ Formal governance \narrangements have been established by legal and structural\
    \ definitions \ncaptured in the constitution and other working documents dependent\
    \ on the \ncontext. Traditional governance arrangements, although ‘loosely’ framed\
    \ are \nembedded in local and community culture expressed in the form of rules,\
    \ \nnorms and beliefs (see also Myers & Fridy, 2016). In Northern Ghana, the \n\
    activities of rice farmers are informed by both governance arrangements \n(Nanedo\
    \ et al., 2014). \n \nOur engagements revealed that the Ghana Irrigation Development\
    \ Authority, \nhas the mandate of developing and managing irrigation infrastructure\
    \ (see \nalso (Namara et al., 2011). The Ghana Meteorological Agency, Water \n\
    Resource Commission and the Center for Scientific and Industrial Research \nare\
    \ also collaborative institutions in meeting information, water security and \n\
    advice on crop productivity respectively (see also Braimah et al., 2014; \nNanedo\
    \ et al., 2014). The Participatory Irrigation Management Strategy \n(Namara et\
    \ al., 2011), adopted in the 1990s has served as the framework for \nmore decentralized\
    \ management of Irrigation Schemes. At the scheme level, \nthe manager is responsible\
    \ for the daily operations of the scheme and thus \nengages farmers and leadership\
    \ of farmer associations in the drafting of \nschedules and assigning of roles\
    \ for effective water management for irrigation \npurposes. Water is thus discharged\
    \ through canals onto farmlands within \ndifferent laterals guided by agreed schedules.\
    \ The manager also coordinates \ndecisions and information exchange amongst all\
    \ actors as part of steps to \nadapt to changing conditions experienced. \n \n\
    Rainfed rice farmers operating within communities are also guided by \ntraditional\
    \ governance arrangements aimed at ensuring effective engagement \nChapter 2\n\
    62\n \nand resource use. These are in the form of rules and procedures which \n\
    community members are expected to adhere to or live by. For example, Chiefs \n\
    are custodians of lands and thus farmers who do not have family lands would \n\
    have to consult the leadership for land for farming activities. Water is also\
    \ \nperceived as a communal resource and hence farmers are expected to consider\
    \ \nthe interest of other users in the quest to meet their water needs. Chiefs\
    \ who \nare seen to have the highest authority within the community legally enforce\
    \ \ncommunal decisions. Farmers must, therefore, adhere to agreed rules even if\
    \ \nit does not satisfy their needs. \n \nIn both systems, we found the existing\
    \ governance arrangements to be faced \nwith multiple challenges limiting stakeholder\
    \ interaction and information \nexchange. For instance, information provision\
    \ through Chief is usually aimed \nat general community concerns and activities\
    \ rather than agriculture \ninformation required for farm decision-making. Most\
    \ farmers thus took the \ninitiative of obtaining information from other farmers\
    \ or platforms such as \nradio and mobile telecommunication service operators\
    \ involved in related \ninformation provision (See also Alhassan et al., 2013).\
    \ Community \nrepresentatives such as Assemblymen are not instrumental in providing\
    \ \nrelevant farm related information. Within the irrigation scheme, power play\
    \ \nand gender imbalance result in bias in engagement. Results of the focus group\
    \ \ndiscussions show that access to water was mostly characterized by power play\
    \ \nespecially during the dry season as only a few laterals upland could access\
    \ \nwater for irrigation from the dam. Thus, lands in the upland are allocated\
    \ to \ncronies of the irrigation manager, chiefs and heads of committees. Women\
    \ \nare also less represented and hence limited in accessing land and obtaining\
    \ \nrelevant information related to farm activities.  \n \nGovernance arrangements\
    \ within the scheme also put the Scheme manager in \ncharge of information directly\
    \ relevant for scheme operations. In some \ncontexts, farmers receive delayed\
    \ information relevant for decision making \ndue to inactivity on the side of\
    \ leadership. Interviews and FGDs pointed to \nweak institutional collaborations\
    \ especially on information provision and use \n(see also (Nugent, 2000). This\
    \ situation is largely attributable to negligence, \npoor leadership, weak communication\
    \ links, inadequate resources and \nlogistical challenges. For example, the Ghana\
    \ Meteorological Agency \nprovides seasonal climate information only at the start\
    \ of the season and \nmostly to radio stations and irrigation scheme managers\
    \ with little contact \nwith farmers themselves. However, wherever these contacts\
    \ exist they are \ninconsistent and generally decrease over the season. Private\
    \ operators \nproviding hydro-climatic information have limited collaboration\
    \ with the \nPotential of hydro-climatic information services to support rice\
    \ farming\n63\n \npublic sector. Thus, ESOKO, MTN and Vodafone only interact with\
    \ farmers \nwithout consideration of existing programmes and how their interventions\
    \ \ncould be embedded in them. Braimah et al. (2014) allude to complex local \n\
    socio-political issues that affect relationships within irrigation schemes. \n\
    These range from power play to gender inequalities affecting knowledge \nexchange\
    \ and resource management. \n \nInterviews also revealed that farmers take a number\
    \ of key decisions in \nmanaging changes in climatic conditions and how they affect\
    \ water \navailability and food production. These include when and how to prepare\
    \ \nfarmlands, when, what and how to plant, perform weed control, apply \nfertilizer\
    \ and harvest. Farmers adapt their decisions considering outcomes and \nwhat is\
    \ deemed appropriate in a given context (see also Ndamani and \nWatanabe, 2013).\
    \ Under irrigated rice farming, water managers lead the \ndecision process with\
    \ the design of an irrigation schedule. Farmers, however, \nare responsible for\
    \ specific decisions on their farms. Under rain-fed systems, \nthe farmer leads\
    \ the risk management process by exploring how experience \nfrom the previous\
    \ season and new knowledge or information on weather inter \nalia, water availability\
    \ in their decision-making (see also (Abdul-Razak & \nKruse, 2017). The survey\
    \ revealed that adaptive farm decisions of farmers are \ngenerally based on information\
    \ generated from indigenous and scientific \nforecasts. While farmers were quick\
    \ to acknowledge the limitations in their \npersonal forecast they, however, considered\
    \ it better for decision making than \nthe scientific forecast provided by Ghana\
    \ Meteorological Agency as this was \nperceived to be generic and not locally\
    \ specific to their community and needs \n(See also Gwenzi et al., 2016; Zuma-Netshiukhwi\
    \ et al., 2013). Information \nsystems within the study area were identified to\
    \ provide scientific forecast \ninformation whereas indigenous forecasts were\
    \ tied to farmers’ observation \nmatched with experience. For example, farmers\
    \ are able to predict the \nbeginning of the wet season and when to prepare their\
    \ fields for planting \n(Ofori-Sarpong, 2001). They base their predictions on\
    \ a set of indicators, each \nof which has different levels of reliability. The\
    \ flowering of the shea nut tree, \nmigratory patterns of birds and position of\
    \ the constellation Pleiades all help \nfarmers determine when the rainy season\
    \ is due (Benneh, 1970). They are \nable to predict the date of seasonal rainfall\
    \ onset and cessation, and whether \nthe season will receive above, below and\
    \ normal rainfall. Also, they are able \nto make daily weather predictions of\
    \ low, medium and high rainfall \n(Nyantakyi-Frimpong, 2013). In the next section,\
    \ the paper presents findings \non information systems and how they enable hydroclimatic\
    \ information \naccess and use. \n \nChapter 2\n64\n \n2.4.2. Hydro-climatic information\
    \ access and use in rice farming systems in \nNorthern Ghana \n \nThe role of\
    \ hydro-climatic information in knowledge creation, improved \nadaptation and\
    \ improved agricultural production has been highlighted in \ndifferent studies\
    \ and initiatives (Owolade & Kayode, 2012; Sam & Dzandu, \n2015). For example,\
    \ in 2014 and 2015, the Ghana Meteorological Agency in \ncollaboration with the\
    \ CGIAR and ESOKO provided weather and seasonal \nclimate information via conventional\
    \ SMS to farmers in two piloted \ncommunities (Doggoh and Bompari) in northern\
    \ Ghana (ESOKO, 2016). \nOther media such as radio and television programs are\
    \ also used to provide \nrelevant information in English and local languages (i.e.\
    \ Dagbanli, Frafra, \nGonja, Kasem etc.). \n \nIn spite of these interventions,\
    \ there are still challenges in information access \nand interpretation by farmers\
    \ who are illiterates and can’t read text and even \nliterate farmers lack the\
    \ necessary skills to understand technical information \nbecause of the format\
    \ in which they are presented. Also, the extent to which \nthose who could read\
    \ adopt the information and new knowledge received is \nconsiderably questionable\
    \ (see also Sam & Dzandu, 2015). Our inventory of \nexisting ICT and media platforms\
    \ in Ghana as shown in Table 2.1 reveals \nsome potential information transfer\
    \ models, namely radio, mobile apps, \nwebsites and conventional phone-based services\
    \ (e.g. recorded voice \nmessages and SMS texts for more literate farmers). Other\
    \ non-ICT means of \ninformation transfer include moving vans, extension officers,\
    \ water managers \nand head of farmer organizations who disseminate pertinent\
    \ information to \nfarmers. Table 2.3 provides an assessment of the strengths\

    \ aim of diagnosing how socio-ecological settings \nof rice farmers in Northern\
    \ Ghana could affect the design and \noperationalisation of a hydro-climatic EVO.\
    \ In this section, we draw on the \ninsights from our diagnostic analysis to outline\
    \ the characteristics of our \nhydro-climatic EVO. The design aims to overcome\
    \ the identified challenges \nand capitalize on opportunities identified in section\
    \ 4.2. The framework \nconsists of two main parts: the structural elements of\
    \ the framework and the \nprocesses through which it operates. We discuss the\
    \ process of designing the \nEVO through the lens of the four dimensions of RI.\
    \ \n \n2.5.1 Design features: description of the structural elements \n \nOur\
    \ diagnostics resulted in different hydro-climatic information needs, \nchallenges\
    \ and opportunities for an EVO. We propose a hydroclimatic EVO \n(Figure 2.4)\
    \ consisting of three major elements; (a) data sources, (b) data \nhandling processes,\
    \ (c) platform for information and data exchange. \n \n \nFigure 2.4: Fundamental\
    \ Architecture of second generation climate services \n(hydro-climatic EVO). \n\
    \ \n \n(a) Data sources \n \nData will be sourced from two main knowledge systems;\
    \ indigenous and \nscientific knowledge systems (see Figure 2.4). First, as explained\
    \ earlier, \nGhanaian farmers use indigenous ecological knowledge to understand\
    \ \nPotential of hydro-climatic information services to support rice farming\n\
    69\n \nweather and climate patterns in order to make decisions about crop and\
    \ \nirrigation cycles (Frimpong, 2013). Prior to every season, the EVO will \n\
    collect farmers’ seasonal forecast of rainfall onset and cessation date and, \n\
    rainfall amount and degree of temperature forecast expressed on a nominal \nscale\
    \ of below, normal or above normal. Also within the season, the EVO will \ncollect\
    \ farmers’ twenty- four (24) hours weather forecast of low, medium or \nhigh rain.\
    \ \n \nSecond, seasonal temperature and rainfall forecast data from European Centre\
    \ \nfor Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF-S4) seasonal forecasts \nsystem\
    \ 4 (Molteni et al., 2011) will be analysed to also provide same seasonal \nclimate\
    \ information on rainfall onset and cessation date, amount of rainfall \nand degree\
    \ of temperature also expressed in a nominal scale of below, normal \nand above\
    \ normal. ECMWF-S4 is a state-of-the-art seasonal ensemble \nclimate model that\
    \ provides seasonal climate forecast on daily timescale into \nseven months ahead\
    \ of time. The daily nature of the data will allow us to \nestimate daily rainfall\
    \ amount of either low, medium and high. \n \n(b) Data handling processes \n \n\
    The second element of the framework is the data handling process where \nindigenous\
    \ and scientific data are collected, processed, analysed, and \nvisualized. The\
    \ collection of data will be partly automated. The hydro-\nclimatic-EVO will offer\
    \ a platform where farmers can regularly upload their \nseasonal climate and daily\
    \ weather forecast information. This indigenous \nforecast information from farmers\
    \ will be complemented with those from the \nscientific forecast. \n \nThere are\
    \ clear differences and limitations of both data sources. However, \nseasonal\
    \ information such as rainfall onset and cessation date, above, below \nand normal\
    \ rainfall generated from the analysis of the ECMWF-S4 \ntemperature and rainfall\
    \ data will be used to complement those predicted by \nfarmers using their indigenous\
    \ knowledge. In a similar way, daily weather \ninformation such as low, medium\
    \ and high rainfall predicted by farmers will \ncomplement information estimated\
    \ from the daily data from ECMWF-S4 or \nany other weather model. There is potentially\
    \ great value in combining both \nsources of data. For example, both data sources\
    \ have an inherent value that \nwill complement the weakness exhibited by each\
    \ without substituting one for \nthe other and building on their respective strengths.\
    \ The question that remains \nis whether information from both sources will be\
    \ provided independently or \ncombined. Developing a comprehensive approach to\

    \ and weather forecast \npossess poor skills and are very coarse in \nresolution.\
    \ Information are often not \nlocation-specific and therefore farmers do \nnot\
    \ find them useful. \nWe use data from state-of-the-art ensemble forecast \nmodel\
    \ ECMWF-S4 that have better skills (accuracy) for \nWest Africa (Molteni et al.,\
    \ 2011). The hydro-climatic-\nEVO will provide downscaled information with higher\

    \ not specific to the \nexact needs of the farmers. Climate \nsensitive information\
    \ such as onset and \ncessation dates, amount and frequency of \nrain etc. are\

    farmers on which decision is suitable based on the \nprovided information. It\

    \ adopted and applied. Aside from \nregular workshops and meetings to discuss\
    \ opinions and \nideas from both sides, the hydro-climatic-EVO presents \na platform\
    \ where knowledge and information are \ncontinuously exchanged. This creates a\
    \ deep sense of \nownership amongst all stakeholders. \nChapter 2\n74\n \n2.5.3\
    \ Design process: hydro-climatic EVO as responsible innovation \n \nWe build on\
    \ the responsible innovation framework (Stilgoe et al., 2013) to \nassess the\
    \ initial steps taken in the process of building a hydroclimatic EVO, \nand to\
    \ identify the challenges ahead. For each cardinal principle, we raised \nsome\
    \ salient questions that seek to guide the development and \nimplementation. \n\
    \ \n(i) Anticipation \n \nAnticipation involves “systematic thinking aimed at\
    \ increasing resilience \nwhile revealing new opportunities for innovation and\
    \ the shaping of agendas \nfor socially-robust risk research” (Stilgoe et al.,\
    \ 2013). This relates to \nforecasting, and imagining possible and desirable futures,\
    \ but also to the \n‘ethics of promising’. This dimension of the RI framework\
    \ makes us ask \n‘what if…?’ questions (Jerome R Ravetz, 1997) to expose the various\
    \ \ncontingencies associated with the development of the hydro-climatic-EVO. \n\
    From its conception, the envisaged hydro-climaticEVO anticipates the future \n\
    by considering the potential impacts of climate variability and change on \nfarmers’\
    \ daily and seasonal farm decision making. Rather than optimizing for \nthe most\
    \ likely future scenario, the hydro-climatic-EVO accounts for the \nassociated\
    \ uncertainty by trying to make variability in water availability \nmanageable\
    \ for different farming purposes. Climate variability and change is \nonly one\
    \ of the potentially relevant future developments. Equally important \nis the\
    \ unintended consequences which could be the future development of \nfarming in\
    \ the region, in terms of economic prospects and farmers’ \naspirations. Will\
    \ farmers move out of agriculture into other occupations if \npossible, or do\
    \ they see a future for themselves and their children that will \nmotivate them\
    \ to further improve their farmer system and embrace new \ntechnologies such as\
    \ an EVO? The approach is taken to ensure inclusiveness \nthrough user-centered\
    \ design (see below) creates some challenges for the \n‘ethics’ of promising.\
    \ Developing features that are most relevant to users \nimplies that these may\
    \ be quite specific and/or novel, making it uncertain to \nwhat degree the innovation\
    \ will be able to deliver on the promised usefulness \nof the EVO. \n \n(ii) Reflexivity\
    \ \n \nReflexivity means “holding a mirror up to one’s own activities, commitments\
    \ \nand assumptions, being aware of the limits of knowledge and being mindful\
    \ \nthat a particular framing of an issue may not be universally held” (Stilgoe\
    \ et \nPotential of hydro-climatic information services to support rice farming\n\
    75\nal., 2013). It is about questioning the value systems and theories that shape\
    \ \nscience, innovation and governance. The envisaged hydro-climatic-EVO will\
    \ \nbe developed through interdisciplinary collaboration, where the absence of\
    \ \nshared standard ways of operating leads to mutual questioning and thus some\
    \ \nform of reflexivity. This reflexivity prevents natural scientists to retreat\
    \ into \nsole modelling and prevents social scientists to retreat into the sole\
    \ analysis \nof social processes. Reflexivity also requires carefulness not to\
    \ violate the \nsocial and cultural ethics of the society in which the project\
    \ is carried out, \nparticularly because different countries and vulnerable populations\
    \ are \ninvolved. This was vital especially during our interaction with farmers,\
    \ for \nexample regarding their traditional knowledge and regular engagement for\
    \ \ninformation exchange. A continuous challenge is to remain reflexive about\
    \ \nassumptions made in building the EVO, and to what extent these are aligned\
    \ \nwith the users’ context. Thus the need for continued scrutiny of project \n\
    activities and dealing with every farmer and situation distinctively. \n(i) Inclusion\n\
    The user-centred design framework (Zulkafli et al., 2017) adopted for the \ndevelopment\
    \ of the hydro-climatic EVO strongly emphasizes inclusion. \nVarious actors and\
    \ institutions were actively involved in the early \ndevelopment process, with\
    \ particular attention paid to potential end-users. \nThe engagement of different\
    \ actors on the project especially during regular \nworkshops and training is\
    \ expected to play a pivotal role in creating a sense \nof ownership among the\
    \ farmers and other actors (public and private sector \nagencies, local leaders\
    \ and chiefs). A clear example of inclusiveness is the \ninvolvement of both rainfed\
    \ and irrigated rice farmers on the project. Each of \nthese farmer types has\
    \ its own need, which must be met. Also, the reliance on \nboth scientific and\
    \ indigenous data and knowledge systems to generate \nactionable knowledge enhances\
    \ the inclusiveness of hydro-climatic EVO. \nInclusion is never perfect, however,\
    \ and pragmatic choices have an impact. \nThe particular study area receives considerable\
    \ attention from development \nactors, partly because of its proximity to the\
    \ city of Tamale and its university. \nFarmers with higher literacy levels, fluency\
    \ in English, and familiarity with \nICT are easier to involve in e.g. local smartphone-based\
    \ data gathering. \n(ii) Responsiveness\nResponsiveness is the capacity to “change\
    \ shape or direction in response to \nstakeholders, public values, and changing\
    \ circumstances” (Stilgoe et al., \nChapter 2\n76\n \n2013). Funded by a university\
    \ programme (INREF4) that values “research for \ndevelopment”, our hydro-climatic-EVO\
    \ project has a good starting point for \nachieving responsiveness. The user-centred\
    \ design approach to developing \nthe EVO emphasizes the importance of the user\
    \ context as a starting point – \nin terms of livelihoods, culture and decision-making.\
    \ A choice that was made \nearly in the project to include the practice of rainfed\
    \ farming as well as \nirrigated farming, was responsive to the importance of\
    \ rainfed farming for \nlarge parts of the rural population, in particular the\
    \ poorer sectors. The design \nand structure of the hydro-climatic-EVO aims to\
    \ meet the needs of users and \nremain flexible enough to respond to future changes\
    \ in circumstances, e.g. \nnew knowledge and emerging perspectives, new technical\
    \ possibilities or \ndemands, as well as changes in livelihoods or cultural values.\
    \ Being a \nuniversity-led project with a limited period (5 years) creates some\
    \ challenges \nfor responsiveness as well. What about responding to changes when\
    \ paid \nproject members are no longer around? Finally, the responsiveness to\
    \ \nstakeholder and public values might be challenged by the responsiveness to\
    \ \nacademic values and incentives, which prioritize modeling, analysis and \n\
    publication over stakeholder engagement and practical application. This \nlimitation\
    \ is therefore recognized and in cases where they emerged efforts \nmust be put\
    \ in place to amicably deal with them. For example, we seek to \nunderstand indigenous\
    \ forecast techniques and develop methods to quantify \nthem in order to harmonize\
    \ them with scientific forecast derived from models. \n \n2.6 Conclusion \n \n\
    The diagnostics study presented here offers a number of important insights \n\
    that help to further refine and implement the hydro-climatic EVO. First, the \n\
    participatory design will create a sense of ownership among farmers. This is \n\
    because, being actively involved from the design to production and \nimplementation\
    \ stages of the project is novel, and it increases the likelihood \nthat the hydro-climatic\
    \ information services developed will be useful for \nfarmers. Secondly, the diagnostics\
    \ provide an in-depth appreciation of the \nsocio-ecological conditions in which\
    \ the EVO will operate. Thirdly, our \nreflection using the RI framework exposed\
    \ key challenges, which the hydro-\nclimaticEVO development process needs to deal\
    \ with. Asking these \nquestions, however, allowed us to discuss plausible solutions\
    \ at an early stage \nin the design process. \n \n                           \

    \ \nINREF.htm \nPotential of hydro-climatic information services to support rice\
    \ farming\n77\nOne of the key challenge anticipated is the reliance on stakeholder\
    \ \nparticipation throughout the project cycle. Farmers need incentives and \n\
    motivation for continuous participation. In our case, we argue that both \nrainfed\
    \ and irrigated farmers are challenged by climate variability and limited \nwater\
    \ availability and that urgent action is needed. The information services \ndeveloped\
    \ can help with improving their farm decision making in order to \nbetter cope\
    \ with climate variability. However, it remains unclear how much \ntime future\
    \ users and other stakeholders are prepared to devote to the design \nprocess.\
    \ Close monitoring is needed to find out if farmers feel that providing \nregular\
    \ data and information is time consuming. Limited commitment of \nusers can potentially\
    \ reduce data availability and quality. As a response we \npay specific attention\
    \ to openness and transparency in the design process, to \nallow participants\
    \ to freely share their opinions and concerns. At the same \ntime, researchers\
    \ need to be proactive. They should be seen as and perceived \nto be serious with\
    \ the process through their active engagement. In the context \nof decision-making,\
    \ our reflections and findings present key challenges in \nterms of language,\
    \ interpretation and usability. The knowledge co-creation \nand subsequent provision\
    \ of actionable knowledge must align with literacy \nand user confidence in being\
    \ able to easily relate to outputs. \nOur approach and innovation possess the\
    \ potential to deal with the socio-\necological challenges imposed by climate\
    \ variability and limited water \navailability. We argue that one of the most\
    \ important drivers of success to our \nproject will be the intensive collective\
    \ interaction of scientist and farmers \ncompelled by the structure and mechanism\
    \ of the hydro-climatic EVO, in \nwhich scientist and other stakeholders think,\
    \ plan and execute together from \ncommon ground. In addition, the responsible\
    \ line of questioning will reduce \nthe possible surprises and eventualities that\
    \ may affect EVO development. \nImportant issues to follow-up on are the performance\
    \ of indigenous and \nscientific forecast to meet the hydro-climatic information\
    \ needs of rice \nfarmers in Northern Ghana. Another issue from our diagnostics\
    \ is how \ngovernance systems limit information flow and interpretation. For our\
    \ follow \nup studies we aim to investigate governance arrangements and how these\
    \ are \nenabling or inhibiting adaptive decision-making amongst farmers and water\
    \ \nmanagers. Also in the next stage of this project is to find out what is the\
    \ most \npreferred model of information exchange by rice farmers. \n The potential\
    \ of including farmers in information collection through citizen \nscience potentially\
    \ bridges part of the gap between scientific and indigenous \nexpertise and constitutes\
    \ a novel contribution to the field of environmental \nobservations. \nChapter\
    \ 2\n78\n \n \nWe conclude that the socio-ecological conditions in Northern Ghana\
    \ \nnecessitate the development of an effective second generation hydroclimatic\
    \ \nEVO as this potentially responds to the principles of RI expected to drive\
    \ \ntechnological innovation to manage change in natural resource management.\
    \ \nFinally, the proposed hydro-climatic EVO has the potential for influencing\
    \ \nadaptive farm decision making in Northern Ghana in spite of identifiable \n\
    challenges. Using the RI framework has helped us to refine these challenges \n\
    and offer concrete suggestions to improve both the design and \nimplementation\
    \ of the proposed platform in a responsible way. \n \nAcknowledgements \n \nWe\

    \ Africa face many difficulties when making farming \ndecisions due to unexpected\
    \ changes in weather and climate. Access to hydro-\nclimatic information can potentially\
    \ assist farmers to adapt. This study \nexplores the extent to which seasonal\
    \ climate forecasts can meet hydro-\nclimatic information needs of rice farmers\
    \ in northern Ghana. First, 62 rice \nfarmers across 12 communities were interviewed\
    \ about their information \nneeds. Results showed that importance of a hydro-climatic\
    \ information need \ndepends on the frequency of use and farming type (rain fed,\
    \ irrigated or both). \nGenerally, farmers perceived rainfall distribution, dam\
    \ water level, and \ntemperature as very important information followed by total\
    \ rainfall amount \nand onset ranked as important. These findings informed our\
    \ skills assessment \nof rainfall (Prcp), minimum temperature (Tmin) and maximum\
    \ temperature \n(Tmax) from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts\
    \ \n(ECMWF-S4) and at lead times 0 to 2. Forecast bias, correlation and skills\
    \ \nfor all variables vary with season and location but generally are unsystematic\
    \ \nand relatively constant with forecast lead time. Making it possible to meet\
    \ \nfarmers’ needs at their most preferred lead-time of one month before the \n\
    farming season. ECMWF-S4 exhibited skills in Prcp, Tmin and Tmax in \nNorthern\
    \ Ghana except some few grid cells in MAM for Prcp and SON for \nTmin and Tmax.\
    \ Tmin and Tmax forecast were more skilful than Prcp. We \nconclude that the participatory\
    \ co-production approach used in this study \nprovides better insight for understanding\
    \ demand driven climate information \nservices and that the ECMWF-S4 seasonal\
    \ forecast system has the potential \nto provide actionable hydro-climatic information\

    \ needs of farmers\n83\n3.1 Introduction \nThe agriculture sector of many West\
    \ African countries is yet to realize its \nfull production potential in terms\
    \ of agricultural yield. Compared to levels \nachieved in the 1960s, the sector\
    \ is considered to be underperforming (Benin \net al., 2011; Nin-Pratt et al.,\
    \ 2011). The low performance of the sector has \nmany reasons, including political\
    \ and institutional constraints, low adoption \nrate of socio-technical innovations,\
    \ and biophysical factors, including highly \nvariable climatic conditions (Baltzer\
    \ & Hansen, 2011). Climate variability \nin large parts of Africa is projected\
    \ to increase due to global warming (Niang \net al., 2014; Salack et al., 2019)\
    \ which is likely to have severe impacts on the \nagricultural production ( Schlenker\
    \ & Lobell, 2010; Rockström et al., 2014). \nThis is particularly the case for\
    \ sub-Saharan Africa where smallholder \nfarmers largely depend on rain-fed agriculture\
    \ and small scale irrigation \nsystems. Changing rainfall patterns could necessitate\
    \ significant adjustments \nto farming activities (Sarr et al., 2015). For example,\
    \ changes in the onset, \nduration and end of the rainy seasons have already affected\
    \ planting patterns \nand the farming calendar (Jotoafrika, 2013). \nIn Ghana,\
    \ significant changes in farm activities caused by climate variability \nand change\
    \ are already evident and efforts to manage the negative effects of \nthis change\
    \ on agricultural production have had limited success. Water \nscarcity and reliance\
    \ on unpredictable rainfall remain major factors limiting \ncrop production in\
    \ the country. One of the most important concerns in this \nregard is the increasing\
    \ rice yields (Kranjac-Berisavljevic’ et al., 2003; \nDonkoh et al., 2010). Rice\
    \ is currently a key staple crop in Ghana for which \nthe consumption has increased\
    \ in recent years (Mabe et al.,  2012). As a \nresult, the production of rice\
    \ needs to increase to meet rising demands under \nthe increasing variable climatic\
    \ conditions (SARI, 2011). This poses a \nsignificant challenge, as farmers have\
    \ to make several climate-sensitive \ndecisions months in advance to the rice\
    \ farming season (Asante & \nAmuakwa-Mensah, 2015). A similar challenge exists\
    \ in irrigated rice \nfarming. The difficulty to predict rainfall and consequently\
    \ river discharge \naffects the decisions of water managers making on water distribution\
    \ to the \nirrigated farmlands. The use of weather and climate forecasts could\
    \ be an \ninstrument that helps farmers in their decision making to improve \n\
    agricultural productivity and food security (Hansen et al., 2009). \nPrevious\
    \ research on hydro-climatic information to support farmers in their \ndecision\
    \ making can be broadly divided into two directions. Firstly, social \nscience\
    \ studies that explored in a mostly bottom-up fashion the weather and \nChapter\
    \ 3\n84\n \nclimate forecast information needs of smallholder farmers and potential\
    \ \nchallenges they encounter. Results showed that farmers do receive weather\
    \ \nand climate information, mainly through radios and local administration \n\
    (Feleke, 2015). Relatively few farmers find the information useful in their \n\
    operational \ndecision-making. \nLanguage \nproblems, \ndifficulty \nin \nunderstanding\
    \ forecast terminology and inconsistency in the time of \ninformation provision\
    \ constrain farmers in the use of weather and climate \ninformation (Feleke, 2015).\
    \ Other studies conclude that weather and climate \ninformation currently received\
    \ by farmers are insufficient and service \nimprovements are needed to make better\
    \ use of the available weather and \nclimate forecasts for informed decision making\
    \ (Onyango et al., 2014). \n \nThe second line of research focusses on technical\
    \ and top-down approaches \nassessing the skills of existing forecasts for several\
    \ regions across the globe \n(Kumar et al., 2001; Barnston et al., 2010; Ogutu\
    \ et al., 2017). These studies \noften conclude that weather and climate forecasts\
    \ have considerable \npotential to improve agricultural management and rural livelihoods\
    \ (Hansen \net al., 2009; Roudier et al., 2014; Ouédraogo et al., 2015), but do\
    \ not connect \nit to the needs of farmers to make informed decisions. Several\
    \ forecasting \nsystems have been developed and used (e.g. (Stockdale et al.,\
    \ 1998; Mason, \n1999; Kanamitsu et al., 2002; Alves et al., 2003). The European\
    \ Centre for \nMedium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF)-System 4 ensemble seasonal\
    \ \nclimate forecasting system, is the state-of-the-art with an ensemble of 15\
    \ \nmembers found to be skilful in many regions across the globe. Several have\
    \ \nargued that it has potential value for providing climate services for \nvulnerable\
    \ sectors including agriculture, energy, and health (Manzanas et \nal., 2012;\
    \ GFCS, 2016). Nonetheless, until now only a few studies used \nECMWF-S4 for Africa\
    \ (QWECI, 2013; Trambauer et al., 2015; Ogutu et al., \n2017). \n \nIn this study,\
    \ we aim to connect these two different lines of research to gain \ninsights on\
    \ demand driven climate service for rice farmers’ adaptive decision \nmaking.\
    \ More specifically, we explore if and how seasonal climate forecasts \nof the\
    \ ECMWF System 4 can meet the hydro-climatic information needs of \nrice farmers\
    \ in northern Ghana. To do this, we used social science methods \n(interviews,\
    \ workshops) combined with a skills assessment of ECMWF \nSystem 4 seasonal climate\
    \ forecast system. Therefore, to meet the main \nobjective, we implement a 2-step\
    \ approach: (1) identify the information \nneeds and (2) assess hindcast skills\
    \ (verification).  \n  \nVerification of seasonal climate forecast towards hydroclimatic\
    \ information needs of farmers\n85\nThe paper proceeds as follows. First, we briefly\
    \ introduce the case study \nregion. In section 3, we describe the methods used\
    \ for data collection and \nanalysis, followed by section 4 where we present the\
    \ findings of the farmers’ \nneeds assessment and the performance evaluation of\
    \ the forecast. We discuss \nthe findings in section 5, followed by a concluding\
    \ section. \n3.2 Study area \nThe North of Ghana is located within the Inter-Tropical\
    \ Convergence Zone \n(ITCZ) where the movement of the two air masses, the Harmattan\
    \ or North \n– East (NE) Trade Winds and the South-West Monsoon winds, determines\n\
    the nature of the climate (Liebe., 2002). The area is associated with erratic\n\
    unimodal rainfall with total annual precipitation ranging from 400 to 1200\nmm.\
    \ The north of Ghana has challenging climatic conditions such as a long\ndry season\
    \ of about six to seven months followed by a five-month rainy\nseason (April/May\
    \ to September/October). The area is characterized by\nfrequently occurring drought\
    \ and flood events (Amikuzuno & Donkoh,\n2012; Asare-Kyei et al., 2015). Temperatures\
    \ in this part of Ghana are higher\ncompared to the southern part of the country.\
    \ Maximum temperatures range\nfrom 26°C in August to 40°C in March or April (Mdemu,\
    \ 2008). This makes\nits agriculture activities highly vulnerable to climate variability\
    \ and change.\nNorthern Ghana comprises of the Upper West Region, the Upper East\
    \ \nRegion and the Northern Region (Runge-Metzger & Diehl, 1993). The \npoverty\
    \ level of Northern Ghana is higher compared to the southern regions \neven after\
    \ over 30 years of agricultural-led development projects, the \nnorthern regions\
    \ of Ghana remain impoverished (Morris et al., 1999; IFAD, \n2012;). According\
    \ to a recent report from the Ghana Statistical Service, \nabout 80% of the economically\
    \ active population in this part of Ghana \nengages in agriculture (GSS, 2014).\
    \ The main crops are rice, maize, soybean, \nmillet, cassava guinea-corn, groundnut,\
    \ beans, and sorghum, with some \nfarmers also producing dry season tomatoes,\
    \ pepper, cabbage and onions \nmainly for consumption with surpluses for the market\
    \ (GSS, 2014). \nGenerally, average farmland size varies with crop type; 0.27\
    \ ha for soybean, \n0.72 ha for rice and 1.06 ha for maize. Rice production in\
    \ the area declined \nfrom 3.20 MT/ha in 2010 to 2.32 MT/ha in 2015 despite an\
    \ increasing \ndemand (USAID, 2017). The period of rice farming is similar across\
    \ the \nthree regions of northern Ghana because of similar agro-ecological \n\
    conditions, even though there are individual preferences for different rice \n\
    varieties based on production rational (GIDA, 2016).  \nChapter 3\n86\n \nTo mitigate\
    \ irregular water availability for farming and domestic activities \nin the Northern\
    \ Region, about 20 small and large irrigation schemes have \nbeen developed with\
    \ the Bontanga irrigation scheme being the largest in the \nKumbungu District\
    \ (Figure 3.1). The Bontanga irrigation scheme sources its \nwater from the Bontanga\
    \ River, a tributary of the White Volta River. The \nscheme has a potential area\
    \ of 800 hectares but 450 hectares are currently \nirrigated. Out of this, 240\
    \ hectares is used for lowland rice cultivation. In \n2016, the scheme included\
    \ about 600 farmers (~100 women and ~500 men) \nfrom 13 different communities\
    \ with an average of 0.8 ha per farmer. They \nengaged in rainfed and irrigated\
    \ rice farming in the rain and dry season \nrespectively (GIDA, 2011, 2016; The\
    \ Republic of Ghana, 2012). \n \n \n \n Figure 3.1: Northern Ghana in a black\

    \ climate forecast towards hydroclimatic information needs of farmers\n87\n3.3.\
    \ Research Methodology and Data \nThis research was conducted in three main steps.\
    \ First, document analyses, \ninterviews (n=62) and a feedback workshop were used\
    \ to obtain information \nabout the hydro-climatic information needs of rice farmers\
    \ in the \ncommunities around the Bontanga irrigation scheme. In the second step,\
    \ we \nevaluated the skills of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather \n\
    Forecasts’ System 4 ensemble seasonal climate forecasts (ECMWF-S4) \nusing probabilistic\
    \ verification statistics. Thirdly, we assessed the potential \nfor meeting the\
    \ hydro-climatic information needs of farmers at their \nexpected lead time. \
    \ \n3.3.1 Data collection and analysis  \n3.3.1.1 Assessment of hydro-climatic\
    \ information needs. \nTo collect data on hydro-climatic information needs for\
    \ farmers’ decision \nmaking we designed a structured interview guide based on\
    \ document \nanalysis (Bowen, 2009) and previous studies (Roncoli et al., 2009;\
    \ Crane et \nal., 2010; Roudier et al., 2014). The interview protocol covered\
    \ both open \nand closed questions on (i) respondents’ general perception of climate\
    \ \nvariability and change; (ii) hydro-climatic information needs for decision\
    \ \nmaking where farmers could identify their hydro-climatic information \nrequirements\
    \ in each stage of the farming process; (iii) general information \nabout respondents\
    \ (see Table A3 of supporting material for the interview \nguide). The interview\
    \ guide was pilot-tested twice to ensure that the \nquestions were understandable\
    \ and unambiguous.  \nIn total 62 rice farmers were interviewed (Table 3.1). Each\
    \ interview lasted \nfor about 30-40 minutes and was audio recorded. In the sampling\
    \ process, \nwe aimed to balance between types of farmers; Irrigation only (IO),\
    \ Rainfed \nOnly (RO) and Both Irrigated and Rainfed (BIR) and their location\
    \ within \nthe irrigation scheme (up-, mid- and down-stream of the Bontanga River).\
    \ \nIndividual farmers were selected based on their rice farming experience \n\
    (more than 5 years) and their willingness to participate in the survey. We \n\
    included IO farmers (n= 11), RO farmers (n=20) and BIR farmers (n=31). \nAfter\
    \ completing the interviews and processing the data, a one-day feedback \nworkshop\
    \ was organised to discuss and validate the interview results with \nrepresentatives\
    \ from each of the 12 selected communities. The aim was to \nreduce interpretation\
    \ bias by the researchers, to collectively rank information \nneeds, to improve\
    \ understanding of the respondents' needs, to share key \ninsights of the research\
    \ team, and to identify farmers for follow-up studies. \nThe data and information\
    \ gathered from the interviews and workshop were \nChapter 3\n88\nanalysed using\
    \ descriptive statistics (frequency and percentage). The \nanalysed demography\
    \ and farming characteristics of the farmers are \npresented in Table 3.1 showing\

    \ and maximum temperature (Tmax) were collected from \nthe European Centre for\
    \ Medium Range Weather Forecast system 4 \n(ECMWF-S4). The data is an ensemble\
    \ of 15 members at approximately \n0.75 degree horizontal resolution. The data\
    \ initialization used for this \nanalysis starts on the first day of every month\
    \ from 1981 to 2010. Each of \nthe 15 ensemble members provides forecast of up\
    \ to 7 months. Also, 30 \nChapter 3\n90\nyears’ (1981 to 2010) Water and Global\
    \ Change (WATCH) forcing data \nERA-Interim (WFDEI) daily data of the same variables\
    \ (Prcp, Tmin and \nTmax) were used as reference observation (Weedon et al., 2014)\
    \ because of \nthe sparse network of weather stations in the area and the quality\
    \ of data \navailable does not allow for proper spatial validation. \nWFDEI has\
    \ been considered useful for evaluation purposes in East Africa \n(Ogutu et al.,\
    \ 2017). An inter-comparison analysis of precipitation variability \nand trends\
    \ in Ghana has shown that GPCC which is an input data set of \nWFDEI performed\
    \ well when compared to Ghana meteorological agency \n(GMET) station data for\
    \ monthly totals in Northern Ghana (Manzanas et al., \n2014). We performed further\
    \ analysis of Prcp, Tmin and Tmax to recognize \nthe extent of the existing bias\
    \ daily timescale (see figure B1 and B2 in \nsupplementary documents). But the\
    \ results of this validation were not very \nencouraging as WFDEI could not properly\
    \ estimate the variables at a daily \ntime scale but capture well temporal trend\
    \ of variability of the variables. \nComparing point data from a wide grid to\
    \ GMET station data could, \ntherefore, have affected the results.   \n3.3.2.2\
    \ Data analysis \nThis study uses two well-documented verification measures (Generalised\
    \ \nDiscrimination Score (GDS) and Relative Operating Curve Skill Score \n(ROCSS)\
    \ to assess the performance of the forecast to a standard reference \n(i.e. the\
    \ climatological forecasts and observed climatology). Indicator values \nfor these\
    \ measures range from zero denoting forecast being as good as the \nreference\
    \ and positive or negative implying an improvement and no skill \nrespectively).\
    \ \nMore in detail, the forecast verification is performed for three different\
    \ \nperiods of the rainy seasons of Northern Ghana: i.e. MAM (March, April \n\
    May, coinciding with Onset), JJA (June, July and August for peak monsoon \nseason)\
    \ and SON (September, October and November for cessation) (Sultan \n& Janicot,\
    \ 2003; Amekudzi et al., 2015). Our results from step 1 showed that \nfarmers\
    \ preferred lead times ranges between 0-2 months (see section 4.1). \nThe skill\
    \ was verified at 0, 1 and 2 lead times corresponding to the months \nthe forecast\
    \ started before a growing season. The verification was carried out \non the ensemble\
    \ mean of all members as the accuracy of the verification \nimproves with larger\
    \ ensemble size. Large ensembles are particularly \nimportant if extreme events\
    \ are to be forecasted (Weigel et al., 2007; Ferro \net al., 2008;). Prior to\
    \ the validation, we matched forecast data spatial \nVerification of seasonal\
    \ climate forecast towards hydroclimatic information needs of farmers\n91\nresolutions\
    \ (0.75 degree) to observe data resolution (0.5 degree) using \nbilinear interpolation\
    \ which is a widely used method in climate forecast \nvalidation exercises (Bedia\
    \ & Iturbide 2017; Ogutu et al., 2017; Cofiño et \nal., 2018).3-monthly averages\
    \ of the forecasts and observations were \ncomputed to allow the validation scores\
    \ on seasonal timescale. The \nevaluation was carried out at grid points level\
    \ and the three regions within \nthe north of Ghana where rainfall patterns are\
    \ similar (Nkrumah et al., 2014). \nWe analysed mean biases for each of the three\
    \ seasons and for different lead \ntimes (Willmott et al., 2012). The strength\
    \ of the relationship between the \nensemble 261 mean and the verifying observations\
    \ were assessed using \nSpearman’s rank correlation coefficient.   \nThe Generalised\
    \ Discrimination Score (GDS) was used as a measure to assess \nhow well the forecasts\
    \ are able to discriminate between varying observations. \nThis was done by quantifying\
    \ whether a set of observed outcomes can be \ncorrectly discriminated by the corresponding\
    \ forecasts (Weigel & Mason, \n2011). The score measures the probability that\
    \ any two (distinguishable) \nobservations can be correctly discriminated by the\
    \ corresponding forecasts. \nThus, GDS can be interpreted as an indication of\
    \ how often the forecasts are \n“correct” regardless of whether forecasts are\
    \ binary, categorical, continuous, \nor probabilistic (Mason & Weigel, 2009).\
    \ Relative Operating Curve Skill \nScore (ROCSS) was also used to compute the\
    \ skills in tercile forecasts (i.e. \nprobability forecasts for upper, middle\
    \ and lower terciles forecasts) \nconsidering rainfall forecasts only. The ROCSS\
    \ measures the hit rate of a \nforecast against its false-alarm rate as the decision\
    \ threshold (for example a \nquantile of a probabilistic forecast) is varied.\
    \ It is expressed as a percentage \nand quantifies the improvement over climatological\
    \ forecast (Jolliffe & \nStephenson, 2012). Characteristics of the ROC have been\
    \ widely discussed \n(e.g. Kharin & Zwiers, 2003; Mason, 2003). Several other\
    \ studies have used \nthe technique to diagnose ensemble forecast accuracy (Gallus\
    \ & Segal, 2004; \nLegg & Mylne, 2004; Ogutu et al., 2017). Accessing, downloading\
    \ and \nanalysis of data was carried out using relevant packages within R statistics:\
    \ \nSpecsVerification (Siegert, 2017), easyVerification (MeteoSwiss, 2017), \n\
    downscaleR (Bedia et al., 2017), visualizeR (Frías et al., 2017) and \ntransformeR\
    \ (Bedia & Iturbide, 2017).  \n3.4 Results \n3.4.1 Farmers Expectations and Hydro-climatic\
    \ information needs for rice \nfarming decision making  \nChapter 3\n92\n \nIn\
    \ the face of difficulties posed by climate variability, farmers report having\
    \ \nlimited access to reliable sources of hydro-climatic information to support\
    \ \ntheir farm decisions. Results showed that almost half of the farmers (43.5%)\
    \ \nrely only on experiences and personal predictions based on indigenous \necological\
    \ knowledge. For example, the croaking of a frog and the movement \nof ants from\
    \ their hole is an indication that it will rain the next day. During \nthe workshop,\
    \ one farmer complained about existing hydro-climatic \ninformation available:\
    \ “Those people [providers of the hydro-climatic \ninformation] are liars, I do\
    \ my own thing and I don’t’ rely on them at all. \nWhen I say it will rain it\
    \ will, except for a few occasions when it rains \nunexpectedly”. More than half\
    \ of the farmers (56.5%) use indigenous forecast \nalongside climate forecast\
    \ information from GMET via radio, TV and in some \ncases through ESOKO (information\
    \ service provider for agriculture), and \nfrom extension officers of the Ministry\
    \ of Food and Agriculture. When asked \nabout barriers for the use of hydro-climatic\
    \ information, farmers mention \ninaccuracy and untimeliness of information, difficulties\
    \ interpreting technical \ninformation and language barrier. Another reason for\
    \ farmers not to use \nforecasts provided by GMET is that these do not fit their\
    \ purpose, and are \nprovided at a regional scale and do not match the situation\
    \ in their \ncommunities. They showed good understanding of how hydro-climatic\
    \ \ninformation could support their farm decisions and lives; frequently reported\
    \ \nbenefits include seed usage, rice yield, and appropriate water management,\
    \ \nsaving money and having enough food for the family.   \n \nThroughout a farming\
    \ cycle, farmers make decisions for which they require \ninformation on climate\
    \ and water (Table 3.2). Pre-season decisions require \ninformation mostly on\
    \ rainfall onset, rainfall distribution, and rainfall amount. \nDecisions during\
    \ the season such as land preparation and planting also require \ninformation\
    \ on rainfall onset. The dam water level was highest on the priority \nlist of\
    \ farmers engaged in irrigation. Temporal distribution of rainfall is the \nmost\
    \ important information to determine when and how much fertilizer to \napply and\
    \ when to conduct pest- and weed-control. Wind speed and direction \nwas most\
    \ important for spraying weedicides. However, farmers expressed \nlittle need\
    \ for this information as they already spray early mornings to avoid \nstrong\
    \ winds. Finally, rainfall cessation and temperature were most needed \ninformation\
    \ to start harvesting, although rainfall distribution and amount are \ncritical\
    \ to choosing a harvesting method. For instance, it is better to harvest \nwith\
    \ sickles and knives on wetter than normal fields than use reapers or \ncombine\
    \ harvesters. \n \n \nVerification of seasonal climate forecast towards hydroclimatic\

    Farmers ranked rainfall distribution, temperature and dam water level ranking\
    \ \nmost important followed by total rainfall amount and onset as fairly important\
    \ \nbefore cessation. Wind speed and direction were considered the least \nimportant\
    \ among all the information needs. Temperature and precipitation \npatterns were\
    \ found relevant by all farmers irrespective of geographical \nlocation or type\
    \ of farming except dam water level which was top on the list \nof irrigating\
    \ farmers (see Table 3.1 of supporting material). Farmers consider \nthe timing\
    \ of information provision as essential for making decisions and \nmobilizing\
    \ resources for farming activities. When asked about which times \nthey would\
    \ prefer to receive seasonal climate and hydrological (dam water \nlevel) information,\
    \ 74% preferred 1-month lead time, 24% preferred 2 months \nand only 2% preferred\
    \ 4 months lead time. Of the 42 rice farmers (IO and B) \nwho required hydrological\
    \ information, 67% preferred a month lead time and \n33% preferred a 2 months’\
    \ time lead.   \n \n3.4.2 Forecast Evaluation  \n \nFollowing the needs assessment,\
    \ the skill assessment of the ECMWF-S4 \nclimate forecast was performed on three\
    \ different lead times i.e. 0, 1 and 2 \nmonths. Rainfall, minimum and maximum\
    \ temperature were evaluated by \nvalidating forecast with observation to determine\
    \ their performance in the \nstudy area.    \n  \n3.4.2.1 Rainfall Verification\
    \  \n \nAnalysis of rainfall forecasts showed a general mixture of wet and dry\
    \ biases \n(-2 mm/day to 1 mm/day) (see figure B3 of the supplementary document).\
    \ In \nmost cases, however, rainfall was underestimated (dry bias) except for\
    \ the \nupper west region where JJA (June, July, August; peak monsoon season)\
    \ for \nall lead times and SON (September, October, November; monsoon cessation)\
    \ \n(lead time 0) showed some spread of overestimation (wet bias) of rainfall\
    \ \nwhich decreases with lead time. Dry bias was high in MAM (March, April \n\
    May; monsoon onset) (irrespective of lead time) compared to SON and then \nJJA.\
    \ Wet bias was found largely in the western part of the Northern Region \nand\
    \ Upper West region for JJA for all lead times and in Upper West region \nonly\
    \ for SON lead time 0. Change in bias with respect to forecast lead times \ncould\
    \ be attributed to the existing influence of local features such as surface \n\
    topography (see also Ogutu et al., 2016) and for that reason the initial \nconditions\
    \ for which the model was run.   \n \nChapter 3\n96\n \nFor rainfall, there was\
    \ a positive correlation (0.2≤ r ≤0.6) between forecasted \nrainfall and observations\
    \ (significance correlation most grids) for the entire \nstudy area for all lead\
    \ times of SON and JJA. MAM showed a mixture of \nlower positive and negative\
    \ (-0.3≤ r ≤0.2) correlation for a large part of \nNorthern region. Negative correlations\
    \ were mostly found in the northern \nregion at lead time 0 and 1 and Upper East\
    \ and north of West region at lead \ntime 2. SON showed the strongest correlation\
    \ followed by JJA before MAM. \nThere is, however, no drastic change in correlation\
    \ for each season per lead \ntime, except in the Northern region where MAM and\
    \ SON showed low \ncorrelation at an increasing lead time (see figure B4 of supporting\
    \ document).   \n  \nSummarizing results showed that rainfall forecasts are able\
    \ to discriminate \nbetween varying observations in large parts of the study area\
    \ (Figure 3.2). \nThis is the case for all seasons except for the MAM period when\
    \ the Northern \nregion (lead time 0 and 1) and Upper east region (lead time 2)\
    \ exhibited poorer \nskills. SON rainfall forecast is found to be more skilful\
    \ than JJA. MAM only \nshowed patches of skills in the Upper East and West region\
    \ (lead time 0 and \n1) and for the northern region (lead time 2). Interestingly,\
    \ while the skills of \nthe forecasted rainfall generally decrease with lead time\
    \ in JJA and SON, it \ngets slightly better with lead time in MAM.  \n \nFigure\

    \ C) for large areas \nand for all seasons irrespective of lead time (See figure\
    \ B5 of supporting \ndocument). There were, however, spots of warm bias in north\
    \ eastern part of \nNorthern region for JJA lead time 1 and 2 (stronger in lead\

    \ \nshowed similar trends of cold biases irrespective of lead time. \n \nDespite\
    \ the recorded biases, forecast and observed Tmin showed a positive \ncorrelation\
    \ (0.4 ≤ r ≤ 0.6 dominating grid cells) in MAM, JJA and SON of \nalmost all areas\
    \ of the study and for all lead times. The correlation in MAM \nand SON forecasts\
    \ is weaker in some grid cells but nearly constant in JJA \nwith lead time. SON\
    \ showed some patches of poor correlation in the north \nwestern and north eastern\
    \ part of Northern region at lead time 2 and extreme \neastern part of upper west\
    \ at lead time 1 and 2 (figure B6 of supporting \ndocument). A significant correlation\
    \ was observed in most grid cells in JJA \nfor all lead times. MAM also exhibited\
    \ significant correlations in large part \nof the study area except for the upper\
    \ west region in lead time 2. A large part \nof the Northern region exhibited\
    \ a significant correlation for lead time 1 than \n2 before 0. The results of\
    \ the generalized discrimination score in Figure 3. 4 \nshowed considerable skill\
    \ in the Tmin forecast in almost all the study areas \nand lead times. JJA is\
    \ comparatively skilful than MAM and then SON. Spots \nof poor skills at the western\
    \ part of Upper West and south-eastern corner of \nNorthern region for all lead\
    \ times were found in SON. The poor skill in these \nareas, however, got poorer\
    \ with lead time. Generally, the skill of the forecast \n(Tmin) was nearly constant\
    \ with increasing lead time.  \nChapter 3\n100\n \n \nFigure 3.4: The generalized\

    \ seasons, cold bias showed nearly a \nconstant change in bias with lead time.\
    \  In spite of the dominating cold biases \nacross the study area (see figure\
    \ B7 of supporting document), Tmax showed \nskills across the study area for all\
    \ seasons and lead times (Figure 3.5). Tmax \nexhibited a strong relationship\
    \ between its forecast and the observation in \nmost of Northern Ghana (see figure\

    \ was generally better in \nMAM compared to JJA and before SON. It was however\
    \ comparatively \nweaker at lead time 1 of JJA and lead time 1 and 2 of SON. The\
    \ correlation, \ntherefore, reduced with lead time for all seasons but not consistently.\
    \ MAM \nand SON at lead time 0 showed a significant correlation in all parts of\
    \ the \nstudy area. However, SON (lead time 1 and 2) showed no statistically \n\

    \ The correlation was however poor for \nMAM Prcp in the Northern region, and\

    forecast was able to discriminate between varying observations and thus \nskilful\
    \ over large areas of Northern Ghana. Forecasted SON rainfall was more \nskilful\
    \ than JJA and MAM. Lower rainfall predictability skills found in MAM \ncould\
    \ be due to the inability of ECMWF-S4 model to capture well local \nfeatures and\
    \ processes. The skills of the forecasted rainfall were not severely \ninfluenced\
    \ by the lead time. The skills exhibited by both Tmin and Tmax were \nhomogeneous.\
    \ For Tmin however, JJA exhibited slightly higher skill \ncompared to MAM and\

    information needs and unequivocally requires this information within a\nChapter\
    \ 3\n104\n \nThis study uses seasonal average as a proxy to assess performance\
    \ and discuss \nthe possibility of meeting farmers’ needs. Further study is needed\
    \ to make \nstronger claims on the predictability of each information need with\
    \ ECMWF-\nS4. For example, onset and cessation are expressed in calendar dates\
    \ while \ndam water level requires a hydrological method to determine its \npredictability.\
    \ Nonetheless, the existence of skill in the analysis showed \npotentials in predicting\
    \ the identified information needs. For instance, skills \nin tercile predictability\
    \ of above and below normal rainfall could provide \ninformation on rainfall amount\
    \ and seasonal flow of water to the irrigation \ndam. Based on the results of\
    \ the GDS and ROCSS analysis, Table B2 in \nsupporting document synthesizes these\
    \ possibilities taking into account the \nlimitations 524 associated with the\
    \ current analysis.   \n \nGenerally, ECMWF-S4 is able to simulate well the inter-annual\
    \ variability, \nspatial patterns and structure of Prcp, Tmin and Tmax for all\
    \ seasons at \ndifferent lead times except MAM in the northern region and north\
    \ of upper \neast and west region (figure B4, A6 and A8 of supporting document).\
    \ This \nhas great implications since increasing rainfall variability results\
    \ in higher \nrisk for farmers (Graef & Haigis, 2001; Ochieng et al., 2016). Rice\
    \ farmers in \nNorthern Ghana already complain of loss of seeds at the beginning\
    \ of the \nraining season due to delay in rainfall onset and variability between\
    \ March \nand May (Ndamani & Watanabe, 2013). While GDS and ROCSS are \nimportant\
    \ attributes for assessing forecast skills, forecast with high \ndiscriminative\
    \ power may still be subject to systematic errors and may require \npost-processing\
    \ such as bias correction to become useful (Weigel et al., 2007; \nWeigel & Mason,\
    \ 2011). A bias of up to 2 mm/day and 2 to 3 degrees as \nobserved in Tmin and\
    \ Tmax could adversely affect farm decisions. These \nforecast biases could be\
    \ attributed to the consequence of the intrinsic \nlimitations of the physical\
    \ models related to parameterizations, equation \nsimplification and uncertainties\
    \ in the initialization procedure (Doblas-Reyes \net al., 2013). Such biases could,\
    \ however, be mitigated through the application \nof bias correction techniques\
    \ that are normally based on statistical methods \nusing antecedent series of\
    \ forecasts and observations (Peng et al., 2014; Piani \net al., 2010; Weigel\
    \ et al., 2007). However, studies have shown that bias \ncorrecting ECMWF-S4 probabilistic\
    \ forecast does not necessarily improve \nforecast skill (Ogutu et al., 2017)\
    \ but enhances the usability of the forecast by \nimproving the root-mean-square\
    \ error (Barnston et al., 2015). \n \nFinally, in this study, we have used an\
    \ interdisciplinary approach by \ncombining a needs assessment with a forecast\
    \ skill test, in order to assess the \npotential for meaningful climate services\
    \ for local-level decision support. The \nVerification of seasonal climate forecast\

    \ a broader contextualisation of existing research on seasonal \nclimate forecast\
    \ verification and farmers’ information needs which is often \ndone in isolation.\
    \ In this way, we are able to move away from one directional \napproach of looking\
    \ at climate services to two directions where needs and \nskills are clearly documented\
    \ and synthesised. Our findings demonstrate the \nvalue of linking climate forecasts\
    \ to farm-level decision making. As such, this \nstudy contributes to the need\
    \ of better matching hydro-climatic information \nservices with needs of end-users\
    \ and important calls to improve climate \nservices (Stiller-Reeve et al., 2015;\
    \ Street, 2016; Vogel et al., 2017). \nFollowing Stone & Meinke (2006), we showed\
    \ that developing appropriate \ninterdisciplinary systems to connect forecast\
    \ products with farm management \nis needed if uptake of weather and climate information\
    \ by farmers is to be \nsuccessful.   \n 3.6 Conclusion \nThis paper has addressed\
    \ key aspects of climate information services: \nmatching information needs and\
    \ forecast performance. Results show \nhomogeneity in rice farmers’ hydro-climatic\
    \ information needs although some \nof these needs are ranked higher than others\
    \ depending on the frequency of \nuse and farming type. Majority of farmers prefers\
    \ to receive hydro-climatic \ninformation within a month lead time for proper\
    \ planning and decision-\nmaking. Our analysis concludes that this is possible.\
    \ ECMWF-S4 possess \nsome skill for forecasting Prcp, Tmin and Tmax in Northern\
    \ Ghana. The skill \nvaries per season and location but barely on forecast lead\
    \ time, having \nsignificant implications for meeting rice farmers’ information\
    \ needs in \nNorthern Ghana with improved seasonal climate forecast at different\
    \ lead \ntimes. The ECMWF-S4 seasonal climate forecast, therefore, has the potential\
    \ \nto provide farmers with information that improves their farm decision making.\
    \ \nYet, information services will require a careful introduction to increase\
    \ trust \nin using more tailored results from the forecast systems. Finally, we\
    \ \nrecommend that due to the limitations of this study discussed in section 3,\
    \ \nfurther research is needed to make stronger claims especially on the \npredictability\
    \ of each information need with ECMWF-S4. \n Acknowledgements  \nThis study is\

    \ Introduction \n \nThe weather and climate have a significant influence on crop\
    \ growth, \ndevelopment and yield as well as pests and diseases infestation, water\
    \ needs \nand fertilizer requirements (Doblas-Reyes et al., 2003).  The variability\
    \ of the \nweather and climate is beyond human control. However, being able to\
    \ \nforecast the weather and seasonal climate accurately and timely help farmers\
    \ \nto adapt farm decisions from time immemorial (Banerjee et al., 2003)  \n \n\
    \ Around the world, people use indigenous ecological knowledge (IEK) to \nimprove\
    \ understanding of their living environment. They make regular \nobservations\
    \ and match them with their experiences and historical knowledge \n(Olsson et\
    \ al., 2004; Orlove et al., 2010). The generality and applicability of \nIEK have\
    \ been studied across the globe ( Desbiez et al., 2004; Cabrera et al., \n2006;)\
    \ and in Africa (Gray & Morant, 2003; Orlove et al., 2010). In this study, \n\
    we focused on the use of IEK for weather and seasonal climate forecast which \n\
    has been referred to by (Vervoort et., (2016) as indigenous forecast (IF).  \n\
    \ \n Across the globe farmers still use IF today to adjust their farm practices\
    \ or \ndiversify their production to respond to local climate variability (Eriksen\
    \ et \nal., 2005). Here, we define “indigenous” as native or local and “forecasting”\
    \ \nin its elementary form as a prediction of a future occurrence or condition.\
    \  \n \nScientific advancements now make it possible to provide short and long-term\
    \ \nclimate information services to support farmers’ decision-making. Several\
    \ \nstudies showed that farmers use a combination of meteorological information\
    \ \nand indigenous knowledge in their weather and seasonal climate forecasting\
    \ \ndecisions (B. Orlove et al., 2010; Roudier, Muller, D’Aquino, et al., 2014).\
    \ \nAlthough farmers use IEK for forecasting weather and seasonal climate \npatterns,\
    \ they are the first to also recognize the limitations in terms of \naccuracy,\
    \ timing, and reliability (Roncoli et al., 2002). Studies have also \nshown that\
    \ IEK can serve as a basis for developing adaptation and natural \nresource management\
    \ strategies and for understanding the potential for \ncertain cost-effective,\
    \ participatory and sustainable adaptation strategies \n(IPCC, 2007; Nakashima\
    \ et al., 2012). Only relatively few studies have \nexplored indigenous ecological\
    \ knowledge in weather and seasonal climate \nforecasting and even those that\
    \ attempted did so qualitatively (Manyanhaire \n& Chitura, 2015; Roncoli et al.,\
    \ 2002). Furthermore, among those who have \nstudied IF for agriculture production,\
    \ very few have looked at the underlying \nmechanism (techniques) for IF and particularly\
    \ quantitative test skills in these \nforecasts. \nChapter 4\n110\n \n \n \n \n\

    \ \ncommunities and their locations are shown in Figure 4.2. These farmers \n\
    practised both irrigated and rainfed rice farming. Each farmer in this study \n\
    hypothetically represents a forecast system providing forecast and a \nmeteorological\
    \ station recording observed rainfall for each community. \nTherefore, although\
    \ selecting many farmers in each community is not a bad \nidea, one farmer for\
    \ each community was representative enough for the \nexercise. Moreover, we were\

    \ and selecting these number allowed us to \nproperly monitor and obtain detail\

    \ in using indigenous forecast and \nwillingness to partake in the study. \n \n\
    Our initial inquiries show that not all farmers are good at forecasting using\
    \ \nindigenous ecological indicators (IEIs). Also, farmers were aware of those\
    \ \ngood at forecasting in their communities and so, we agreed together who will\
    \ \nChapter 4\n112\n \nbe involved in the training and forecasting.  Moreover,\
    \ only few farmers were \nknown to have the technique and good skills for forecasting\
    \ and so we did not \ncollect forecast using surveys from randomly selected farmers.\
    \ We \npurposively selected our expert farmers based on their forecast techniques\
    \ \nand skills. In general, local forecast experts are known for having this skill\
    \ \n(e.g. reading the stars or the direction of the wind) in their community.\
    \ The \nselection of these 12 expert farmers was rigorous in order to reduce risk\
    \ and \ngenerate quality data for our analysis. The selection process includes\
    \ the \nactive involvement of members of the community, manager of the irrigation\
    \ \nscheme and extension officers during a workshop. It was clear that \ncommunity\
    \ members were aware of who is good at forecasting in their \nrespective communities\
    \ and so we decided together who will be involved in \nthe training and forecasting.\
    \  In addition, during the meeting and before the \nfinal selection we asked the\
    \ pre-selected farmers how many rainfall events \ncould each farmer accurately\
    \ predict out of 10 events. We selected those with \nthe highest numbers. All\
    \ participants agreed to the selected farmers.  \n \nIt is not new that Humans\
    \ are able to forecast the weather and seasons using \nIEIs since time immemorial.\
    \ Weather and seasonal climate forecasting \nmodels also provides forecast using\
    \ what we called initial conditions such as \nwind direction, surface pressure\
    \ etc. It is also a fact that the IEIs used by \nhumans’ changes just as initials\
    \ conditions used in forecasting models \nchange. Therefore, while differences\
    \ exist in several aspects of both systems, \nour focus for comparing both systems\
    \ are based on the fact that they both \nprovide forecast of the same parameter.\
    \ In this study, we did not consider \nhumans as weather stations in a literal\
    \ sense. These expert farmers were given \nrain gauges to record the rainfall\
    \ in their community as an observation which \nwe compared to their own forecast\
    \ for verification. Moreover, we agree that \nthere are several schools of thoughts\
    \ on scientific reductionism. For those in \nthe field of development, this could\
    \ be an issue that can affect results. Yet this \napproach is valid for studies\
    \ in the field in meteorology and climate \nforecasting.  For instance, one area\
    \ that uses reductionism extensively is in \nmodelling, forecasting and understanding\
    \ the weather. If a scientist designs a \ncomputer program to model and predict\
    \ weather patterns, they cannot \npossibly include every single permutation of\
    \ such a vast and complicated \nsystem. Instead, they simplify many of the elements\
    \ to allow the program to \nwork without losing accuracy. This was the case also\
    \ in our study. We could \nnot have considered all other parameters of each farmer.\
    \ A good reason to \nselect and work with expert farmers who have ample knowledge\
    \ about \nindigenous forecasting. \n \nTechniques and skills of indigenous weather\
    \ and seasonal climate forecast\n113\n \nPrior to the rainy season, two workshops\
    \ (Plate B1-B6) were organized in \nMarch 2017, to collect information about IEIs\
    \ and train farmers. During the \nfirst workshop, farmers were asked about their\
    \ confidence in their own \nforecasts, key IEIs were identified and collectively\
    \ discussed among \nparticipants, and key terminologies were explained (see Table\
    \ C1 of the \nsupplementary document). A mental model was used to conceptualize\
    \ the \ndegree of influence of each IEI on a phenomenon forecast. The developed\
    \ \nmental model was analysed using a matrix (Table C10 of the supplementary \n\
    document) in the mental model software (http://www.mentalmodeler.org/) to \ndefine\
    \ cumulative strength of connections between elements of the system \n(Gray et\
    \ al., 2013; Özesmi & Özesmi, 2004). The second workshop aimed at \ntraining farmers\
    \ in two key areas; (i) how to use an android based mobile app \nto record 24\
    \ hours forecasts (see Plate C3) and (ii) How to record observed \nrainfall using\
    \ a simple rain gauge. We recognized that timing is very crucial \nfor the data\
    \ recordings. Therefore, we followed similar timing just as GMet. \nRainfall observed\
    \ are recorded at 9 am against the previous day, and forecast \nat 6 am for the\
    \ next 24hours.  To ensure farmers stick to this schedule, we set \nalarms on\
    \ their mobile phones to remind them on a daily basis.  After the \ntraining,\
    \ trial exercises were carried out with the mobile app and rain gauges. \nThe\
    \ seasonal climate forecasts for the year 2017 were also collected from \neach\
    \ farmer during this workshop. We chose to use a mobile phone \napplication for\
    \ collecting farmers’ forecasts for two main reasons; first, to \nmonitor forecast\
    \ by date, time and location. Secondly, to appreciate how \nfarmers with low literacy\
    \ levels interact with ICT based tools for future \ninformation exchange.  \n\
    \ \nFarmers’ weather (24hrs) forecast and observation data for 214 days were \n\
    collected from April – October (2017) using the Sapelli mobile app (Stevens, \n\
    Vitos, Altenbuchner, et al., 2013). Weather and seasonal climate forecast data\
    \ \nfor the same period was acquired from the Ghana Meteorological Agency \n(GMet).\
    \ At the end of the data collection period, a third reflection workshop \nwas\
    \ organized to evaluate the process and discuss preliminary results, \nchallenges\
    \ and prospects for future hydro-climatic information services.  \n \nChapter\
    \ 4\n114\n \n \n \nFigure 4.2: Map showing the location of selected communities\
    \ in Northern \nGhana. Socio-institutional and biophysical characteristics of\
    \ the study area \nhave been described by Nyadzi et al., (2018). \n \n4.2.2 Data\
    \ analysis \n \nData were analysed in three main ways. First, the grid function\
    \ of the mental \nmodeller was used to analyse the relationship (probability of\
    \ influence) that \neach IEI had with a predicted phenomenon. Second, 214 days\
    \ of \nobservational and forecast data from 12 farmers and GMet was used for the\
    \ \nstatistical analysis. We analysed spatiotemporal variations (monthly, seasonal\
    \ \nand annual totals) in GMet and farmers’ observed rainfall data using excel\
    \ \n2016 version. Also, we evaluated the skills (accuracy) in predicting rain\
    \ \n(Yes/No) and the types of rain (low, medium and high rainfall) using a \n\
    dichotomous forecast verification method based on the recommendations of \nthe\
    \ World Meteorological Organization and widely used by meteorologist to \nevaluate\
    \ forecast (Mason, 2003; Mariani et al., 2007; Bumke et al., 2012; \nWMO, 2014;\
    \ Fekri & Yau, 2016). A 2×2 contingency matrix was generated \nusing a pivot table\
    \ in excel 2016 version. The pivot table was used to evaluate \nthe sequence of\
    \ the binary forecasts as a performance measure to determine \nTechniques and\
    \ skills of indigenous weather and seasonal climate forecast\n115\n \nthe number\
    \ of (a) hits, (b) false alarms, (c) misses, and (d) correct rejections \n(Hogan\
    \ and Mason, 2012). We estimated onset from farmers’ observation by \nlooking\
    \ at any week in the initial period of a rainy season, within which \nrainfall\
    \ amounts total at least 25 mm (Popov & Frere, 1986). We also tested \nthe statistical\
    \ difference among the 12 farmers, and between farmers and \nGMet forecast and\
    \ observation at an alpha level of 95% using R statistical \nprogramme. The average\
    \ performance of farmers was estimated by \ncalculating the average hit rate of\
    \ the 12 farmers. The performance of GMet \nforecast in each community was also\
    \ computed by comparing GMet forecast \nagainst each of the community’s observation.\
    \ We also compared GMet and \nfarmers forecast skills. We did this despite existing\
    \ differences in location of \nrain gauges and spatial variation of rainfall because\
    \ comparing the skills and \nnot the method of forecast generation is still meaningful.\
    \ However, it is worth \nnoting that the performance of farmers forecast is an\
    \ average of 12 farmers \ncompared to GMet forecast though generated from multiple\
    \ forecast models \nbut from one source. Third, the reliability and usability\
    \ of IEIs collected for \nthe season were analysed in addition to forecasting\
    \ certainty expressed as sure \nfor high, so sure for higher and very sure for\
    \ highest certainty. Usability \ndenotes the number of times an IEI has been used.\
    \ Reliability was estimated \nin two main ways; first from farmers’ perception\
    \ at the workshop presented \nin Table 4.1. Second, from the empirical data collected\
    \ from the mobile app \nwith a working definition of the number of times an IEI\
    \ gave an accurate \nprediction out of the number of times it was used within\
    \ the study period, all \nexpressed in percentage. Details of the mental model,\
    \ binary forecast \nverification and Sapelli are described in items B1, B2 and\
    \ B3 of the \nsupplementary document.   \n \n4.3 Results  \n \n4.3.1 Farmers’\
    \ techniques and use of indigenous ecological indicators for \nforecasting  \n\
    \ \nFindings from the workshops show that farmers in Northern Ghana use both \n\
    indigenous forecasts (IF) and scientific forecast (SF), but give preference to\
    \ \nIF because of its reliability for farm decision-making. They find their own\
    \ \nindigenous weather forecast more reliable than their seasonal forecast. \n\
    Farmers unanimously expressed much difficulty in predicting seasonal events \n\
    than daily weather events, stating that indigenous ecological indicators (IEIs),\
    \ \nare often not clear enough for long-term predictions. However, at the \nworkshop,\
    \ nine farmers claim they could forecast accurately 5 out of 10 times \nseasonal\
    \ events such as onset, cessation and wetter/dryer/normal season. \nChapter 4\n\
    116\n \nUncertainties in their own seasonal climate forecasts force farmers to\
    \ \ncomplementarily use SF in addition to their IF. Farmers also recognize the\
    \ \ndifficulties in making IF in recent years because of continuous environmental\
    \ \nchanges.  \n \n Results show that farmers rely on a number of IEIs for predicting\
    \ the weather \nand seasonal climate. Their forecast technique is based on observational\
    \ \nchanges in IEIs such as sound, phenology, shape and movements in the \nbehaviour\
    \ of animals, plants, insects and heavenly bodies (such as sun and \nmoon). These\
    \ observable changes in IEIs have their generally held \ninterpretations depending\
    \ on which event is to be predicted and whether for \nshort or longer time scale\
    \ (see Table 3). The presence of observable changes \nin IEIs generally indicates\
    \ the occurrence of a particular event while their \nabsence indicates the non-occurrence,\
    \ except in some situations. For example, \nIEIs such as rainbow in the sky, lepisiota\
    \ ant (Lepisiota capensis) carrying its \neggs from uphill to downhill in the\
    \ rainy season and a cloudless sky implies \nthe non-occurrence of rains. According\
    \ to the farmers, the reliability of IEIs \nfor forecasting varies due to rapid\
    \ environmental changes (Table 4.1). \n \nFarmers consider forecasting techniques\
    \ as a skill acquired through long-term \nlearning process and therefore age and\
    \ experience of the person are crucial \nfor providing a reliable indigenous forecast.\
    \ Forecasting skills are either \nlearned from the elderly or developed through\
    \ learning-by-doing, i.e. \nobservation of changes in one’s environment. Farmers\
    \ also acknowledge \ncertain individuals who are locally called “sabanda” meaning\
    \ “bearer of rain \nknowledge”. These persons are known in the community to have\
    \ \nextraordinarily accurate prediction skills especially for long-term seasonal\
    \ \nclimate events. Their predictions are based on instincts, which is purported\
    \ to \nbe a divine gift, rather than from using IEIs. These individuals consult\
    \ deity \nfor rains when their communities are experiencing long term dry periods.\
    \ For \nthese reasons and the fact that their predictions are not rationale, such\
    \ \nindividuals were not included in our study. \n \nDifferent IEIs are used to\
    \ predict different weather and seasonal climate \nevents, as well as their severity.\
    \ The occurrence or presence of each IEI \nsignals different probability for an\
    \ event to occur. For example, to forecast \ndaily rainfall; clouds, mosquitoes\
    \ (Culicidae), butterflies (Amblyscirtes) and \nfrog (Xenopus laevis) have a probability\
    \ of up to 0.25, 0.5 and 1 for low, \nmedium and high rainfall to occur respectively\
    \ (see Table C1 for definition \nof low, medium and high rainfall). The other\
    \ IEIs have varying probability \nwith the type of rain to expect. The appearance\
    \ of all the IEIs has different \nTechniques and skills of indigenous weather\
    \ and seasonal climate forecast\n117\n \ndegrees of relationship with onset prediction\
    \ except for stars and sun. Ants \n(Lepisiota capensis) and stars are the only\
    \ indicators that have a relationship \nwith rainfall cessation. For rainfall\
    \ amount; all the IEIs have a varying \nrelationship with below, normal and above\
    \ normal rainfall except stars. \nDetails of how each IEI influences the probabilities\
    \ of an event are presented \nin the mental model (Figure C4 and Table C10 of\
    \ the supplementary \ndocument). Results show that a large number of the same\
    \ IEIs are used for \nboth weather and seasonal predictions, depending on the\
    \ signals they exhibit. \nHowever, IEIs such as dogs (Canis lupus familiaris),\
    \ reptiles (such as snakes \n- family colubridae), stars and trees (such as baobab\
    \ tree- adansonia digitate) \nare used only for seasonal climate forecast while\
    \ soil texture, for example, is \nused for weather forecast only. \n \nChapter\

    \ Skills of Farmers and GMet Rainfall weather forecast   \n \nFarmers’ observational\
    \ data show rainfall patterns that begin to build up in \nApril, peaks in July\
    \ and then start to decline in August until October. At the \nseasonal time scale,\
    \ June July August (JJA) recorded the highest rainfall \namount, followed by September-October\
    \ (SO) with the least recorded in \nApril-May (AM) season. The sum of annual rainfall\
    \ recorded by farmers was \non average 15.5% more than what GMet observed. Results\
    \ also show \nfarmers’ locally observed rainfall amounts vary from one community\
    \ to the \nother (Figure C1). The total annual rainfall ranged from 492 mm in\
    \ Saakuba \nto 1563 mm in Kushibo. Total rainfall amount recorded in Kushibo was\
    \ \n43.9% more than the average annual rainfall of 1000 mm observed by Owusu \n\
    & Waylen (2009) for the study area. Gbulun and Kukuo showed the same \nrainfall\
    \ amount of 1243 mm representing the second highest rainfall total. The \nstudy\
    \ area is characterized by high records of low rainfall days compared to \nmedium\
    \ and then high rainfall. The total number of rainy days ranged from \n22 in Tibung\
    \ to 49 days in Zangbalun. GMet recorded high number of \nobserved rainy days\
    \ over the study area compared to what each farmer \nrecorded (see Table C3 of\
    \ supporting document). The difference in rainy days \nwas largely associated\
    \ with the high number of low rainfall days recorded by \nGMet, which could be\
    \ attributed to the sensitivity of meteorological \ninstruments as compared to\
    \ the rain gauges used by the farmers in this \nresearch. Also, this could be\
    \ due to the number of farmers’ rain gauges (12) \ncompared to one GMet rain gauge\
    \ and the spatial variation between them, \nthus reflecting the strong spatial\
    \ variability in rainfall in even very small \nareas. \n \nResults of farmers\
    \ and GMet weather forecast performance within the study \narea show that, for\
    \ the seven months period, farmers’ performed at an average \nof 30% while GMet\
    \ performed at 34% (performance hereafter means hit rate \nor number of rain events\
    \ accurately predicted). The average performance of \nGMet in each community was\
    \ 32%. Meanwhile, within the seven months, \nfarmers’ performance varied from\
    \ 16% accuracy in Wuba to 61% in \nZangbalun. Farmers in Dalun and Gbugli also\
    \ performed at 43% and 47%, \nrespectively and the rest performed at less than\
    \ the average of 30%. GMet \nforecast outperformed farmers forecast in most communities\
    \ except Dalun, \nZangbalun and Gbugli where farmers forecast performed at 3%,\
    \ 25%, and \n14% more (see Table C3 and B4 of supporting documents). However,\
    \ on the \naverage, both farmers and GMet showed similar performance rate of \n\
    predicting one out of every three daily rainfall events right. Farmers recorded\
    \ \nmany correct rejections (No rain/No rain). Results also showed that the \n\
    Chapter 4\n122\n \nmonthly performance of GMet and farmers varies but insignificantly\
    \ \n(P>0.05), although farmers performed better than GMet in May, June and \n\
    October. The monthly performance ranged from 21% in September to 46% \nin October\
    \ for farmers and 20% in May and October to 56% in August and \nSeptember for\
    \ GMet (see Table C3 and B4 of supporting documents). \n \nOut of 214 observational\
    \ data for the 7 months’ period under study, GMet \nand farmers’ forecast show\
    \ both agreement and disagreement with the actual \nobservations within the communities.\
    \ On average, both forecast systems \ndisagreed 84 times (39%) and agreed 130\
    \ times (61%). Out of the 130 agreed \ntimes, 3 hits, 100 correct rejections,\
    \ 12 miss and 15 false alarms were \nrecorded. Table C5 of the supplementary document\
    \ provides details of \nagreement and disagreement of the forecast. In addition,\
    \ farmers generally \nhave poor ability to forecast rainfall types. They recorded\
    \ an average hit \nperformance of 17%, 16% and 6% for low, medium and high rainfall\
    \ types \nrespectively. The hit performance was poor:  0% for high rainfall in\
    \ 8 \ncommunities, 0% for medium rainfall in 4 communities, and 0% for low \n\
    rainfall in 2 communities. However, each farmer had a better hit rate for low\
    \ \nrainfall than medium and high rains (See Table C6 of the supplementary \n\
    document). \n \n \n4.3.3 Reliability and usability of IEIs used by farmers for\
    \ rainfall weather \nforecast \n \nFigure 4.3 shows how often the indicators were\
    \ used during the study period \nand how reliable they were. Here, usability is\
    \ the number of times an IEI has \nbeen used per the seven month period of study\
    \ and reliability is the number \nof times an IEI gave an accurate prediction\
    \ out of the number of times used \nwithin the seven months period, all expressed\
    \ in percentage. Results of \nreliability presented in Figure 4.3 is empirically\
    \ determined compared to what \nis obtained from farmers’ perception presented\
    \ in Table 4.1. Reliability here \nis the number of times an IEI gave an accurate\
    \ prediction out of the number \nof times it was used within the seven month study\
    \ period, all expressed in \npercentage. Results show that on the average each\
    \ IEI was used 42 times. \nAlso, at 95% confident level (19.6), the interval between\
    \ 22.76 (lower bound) \nand 61.99 (upper bound) contains the true value of the\
    \ population parameter \n(mean). Details of descriptive statistics of this analysis\
    \ are shown in Table \nC11 of the supplementary document. Generally, results of\
    \ empirical analysis \nin Figure 4.3 show that butterflies (Amblyscirtes), mosquitoes\
    \ (Culicidae), \nbird sound, caterpillars (Larva) and moon, were five most reliable\
    \ IEIs during \nTechniques and skills of indigenous weather and seasonal climate\
    \ forecast\n123\n \nthe study period. Butterflies (Amblyscirtes) and soil appearance\
    \ were the \nmost reliable (45.5%) and least reliable (7.7%) IEI used respectively.\
    \ \nHowever, according to the farmers, during the evaluation workshop, the \n\
    appearance of butterflies (Amblyscirtes) is becoming rare in the area, thus it\
    \ \nthe least used IEI. Meanwhile, hot weather is the most used (138 times, \n\
    20.2%) IEI in the study area followed by clouds appearance (118 times, \n17.4%).\
    \  \n \n \nFigure 4.3: Reliability and Usability of indigenous Ecological indicators\
    \ for \npredicting Yes/No Rain  \n \nMoving a step further, we analyzed the reliability\
    \ of IEIs for forecasting \ndifferent types of rain (low, medium and high rains).\
    \ Results show that ants \nare the most reliable (83%) IEI for forecasting low\
    \ rains. Cow (Bos Taurus), \nduck (Anas Platyrhynchos) and frog showed 100% reliability\
    \ in forecasting \nmedium rainfall while earthworm (Lumbricina) and wind were\
    \ the most \nreliable (100%) IEIs for high rainfall forecast. Hot weather is the\
    \ most used \nIEI for forecasting low rains while cloud formation is mostly utilized\
    \ for \nmedium and high rains (see figure C2 of the supplementary document). \n\
    Results show that farmers’ certainty does not significantly correlate with \n\
    forecast performance. No consistent trend was observed in their expression \n\
    of certainty. In most cases, they miss the rains even at higher certainty and\
    \ hit \nat a lower certainty (see table C7 and B8 of the supplementary document).\
    \ \nWhen this was raised at the evaluation workshop, one farmer indicated that\
    \ \n“sometimes I see very clear signs of rain and become so sure that it will\
    \ rain \nChapter 4\n124\n \nin my village only for the rain to rather fall in\
    \ a neighbouring village”, this \njustification was unanimously supported by all\
    \ farmers. \n \n4.3.4 Farmers and GMet forecasting skills at the seasonal timescale\
    \   \n \nPrior to the rainfall season, GMet provided a seasonal forecast for the\
    \ period \nof April to October 2017. The Western and Eastern halves of Northern\
    \ Ghana \nwere predicted to experience near normal to above normal and normal\
    \ rainfall \namount respectively (GMet, 2017). Based on the location of Kumbungu\
    \ \ndistrict, rainfall was expected to be near-normal to normal.  The mean onset\
    \ \ndate of the rainy season was forecast to be from 4th week of April to 1st\
    \ week \nof May. The range of the expected rainfall amount over the entire region\
    \ was \n1090-1360 mm and the mean cessation date was forecasted to be the end\
    \ of \nOctober (GMet, 2017). Prior to the season and during the second workshop,\
    \ \nfarmers forecasted rainfall amount, onset and cessation using various \necological\
    \ IEIs listed in Table C9 of the supplementary document. They did \nnot use IEIs\
    \ for rainfall cessation because there were no clear signs. Instead, \nthey relied\
    \ on their experience. 58% of the farmers predicted normal rainfall \nseason,\
    \ 33% predicted above normal and only 9% predicted below normal \nrainfall. For\
    \ the onset of the season, 25% of the farmers predicted the second \nweek of April,\
    \ 50% predicted the third week while the remaining 25% \npredicted it to occur\
    \ in the fourth week of April.  \n \nAll farmers agreed rainfall cessation would\
    \ be in October. Nonetheless, 41% \nforecast it in the 1st week, 17% forecast\
    \ 2nd week, 17% in the 3rd week and the \nremaining 25% forecast it in the 4th\
    \ week of October. Comparing each \nfarmer’s forecast to its own recorded observations,\
    \ results show that, 33% of \nthe farmers got the onset prediction right while\
    \ 42% were right with cessation. \nUsing GMet estimated range of annual normal\
    \ rainfall of 740-1230 mm \n(GMet, 2017), we observed that 33% of the farmers\
    \ predicted the near-normal \nrainfall of their communities right while only 9%\
    \ predicted the observed \nabove normal rainfall right. The other farmers incorrectly\
    \ predicted the \nrainfall cessation. GMet, on the other hand, predicted accurately\
    \ the rainfall \namount (near normal) for 42% of the communities and onset for\
    \ only 25% of \nthe communities but was unable to forecast correctly cessation\
    \ for any of the \ncommunities (see Supplementary Table C9 for details). \n \n\
    4.4 Discussions  \n \nThis study aimed to show for the first time, the techniques\
    \ and skills \n(accuracy) of indigenous forecast (IF) in semi-quantitative and\
    \ quantitative \nTechniques and skills of indigenous weather and seasonal climate\
    \ forecast\n125\n \nterms. It elaborated on how IF are generated by local farmers\
    \ in northern \nGhana and established a communal model of the relationship (semi-\n\
    quantitatively) between indigenous ecological indicators (IEI) used and the \n\
    phenomenon forecasted at both daily and seasonal timescale. It also evaluated\
    \ \nskills (quantitatively) in IF compared with the Ghana Meteorological Agency\
    \ \n(GMet).  \n \nResults of the forecast evaluation showed that on the average,\
    \ both farmers \nand GMet correctly predict one out of every three daily rainfall\
    \ events. At the \nseasonal scale, one out of every three farmers is able to accurately\
    \ make onset \nprediction while two out of every five farmers are able to get\
    \ rainfall amount \nand cessation right. Similarly, GMet was able to predict rainfall\
    \ amount \naccurately in one out of every three communities and one out of every\
    \ four \ncommunities for onset but was unable to accurately predict cessation\
    \ for the \ncommunities. A possible explanation for differences in farmers’ forecasts\
    \ is \nthat, first, each farmer has different predicting skills which stems from\
    \ the \nability to accurately observe and interpret IEIs per one’s experience.\
    \ The \nsecond could be attributed to farmers losing interest in the data collection\
    \ \nprocess and thus do not make a critical observation of IEIs before forecasting\
    \ \nalthough monthly skill test did not confirm this trend. While little could\
    \ be \ndone to improve the former, the latter could be avoided by offering attractive\
    \ \nincentives to farmers and maintaining frequent contact. In this study, farmers\
    \ \nwere promised that they could keep the mobile phones at the end of the study\
    \ \nas a way of motivation.  The third reason for the differences in the prediction\
    \ \nskills of the farmers at the weather time scale could be attributed to the\
    \ impact \nof climate change on the ecosystem that might have affected the relationship\
    \ \nbetween the IEIs and the meteorological phenomenon forecasted. Thus, the \n\
    information fed into the Mental Modeler may not reflect the future \nrelationship\
    \ between the IEIs and the phenomenon forecasted. For example, \nonset and cessation\
    \ dates could be affected if say they occur a number of days \nafter the appearance\
    \ of butterflies. If the butterflies now appear earlier or later \nthan before,\
    \ then this could affect the prediction.  \n \nHistorical patterns of the rains\
    \ serve as the fundamental template that allows \nfarmers to form expectations\
    \ for the coming season. Results of this study \nconfirm that observed changes\
    \ in each IEI strongly influenced farmers’ \npredictions. Farmers’ perception\
    \ of the most reliable indicators was different \nfrom the results of empirical\
    \ analysis. For instance, for weather forecast, \nfarmers mentioned earthworm\
    \ (Lumbricina), clouds, ducks (Anas \nPlatyrhynchos), caterpillars (Larva) and\
    \ butterflies (Amblyscirtes) as the five \nmost reliable indicators, meanwhile,\
    \ empirical results show butterflies \nChapter 4\n126\n \n(Amblyscirtes), mosquitoes\
    \ (Culicidae), bird sound, caterpillars (Larva) and \nmoon, as most reliable.\
    \ These results indicate the possibility of perceptional \nmeasurement being significantly\
    \ different from the real-time measurement. \nTherefore, care needs to be taken\
    \ when testing the reliability of IEIs and \nfarmers forecast skills using perceptional\
    \ methods only, as in Makwara \n(2013) and Elia et al., (2014).  However, these\
    \ differences could also be \ncaused by seasonal differences.  \n \nResults of\
    \ the mental model allowed us to establish the underlying \nmechanism behind farmers’\
    \ prediction. For instance, when one comes across \na high frequency swirling\
    \ winds in the dry season, this may indicate the onset \nof rains but also provides\
    \ a higher probability of above normal rain than below \nand normal rainfall.\
    \ The appearance of a halo around the sun has a higher \nprobability for predicting\
    \ medium rainfall than high and low rainfall. \nFrequent and painful bite of mosquitoes\
    \ in the day during the wet season \nindicate a higher chance of recording high\
    \ rain the next day compared to \nmedium and low rain. This implies that the process\
    \ of how IF is made is not \nonly intuitive but also based on a rational skill\
    \ which can be learned and \npassed on from one generation to the next. Established\
    \ communal mental \nmodels are modified over time depending on observable environmental\
    \ \nchanges. The value of IEIs in developing forecasting tools is critical. Careful\
    \ \nexamination of the relationship between these IEIs and predicted weather and\
    \ \nseasonal climate events are useful for developing integrated forecast models\
    \ \nthat use IEIs in combination with initial conditions of the atmosphere (wind\
    \ \ndirection and atmospheric pressure etc.) for forecasting local weather and\
    \ \nseasonal climate conditions (see Andrade & Gosling, 2011). Also, IEIs could\
    \ \nbe used as a starting hypothesis for building local predictive models \ndeveloped\
    \ with historical observation for local communities (Waiswa et al., \n2007). Once\
    \ the probability of occurrence of an IF is determined, this could \nbe integrated\
    \ with scientific forecast (SF) using their probabilities. \n \nWe acknowledge\
    \ the limitations of using data from only a single wet season. \nThis did not\
    \ allow for inter-annual variability assessment. Moreover, the \nnumber of farmers\
    \ in each community should be increased to analyse within \nand between community\
    \ variation of results. However, results show that \npattern of monthly and seasonal\
    \ rainfall recorded by farmers are similar to \nthose measured with meteorological\
    \ instruments in Northern Ghana by GMet \nand other studies such as Lacombe et\
    \ al., (2012) and Manzanas et al., (2014). \nThis provides confidence about the\
    \ quality of farmers’ observations. The \nfrequency (rainy days) and amount of\
    \ rainfall, however, differ significantly \namong farmers and between farmers\
    \ and GMet. In addition, we recognise the \nTechniques and skills of indigenous\
    \ weather and seasonal climate forecast\n127\n \ndifferences in GMet and farmers\
    \ forecast as an indication of the distances \nbetween rain gauges and strong\
    \ rainfall variability even over small areas. It is \ncommon knowledge how it\
    \ rains in one place but does not rain at a nearby \nlocation. However, a comparison\
    \ of forecasts could be meaningful as the \nforecast themselves could be compared\
    \ irrespective of the variation and \nmethod used to arrive at the forecast. Basically,\
    \ it is a comparison of the skills \nof the different forecast systems and we\
    \ did this by taking the average of \nfarmers forecast skills as a representative\
    \ of the entire area compared it to \nGMet skills where the performance was almost\
    \ the same. Moreover, on \noccasions when GMet forecast was compared to the farmers’\
    \ observation, this \nwas aimed at establishing how spatial variation could affect\
    \ forecast skills or \naccuracy. This was done in order to make a case for every\
    \ community having \nrain gauges for recording rainfall and forecast must be issued\
    \ at community \nlevel instead of regional level as done now. For instance, GMet\
    \ has a single \nweather station with rain gauge that measures rainfall for a\
    \ wider area, which \nin most cases did not represent what is actually happening\
    \ within the \ncommunities making farmers prefer their own forecast to GMet. These\
    \ \nvariations could have significant implication on impact studies that do not\
    \ \ntake into account spatial variations in rainfall. There is, therefore, the\
    \ need to \nmount in each community additional rain gauges to record locally observed\
    \ \nrainfall, in order to generate data that is relevant for studying local rainfall\
    \ \nvariability and change. In line with this, some studies have argued the need\
    \ \nto pay attention to smaller details in each geographic area since this can\
    \ have \na bigger impact on local climate(Frumkin et al., 2008; Maibach et al.,\
    \ 2008). \n \nThe result shows that knowledge possessed by local people can contribute\
    \ to \nclimate science by offering observations and interpretation at a much finer\
    \ \nspatial scale with considerable temporal depth, and by highlighting aspects\
    \ \n(in this case indigenous ecological indicators) that may not be considered\
    \ by \nclimate scientists (Mafongoya & Ajayi, 2017). Therefore, farmers in \n\
    communities where meteorological observation are not available can be \nengaged\
    \ to collect community level weather and climate information and \ndata. In the\
    \ process, local farmers are empowered and become more aware of \nspatial and\
    \ temporal variability in rainfall(McCormick, 2009). Finally, some \nstudies have\
    \ already proposed the integration of indigenous and scientific \nforecast to\
    \ increase community resilience (Hiwasaki et al., 2015; Nyadzi et \nal., 2018).\
    \ While we found both forecasting systems in general to have similar \nskills,\
    \ there were some specific rainfall events that both forecasts disagree, \nthus\
    \ making integration both potentially useful especially in increasing \nforecast\
    \ accuracy and/or the trust of the forecast. Long term data sets need to \nChapter\
    \ 4\n128\n \nbe collected to understand the potential of integrating indigenous\
    \ and \nscientific forecasts under climate change.  \n \n4.5. Conclusion  \n \n\
    Local people’s contribution to climate science can be vital but is typically \n\
    overlooked. In this study, we have illustrated the accuracy of indigenous \nforecasts\
    \ (IF) generated by farmers and provided insight into the underlying \nmechanisms\
    \ behind farmers’ forecasting techniques. We observed that in \naddition to farmers\
    \ using historical patterns of the rains as a basis for IF, they \nalso use different\
    \ indigenous ecological indicators (IEIs) for local rain \nforecast through an\
    \ established mental model of how these IEI influence the \noccurrence of different\
    \ weather and seasonal climate events. They generate \nIF by observing the presence\
    \ or absence of IEIs which signals the occurrence \nor non-occurrence of a particular\
    \ event at both daily and seasonal time scale. \nTherefore, IF are not intuitive\
    \ but a skill rationally developed which improved \nwith age and experience. Also,\
    \ farmers’ perception of reliability of IEIs and \nskills are different from observational\
    \ analyses and therefore care should be \ntaken when making a conclusion based\
    \ on perception studies only. However, \nfarmers and GMet showed similar skills\
    \ in their forecast; correctly predicting \none out of every three daily rainfall\
    \ occurrences. We conclude that farmers \ncan contribute to climate science by\
    \ offering their local expertise as well as \ncollect community-level weather\
    \ and climate information and data that is \nbeneficial to developing climate\
    \ services and climate change adaptation \npractices. \n \nAcknowledgement  \n\

    \ forecast to improve forecast reliability and acceptability  \n \nAbstract \n\
    \ \nExtreme weather events and climate change are affecting the livelihoods of\
    \ \nfarmers across the world. Accessible and actionable weather and seasonal \n\
    climate information can be used as an adaptation tool to support farmers to \n\
    take adaptive farming decisions. There are increasing calls to integrate \nscientific\
    \ forecasts with indigenous forecasts to improve weather and \nseasonal climate\
    \ information at local scale. In Northern Ghana, farmers \ncomplain about the\
    \ quality of scientific forecast information thereby \ndepending on their own\
    \ indigenous forecast for taking adaptive decisions. To \nimprove this, we developed\
    \ an integrated probability forecast (IPF) method \nto combine scientific and\
    \ indigenous forecast into a single forecast and tested \nits reliability using\
    \ binary forecast verification method as a proof of concept. \nWe also evaluated\
    \ the acceptability of IPF by farmers by computing an index \nfrom multiple-response\
    \ questions including a good internal consistency \ncheck. Results show that,\
    \ for reliability, IPF performed on average better than \nindigenous and scientific\
    \ forecast at a daily timescale. For the seasonal \ntimescale, indigenous forecast\
    \ overall performed better followed by IPF and \nthen scientific forecast. However,\
    \ IPF has far greater acceptability potential.  \nAbout 93% of farmers prefer\
    \ the IPF method as this provides a reliable \nforecast, requires less time and\
    \ at the same time helps to deal with \ncontradicting forecast information. Results\
    \ also show that farmers already use \ninsights from both forecasts (complementary)\
    \ to make farming decisions. \nHowever, their complementary method does not resolve\
    \ the issues of \ncontradicting forecast information. We conclude based on our\
    \ proof of \nconcept that integrating indigenous and scientific forecast has high\
    \ \nacceptability and can potentially increase forecast reliability and uptake.\

    Submitted as:\nWeather and climate services that integrate indigenous and scientific\
    \ forecast\n133\n \n5.1 Introduction \n \nFarmers across the globe, particularly\
    \ in Africa use weather and climate \ninformation from indigenous and meteorological\
    \ sources for risk-based \ndecisions (Mapfumo et al., 2015; Orlove et al., 2010;\
    \ Roudier et al., 2014). In \nGhana, farmers often approach a season using indigenous\
    \ forecast (IF) which \nis built on past experiences, empirical observations of\
    \ ecological indicators, \nand traditional knowledge. Sometimes, they use IF in\
    \ combination with \nmeteorological scientific forecast (SF) to adjust farm activities\
    \ against \nclimate variability and change (Furman et al., 2011; Nyantakyi-Frimpong,\
    \ \n2013). However, both IF and SF have distinct weaknesses which pose \nchallenges\
    \ for their use (Ziervogel & Opere, 2010). \n \nFirst of all, Klopper and Landman,\
    \ (2003) observed that end-users are often \nconfused about what decision to take\
    \ when forecast information comes from \ndifferent sources, especially in cases\
    \ where they produce contradicting \nforecasts. Second, SF is often developed\
    \ at a coarse spatial scale compared to \nIF and therefore does not address farmers’\
    \ local needs (Orlove et al. 2010). \nThird, policy makers and scientists often\
    \ view IF with much scepticism as it \nis qualitative and has a measure of spirituality\
    \ that is absent in SF (Briggs & \nMoyo, 2012; Kolawole et al., 2014; Saitabau,\
    \ 2014). SFs, on the other hand, \nare not always embraced by farmers due to the\
    \ absence of a sense of \nownership and lack of trust in service providers. This\
    \ reduces the uptake of \nweather and climate information (Jiri et al., 2016).\
    \  \n \nStudies have indicated that forecast information is more acceptable when\
    \ IF \nand SF are integrated (Ziervogel & Opere, 2010; Gagnon & Berteaux, 2009).\
    \ \nActionable information is often considered more credible, legitimate and \n\
    salient to farmers when it is embedded within the context of their existing \n\
    knowledge (Mafongoya, & Ajayi, 2017; Nyamekye et al., 2018). Moreover, \nclimate\
    \ change offers challenges that can go beyond the experiences of \nfarmers and\
    \ scientists (Huntington et al., 2004).  \n \nTherefore, finding a meeting point\
    \ between the two forms of forecasts could \nset the agenda for integration (Kolawole\
    \ et al. 2014). Such integration should \nideally go beyond the individual outcomes\
    \ of scientific and indigenous \nforecasts. Mafongoya and Ajayi (2017) suggest\
    \ the need for policies and \nactions that promote knowledge co-production through\
    \ collective efforts of \nindigenous people, natural and social scientists (Lemos\
    \ et al., 2018). \nHowever, the question that remains is how IF and SF can be\
    \ integrated whilst \nrespecting the different norms and values. Therefore, this\
    \ study investigated \nChapter 5\n134\n \ntwo objectives: 1) The potential to\
    \ integrate IF and SF and 2) The \nacceptability of a combined forecast, from\
    \ the receivers’ point of view. \n \nThis study is a proof of concept that aimed\
    \ at demonstrating how to \nquantitatively integrate IF and SF to improve the\
    \ reliability and acceptability \nof forecast information by farmers in Ghana.\
    \ To achieve this, the strengths \nand weaknesses of existing integration methods\
    \ were first reviewed and \nanalysed in section 2. Section 3 captures the details\
    \ of the methods adopted \nfor the study. Section 4 presents the results of the\
    \ reliability and acceptability \nof the integrated probability forecast (IPF)\
    \ method proposed. The article ends \nwith a reflection on the findings and the\
    \ actionability of IPF to support \nfarmers’ daily and seasonal decision making\
    \ in section 5. \n \n5.2 Literature review and conceptual framework  \n \nThe\
    \ idea of improving forecast accuracy by integrating forecast from multiple \n\
    models is certainly not new (Clemen, 1989), but there is substantive room for\
    \ \nimprovement to make climate information actionable for farmers. For \nexample,\
    \ Zou & Yang (2004) and Wei (2009) suggested time series analysis \ncombined with\
    \ multiple regression. Adhikari and Agrawal, (2012) also used \na weighted nonlinear\
    \ mechanism for combining forecasts from multiple time \nseries models. Andersson\
    \ & Karlsson (2008) and Raftery et al. (2005) \nproposed Bayesian combinations.\
    \ Others discussed the possibility of \naveraging the probabilities of individual\
    \ forecasts (Ranjan & Gneiting, 2010). \nKlopper and Landman (2003) created a\
    \ single probability forecast by \ncombining different model outputs and concluded\
    \ that the method \nconsistently delivers a more skilful forecast than any individual\
    \ model on its \nown.  \n \nRecent studies on integrating scientific forecast\
    \ (SF) with indigenous forecast \n(IF) can be divided into consensus methods and\
    \ science integration methods \n(Plotz et al., 2017). The consensus methods refer\
    \ to the subjective ways of \nestablishing agreement on the most convincing forecast\
    \ information. Methods \ninclude meetings of experts from the indigenous and scientific\
    \ community to \ndiscuss their forecasts to develop an agreed forecast for the\
    \ coming season \n(Ziervogel and Opere 2010; Guthiga & Newsham, 2011; Mahoo et\
    \ al., 2015). \nThe science integration method refers to ways that objectively\
    \ combine \nforecasts into single source of information using systematically established\
    \ \nscientific techniques. For example, combining IF with statistical or dynamical\
    \ \nweather or climate model outcomes (Andrade & Gosling, 2011; Chand et al.,\
    \ \n2014; Masinde, 2015; Mwagha & Masinde, 2015; Waiswa et al., 2007). \nWeather\
    \ and climate services that integrate indigenous and scientific forecast\n135\n\
    \ \n \nHowever, consensus and scientific integration methods have some \nchallenges;\
    \ the consensus method causes delay since neither group would be \nable to produce\
    \ a combined forecast in the absence of the other. Also, the \ncombined forecast\
    \ cannot always be replicated as there are no clear rules or \nprocesses involved.\
    \ In addition, the consensus method is time and cost \nintensive due to the need\
    \ for regular and meetings. The science integration \nmethod, however, requires\
    \ large amount of data to develop and verify \npredictive models, and it is less\
    \ flexible with regards to cultural sensitivity. \nThe science integration method\
    \ is also limited in its engagement with farmers. \nFarmers are only engaged during\
    \ the time of the initial data gathering required \nto develop the predictive\
    \ model. Subsequent activities including data \ninterpretation and analysis are\
    \ done only by the researchers, limiting the idea \nand value of co-production.\
    \ Moreover, rapid environmental changes have the \npotential to impact the future\
    \ effectiveness of the science integrated method \nsince farmers are no more involved\
    \ once predictive models are built (Plotz et \nal., 2017).  The consensus and\
    \ scientific integration methods do not actually \nintegrate IF and SF into an\
    \ objective single forecast. Climate information \nfrom the science integration\
    \ methods, for example, is only based on \nhistorically observed data from stations\
    \ with IF serving as a driving \nhypothesis for trends. Consensus methods are\
    \ also based on the subjectivity \nof experts.  \n \nGiven the limitations of\
    \ the two groups of methods discussed above, a new \nmethod called the integrated\
    \ probability forecast (IPF) method is proposed. \nThis method is inspired by\
    \ the approach of Klopper and Landman (2003) who \nused a simple unweighted average\
    \ of forecast probability to combine \nscientific forecast from different forecast\
    \ models. The difference with the IPF \nmethod is that it used a weighted average\
    \ technique and combines the strength \nof both consensus and science integration\
    \ methods. This paper referred to the \nIPF method as one that seeks to generate\
    \ the probability of IF and \nquantitatively combines that with the probability\
    \ of SF using simple weighted \naverage techniques. The IPF method integrates\
    \ SF and IF using their forecast \nprobabilities. Unlike IF, weather and seasonal\
    \ climate forecasts from SF \nsystems are produced with their probabilities. Yet\
    \ to integrate IF and SF at \ndaily and seasonal time scale, there is a need to\
    \ estimate the probabilities for \nIF. The probabilities of IF were calculated\
    \ based on the number of people \nforecasting ‘Yes rain’ for the weather, and\
    \ near-normal rainfall, above and \nbelow for seasonal climate forecast [near-normal\
    \ rainfall (740-1230 mm) is \nthe average rainfall value for over a 30-year period].\
    \ Rainfall for each season \nor year may very often be either above, below or\
    \ near the normal. The \nChapter 5\n136\n \ncalculated probability of IF is combined\
    \ with that of SF to form the IPF (see \nsection 5.3.4.1 for details of the proposed\
    \ method). The IPF requires expert \nindigenous forecasters just as in the consensus\
    \ method, but unlike the \nconsensus method, it does not require regular (in)formal\
    \ meetings to agree on \na forecast. IF from several expert forecasters (farmers)\
    \ is collected at a \nparticular time, out of which the probability is estimated\
    \ based on the number \nof experts that forecast events and those that forecast\
    \ otherwise.  \n \nReliability and acceptability of integrated probability method\
    \ \n \nTo assess the actionability of the integrated probability forecast (IPF)\
    \ method, \na reliability and acceptability check is necessary (Whitford et al.\
    \ 2012; \nFriedman and Wyatt 2005). In this study, the reliability of the IPF\
    \ method is \ndefined as being able to produce information that performs better\
    \ than those \navailable, in this case, either the scientific or indigenous forecast.\
    \ According \nto Ziegel, (2004), reliability is a concept that is used to determine\
    \ the \nperformance of a thing, for example a forecast, in order to measure its\
    \ quality. \nThe acceptability of IPF to end-users and researchers partly depends\
    \ on its \nreliability. Acceptance is regarded as a significant factor in determining\
    \ \nsuccess or failure of any innovation, particularly information systems (Gould,\
    \ \net al., 1991; Nickerson, 1981). Acceptability can be defined as a demonstrable\
    \ \nwillingness of an individual or group to trust and use forecast information\
    \ \n(Dillon & Morris, 1996). Dillon and Morris (1996) report that the likelihood\
    \ \nof actual usage could deviate slightly from intended usage, but the essence\
    \ of \nacceptance theory is that such deviations are not significant. \n \n5.3\
    \ Research Methodology  \n \nThis section introduces the case region and discusses\
    \ the methodology used.  \n \n5.3.1 Study area \n \nTo test the IPF method, the\
    \ Kumbungu district in the northern region of \nGhana located in the guinea savannah\
    \ ecological zone was selected. Given \nprevious engagement in this region by\
    \ the research team, the researchers were \nable to use existing data and resources,\
    \ as well as the engagement of farmers \nin the study area. \n \nThe region is\
    \ characterised by lowland and grassland (Abdul-Razak & Kruse, \n2017b). The district\
    \ has a unimodal rainfall pattern which begins from May, \npeaks in July to September,\
    \ and ends in October with the rest of the year being \nWeather and climate services\
    \ that integrate indigenous and scientific forecast\n137\n \ndry (GSS, 2014).\
    \ The district is generally warm with fluctuating mean \nmonthly minimum and maximum\
    \ temperatures of 26.6 °C and 35.6 °C the \nannual temperature is 29.7 °C and\
    \ an average annual rainfall of about 1043 \nmm (SARI, 2016). The district like\
    \ many others in the region is challenged \nby the impacts of climate variability\
    \ and change, such as recurring floods and \ndrought (F. A. Asante & Amuakwa-Mensah,\
    \ 2015). The region is highly \nvulnerable (both ecologically and socially) to\
    \ climate change, a situation \nwhich is intensified by other biophysical and\
    \ human-related issues such as \novergrazing, deforestation, and human-induced\
    \ bush fires (Stanturf et al., \n2015). The people of the study area belong to\
    \ the Dagbani ethnic group with \nagriculture as their main economic activity.\
    \ Agriculture activities are \npredominantly rain-fed and therefore seasonal with\
    \ only a few people \nengaged in dry season irrigation farming in schemes such\
    \ as Bontanga \n(Emmanuel Nyadzi, 2016). About 95% of households in the district\
    \ are \nengaged in agriculture with almost 98% involved in crop farming and poultry\
    \ \n(chicken) production as the most dominant animal reared (GSS, 2014).  \nTo\
    \ answer the research questions, the study used multiple methods using \nprimary\
    \ and secondary data (see Figure 5.1). \n \n \n \nFigure 5.1: Methodological flow\
    \ of the study \n \n \n \nChapter 5\n138\n \n5.3.2 Population and selection of\
    \ sample  \n  \nTo assess the acceptability of integrated probability forecast\
    \ (IPF), a stratified \nrandom sampling technique was used. A total of 108 rice\
    \ farmers from 12 \ndifferent communities (Figure 5.2) were selected for interviews.\
    \ Using this \nmethod allowed us to identify sub-groupings of farmers: 1) irrigated\
    \ rice \nfarmers, 2) rain-fed rice farmers, and 3) both irrigated and rain-fed\
    \ rice \nfarmers. It was assumed that different types of farming practices will\
    \ require \ndifferent types of climate information and so acceptability of IPF\
    \ might differ. \nThe study focused on rice farmers because of the high demand\
    \ for rice in the \narea and the country at large. Yet rice production is crippled\
    \ by climate \nvariability and water unavailability challenges (Kranjac-Berisavljevic’\
    \ et al., \n2003). In each of the 12 communities, 9 farmers were randomly selected;\
    \ 3 \nirrigation farmers, 3 rain-fed farmers, and 3 both irrigation and rain-fed\
    \ \nfarmers. The sampled population included male (72%) and female (28%) \nfarmers\
    \ (see Table D1). In addition to the interviews, a feedback workshop \nwas organised\
    \ with 12 participating rice farmers (one farmer from each \ncommunity) engaged\
    \ in both rain-fed and irrigated rice production.  \n \nTo assess the reliability\
    \ of IPF, IF data was collected from 12 expert farmers, \nall males above 45 years\
    \ of age from 12 different communities within the \nstudy area (Figure 5.2). There\
    \ was no intention to focus on only males but this \nemerged due to the local\
    \ practice. The sampling method adopted concentrated \non selecting the best and\
    \ most trusted forecasters in the community. Farmers \nabove the age of 45 were\
    \ selected because they have at least 30 years of \nfarming experience to guarantee\
    \ their knowledge about how the climate has \nchanged and rainfall become variable\
    \ over the years in their communities. A \nrigorous process was adopted to select\
    \ farmers with good forecasting \ntechniques and skills in order to obtain quality\
    \ data for the analysis. Initial \ninquiries showed that not all farmers are good\
    \ at using indigenous ecological \nindicators (IEIs) for forecasting. Therefore,\
    \ the selection process actively \ninvolved the community members, irrigation\
    \ manager and an extension \nofficer.  \n \nIn each community, members have knowledge\
    \ of who is good at forecasting \ntherefore both researchers and farmers decided\
    \ on who to involve in the \ntrainings and forecasting. During the meetings and\
    \ before the final selection \nthe pre-selected farmers were asked to indicate\
    \ how many rainfall events \ncould each accurately predict out of 10 events. Those\
    \ with the highest \nnumbers were selected and all participants agreed to the\
    \ selected expert \nfarmers. The selected farmers were introduced to smartphones\
    \ and mobile \nWeather and climate services that integrate indigenous and scientific\
    \ forecast\n139\n \napps for the first time. Only a few farmers were selected\
    \ in order to monitor \nand obtain detail insight into the process for forecast\
    \ data collection. This \nallowed the collection of quality forecast data for\
    \ analysis. Farmers were also \ntrained on how to record daily observed rainfall\
    \ with tailor-made rain gauges. \nIn a previous comparative analysis of observed\
    \ rainfall, farmers and Ghana \nmeteorological agency (GMet) show similar rainfall\
    \ pattern of the seasons, \nincreasing our confidence in farmers' data. Also,\
    \ by involving the community \nin the selection process and considering their\
    \ interest as well as confirming \nwho should be involved in the study, one can\
    \ be certain that forecast \ninformation would be trusted by all. Moreover, the\
    \ expert farmers already \nmentioned that through this study they have become\
    \ a source of forecast \ninformation for other farmers in their respective communities.\
    \ The expert \nfarmers have somehow become formally recognised for their expertise\
    \ \nthereby increasing the number of people who consult them regularly for \n\
    forecast information. Roncoli et al., (2009) similarly opined the value of \n\
    promoting local ownership and generating trust when users of climate \ninformation\
    \ are involved in the production and dissemination.  \n \n \nFigure 5.2: Map of\
    \ the study area positioned in Ghana. The red triangles show \nthe location of\
    \ farmers and their respective selected communities (Nyadzi et \nal., 2019). \n\
    Chapter 5\n140\n \n5.3.3 Research instruments and data collection  \n  \nThe study\
    \ used three main types of data; (i) indigenous and scientific forecast \ndata\
    \ (ii) interview data (iii) feedback and discussion workshop data. (i) The \n\
    indigenous forecast data was collected from 12 expert farmers who sent their \n\
    daily predictions (in 2017) through smart mobile phones with apps and their \n\
    seasonal predictions collected at a workshop in 2017 and 2018 (See section \n\
    3.3.1 for details on the mobile app). The scientific forecast data at both daily\
    \ \nand seasonal timescale were obtained from the Ghana Meteorological \nAgency.\
    \ (ii) Interview data from 108 farmers were collected in 2018 and (iii) \nFeedback\
    \ and discussion data were gathered during workshops in 2018. Each \nof these\
    \ data sets were used for specific analysis. For instance, the indigenous \nand\
    \ scientific daily and seasonal forecast data were used for the integration \n\
    and testing of the IPF method. The interview data were used to evaluate the \n\
    acceptability of IPF. The workshop data was used to evaluate the preliminary \n\
    results of the interviews and indigenous forecast collected. In addition, the\
    \ \nworkshop also provided the opportunity to enhance the discussion of why the\
    \ \nIPF method is most preferred by farmers.  \n \nIn a previous case study in\
    \ the region, the researchers studied the various \necological indicators farmers\
    \ use for forecasting and assigned to them \nscientific names. During one of the\
    \ workshops, the researchers defined and \nexplained the technical terminologies\
    \ assigned to what farmers already know \nusing simple illustrations they relate\
    \ to. For example, researchers and farmers \ntogether agreed on Low rainfall (0.1\
    \ -19mm/day) as rain that starts from \ndrizzling to rains that do not wet the\
    \ soil to capacity. Medium rains (19 -\n37mm/day) are rains that wet the soil\
    \ to capacity and high or heavy rains (> \n37mm/day) as rains that gathers water\
    \ in farms and sometimes makes crops \nfail.  The rainfall values were obtained\
    \ from Lacombe et al., (2012). Above \nnormal seasonal rainfall was explained\
    \ as when the season has more rains \nthan often observed and is much wetter than\
    \ normal (mostly with higher \nyield). Below normal was explained as when the\
    \ season will have less rain \nthan observed or is much drier than normal (mostly\
    \ with lower yield), Near \nNormal is when the season will be as it often is (mostly\
    \ average yield). Onset \nwas also explained as when the rain will start (when\
    \ to start planting).  \n5.3.4 Ethical considerations \n  \nWhile there was no\
    \ formal research ethical clearance required of us before \nthe data collection,\
    \ we adopted an appropriate community entry procedure \nseeking permission from\
    \ chief and leaders of the communities. We gave prior \nnotice to the regional\
    \ and district offices of the government. It was also vital \nWeather and climate\
    \ services that integrate indigenous and scientific forecast\n141\n \nto respect\
    \ the opinions and rights of the indigenous people, be aware of local \nlaws,\
    \ formal and informal governance arrangements in addition to \nrecognizing the\
    \ diversity of indigenous people (perspective, religious, \nculture, the language)\
    \ between and within communities. This is essential for \nthe planning and executing\
    \ the research and to a larger extent for reporting. \nFor instance, in our case,\
    \ religion played a role in scheduling our activities. \nThe majority of the farmers\
    \ were Muslims and do not farm on Fridays. \nTherefore, we plan most activities\
    \ on Fridays but outside praying hours. Also, \nwe did not schedule our workshops\
    \ in the mornings because farmers prefer to \nbe on their farms. \n \n5.3.4.1\
    \ Android mobile app (‘Sapelli’) and Rain Gauges   \n  \nIndigenous rainfall forecast\
    \ data was collected using the Sapelli mobile app \n(see Figure D1). Sapelli is\
    \ an open-source project that facilitates data \ncollection across language or\
    \ literacy barriers through highly configurable \ndecision-tree of a pictorial\
    \ icon-driven user interface. According to Stevens \net al., (2013), Sapelli has\
    \ a powerful visualisation capability that allows usage \nby people with low literacy.\
    \ Users can select options by simply touching the \nscreen of the mobile device\
    \ and do not have to read the text. The Sapelli \nplatform allows offline data\
    \ collection, postponing data transmission to a later \nstage and does not rely\
    \ on internet connection. This function makes it possible \nto use in areas where\
    \ network connectivity is rare, unstable, slow or \nexpensive, and when users\
    \ lack phone experience. Vitos et al., (2013) for \nexample, used Sapelli to support\
    \ non-literate people to monitor poaching in \nCongo. In our context, the app\
    \ was coded to provide an interactive interface, \nsuitable for use by farmers\
    \ with little or no technical knowledge and \neducation.  The app was uploaded\
    \ on smartphones distributed to the 12 expert \nforecasters (rice farmers) to\
    \ send their daily rainfall forecast. On the app, the \nfarmer is asked to first\
    \ indicate whether in the next 24 hours there will be \n“Yes rain” or “No rain”.\
    \ If ‘Yes rain’ is selected, the farmer proceeds to the \nnext step where he indicates\
    \ which type of rain: “low rain”, ‘medium rain’, \nand ‘high (heavy) rain’. Thereafter\
    \ a number of indigenous ecological \nindicators (IEIs) such as ants, the moon,\
    \ or earthworm are presented from \nwhich the farmer selects the ones upon which\
    \ the forecast is based. These IEIs \nwere mentioned by farmers themselves and\
    \ collectively discussed in an \nearlier workshop. After this, the farmer specifies\
    \ the certainty of the forecast \nby selecting ‘sure’, ‘very sure’ and ‘so sure’.\
    \ The process ends by saving the \ninformation unto the mobile phone. However,\
    \ a farmer could skip a stage on \nthe app if he doesn’t want to respond which\
    \ literally means no idea. We ruled \nout the possibility of “I do not understand’\
    \ or ‘I am not comfortable \nChapter 5\n142\n \nanswering”. This is because farmers\
    \ were thoroughly trained to understand \neach stage of the app and are willing\
    \ to provide answers unless otherwise they \ndo not know what event to expect\
    \ because of confusing IEIs. \n \nThe farmers also recorded daily rainfall observed\
    \ in their communities using \nthe tailor-made rain gauges. These rain gauges\
    \ were built from plastic water \nbottles by researchers and farmers were trained\
    \ on how to use it and how to \nrecord rainfall.  \n \n5.3.4.2 Structured interviews\
    \ \n \nA structured interview guide was designed based on three core themes; (i)\
    \ \nPersonal characteristics, (ii) Forecast sources and usage, (iii) Acceptability\
    \ of \nintegrated forecast. See interview guide in table D2. \n \nThe interview\
    \ guide was pilot-tested twice to ensure questions were \nunderstandable and unambiguous.\
    \ Each interview lasted for about 15 minutes \nand was mainly administered in\
    \ the local Dagbani language except for some \ncases with literate farmers where\
    \ the English language was used. In total 108 \ninterviews were conducted. For\
    \ each question, background information was \nprovided to ensure that farmers\
    \ have a good understanding of the questions \nin order to respond appropriately.\
    \ \n \n5.3.4.3 Feedback workshop \n \n Following the preliminary analysis of the\
    \ interview data, and the IF data \ncollected with sapelli mobile app, a feedback\
    \ workshop was organised to \ndiscuss and obtain further insight as well as validate\
    \ (to reduce interpretation \nbias) both results. The workshop also discussed\
    \ how farmers are already using \nIF and SF and whether they find IPF acceptable.\
    \ It is worth noting that the \nworkshop was conducted in the Dagbani language\
    \ and as such, all the \nquotation used in this paper has been translated into\
    \ scientific terminologies. \nFor example, a farmer may not say indigenous ecological\
    \ indicators but rather \nuse expressions (such as ti bangsim kura) that imply\
    \ the same.  \n \n5.3.5 Data analysis \n \nEach dataset was handled in a way that\
    \ it produced the intended purposes. \nThe indigenous and scientific forecast\
    \ data were analysed on a daily and \nseasonal timescale. Further, the daily forecast\
    \ data were aggregated to \nmonthly to provide insights into the monthly variation.\
    \ The interview data \nWeather and climate services that integrate indigenous\
    \ and scientific forecast\n143\n \nwere also sorted and analysed to determine\
    \ the acceptability of IPF. The \nworkshop data was used to validate the preliminary\
    \ results of the interviews \nand the indigenous forecast data collected. Details\
    \ of the data analysis are \npresented in section 5.3.5.1 and 5.3.5.2 \n  \n5.3.5.1\
    \ Integrating forecast and testing reliability  \n \nBefore the integration of\
    \ IF, indigenous ecological indicators (IEIs) were \nidentified and farmers’ rainfall\
    \ forecasting techniques were explored. Results \nshow that farmers base their\
    \ forecast on observing and interpreting IEIs and \ntheir long term personal experiences.\
    \ Farmers ensure that there is ample \nevidence to support their forecast and\
    \ they do so by observing different IEIs. \nFor example, a farmer would not forecast\
    \ “no rain” just because of the \ndisappearance of ants but would also refer to\
    \ other possible indicators. \n \n In addition to IEIs identification and the\
    \ exploration of indigenous forecast \ntechniques, skills in farmers’ forecast\
    \ were evaluated using a binary forecast \nverification method to test the reliability\
    \ of both forecasts. This method \nanalyses rainfall forecasts in the form of\
    \ yes/no rain and uses the contingency \ntable to score hit rates against miss\
    \ rates (Barnston, 1992; Ward & Folland, \n2007). According to Hammer et al.,\
    \ (1996), using this method of forecast \nverification is of practical value in\
    \ the sense that forecast users often have to \nmake a yes/no decision to act\
    \ on the information provided.  Moreover, users \ndo not generally change their\
    \ practices unless there is a significant shift in \nprobabilities away from random\
    \ expectation. Integrating SF and IF at daily \nand seasonal timescale followed\
    \ the following two stages: \n \nStage 1: Constructing and Consolidating forecast\
    \ probabilities for IF and \nSF \n \nWhile weather and seasonal climate forecast\
    \ from SF are issued with the \nlikelihood of rainfall occurrence, IFs are not.\
    \ The probabilities of daily IF \nwere calculated based on the number of expert\
    \ farmers forecasting ‘Yes rain’. \nFor the seasonal time scale, the probabilities\
    \ were calculated based on the \nnumber of people who indicate above, below, and\
    \ near-normal rainfall (see \ntable 5.1). The corresponding probabilities of occurrence\
    \ constructed for IF \nand SF were merged to form a combined forecast (IPF) using\
    \ a simple \nweighted average method. A demonstration of this at the seasonal\
    \ timescale \nis depicted in Table 5.1 \n \nChapter 5\n144\n \nTable 5.1: Formulae\

    \ \n \nStage 2: Evaluating forecasts (IPF, IF and SF) against observation \n \n\
    To assess the reliability, each forecast (IPF, IF and SF) was compared with \n\
    observations. The percentage of hit rates for each forecast type were \ncalculated\
    \ for a probability of ≤0.5 and >0.5. Using equation 1, a weighted \nvalue estimated\
    \ from the results of the skills assessment of IF and SF were \nassigned to each\
    \ probability. The values were of 0.3 and 0.34 hit rate for IF \nand SF respectively.\
    \ Also, this study hypothetically considered each farmer \nas a kind of forecast\
    \ model and their forecast techniques and skills adequately \nevaluated.  The\
    \ weight assigned to each forecast addresses the tendency to \nlose the value\
    \ placed on each forecast during the combination.  \n \nWeather and climate services\

    \ of interview and workshop data for acceptability \n \nData from the questionnaire\
    \ were coded and analysed using R statistics, \nStatistical Package for Social\
    \ Sciences (SPSS) version 25 and Microsoft \nExcel 2016. Data from the questionnaire\
    \ were categorical in nature and so \ninformed our choice of the analytical technique.\
    \ Analyses of interview data \nwas framed around the hypothesis that farmers will\
    \ accept an integrated \nprobability forecast. Demography of the respondents in\
    \ addition to the \nfrequency of the types of forecast used are found in table\
    \ D1. \n \nFirst, an index for acceptability was computed from three questions\
    \ (see \nquestion 17-19 of the questionnaire) and collinearity appropriately checked.\
    \ \nTo do this, the three questions were measured on the same scale and combined\
    \ \ninto a single measure by taking an average of each respondents’ response.\
    \ \nResults of the analysis are in table D3.  Price (2012) posit that multiple-\n\
    response measures are generally more reliable than single-response measures. \n\
    However, it is important to make sure the individual dependent variables \ncorrelated\
    \ with each other. Therefore, before the combination of multiple-\nresponse measures\
    \ the reliability of the variables was checked using \nCronbach’s Alphas. This\
    \ test verifies the internal consistency of the variables \nbefore proceeding\
    \ to determine whether farmers will accept an integrated \nprobability forecast\
    \ or not. Results showed an acceptable Cronbach’s Alphas \nof 0.68 (see Table\
    \ D3 for detailed result). A Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.6 is \nconsidered as\
    \ a high reliability and acceptable index (Nunnally and \nBernstein, 1994; Wim\
    \ et al., 2008). The workshop data were sorted and \nstructured into an inferential\
    \ discourse. Some salient comments were isolated \nand presented to improve the\
    \ narrative. All data collected were anonymously \nhandled.   \n \n \n \n \n \n\

    \ >0.5 \n(details of ≤0.5 in table D5). IF recorded no hit for probability >0.5\
    \ in months \nSeptember and October. \n \nFor the seasonal timescale, IF generally\
    \ performed better than IPF and SF. \nIPF also performed better than SF. Interestingly,\
    \ IPF was able to deal with \nthe contradicting forecasts of IF and SF pointing\
    \ at different directions in both \nyears. For instance, in 2017, whereas IF predicted\
    \ near-normal rainfall, SF \npredicted above-normal rainfall. This contradicting\
    \ forecast which often \nconfuses farmers in their decision making was dealt with\
    \ by IPF (Table 5.2). \nAlso in 2018, IF predicted above-normal rainfall and SF\
    \ predicted an equal \nchance of rain for both above and near-normal rainfall.\
    \ With this confusing \ninformation, IPF was able to forecast accurately the above-normal\

    \ by farmers \n \nTo assess the acceptability of integrated forecasts, a number\
    \ of questions from \nthe structured interviews were analysed to test our hypotheses\
    \ “farmers will \naccept integrated probability forecast”.  Results of the acceptability\
    \ analysis \nshow that cumulatively the majority (96%) of the farmers accept the\
    \ \nintegrated forecast but with varying degrees of agreement (Figure 5.4).  About\
    \ \n53% of them ‘agree’ and 43% ‘strongly agree’. However, it is expected that\
    \ \na number of factors would influence the acceptability of the integrated \n\
    forecast. Trust of forecast information significantly correlates (r=0.65) with\
    \ \nthe acceptability of integrated forecast (Table D5). The majority (96%) of\
    \ \nfarmers trusted IPF more than their complementary method. However, 99% \n\
    of farmers would only use IPF if it proves reliable (Table D6). \nChapter 5\n\
    148\n \n \nFigure 5.4: Measure of acceptability of integrated forecast obtained\
    \ from the \naverage of multiple questions in table D3 (Strongly disagree: 1-1.9,\
    \ Disagree: \n2-2.9, Neutral: 3-3.9, Agree: 4-4.9, strongly agree: 5-5.9, I don't\
    \ know: >6-\n6.9). \n \n5.4.3 Farmers’ forecast preferences and approach to integration\
    \ \n \nResults from the interviews showed that farmers (93%) already use SF and\
    \ IF \nfor decision-making, using a complementary technique. The complementary\
    \ \nmethod refers to the act of comparing both forecasts based on farmers’ own\
    \ \nexperience in order to choose the best. This method differs from the IPF \n\
    method, which combines the two forecast into a single objective forecast. For\
    \ \ninstance, when farmers receive weather and or seasonal climate forecast \n\
    information from GMet, they compare it to their own IF and choose the most \n\
    appropriate information to make predictions for the upcoming farming \nseason.\
    \ The prediction is use to plan to when and how to carry out almost all \ntheir\
    \ farm activities such as nursing, planting, fertiliser application, weed, and\
    \ \npest and diseases control. However, 3% of the farmers claimed they integrate\
    \ \nforecasts by a combination approach in order to produce a single forecast.\
    \ \nWhile they could not explain the process for such a combination, an attempt\
    \ \nto do so revealed that they often actually practice the complementary \napproach.\
    \ The remaining 4% of the farmers could not tell which kind of \nintegration they\
    \ do. Overall results of the interview showed that the majority \nWeather and\
    \ climate services that integrate indigenous and scientific forecast\n149\n \n\
    (93%) of farmers prefered an integrated forecast that is combined than used \n\
    in a complementary manner (see table D7 for detail results). \n \nConsidering\
    \ how farmers already use SF and IF, farmers do not have any \nestablished method\
    \ for integrating both forecasts. They explained that the \nselection of the best\
    \ forecast at a given time and circumstance is based on \npersonal discretion\
    \ which largely depended on the experience and the degree \nof confidence they\
    \ have in each forecast. One farmer said “even though \nwe(farmers) have much\
    \ hope in our own forecast, they don’t often work, \nsometimes the Indigenous\
    \ Ecological Indicators upon which we base our \npredictions are not so clear\
    \ for you to depend on for any decision. Under \nthese circumstances, you have\
    \ no option than to act based on the scientific \nforecast you received”.  The\
    \ continuous change in climate and land use has \ncaused changes in the landscape\
    \ and thus affected the migration and \nextinction of certain animals and trees\
    \ that were before used for IF. \n \nWhen asked why they integrate (complementary)\
    \ the forecasts, farmers \nmentioned several reasons, which can be summarized\
    \ into three main points. \nFirst, farmers recognised that IF has become less\
    \ reliable over the years and \nin most cases especially for seasonal predictions,\
    \ accuracy is not guaranteed. \nMeanwhile, SF has its own intrinsic weakness that\
    \ limits its efficacy. Yet both \ncan perform well when used together. Therefore,\
    \ using both forecasts in a \ncomplementary manner help improve their decisions.\
    \ Secondly, confusion \narises when SF and IF are confidently pointing in opposite\
    \ directions. For \nexample, at a daily weather forecast, where IF expects rain\
    \ and SF indicate \nno rain or at seasonal time scale when IF forecast near-normal\
    \ season and SF \nforecast above-normal season at a higher degree of probability.\
    \ Under such \ncontradictory circumstances, they compare both forecasts and select\
    \ one. \nThey do so by first recollecting occasions when such conflicting situations\
    \ \nhad occurred in the past and the possible outcomes. Thirdly, besides \ncomparing\
    \ both forecast and selecting the best, farmers also compare SF and \nIF in order\
    \ to confirm information from each source. Confidence to act is \nboosted when\
    \ they compare and realise both forecasts are pointing in the same \ndirection.\
    \ However, an interesting question to explore is whether they will \nstill look\
    \ at all three forecasts for comparison once a combined one is issued. \n    \
    \    \nAccording to the farmers, although the complementary approach of \nintegrating\
    \ forecasts has been useful in making farm decision, this also comes \nwith some\
    \ limitations. They, therefore, found the idea of combining two \nforecasts into\
    \ a single forecast most appropriate. They foresee such \nintegration to be helpful\
    \ in ways that their complementary approach could \nChapter 5\n150\n \nnot. For\
    \ example, the combination approach (IPF) could eliminate the \nconfusion associated\
    \ with contradicting forecast and perhaps increase \naccuracy. One farmer said\
    \ “If you people (referring to researchers) are able \nto combine the two into\
    \ one, then, it is good news for us. Because when SF \nand IF confidently provide\
    \ different forecasts, it becomes very difficult to \nmake a decision based on\
    \ one. Most of the times, we fail even when we \ncompare and choose one.” Another\
    \ farmer said “To be honest our IF has \nhelped us just like the one from GMet,\
    \ and if we are able to combine them \ninto one, then, it will be good. In fact,\
    \ our elders say two heads are better \nthan one.” \n \nHaving realised farmers’\
    \ preference for integrating SF and IF, the most \npreferred integration method\
    \ was examined. Describing the three main \nmethods to farmers: the consensus\
    \ and science integration methods from \nliterature and our proposed integrated\
    \ probability (IPF) method. Results \nshowed that farmers’ most critical concern\
    \ is not in the type of integrated \nmethod but in receiving reliable forecast\
    \ that can help them take effective \ndecisions. Nonetheless, farmers find it\
    \ necessary for their IF knowledge is \nincorporated in forecast generation but\
    \ were concerned about regular \nmeetings that consume a lot of time. As a result,\
    \ most (75%) farmers’ \npreferred the new IPF method. In comparing IPF to the\
    \ other methods, \nfarmers found the opportunity to incorporate their IF knowledge\
    \ in the \nforecasting process, with minimal meetings and workshops that saves\
    \ time \nvery appealing. Considering the fact that IF is adaptive and evolves\
    \ based on \nspecific events, one may wonder how to guarantee that less frequent\
    \ meetings \nto gather IF does not affect updates and the quality of information\
    \ gathered \nfor IPF. First, it’s a fact that the IEIs used by farmers for IF\
    \ changes just as \ninitials conditions (wind direction, surface pressure) used\
    \ in scientific \nforecasting models change. Therefore, farmers also adapt and\
    \ evolve their \nforecast accordingly. However, with appropriate feedback mechanisms\
    \ \ncreated, farmers will inform researchers on any new changes that had \noccurred\
    \ in the use of IEIs. Moreover, according to the farmers, observed \nchanges in\
    \ IEIs for IF are not frequent; they happen after several years due to \nchanges\
    \ in landscape, environment and climate. Therefore, irregular meetings \nwould\
    \ not affect IF. Moreover, the feedback mechanisms created will keep \nfarmers\
    \ and researchers connected in order to share new updates about \nchanges in IEIs,\
    \ thus IF. \n \nOne farmer said, “now that you have understood how we make our\
    \ forecast, \nwe can send them for you to analyse and give us the final forecast\
    \ \ninformation”. Another farmer said, “I don’t think there will be many \nWeather\
    \ and climate services that integrate indigenous and scientific forecast\n151\n\
    \ \ndifferences in the outcome of forecast information even when we continuously\
    \ \nmeet”. However, 25% of the farmers were in favour of the consensus method\
    \ \nbecause of the degree of engagement and frequent meetings and workshops. \n\
    One farmer in support of this method said, “I like this method because I want\
    \ \nto always be part of the learning process” another also said, “I think when\
    \ we \nmeet continuously, new ideas to improve the forecast information will \n\
    emerge”. When asked why none of them preferred the science integration \nmethod,\
    \ the farmers’ responses pointed to the fact that the idea of temporarily \ncollecting\
    \ their IF as a hypothesis for building predictive models and not \nengaging them\
    \ again in the future is troubling. They believe this will affect \nthe quality\
    \ of the forecast generated. One farmer said, “You can’t expect the \nsituation\
    \ to be the same all the time when it comes to the rains. It is good that \nwe\
    \ keep on monitoring and sending you what is happening in our village so \nthat\
    \ the information can be accurate.    \n \n5.5 Discussion  \n \nThis study is\
    \ a proof of concept that aimed to develop and test a method that \ncombines indigenous\
    \ forecasts (IF) and meteorological scientific forecast \n(SF) into a consolidated\
    \ reliable forecast acceptable by farmers. The analysis \nstarted with the hypothesis\
    \ that an integrated forecast probability (IPF) \nmethod can improve the reliability\
    \ and acceptability of forecast information \namong farmers. The need for such\
    \ combined forecast emerged from the idea \nthat SF and IF individually, have\
    \ inherent weaknesses that affect the accuracy \nof forecast information and forecast\
    \ are sometimes contradicting. Therefore, \nintegrating both forecasts could resolve\
    \ these issues (Nyadzi et al., 2018; \nKolawole et al., 2014). Moreover, the potential\
    \ value of IFs are becoming \nwidely recognised (Nyadzi et al.,2019; Jiri et al.,\
    \ 2016; Manyanhaire & \nChitura, 2015), while meteorological scientific forecast\
    \ (SF) have also \nadvanced (Njau, 2010). \n \n5.5.1 Conceptualising integrated\
    \ probability method (IPF) \n \nThe IPF method used for this proof of concept\
    \ is a simple weighted average \nof the conditional probabilities of SF and IF\
    \ assumed they both do not have \nan equal likelihood. This was done in recognition\
    \ of the fact that each forecast \nhas its own skills. However, in our study,\
    \ this did not produce any significant \noutcome since the estimated weights used\
    \ (based on skills assessment of SF \nand IF) were almost the same. Other comprehensive\
    \ methods have been \nsuggested to objectively combine SF and IF. For instance,\
    \ Andrade & \nGosling, (2011) suggested using long-term indigenous ecological\
    \ indicators \nChapter 5\n152\n \ncombined with observed initial conditions of\
    \ the atmosphere (atmospheric \npressure etc.) as input into deterministic predictive\
    \ models. Chand et al., \n(2014) proposed documentation of ecological indicators\
    \ (e.g. flowering of \nmango trees) that correlate with weather and seasonal climatic\
    \ conditions \ncombined with data from meteorological stations (e.g. rainfall)\
    \ to build \nprobabilistic models. These methods may be promising but difficult\
    \ to \noperationalise. This is perhaps the reason they have not been carried out.\
    \  \n \nResults show that SF and IF did not produce the same forecast accuracy\
    \ at \nboth daily and seasonal timescale, indicating a need to combine both methods\
    \ \ninto a single objective forecast (i.e. IPF). IPF combined the strengths of\
    \ SF \nand IF and subsequently improved their reliability. Our analysis showed\
    \ that \nIPF generally performed better than any of the individual forecasts.\
    \ IPF \nshowed improved reliability at both daily and seasonal timescale although\
    \ IF \nperformed better at seasonal timescales. The high performance of IF may\
    \ be \nattributed to the aggregation of different farmers’ forecast. This implies\
    \ that \nthe number of farmers involved in the process could potentially influence\
    \ IF \nquality. However, IPF may be slightly better in terms of reliability but\
    \ has far \ngreater acceptability potential. This is because farmers preferred\
    \ method of \nintegration which combines IF and SF into a single forecast than\
    \ \ncomplementary method that does not resolve the issues of contradicting \n\
    forecast information. \n \n5.2 Acceptability of integrated probability method\
    \ (IPF) \n \nResults indicated that farmers found IPF as the best way to objectively\
    \ \ncombine SF and IF. To them, IPF possesses potentials that surpass their own\
    \ \ncomplimentary integration approach and the other methods discussed in the\
    \ \nliterature (i.e. consensus and science integration methods). Besides, they\
    \ find \nthe co-production approach of generating reliable and acceptable weather\
    \ and \nclimate forecast information very vital. However, the relevance of forecast\
    \ \nreliability exceeds the choice of integration method. The method of \nintegration\
    \ also becomes a concern when it consumes much of their time. In \nthe end, a\
    \ large number of farmers prefer the IPF method to the consensus \nand science\
    \ integration methods described by Plotz et al., (2017). Farmers’ \nconcern about\
    \ time consumption of an integration method was related to the \nconsensus and\
    \ science integration method and not the IPF. Nonetheless, their \nconcern for\
    \ IPF to generate reliable forecast still stands. To achieve a reliable \nintegrated\
    \ forecast, adjustment is required from both scientists and farmers. \nFarmers\
    \ need to be consistent in IF provision and scientists must do thorough \nevaluation\
    \ to include only the best local forecasters in the combination.  \nWeather and\
    \ climate services that integrate indigenous and scientific forecast\n153\n \n\
    \ \nFrom the analysis, we found that trust of forecast information is a significant\
    \ \ndeterminant for uptake. Farmers trust IPF because it combines the best of\
    \ \nscientific and indigenous forecasts. Furthermore, the IPF method keeps \n\
    farmers up to date on activities and emerging issues such as forecast \nuncertainties\
    \ and risks. Kasperson et al. (2012) and Renn & Levine (1991) \nstated that communicating\
    \ risk is an important part of risk management that \nrevolves around trust. However,\
    \ farmers trust and preference for IPF over SF \nand IF does not guarantee uptake,\
    \ unless IPF information proves reliable for \ntaking farm decisions to reduce\
    \ risks and increase yield. Furthermore, we \nexpect that building trust among\
    \ farmers in the study area does not only \ndepend on the confidence they have\
    \ in forecast information but also the \nsource of the information.  In line with\
    \ this, Steelman et al., (2014) mentioned \nthat the credibility of the source\
    \ of information could have an effect on how \nusers of information view and respond\
    \ to messages about environmental \nrisks. Therefore, we propose a transparent\
    \ and credible co-production process \nthat continuously involves and informs\
    \ farmers on day-to-day activities.  \n \n5.3 Opportunities and limitations of\
    \ combining indigenous and scientific \nforecast  \n  \n Some previous studies\
    \ have questioned the possibility of combining IF and \nSF because of the significant\
    \ differences between the two (see Agrawal, \n2002; Plotz et al., 2017).  Others,\
    \ however, have mentioned that both IF and \nSF converges in some aspects of content\
    \ and method (Roncoli et al., 2001). \nHere, we show as a proof of concept that\
    \ if you collect quantitative data on \nIF, it is possible to integrate it with\
    \ SF using the IPF method. To validate the \nreliability of the IPF method, we\
    \ used a relatively short dataset. We \nacknowledge that a longer time series\
    \ is needed for a more robust validation. \nAdding more data will provide a more\
    \ solid basis for validating the reliability \nof the method. However, it is important\
    \ to recognise that, long term IF \ndatasets do not exist and the length of our\
    \ project only made it possible to \ncollect IF data for a single year (in 2017)\
    \ for the daily forecast analysis and \ntwo years (2017 and 2018) for the seasonal\
    \ analysis. Yet for science-based \nforecasts it is possible to generate long\
    \ term datasets using hind-cast methods, \nthis is unfortunately not possible\
    \ for IF.  \n \nGenerally, we observe that for both scientists and farmers, the\
    \ reliability of \nthe forecast is essential and once this is achieved they will\
    \ probably rally \nbehind the combined forecast irrespective of their inclination\
    \ to use scientific \nforecast or indigenous forecast. Therefore, several opportunities\
    \ exist in \nChapter 5\n154\n \ncombining IF and SF. However, there are some limitations\
    \ of the combined \nforecast. First, If the best IF experts are not included in\
    \ the forecast data \ncollection, then this can introduce errors in the combined\
    \ forecasts. Secondly, \nthe probability of SF as issued by GMet is also associated\
    \ with a degree of \nsubjectivity. The best meteorological forecasters are able\
    \ to produce a more \nprecise probability of rainfall occurrence. Therefore, generating\
    \ an improved \nrainfall forecast must be high on the agenda of scientists and\
    \ meteorological \ncenters including the training of forecasters. Thirdly, to\
    \ improve the quality \nof the combined forecast, the spatial resolution at which\
    \ SF is issued should \nbe as fine as IF. SFs in Ghana are only issued at a regional\
    \ scale while IF is \nissued at the village level. This requires an improvement\
    \ in the use of existing \nforecasting models and technologies. Fourth, if the\
    \ combination approach is \nunclear to both scientist and farmers, they will become\
    \ sceptical about the \ncombined forecast. Under these circumstances, farmers’\
    \ attitude to risk \nbecomes an additional factor in using the combined method\
    \ while scientist \nopen-mindedness becomes important to accept it.   \n \n5.4\
    \ Implications for knowledge integration and climate services  \n \nFinally, findings\
    \ from this study support the argument that SF and IF have \nsome unique characteristics\
    \ that make both relevant especially when \ncombined (see also Alexander et al.,\
    \ 2011; Armatas et al., 2016; Nyadzi et \nal., 2018). Meanwhile, previous studies\
    \ considered this as either inappropriate \nor impossible because of possible\
    \ differences between them (Agrawal, 2002). \nTherefore, the implications of this\
    \ study are important for the field of weather \nand climate services. First,\
    \ it sets the pace for finding answers to the persistent \ncall by scientists\
    \ and policy-makers to find ways to objectively integrate SF \nand IF (Kalanda-Joshua\
    \ et al., 2011; Hiwasaki et al., 2014; Hoagland, 2016) \nSecondly, IPF provides\
    \ an opportunity for both scientists and policy makers \nto bridge the forecast\
    \ information gap and thus meet the climate services \ndemands of farmers, particularly\
    \ in areas where scientific instruments and \nrecords are insufficient (Mahoo\
    \ et al., 2015; Basdew et al., 2017; Nyadzi et \nal., 2018). Thirdly, IPF could\
    \ help eliminate the presence of possible human \nerrors associated with a subjective\
    \ combination of the forecast from \nmeteorological models and indigenous people.\
    \ \n \n5.5 Recommendations for practice  \n \nPrevious studies have already proposed\
    \ frameworks and approaches to be \nfollowed when combining indigenous and scientific\
    \ knowledge, yet they do \nnot have to be static (Plotz et al. 2017).  Attempts\
    \ to combine IF and SF come \nWeather and climate services that integrate indigenous\
    \ and scientific forecast\n155\n \nwith different challenges due to the method,\
    \ location and context related \nissues. Therefore, for a successful engagement.\
    \ We recommend the \nfollowing;  \nLocal communities should be engaged from the\
    \ beginning until the end(co-\ncreating), both defining the problem and designing\
    \ the solution.  Also, the \nshort and long term objectives of the project should\
    \ be clearly communicated. \nRegular workshops and meetings with local communities\
    \ offer a greater \nopportunity to engage farmers. Together, researchers and farmers\
    \ should \nagree on who should be involved as an expert forecaster based on forecast\
    \ \nskills and how long they are available to provide IF using mobile phones.\
    \ \nSince rainfall variability could impact both SF and IF predictions, this can\
    \ \nalso re-define who is actually a “forecast expert”. This could be the case\
    \ in \nthe future when the variability becomes so difficult for so-called expert\
    \ \nfarmers to predict, because the ability of a farmer to interpret IEIs under\
    \ a \nvarying climatic condition to predict rainfall accurately is a determinant\
    \ of \nhis or her expertise.  \n \nResearchers should ensure that the understudied\
    \ communities already use \nindigenous forecast and they have a better understanding\
    \ of how IF is \ngenerated from IEIs. This includes consistency and common understanding\
    \ \nof the use of scientific terminologies by both researchers and farmers as\
    \ \ndescribed in section 5.3.  \n \n6.0 Conclusion  \n \nThis paper describes\
    \ a proof of concept showing the possibility of combining \nweather and seasonal\
    \ climate forecasts using both scientific and indigenous \nforecast systems. Our\
    \ study concludes that there is an opportunity to increase \nforecast reliability\
    \ and usefulness for farmers if quantitative data on IF is \ncollected and integrated\
    \ with SF using the IPF method. The IPF method \nintroduces some objectivity into\
    \ integrated forecast compared to other \nexisting methods.  \n  \nThe most important\
    \ limitation of the study is the short datasets. With several \nstudies calling\
    \ for the integration of forecast from IF and SF systems, there is \na need to\
    \ collect long-term datasets for rigorous analysis to substantiate our \nresults.\
    \ Furthermore, this study directs future research that goes beyond the \nintegration\
    \ of IF and SF to understanding the consequences of using combine \nforecast.\
    \ In particular, the risk of using combined forecast rather than \nindigenous\
    \ and scientific forecast in a complementary way by researchers \nChapter 5\n\
    156\n \nwho are more inclined to using scientific methods and farmers who are\
    \ more \ncomfortable using indigenous methods. \n \nFinally, the insights gained\
    \ from this study will be relevant for scientists and \npolicy makers in bridging\
    \ the forecast information gap and thus meet the \nclimate services needs of farmers,\
    \ particularly those in areas where limited \nmeteorological instruments and records.\

    climate forecast information on rice \nfarmers’ decision making\nChapter 6\nChapter\
    \ 6\n160\n \nChapter 6 \nThe influence of weather and seasonal climate forecast\
    \ information on \nrice farmers’ decision-making  \n \nAbstract \n \nRice farmers\
    \ in Northern Ghana are susceptible to climate variability and change \nwith its\
    \ effects in the form of drought, water scarcity, erratic rainfall and high \n\
    temperatures. In response, farmers resort to weather and seasonal forecast to\
    \ manage \nuncertainties in decision-making. However, there is limited empirical\
    \ research on \nhow forecast lead time and probabilities influence farmer decision-making.\
    \  In this \nstudy, we posed the overall question: how do rice farmers respond\
    \ to forecast \ninformation with different probabilities and lead times? We purposively\
    \ engaged 36 \nrice farmers (12 rainfed, 12 irrigated and 12 practising both)\
    \ in Visually Facilitated \nScenario Mapping Workshops (VFSMW) to explore how\
    \ lead times and \nprobabilities inform their decision-making. Results of the\
    \ VFSMW showed rainfed \nrice farmers are most sensitive to forecast probabilities\
    \ because of their over reliance \non rainfall. An increase in forecast probability\
    \ does not necessarily mean farmers \nwill act. The decision to act based on forecast\

    \ parts of Africa is heavily impacted by \nclimate variability and change (Benin\
    \ et al., 2011; Müller et al., 2011). The \nincreasingly unpredictable and erratic\
    \ nature of weather and climate \nconditions on the continent is expected to compromise\
    \ agricultural production \nand rural livelihoods, especially in smallholder systems\
    \ with little adaptive \ncapacity ( Kurukulasuriya et al., 2006; Cooper et al.,\
    \ 2008). For instance, \nchanges in rainfall onset, duration and cessation have\
    \ already caused \nsignificant adjustment to farming activities (Jotoafrika, 2013;\
    \ Salack et al., \n2015). \n \nGhana is one example of such countries facing these\
    \ challenges. An enormous \nnumber of its farmers rely solely on rainfall, with\
    \ less than 1% of land under \nirrigation (World Bank, 2010; Armah et al., 2011;\
    \ De Pinto et al., 2012). The \nSavanna belt of the country is most impacted throughout\
    \ the year with \nirregular rainfall, high temperatures and water scarcity conditions\
    \ (Akudugu \n& Dittoh, 2012; Quaye, 2008; Rademacher-Schulz et al., 2014). The\
    \ advent \nof climate variability and change has deepened the woes of farmers\
    \ who \nmostly rely on rainfall to meet water needs at the farm level. Irrigated\
    \ farmers \nare equally threatened when water levels in reservoirs are too low\
    \ for \nirrigation (Nyadzi et al., 2018). As a result, rice production in the\
    \ north of \nGhana is severely impacted due to its high crop water requirement\
    \ (Kranjac-\nBerisavljevic et al., 2003). Yet, rice is a staple food and the need\
    \ to meet \ndemand under rapidly changing and varying climatic conditions in the\
    \ area is \na major concern (SARI, 2011). \n \nAs part of efforts to manage uncertainties,\
    \ rice farmers seek forecast \ninformation on weather and seasonal climatic conditions\
    \ (rainfall amount, \nrainfall distribution, onset, cessation etc.) for informed\
    \ decision-making \n(Grothmann & Patt, 2005; Nyamekye et al., 2018). Forecast\
    \ information is \nexpected to improve farmer decision-making by informing choices\
    \ on how \nand when to plant, fertilize and plan supplementary irrigation, amongst\
    \ others \n(Defiesta et al., 2014; Risbey et al.,1999).  \n \nCurrently, farmers\
    \ in Northern Ghana obtain forecast information from the \nGhana Meteorological\
    \ Services and private information service providers \nsuch as ESOKO and Farmerline\
    \ (Nyamekye et al., 2019). However, the \nassumption that all seasonal and weather\
    \ forecast information made available \nto farmers are useful and used in decision\
    \ making has been questioned due to \na number of challenges (Adiku et al., 2007).\
    \ First is the timeliness of \nChapter 6\n \n \n \n \n \nmeteorological information,\

    163\n \ndetermines farmers’ willingness to act and the kind of decisions they\
    \ take \n(Verbeke, 2005; Weaver et al., 2013; Dewulf & Biesbroek, 2018; Gbangou\
    \ \net al., 2019). In climate change literature, uncertainty and forecast lead\
    \ times \nhave been highlighted in bridging climate information usability gaps\
    \ in \ndecision-making (Podestá et al., 2002; Lemos et al., 2012; Mase & Prokopy,\
    \ \n2014; Roudier et al., 2014). \n \nThis study sought to test three hypotheses\
    \ in understanding the relationship \nbetween meteorological information (focusing\
    \ on rainfall) and farmer \ndecision-making although there are a lot of factors\
    \ that determine farmer use \nof meteorological forecast (Vogel, 2000; Ziervogel,\
    \ 2004). First, that the \nhigher the probability associated with a forecast,\
    \ the more farmers are willing \nto act on their decision at every stage of decision-making\
    \ within the farming \ncycle. In this case, although the probability of a forecast\
    \ cannot be 100 \npercent, farmers irrespective of practising rainfed or irrigated\
    \ farming will act \nout their intended decision when rainfall probability is\
    \ high. Weisheimer and \nPalmer (2014) opine that probabilistic reliability should\
    \ be the foremost \nmeasure of the ‘goodness’ of a forecast.  Herewith, the ‘goodness’\
    \ of a \nforecast is a contextual question requiring the positioning of its interpretation\
    \ \nin specific farming systems.  Letson et al., (2001) concur with reference\
    \ to \ntheir findings on obstacles to greater use of climate information. (Langford\
    \ & \nHendon, 2013) affirm and buttress how unreliability remains an impediment\
    \ \nto the uptake of climate related information. \n \nOur second hypothesis is\
    \ that seasonal forecast communicated at different \nlead times has consequences\
    \ on the choices farmers make in seasonal \ndecision-making. Thirdly, we also\
    \ posit that weather forecast made available \nat different lead times significantly\
    \ drives in-season decision making. \nForecast communicated with a ‘sufficient’\
    \ lead time has a positive correlation \nwith productivity (Zinyengere et al.,\
    \ 2011). Seasonal climate forecast has no \nintrinsic value except for their ability\
    \ to influence decisions of users \n(Hammer, 2000). Sub-seasonal-to-seasonal forecasting\
    \ range seen as \n‘predictability desert’ due to initial difficulties has gained\
    \ attention in the bid \nto bridge the gap between weather forecasts and seasonal\
    \ outlooks (Vitart et \nal., 2012). Randomizing probability, seasonal and weather\
    \ information \nvariables in the context of rice farming systems requires holding\
    \ other \nconditions (finance, land, labour, etc.) that influence decision-making\
    \ \nconstant. \n \n \nChapter 6\n164\n \n6.3 Methodology \n \n6.3.1 Study area\
    \ \n \nThe study was undertaken in the Kumbungu District in the Northern region\
    \ \nof Ghana as shown in Figure 6.1. The district, located within the Guinea \n\
    Savannah agro-ecological zone covers a land area of 1,599km2 with \nKumbungu as\
    \ its capital. The District shares boundaries to the north with \nMamprugu/Moagduri\
    \ district, Tolon and North Gonja districts to the west, \nSagnerigu Municipal\
    \ to the south and Savelugu Municipal to the east (Abdul-\nMalik & Mohammed, 2012).\
    \ Farming is the mainstay of inhabitants \ncultivating cereals, tubers and vegetables\
    \ including rice, millet, sorghum, \ngroundnut, tomatoes and pepper. Average annual\
    \ rainfall is 1000mm with the \nmain cropping season stretching over the period\
    \ of May to late October \n(Quaye et al., 2009). The temperature is warm, dry\
    \ and hazy between \nFebruary and April. The district is drained by the White\
    \ Volta and other \nsmaller rivers and their tributaries with most drying up in\
    \ the dry season. The \nBontanga Irrigation Scheme located within the district\
    \ also supports irrigated \nfarming with crops such as rice and vegetable mostly\
    \ produced within the \nscheme. \n \nFigure 6.1: Map showing the study location\
    \ \nThe influence of forecast information on farmers’ decision-making\n165\n \n\
    6.3.2 Research Design \n \nScenario Workshops (SW) have roots in technological\
    \ assessments and \noriginally designed to facilitate engagement between scientists\
    \ and citizens in \nthe appraisal of new technologies (Andersen & Jaeger, 1999).\
    \ SWs have also \ndominated planning circles for giving a participatory foresight\
    \ to resource \nmanagement and also used in engaging citizens in testing technological\
    \ \nsolutions (Andersen & Jæger, 1999; Mayer, 1997; Rinaudo et al., 2012). The\
    \ \nstudy adopted a Visual Facilitated and Scenario Mapping Workshops \n(VFSMW)\
    \ (Hatzilacou et al., 2007; Mexa, 2002) focused on three main \ngroupings of farmers;\
    \ irrigated, rain fed and those who practised both. \n \nA total of five workshops\
    \ were organised. The first workshop was a kick-off \nworkshop with the objective\
    \ to select and familiarise with the participants and \nexplain to them the rationale\
    \ of the study. The kick-off workshop also aimed \nat grouping farmers, setting\
    \ up the environment with the required tools as \nwell as agreeing on dates for\
    \ the rest of the activities. In addition, rules of \nengagement were communicated\
    \ to the participants and opportunities created \nfor questioning and clarifications.\
    \ The second, third and fourth workshops \nwere the VFSMW specifically focused\
    \ on engaging different farmer groups \ndirectly to test the different information\
    \ variables (see section 3.3) and what \nthey mean for farmer decision-making.\
    \ Here, farmers were given a cardboard \nand spinning wheels showing the source\
    \ of information, certainty and forecast \nlead-times. On the cardboard was a\
    \ matrix showing the cropping cycle (See \nfigure E1 in supplementary materials)\
    \ for easy representation and \nunderstanding considering literacy levels of the\
    \ participants. Individually, \nparticipant(s) were taken through seven decision\
    \ points of the cycle.  \n \nParticipant(s) were randomly exposed to three spinning\
    \ wheels with each \nwheel focusing on a key information variable (probability;\
    \ lead time \n(seasonal); lead time (weather). Each variable also had three main\
    \ indicators \nfor which farmers were required to indicate what decision they\
    \ will make \nconsidering these indicators. The purpose of the wheel is to allow\
    \ for \nrandomization of the information to be tested (See figure E1 in supplementary\
    \ \nmaterials). The fifth workshop was a validation and feedback workshop. At\
    \ \nthis workshop, preliminary results were communicated and discussed. \nParticipants\
    \ feedback on key findings were also noted. The process for \nVFSMW is summarized\
    \ in Figure 6.2. \n \n \nChapter 6\n166\n \n \n \nFigure 6.2: Stepwise approach\
    \ to the VFSMW \n \n6.3.3 Sample and sampling approach \n \nWith the support of\
    \ the leadership of farmer associations and the extension \nofficer in the area,\
    \ a total of thirty-six (36) rice farmers (3 from each \ncommunity engaged in\
    \ either rainfed, irrigated or both) were purposively \nsampled from 12 different\
    \ communities for the VFSMW workshops (See \nFigure 6.1). The VFSMW was used to\
    \ test three (3) main variables and twelve \n(12) indicators fashioned out of\
    \ research questions. The variables include; (i) \nProbability of rainfall forecast\
    \ information for decision-making (ii) Lead \ntimes of weather forecast for decision-making\
    \ (iii) lead times of seasonal \nclimate forecast for decision-making. For each\
    \ of these three variables, a \ncouple of indicators and their influence on decision-making\
    \ was established \nfocusing on rainfall and what prevails under normal conditions.\
    \ Farmers were \nengaged in what decisions they will take under different scenarios.\
    \ The \nexperiment was carried out in this order: first, the probability of forecast\
    \ and \nfarmers’ decision-making, secondly seasonal forecast lead times and farmer\
    \ \ndecision-making and thirdly weather forecast lead times and farmer decision-\n\
    making. \n  \n \n \n \nThe influence of forecast information on farmers’ decision-making\n\
    167\n \nVariable 1: Probability of rainfall forecast and Farmer decision-making\
    \ \n \nThe degree of certainty associated with weather and seasonal climate \n\
    information is expected to inform farmers’ information uptake and adaptive \n\
    decision-making. Here, participants received information on the probabilities\
    \ \nof forecast information categorised as (1) low (x<0.5), (2) medium (0.5>x\
    \ \n<0.75) and (3) high (x>0.75). Interactions were based on the assumption that\
    \ \nit will rain but at these different probabilities. For each of these probabilities,\
    \ \nwe recorded whether farmers would act or not given. We treated the \nprobabilities\
    \ in each case as the independent variable and the decision “will \nact” and “will\
    \ not act” as dependent variables. \n \nVariable 2: Seasonal (rainfall) forecast\
    \ lead times and farmer decision-\nmaking  \n \nThe timing of information provision\
    \ at seasonal timescale affords decision-\nmakers, in this case, farmers to have\
    \ either more or less room in deciding \nwhat decisions to take. We deduce which\
    \ decisions farmers take given \ndifferent lead times (1 month, 2 month and 3\
    \ months) under ‘normal’ \nconditions and whether there is a substantive difference\
    \ in actions adopted by \nfarmers in this regard. The dependent variables in this\
    \ test were also “will \nact” and “will not act” and the independent variables\
    \ were the three lead \ntimes. \n \nVariable 3: Weather (rainfall) forecast lead\
    \ times and farmer decision-\nmaking  \n \nBuilding on from the rationale behind\
    \ the testing of variable 2, the \nparticipants were exposed to varying lead times\
    \ of weather forecast \ninformation. Here, we tested which decision farmers will\
    \ take given lead \ntimes of 1 day, 3 days and 1 week.  Unlike variable 2, the\
    \ dependent variables \nin this test were the decision options of farmers and\
    \ the dependent variables \nwere the three lead times. \n \n6.3.4 Data Analysis\
    \ \n \nWe employed both qualitative and quantitative methods in data analysis.\
    \ The \ndata gathered from the workshop were coded and entered into SPSS version\
    \ \n23 for analysis. The decisions gathered during the workshop were grouped \n\
    given key expressions and then coded for easy analysis in SPSS. Results of \n\
    the analysis are presented in frequencies and percentages.  \nChapter 6\n168\n\
    \ \n6.4 Results  \n \n6.4.1 Forecast Probability as a Determinant of Risk Acceptance\
    \ Level \n \nOur study findings point to different sensitivities to probability\
    \ depending on \nwhat activities farmers had to undertake. The study showed a\
    \ positive \ncorrelation between forecast probabilities and farmers’ decision\
    \ to act in the \npre-season and planting. It emerged that, as probability increased,\
    \ farmers \nwere willing to take action on forecast information received (see\
    \ Figure \n6.3A). However, an inverse relationship between forecast probability\
    \ and \ndecision making was observed during the remaining stages of the farming\
    \ \ncycle. Farmers would rather withhold intended action at the point of land\
    \ \npreparation, weed control and fertilizer application when the probability\
    \ of \nrainfall forecast is high (see Figure 6.3B). Clearly, the aforementioned\
    \ \nfarming stages are very sensitive to the rains and cannot be favourably \n\
    completed when rains are expected. For example, farmers indicated that \nfertilizers\
    \ do take a while to be absorbed in the soil and undertaking such in \nthe moment\
    \ of expected rainfall could result in the fertilizer being washed \naway. Thus,\
    \ although high probability is a good indicator of rainfall \noccurrence, it also\
    \ results in non-action taking as a response.  \n \n \n \nFigure 6.3: The general\

    \ extent those who practised both were least sensitive to \ndifferent forecast\
    \ probabilities compared to rainfed farmers (see figure 6.4A \nand 6.4B). For\

    \ except to face their lost and thus are sceptical in their \ndecision making.\

    \ Forecast Lead Time and Farmers Decision-Making \n \nThe results of the study\
    \ showed seasonal forecast provided at a 1 month lead \ntime significantly informed\
    \ farmer decision-making as part of preparatory \narrangements before the season\
    \ begins. Much also, irrespective of farming \ntype, farmers agree that a lead\
    \ time of 3 months is of least relevance as the 3 \nmonth pre-season period could\
    \ come with much greater variation in expected \nseasonal conditions and also\
    \ the fact that the majority of farmers will do \nnothing given a 3 month window\
    \ of opportunity. From the data, there was \nmore agreement between irrigated\
    \ rice farmers and rainfed rice farmers on \nhow seasonal forecast at different\
    \ lead times influence their decision-making. \nThis is shown in Figure 6.5. \n\

    \ \n \n \n \n \n \n \nGenerally, forecast provided at 1 week lead time better\
    \ position farmers to \ndecide on acting or not followed by 3 days and then 1\
    \ day. Farmers argued \nthat 1 day lead time is too short a period to undertake\
    \ most farm activities \nexcept weedicide application for weed control and broadcasting\
    \ in the case of \nplanting. For example, providing forecast information 1 day\
    \ before land \npreparation and also fertilizer application leaves limited room\
    \ to adjust \ndecisions.  A 3 day lead time, however, offers more time for farmers\
    \ to act \ncompared to 1 day.  \n \n6.5 Discussion \n \nThis paper sets out to\
    \ understand how different forecast sources, lead times \nand probabilities influence\
    \ farmer’ decision making. We explored this \nrelationship using different information\
    \ scenarios and groups of farmers \nwithin rice farming systems in a bid to investigate\
    \ how seasonal and weather \ninformation could be tailored to farmer information\
    \ needs in farming systems. \nIn this section, we discuss inferences from our\
    \ research findings in relation to \nother scholarly works on addressing weather\
    \ and seasonal climate \ninformation needs in rice farming systems in Northern\
    \ Ghana.  \n \nFirstly, our findings reveal that communicating forecast information\
    \ with \ndifferent probabilities in Northern Ghana significantly informs farmer\
    \ \ndecision-making thereby addressing the research question 1.  We, however,\
    \ \nreject the first hypothesis that claims that the higher the probability associated\
    \ \nwith a forecast, the more farmers are willing to act on their decision at\
    \ every \nstage of decision-making within the farming cycle. This hypothesis was\
    \ \nrejected because framers respond to different forecast probabilities is \n\
    dependent on the farming type. For instance, there is a positive correlation \n\
    The influence of forecast information on farmers’ decision-making\n175\n \nbetween\
    \ increasing forecast probability and farmers’ decision to act during \npre-season\
    \ and planting stages. Meanwhile, a negative correlation exists \nbetween increasing\
    \ forecast probability and the decision to act during Land \nPreparation, weed\
    \ control, fertilizer application and harvesting. Furthermore, \nwe discover that\
    \ farmers understood that 100% certainty in weather and \nseasonal climate forecast\
    \ information is non-achievable due to the erratic \nnature of events and are\
    \ thus adaptive in their response to forecast \nprobabilities. Breuer et al.,\
    \ (2000) and O’Brien & Vogel, (2003) concur that \nthe probabilistic nature of\
    \ weather and seasonal climate forecasts present \nparticular challenges. Hence,\
    \ for effective use of forecast information, \ndecision-making must take into\
    \ account the probability of forecast. Also, \nalthough all farmers expressed\
    \ the need to minimize uncertainty, farmer \nresponse varied and was dependent\
    \ on the farming system being practised and \nthe estimated risk that had to be\
    \ managed. For instance, due to water \navailability for supplementary irrigation\
    \ within the irrigation scheme, rice \nfarmers operating within the scheme face\
    \ lower risk levels and will act even \nwhen forecast probabilities are less than\
    \ 0.5. This was contrary in the case of \nrainfed farmers. Thus, forecast probabilities\
    \ must be clearly communicated to \nfarmers.  \n \nIn communicating forecast probabilities\
    \ one needs to reflect on the ways in \nwhich they are presented. From our experience,\
    \ using simple graphics with \nappealing colours to represent forecast probabilities\
    \ is an effective way of \nmaking farmers understand what is been communicated.\
    \ For instance, each \nfarmer type deals with forecast probability differently\
    \ and so forecast \nprobability could be communicated based on different types\
    \ of farmers. Less \nsophisticated farmers will prefer simpler information. Moreover,\
    \ how one \ndescribes forecast probabilities must fit into the domain of farmers’\
    \ local \nknowledge, therefore it is essential to understand how farmers generate\
    \ and \ndescribe probabilities. More so, ascertain whether their personal feelings\
    \ of \nrisk and vulnerability influence their definition.  It is important to\
    \ also \ncommunicate change in probabilities in simple terms and in languages\
    \ that \nare best understood by farmers. Further follow-ups on how a change in\
    \ \nprobability impact farmer decision-making or practices will enhance our \n\
    understanding of the pros and cons of a failed forecast on farmers’ livelihood.\
    \ \n \nSecondly, the study outcome also confirms a part of our first hypothesis\
    \ given \nthe findings that given different lead times of weather and seasonal\
    \ climate \nforecast, farmers made different decisions. However, not all lead\
    \ times \ncontribute to a change in decision-making. For example, seasonal forecast\
    \ \ninformation provided 3 months ahead of time is irrelevant in taking pre-\n\
    Chapter 6\n176\nseason decisions. What is strongly recommended is seasonal forecast\
    \ \ninformation at a lead time of 1 month. In our context, this is the period\
    \ within \nwhich most pre-season arrangements (farm machinery, labour, seeds,\
    \ etc.) \nand decisions happen. Crane et al., (2010) following their engagement\
    \ with \n38 farmers in Northern Georgia made similar conclusions that farmers\
    \ are \nless likely to rely on seasonal forecast with longer lead time. They \n\
    acknowledge that lead time must conform to users’ needs and priorities. \nEssentially,\
    \ the lead time for communicating seasonal forecast must be \nestimated through\
    \ the lens of farmers. Similarly, not all lead times for \ncommunicating weather\
    \ forecast information can contribute to informed \nfarmer decision-making. As\
    \ evident in our results, activities such as fertilizer \napplication and planting\
    \ are highly sensitive and difficult to undertake when \nforecast information\
    \ is communicated with a 3 day or 1 day lead time. Also, \nthe period of fertilizer\
    \ application is the most water sensitive stage of the \nfarming season. Thus,\
    \ a lead time of 1 week offers more flexibility for farmers \nto react to weather\
    \ forecast information.  This is however of least significance \nin the context\
    \ of decision-making on weed control and harvesting. \nThe use of Visually Facilitated\
    \ Scenario Mapping Workshops also renders \nthe opportunity to explore how a future\
    \ functioning hydroclimatic virtual \nobservatory providing farmers with forecast\
    \ information under different \nconditions could inform their decision-making.\
    \ The approach creates a \nhypothetical environment for establishing farmer response\
    \ to information \nfrom climate services or hydroclimatic virtual observatory\
    \ as proposed by \nNyadzi et al., (2018). Therefore, the results from this exercise\
    \ could slightly \ndiffer from real time events depending on conditions where\
    \ social and \nbiophysical conditions of farmers could vary. Scenario workshop\
    \ \nmethodologies originated in technological assessments and were designed to\
    \ \nfacilitate engagements between scientists and citizens in the appraisal of\
    \ new \ntechnologies (Mayer, 1997; Andersen et al., 1999). We give more of a visual\
    \ \nspin to the methodology which can be applied in other contexts in co-\nproduction\
    \ and citizen science experiments on climate services.  \nOur methodology also\
    \ had a number of limitations. First, maintaining other \nexternal factors (finance\
    \ and resource availability, etc.) constant could not \ndepict a vivid environment\
    \ for which farmers make decisions. Results could \nbe different should we consider\
    \ the interaction of these factors. Secondly, the \nexperiment focused on rainfall\
    \  without consideration for other atmospheric \nvariables (temperature, humidity,\
    \ etc.) which also could have influence \nfarmers’ decision outcomes. Hence, a\
    \ similar study with a broader look at \nother variables could produce different\
    \ results in different contexts.  Thirdly, \nThe influence of forecast information\
    \ on farmers’ decision-making\n177\n \nour test of focused on farmers’ decision\
    \ making under normal conditions \nperforming this experiment under extreme situations\
    \ could afford the \nopportunity to analyse comparatively what decisions farmers\
    \ take under \ndifferent situations.   \n \nIn a nutshell, the results of this\
    \ study have critical implications for the design \nand operation of climate services\
    \ particularly in Northern Ghana and also \nanswers our third research question.\
    \ First, the results confirm that different \nfarm types (irrigated, rainfed and\
    \ both) in the study area requires forecast \ninformation at specific lead times\
    \ and probabilities. Hence, operators of \nweather and seasonal climate information\
    \ services must understand their \naudience. Also, for effective decision making,\
    \ farmers have much preference \nfor weather and seasonal climate information\
    \ at 1 week and 1 month lead \ntimes respectively. This means in the provision\
    \ of information, emphasis must \nbe placed on the quality of forecast information\
    \ at these lead times in order to \nmeet farmers’ needs. This nevertheless is\
    \ valid in rice farming systems and \nhence could though hardly vary in other\
    \ systems. Thirdly, communicating \nforecast probabilities to farmers is essential.\
    \ Different types of farmers relate \ndifferently to forecast uncertainty or probabilities.\
    \ Farmers especially those \ninto rainfed farming have little room for taking\
    \ huge risk and will only use \nforecast information with higher probabilities.\
    \ Hence understanding these \ndynamics can extensively improve acceptance and\
    \ uptake of weather and \nseasonal information making climate services more useful\
    \ and impact \noriented. \n \n6.6 Conclusion \n \nBased on the evidence provided\
    \ in this study, we conclude that \ncommunicating forecast information at the\
    \ appropriate lead times and \nprobabilities has the potential of making climate\
    \ services more useful for \nfarmers. More specifically, we discover that, first,\
    \ an increase in forecast \nprobability does not necessarily mean farmers will\
    \ act. The decision to act is \nalso dependent on which farming stage there is.\
    \ Secondly, weather and \nseasonal climate forecast information at 1 week and\
    \ 1 month lead time \nrespectively most conveniently informed farmer decision\
    \ making. Secondly, \nfertilizer application and planting decisions stages of\
    \ rice farming are most \nsensitive to rainfall. Thirdly, irrigated rice farmers\
    \ have comparatively lower \nrisk level and will act irrespective of forecast\
    \ probabilities.  Farmers should \nalso adapt their decisions to the timing and\
    \ probabilities of the forecast \nprovided. Finally, user-driven climate services\
    \ should aim at engaging end-\nChapter 6\n178\n \nusers in the framing of information\
    \ and content rather than assume the \nuniversality of the usefulness of what\
    \ is presented for uptake.  \n \nAcknowledgement \n \nThis study is financially\

    \ \nThe observation that climate information services are considered as an \n\
    essential part of the climate change adaptation agenda (e.g. Orlove et al., \n\
    2004; Vaughan & Dessai, 2014; Lourenço et al., 2016) was the starting point \n\
    of this dissertation. In the past decade, substantial progress has been made in\
    \ \nthe provision of scientific forecast (SF) information at different timescales\
    \ to \nsupport farmers’ decision-making. Yet given the substantial gaps in SF,\
    \ \nstudies have shown that farmers in rural Africa, complement SF with their\
    \ \nown indigenous forecast (IF) and in most cases are more inclined to use IF\
    \ \ncompared to SF. Several scholarly works have therefore proposed the \nintegration\
    \ SF and IF to bridge the forecast information gap especially in \nareas where\
    \ scientific instruments and records are insufficient (Gagnon & \nBerteaux, 2009;\
    \ Chang et al., 2010; Ziervogel & Opere, 2010; Mafongoya, \n2017; Nyadzi et al.,\
    \ 2018). In addition, there has been a pressing call in recent \ntimes to shift\
    \ from climate information services that are science-driven and \nuser-informed\
    \ to a more collaborative approach where both scientist and end-\nusers co-produce.\
    \ This is what has been referred to in this dissertation as a \nshift from first\
    \ to second generation of climate information services, drawing \ninspiration\
    \ from the work of Karpouzoglou et al. (2016) on second generation \nEnvironmental\
    \ Virtual Observatories (EVOs). \nThis study, therefore, sets out to improve climate\
    \ services in Ghana through\nco-production by integrating scientific and indigenous\
    \ forecasts to support\nfarm decision making. To achieve this, I aim to answer\
    \ five research questions \nwhich are defined in chapter 1 and addressed in chapter\
    \ 2 ‐ 6. Answers to \nthese five research questions are presented in section 7.2.\
    \ In section 7.3, I \nelaborate on the results and discussed how they contribute\
    \ to the main \nobjective of the dissertation and fit into the broader literature.\
    \ In addition, the \ncontribution to science and society, key strength and limitations\
    \ and an \noutlook for further research on this topic are given. \n7.2 Answering\
    \ the research questions \nRQ1. What is the potential of climate information services\
    \ to support rice \nfarming systems? (Chapter 2)\nThis research question explored\
    \ the design and operationalization of second \ngeneration climate information\
    \ services that moderate the existing socio-\nChapter 7\n184\n \necological challenges\
    \ in rice production systems in Northern Ghana. Using \nresearch literature and\
    \ documents analysis, interviews and focus group \ndiscussions, I engaged different\
    \ stakeholders, and gathered and analysed \nprimary and secondary data. \n \n\
    I conclude that a second generation climate information service is potentially\
    \ \nrelevant for rice farming systems in Northern Ghana. This is because it has\
    \ \nthe potential to respond to biophysical (climate variability and water \n\
    unavailability) challenges that affect farmers daily and seasonal decision \n\
    making. Also, the analysis of the socio-institutional issues including \ninformation\
    \ delivery platforms informed the design of the services in a \nmanner that enhances\
    \ stakeholder interaction and information exchange and \nuse. The proposed second\
    \ generation climate services framework has the \npotential to address the challenges\
    \ associated with existing information \nservices such as user unfriendliness,\
    \ relevance and inaccuracies of forecast \ninformation, managing user expectation,\
    \ weak collaboration between \ninformation providers and users. Moreover, an important\
    \ driver of success to \nthe development of this framework is the intensive and\
    \ collective interaction \nof scientist and farmers. Citizen science has been\
    \ identified as a means of \nengaging farmers in data collection and information\
    \ exchange. The structure \nand mechanism of the second generation climate services\
    \ framework are \nsupportive in this regard.  \n \nFinally, reflecting on the\
    \ proposed framework using the four principles of \nresponsible innovation (anticipatory,\
    \ inclusive, reflexive and responsive) \nrevealed some possible future eventualities\
    \ that allowed the discussion of \nplausible solutions at an early stage in the\
    \ design process. One of such key \nchallenge anticipated was the continuous reliance\
    \ on farmers for data \ncollection. I argue that both rainfed and irrigated farmers\
    \ in the area are \nmotivated by the awareness of climate variability and limited\
    \ water \navailability and therefore, urgently need action to improve farm decision\
    \ \nmaking. However, it remains unclear how much time in the future will \nfarmers\
    \ devote to this process. I suggested that limited commitment of \nfarmers can\
    \ potentially reduce data availability and quality and therefore both \nscientist\
    \ and farmers must be realistic about the time needed for regular, \nmeetings,\
    \ data and information exchange. Thus, specific attention to openness \nand transparency\
    \ in the design process will allow participants to freely share \ntheir opinions\
    \ and concerns. At the same time, researchers need to be \nproactive and perceived\
    \ to be serious with the process through their active \nengagement. Moreover,\
    \ motivating farmers will maintain their continuous \ninterest and participation\
    \ in the process. \nSynthesis\n185\nRQ2. How successful can seasonal climate forecast\
    \ meet farmers’ \ninformation needs? (Chapter 3) \nThis research question aimed\
    \ to gain insights on demand-driven climate \nservice for rice farmers’ adaptive\
    \ decision making. To do this, I used \ninterviews and workshops to identify information\
    \ needs for each stage of rice \nfarming for the different types of farmers in\
    \ the area (rainfed, irrigated and \nboth rainfed and irrigated). This informed\
    \ the second step where I carried out \nskills assessment of the state of the\
    \ art ECMWF System 4 seasonal climate \nforecast system, discussing the potential\
    \ of the forecast in meeting these \nneeds. \nResults show that farmers’ key information\
    \ needs are related to rainfall and \ntemperature. The information needs are linked\
    \ with specific farming \ndecisions and stages of the growing season, which makes\
    \ the timing of \nproviding information relevant. The information needs of rice\
    \ farmers in \nNorthern Ghana are homogeneous although some of these needs are\
    \ ranked \nhigher than others depending on the frequency of use and farming type.\
    \ \nFarmers ranked rainfall distribution, temperature and dam water level as their\
    \ \nmost important information needs, followed by total rainfall amount and \n\
    onset as fairly important before the cessation of rainfall. Wind speed and \n\
    direction were considered the least important information need. Temperature \n\
    and precipitation patterns were found relevant by all farmers irrespective of\
    \ \ngeographical location or type of farming practised except dam water level\
    \ \nwhich was top on the list of irrigating farmers. \nECMWF-S4 exhibited skills\
    \ that were mostly independent of the variable, \nseason and lead times. This\
    \ is promising for meeting farmers’ needs at their \nmost preferred lead time\
    \ of 1 months, ensuring proper planning and decision-\nmaking. Generally, ECMWF-S4\
    \ is able to simulate well the inter-annual \nvariability, of rainfall, minimum\
    \ and maximum temperature for all seasons \nand lead times. This has great implications\
    \ for farmers’ decision making since \nincreasing rainfall variability results\
    \ in higher risk for farmers. Although at \nthe time of finishing this dissertation\
    \ the new ECMWF-S5 was launched (see \nJohnson et al., 2019), my findings already\
    \ demonstrate the potential use of \nmodel based seasonal forecasts and the value\
    \ of linking forecast information \nto farm-level decision making, which is an\
    \ essential step to improving climate \nservices.  \nChapter 7\n186\n \nRQ3. What\
    \ are the skills in indigenous and scientific forecast to promote \neffective\
    \ climate services? (Chapter 4) \n \nThis research question seeks to establish\
    \ how accurate indigenous forecasts \nof farmers are and what are the underlying\
    \ mechanisms behind farmers’ \nforecasting techniques.  I resolved this question\
    \ in two ways; first, I captured \nfarmers’ mental model of how indigenous ecological\
    \ indicators (IEIs) are \nused to predict the daily and seasonal climate rainfall.\
    \ Secondly, I used binary \nor dichotomous forecast verification measure to determine\
    \ the skills in \nfarmers’ rainfall forecast compared with Ghana Meteorological\
    \ Agency \n(GMet) forecast with no intention of discrediting neither of the forecasting\
    \ \nsystems.   \n \nI found that observational changes in IEIs in addition to\
    \ historical rainfall \npatterns serve as the fundamental template that allows\
    \ farmers to form \nexpectations for the coming season. Farmers have an established\
    \ mental \nmodel of how IEIs influence the prediction of different weather and\
    \ seasonal \nclimate events. On average, both farmers and GMet are able to accurately\
    \ \nforecast one out of every three daily rainfall events. Monthly analyses \n\
    indicated that GMet performed better than farmers in the months of April, \nJuly,\
    \ August and September while farmers performed better in May June and \nOctober.\
    \  At the seasonal scale, one out of every three farmers was able to \naccurately\
    \ make onset prediction while two out of every five farmers are able \nto get\
    \ rainfall amount and cessation right. Similarly, GMet was able to predict \n\
    rainfall amount accurately in one out of every three communities and one out \n\
    of every four communities for onset but was unable to accurately predict \ncessation\
    \ for the communities. I also found that indigenous forecast is not \nintuitive\
    \ but a skill rationally developed which improved with age and \nexperience. This\
    \ result, therefore, informs the next step which aimed at \nfinding a quantitative\
    \ method to integrate farmers indigenous forecast and \nscientific forecast (from\
    \ GMet).  \n \nRQ4.  How can the integration of indigenous and scientific forecast\
    \ \nimprove reliability and acceptability of climate services? (Chapter 5) \n\
    \ \nThis research question aimed at showing whether it is possible to integrate\
    \ \nindigenous forecast (IF) and scientific forecast (SF) into a single forecast\
    \ and \nwhether it will improve the reliability and acceptability of forecast\
    \ \ninformation among farmers in Northern Ghana. I did this by first reviewing\
    \ \nand analysing existing literature to determine the strength and weakness of\
    \ \nexisting integration methods. Secondly, I developed an integrated probability\
    \ \nSynthesis\n187\nforecast (IPF) method, tested its reliability compared to\
    \ IF and SF and \nevaluated the acceptability of the proposed IPF method.  \n\
    The answer to this research question was positive. The IPF method combines \n\
    the strengths of IF and SF and subsequently improves their reliability. \nTherefore,\
    \ IPF performed generally better than any of the individual \nforecasts. Specifically,\
    \ IPF showed improved reliability at both daily and \nseasonal timescale although\
    \ IF performed better at seasonal timescales. \nFurthermore, the IPF method had\
    \ far greater acceptability potential among \nfarmers (93% of farmers accept)\
    \ because it combines IF and SF into a single \nforecast, resolves the issues\
    \ of contradicting forecast information, requires \nless meeting time and improves\
    \ forecast reliability. \nFinally, as a proof of concept, I demonstrated that\
    \ it is possible to combine IF \nand SF into a single objective forecast despite\
    \ the potentially significant \ndifferences between them. I also showed that using\
    \ the IPF method to \nintegrate IF and SF improves the reliability and acceptability\
    \ of the resultant \nforecast information among farmers. \nRQ5.  How do weather\
    \ and climate information influence farmers’ \ndecision making? (Chapter 6)\n\
    For this research question, I investigated how timeliness (lead times) and \n\
    certainty (probability) of forecast information will influence farmers’ \ndecision\
    \ making. I explored this using Visually Facilitated Scenario \nWorkshops (VFSW).\
    \ \n I found that different types of farmers (irrigated, rainfed and both) respond\
    \ \nto forecast probabilities in different ways depending on their perceived risk\
    \ \nlevels. For instance, irrigated rice farmers have comparatively lower risk\
    \ level \nand will take decisions irrespective of forecast probabilities.  Also,\
    \ given \ndifferent lead times of weather and seasonal climate forecast, farmers\
    \ take \ndifferent decisions. Weather forecast provided at 1 week and seasonal\
    \ climate \nforecast provided at 1 month lead times have the most influence on\
    \ rice \nfarmers’ decision making. Also, unlike weed control and harvesting, farming\
    \ \ndecisions such as fertilizer application and planting are highly sensitive\
    \ to \nforecast lead times because they are critical stages of rice farming that\
    \ are \nwater sensitive.  \nFinally, forecasts lead times and probabilities are\
    \ essential for farmers’ \ndecision making, yet for existing climate services\
    \ in Ghana, either \nChapter 7\n188\n \ninformation are not provided at the appropriate\
    \ time or probabilities are not \ncommunicated.  Therefore, I argue that for climate\
    \ services to be useful, \nforecast information needs to be timely provided and\
    \ probabilities properly \ncommunicated to the different groups of farmers, bearing\
    \ in mind the varying \ndifferences in the sensitivity of each group and farm\
    \ stages. However, for \nfarmers to benefit from this depends on their flexibility\
    \ and willingness to \nadapt farm decisions to the timing and probability of the\
    \ forecast provided. \n \n7.3 Connecting the dots: discussion of the main findings\
    \ \n \nIn this section, I reflect on the link between the research questions and\
    \ \nprovide a broader perspective on the results.  \n \n7.3.1 Contribution to\
    \ a “second generation” climate services to support rice \nfarmers   \n \nThe\
    \ anticipatory, inclusiveness, reflexivity and responsiveness of the \nproposed\
    \ framework in Chapter 2 shows the efficiency and robustness for \nmaking climate\
    \ information services useful.  This conclusion was drawn from \nthe results of\
    \ the four dimension of responsible innovation which was used to \nevaluate the\
    \ proposed second generation climate services framework in \nchapter 2. The framework\
    \ is therefore recommended for the development of \na second generation climate\
    \ services to improve the current practice of \nclimate information provision\
    \ for rice farmers in Ghana. The information \nexchange element within the framework\
    \ offers an additional feature that \ndistinguishes it from current climate information\
    \ services. Farmers can be \nactively engaged in the co-production process where\
    \ they can share their \nforecast information and receive tangible information\
    \ and advice for their \nadaptive farm decision-making. The ICT part of the framework\
    \ allows for \neasy and automated data handling activities such as indigenous\
    \ and scientific \ndata collection, processes, analysis, and visualization once\
    \ an algorithm is \nbuilt. Further, the framework, unlike any other affords the\
    \ opportunity to \ninclude indigenous forecast data and information into climate\
    \ services.  \n \nThe framework also introduced citizen science as a principle\
    \ that enables the \nco-production of climate services. General application and\
    \ benefit of citizen \nscience have been well documented in literature as an approach\
    \ to engage \nnon-scientist to gather scientific data and generate knowledge (Gura,\
    \ 2013).  \nHowever, its application and value for climate services have not been\
    \ well \nexplored. A typical example is Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and\
    \ \nSnow Network (CoCoRaHS) where volunteers of all ages and backgrounds \nSynthesis\n\
    189\nfrom United States, Canada, and the Bahamas are engaged to measure and \n\
    map rain, hail and snow (Phillips et al., 2019). In chapter 4, I demonstrated\
    \ \nthe value of citizen science as an approach for collecting indigenous forecast\
    \ \nand local rainfall observation. I did this by experimenting with rice farmers\
    \ \nwho recorded and sent in forecast and observed rainfall for a period of time\
    \ \n(daily forecast for seven months in 2017 and seasonal forecast for 2017 and\
    \ \n2018).  Moreover, in using citizen science, I have shown that knowledge \n\
    possessed by local people can contribute to climate services by offering \nobservations\
    \ and interpretation at a much finer spatial scale with considerable \ntemporal\
    \ depth, and by highlighting aspects (in this case indigenous \necological indicators)\
    \ that may not be considered by climate scientists in \ndeveloping climate services\
    \ and climate change adaptation practices.  \nThe use of sapelli mobile app as\
    \ a tool for citizen science provided some \nbenefits; first, it ensures spatial\
    \ and temporal monitoring of indigenous \nforecast data (i.e. the date, time and\
    \ location of data). Secondly, it provides \ninsight into how farmers with low\
    \ literacy levels could interact with ICT \nbased tools for future information\
    \ exchange. Third, it helps to collate large \nand detailed data sets over a period\
    \ for analysis. Furthermore, the results \npresented in chapter 4 confirms that\
    \ farmers, when trained, are comfortable \nand able to use smartphones. \n7.3.2\
    \ Bridging the gap in forecast integration for improved climate services \nProgress\
    \ has been made in providing climate information services especially \nin areas\
    \ where meteorological instruments are inadequate. Yet there are still \nsubstantial\
    \ gaps with regards to providing location-specific forecasts that is \nreliable\
    \ and acceptable by smallholder farmers.  Consequently, farmers resort \nto using\
    \ indigenous forecast (IF) where local ecological indicators and \nexperiences\
    \ are used to forecast weather and seasonal climatic conditions \n(Radeny et al.,\
    \ 2019). Sometimes they use IF alongside scientific forecast \n(SF) (Nyantakyi-Frimpong,\
    \ 2013; Nyadzi et al., 2018) which in most cases \nhas their own unique challenges\
    \ thereby leading to the call for integrating IF \nwith SF at the local level\
    \ (Kolawole et al., 2014; Mahoo et al., 2015). \nChapter 2 of this dissertation\
    \ provides insight into the fact that farmers in \nNorthern Ghana use both scientific\
    \ and indigenous forecast information for \ntheir daily and seasonal decisions.\
    \ In chapter 1 (section 1.3), one could \nappreciate that IF and SF have a distinct\
    \ weakness which causes challenges \nfor their use. First, as discussed in chapter\
    \ 4 and 5, farmers are often confused \nabout what decision to take when IF and\
    \ SF are both provided, especially in \nChapter 7\n190\n \ncases where they produce\
    \ contradicting forecasts information. Second, \nchapter 2 and 3 show that SF\
    \ issued by GMet are at a coarse spatial scale \ncompared to IF and therefore\
    \ does not meet the farmers’ local information \nneeds. Third, the qualitative\
    \ nature and the presence of presumed spirituality \nof IF that is absent in SF\
    \ have created a bad reputation among policymakers \nand scientists who view IF\
    \ with much scepticism.  Meanwhile, local farmers \nhave difficulties embracing\
    \ SFs because of the absence of a sense of \nownership and lack of trust in the\
    \ service provider, affecting uptake. The \ncynicism of climatologists and meteorologists\
    \ towards farmers’ IF and vice \nversa limits the opportunity for integration.\
    \  Moreover, in chapter 5, it was \nobserved that forecast information will be\
    \ more acceptable by farmers when \nIF and SF are integrated. Furthermore, information\
    \ is more acceptable by \nlocal people when it is embedded within the context\
    \ of their existing \nknowledge. \n \nIn spite of the call to integrate IF and\
    \ SF, one question that remained \nunanswered is whether combining both IF and\
    \ SF is even possible? (see \nAgrawal, 2002; Plotz et al., 2017). In chapter 3,\
    \ evidence for the use of \nindigenous forecast by farmers for their farm decision\
    \ making are shown. \nChapter 4 presents an understanding of farmers’ techniques\
    \ and for the first \ntime quantitatively determining the skills of the indigenous\
    \ forecast. I \ndemonstrated that, in Northern Ghana, the accuracy of farmers’\
    \ indigenous \nforecast is generally as good as scientific forecast provided by\
    \ Ghana \nMeteorological Agency (GMet). In chapter 5, I tested and accepted the\
    \ \nhypothesis that integrated probability forecast (IPF) method improve the \n\
    reliability and acceptability of forecast information among farmers. Results \n\
    show that leveraging on the strength of IF and SF, IPF in general, provided \n\
    reliable forecast information at both daily and seasonal timescale with far \n\
    greater farmers acceptability potential. Therefore, in this dissertation, I have\
    \ \nshown that combining IF and SF into a single forecast is not only possible\
    \ but \nhas greater potential for acceptability among farmers in Ghana than SF\
    \ and \nIF individually.  \n \n7.3.3 Improving uptake of climate information services\
    \ for agriculture \ndecision-making  \n \nIn most cases where climate information\
    \ services are introduced, the \ndisconnect between providers and farmers has\
    \ resulted in low uptake of \ninformation. Inadequate knowledge on ways to successfully\
    \ engage farmers \nfor their information needs, identify appropriate timeframe\
    \ and medium to \ndeliver information, communicating probability of uncertainties,\
    \ improving \nSynthesis\n191\naccuracy \nof \ninformation, \nintegrating \nindigenous\
    \ \nknowledge \nand \nunderstanding how information influence decision making\
    \ have been listed \nas part of the problem of low uptake of climate services\
    \ (Lemos et al., 2012; \nKniveton et al., 2015; Ouedraogo et al., 2018; Singh\
    \ et al., 2018; Nyamekye \net al., 2019). Given the existing gap leading to reduced\
    \ uptake of climate \ninformation, the five research questions of this dissertation\
    \ aimed at \nhighlighting the importance of co-producing ‘farmer-useful’ climate\
    \ \ninformation.  \nChapter 2 present an overall set up for effectively developing\
    \ climate services \nthat are useful for rice farming systems in Northern Ghana\
    \ by identifying and \naddressing the socio-ecological challenges of the study\
    \ area in addition to \nfactors that limit the efficiency of existing information\
    \ systems. Results \ndemonstrated that a two-directional model of climate services\
    \ where farmers \nare active in all stages of the process has potential for forecast\
    \ information \nuptake. The one-way approach, which is still present in existing\
    \ information \nsystems has been criticized for its monopoly on the production\
    \ of knowledge \nby researchers. In fact, lessons from existing information systems\
    \ show that \nthe degree of participation of farmers in developing such systems\
    \ for that \nmatter climate services was often inadequate (Nyadzi et al., 2018;\
    \ Ouedraogo \net al., 2018). In many cases, local people were not involved in\
    \ data gathering \nand interpretation. Participation was often limited to a couple\
    \ of workshops \nwhere the aim of the information systems is communicated, giving\
    \ \nresearchers the choice to determine the problem, gather and interpret the\
    \ \nscientific data and plan the approach of information delivery with little\
    \ \nconsideration for farmers own indigenous knowledge and information need. \
    \ \nProviding seasonal forecast at a lead time of a month and beyond has \npreviously\
    \ been a problem even for the best models limiting its usefulness for \nfarmers\
    \ (Hansen, 2002). I demonstrated in chapter 3 that it is possible to help \nfarmers’\
    \ seasonal decision making at their most preferred lead time of one \nmonth and\
    \ beyond with the state-of-the-art ECMWF-S4 ensemble forecast \nproduct. The key\
    \ lessons discussed in chapter 3 are that using an \ninterdisciplinary approach\
    \ to connect forecast products with information \nneeds for farm management can\
    \ contribute to the successful uptake of \nforecast information by farmers. This\
    \ is important because, existing works \neither concentrate on bottom-up fashion\
    \ focusing on farmers’ access and use \nof forecast information and potential\
    \ challenges they encounter or focusses \non technical and top-down approaches,\
    \ assessing the skills of existing \nforecasts for several regions across the\
    \ globe. Combining both approaches in \nan interdisciplinary manner in this dissertation\
    \ allowed the identification of \nChapter 7\n192\n \npertinent rice farmers’ decisions\
    \ and which information is required to support \nthese decisions.  \n \nThe utilization\
    \ of local knowledge and practices in this study provides a range \nof benefits\
    \ that the scientific community with their weather and seasonal \nforecast models\
    \ could not offer. Engaging farmers throughout the study \naddresses the challenges\
    \ of credibility, legitimacy, scale, cognition, familiar \ninstitutional practices\
    \ and complex decision-making currently affecting the \nuptake of climate information\
    \ services that focus on scientific information \nonly, as detailed by Patt &\
    \ Gwata, (2002) and Nyamekye et al. (2019). \n \nEarlier, the scale of forecast\
    \ is mentioned as a common constraint of forecast \nuptake. In most cases, this\
    \ concern arises when the forecast information \nissued is an average covering\
    \ a wide geographical area such that local details \nare left out or remains unclear.\
    \ A number of scientific techniques (either \nstatistical or dynamical) exist\
    \ to translate forecast information from a coarser \nto finer resolutions, collectively\
    \ known as downscaling. However, these \ntechniques are limited by model inadequacies\
    \ or the availability and quality \nof observed data from metrological stations\
    \ which in most cases are \ninadequate and unrepresentative in local communities\
    \ (Caffrey & Farmer, \n2014). Farmers, as shown in chapter 3, were well capable\
    \ of recording local \nrainfall with tailor-made rain-gauges and in providing\
    \ indigenous forecast at \nthe community level. They also provided some perspective\
    \ into the \ninterpretation of local data which might be overlooked by scientists.\
    \ \nMoreover, in chapter 4, I observed that indigenous forecast is finer in \n\
    resolution and more valuable at the community level than GMet forecast \nwhich\
    \ is coarse and issued at a regional level. Kniveton et al. (2015), posit \nthat\
    \ rather than trying to improve on inherently uncertain scientific forecasts,\
    \ \nthe techniques of knowledge timelines and participatory downscaling that use\
    \ \nlocal knowledge to understand and downscale scientifically based climate and\
    \ \nweather information in time, space and information type to a range of \noutcomes\
    \ and risks can be used. In doing so, the authors hoped that this \nprocess will\
    \ extend the ownership of uncertainty to the wider community of \nusers.  \n \n\
    The timeliness and probability of forecast information present certain \nchallenges\
    \ to the uptake of weather and climate information for decision \nmaking. I have\
    \ demonstrated the validity of this observation in chapter 6. In \nthat, forecast\
    \ lead times and probabilities influence which decision farmers \ntake given forecast\
    \ information. For instance, the credibility of the forecast \ncan be influenced\
    \ by the lead time at which the forecast is provided. Forecasts \nSynthesis\n\
    193\n \nthat give enough lead time allow more flexibility and efficient adjustments\
    \ of \nfarm decision. More so the credibility of forecast becomes a concern when\
    \ \nthe forecasts are communicated in deterministic rather than probabilistic\
    \ \nform. Predicting future atmospheric conditions are inherently uncertain for\
    \ a \nnumber of reasons including, for example, the chaotic nature of the \natmosphere\
    \ and inadequacies of forecasting models (Kniveton et al., 2015). \nEstimating\
    \ forecast certainty and communicating them is not only an \nexpected scientific\
    \ practice but are also potentially useful to everyday \ndecision‐making. Yet,\
    \ in Ghana, as at the time of this research, only seasonal \nclimate forecast\
    \ is issued with forecast probabilities. Weather forecast for \ndaily decision\
    \ making are deterministic in nature, provided as a single value \nfor parameters\
    \ such as rainfall and temperature. In recent times, studies have \ncalled for\
    \ the inclusion of uncertainty in forecast information despite the \nconcerns\
    \ that forecasts uncertainty will not be well understood by end‐users \nand thus\
    \ translate into it having no influence on decision making (Joslyn & \nSavelli,\
    \ 2010). Farmers decision making is framed around the probability of \nthe forecast\
    \ given. Therefore, communicating forecast probability supports \nfarmers in taking\
    \ better decision, proper planning and reducing unrealistic \nexpectations of\
    \ forecast accuracy and reliability of climate service in general.  \nIn chapter\
    \ 6, I have shown that contrary to popular belief that communicating \nuncertainty\
    \ information undermines farmers’ confidence in the service, it is \nrather reassuring\
    \ and creates a sense of transparency and honesty that boost \nfarmers’ confidence\
    \ that forecast information is objectively provided. \nHowever, it is essential\
    \ to tailor the certainty information in a way that \nfarmers can comprehend regardless\
    \ of their literacy level.  \n \n7.4 Scientific contribution  \n \nRelatively\
    \ few studies have explored the application of indigenous ecological \nknowledge\
    \ for weather and seasonal climate forecasting (Roncoli, Ingram, & \nKirshen,\
    \ 2002; Manyanhaire, and Miriam Chitura, & and, 2015). A minority \nof scholars\
    \ have identified and discuss indigenous ecological indicators used \nfor IF,\
    \ but there remains a lack of clarity and empirical evidence for (1) the \ncognitive\
    \ underlying mechanism for generating IF and (2) the accuracy \n(skills) of IF\
    \ expressed quantitatively. This dissertation, to the best of my \nknowledge,\
    \ is the first to use mental modelling approach to establish how \nfarmers use\
    \ indigenous ecological indicators to predict atmospheric events \nsuch as rainfall\
    \ onset, amount and cessation. It is also the first to quantitatively \nevaluate\
    \ the accuracy (skills) of IF. The use of mental model theoretically \nshows the\
    \ cognitive process involves in farmers forecast decision making. \nThis is vital\
    \ for a scholarly debate that focuses on whether generating IF is an \nChapter\
    \ 7\n194\n \nintuitive or rational process. In this thesis, I have shown that\
    \ the process is \nrational. The skills or accuracy of IF as I have demonstrated\
    \ contributes to \ntheories and scientific literature that seek to make a case\
    \ for the validity and \npossibility of transferring indigenous knowledge for\
    \ improved climate studies \nand effective management of ecosystems in general.\
    \ It is important to mention \nthat citizen science and the mental modelling methods\
    \ are hardly used in the \ncontext of climate change adaptation and thus form\
    \ an important part of the \nmethodological contribution of this dissertation.\
    \ \n \nExisting literature suggests that the methodological toolkit is expanding\
    \ \nbeyond approaches of collecting indigenous knowledge to methods that bring\
    \ \ndifferent sources and forms of knowledge together (Bohensky & Maru, 2011).\
    \ \nEarlier efforts have proposed a subjective method and more sophisticated \n\
    untried science integration method (Plotz et al., 2017). Yet in this dissertation,\
    \ \nI have developed and tested a simple objective method (integrated probability\
    \ \nmethod) that combine SF and IF into a single forecast for farm decision \n\
    making. Results from this dissertation have contributed to the theory of \nknowledge\
    \ integration that is cognizant of culture and context.  \n \nThis study is the\
    \ first to introduce a framework for second-generation climate \nservices that\
    \ include citizen science as a means of achieving co-production. \nTo improve\
    \ the degree of engagement between scientist and farmers at data \ncollection\
    \ and exchange, I employed citizen science approach where local \nfarmers were\
    \ trained to record rainfall with tailor-made rain gauges while \nproviding their\
    \ rain forecast using mobile apps. The use of citizen science and \nmobile apps\
    \ as an enabling platform for engaging farmers offers a new \nopportunity for\
    \ research. For example, downscaling and improving spatial \nresolution forecast\
    \ information for climate impact studies. Also, empowering \nmarginalized knowledge\
    \ systems and facilitating social learning. \n \nThis study shows (in chapter\
    \ 3) that, for climate information services to be \nuseful for farmers, it is\
    \ essential though not quite simple to understand the \nvarious farm actions and\
    \ decisions that are taken and match them with the \nrequired information. Using\
    \ an interdisciplinary approach to evaluate \nfarmers’ information needs and carry\
    \ out skills assessment of forecast product \nenabled a broader contextualization\
    \ of existing research which is often done \nin isolation. Also been able to show\
    \ that seasonal climate forecast up to lead \nmonth 2 can be provided to meet\
    \ the needs of farmers in Northern Ghana is \nessential for recognising the scientific\
    \ potential for model based seasonal \nclimate forecast. To my knowledge, no previous\
    \ studies have done this. Also, \nthis study has used what it called visually\
    \ facilitated scenario mapping to \nSynthesis\n195\n \nshow that, aside providing\
    \ farmers with the required information need, \ncommunicating forecast at appropriate\
    \ lead times and with its uncertainty or \nprobabilities have substantial influence\
    \ on which decision farmers will take. \nThe results can be used by researchers\
    \ who develop climate services for \nagriculture. The results could also provide\
    \ a template for making climate \nservices actionable for other sectors.  \n \n\
    The notion that second-generation climate information services can improve \n\
    forecast reliability and acceptability invites a fundamental question that must\
    \ \nbe continually revisited: are there locally specific social-ecological issues\
    \ that \nwill hinder or promote operationability of such information services?\
    \ This \ndissertation theoretically advocates that climate information systems\
    \ are \nplace-based and context-sensitive, requiring a thorough understanding\
    \ of \nlocal socio-ecological issues that has the potential to affect co-production\
    \ and \nuptake of information. The dissertation is also the first to argue for\
    \ making \nclimate services responsible by applying the four dimensions of responsible\
    \ \ninnovation as proposed by Stilgoe et al. (2013), to reflect on the novelty\
    \ as \nwell as unforeseen implications climate information services on society.\
    \ \nTherefore, results obtained have provided insights to conceptualize \nResponsible\
    \ Innovation in the context of climate information services.  This \nprovides\
    \ opportunities for case studies to address potential challenges and \nconsequences\
    \ of developing actionable climate services in a more detailed \nmanner. \n \n\
    Overall, this is the first study that has proposed a framework for a second \n\
    generation climate services in Ghana. It contributes to addressing the gap that\
    \ \naffects the actionability and uptake of climate services provided by the Ghana\
    \ \nMeteorological Agency (GMet) and other information providers such as \nESOKO.\
    \ The methodological approach and results of this study could \ncontribute to\
    \ research that focus on climate services in Ghana.   \n \n7.5 Societal contribution\
    \  \n \nThis study unpacks a number of issues that society could benefit from.\
    \ First I \nhave provided evidence of ways to improve acceptability and usability\
    \ of \nweather and seasonal climate information for farmers. For instance, \n\
    embedding scientific weather and seasonal climate information into farmers \n\
    cultural and social context is a sure way to get this information accepted. Also,\
    \ \nmatching information with needs, communicating forecast at the appropriate\
    \ \nlead time and with the level of uncertainty will improve forecast uptake.\
    \ \n \nChapter 7\n196\n \nSecondly, farmers in Northern Ghana have complained\
    \ about the reliability \nof available scientific weather and seasonal climate\
    \ forecast. Uptake of \nclimate information services is dependent on its accuracy.\
    \ This dissertation \nhas proposed that integrating scientific forecast with indigenous\
    \ forecast will \nimprove the reliability of the existing forecast. This knowledge\
    \ will help \nadvance climate services in Ghana in ways that have not been initially\
    \ thought \nabout. For instance, this study can serve as a template for the Ghana\
    \ \nMeteorological Agency (GMet) to improve the spatial resolution of their \n\
    forecast and thereby improving its reliability for farmers. Moreover, there is\
    \ \ncurrently no guidance on how to engage farmers in collecting and handling\
    \ \ntheir indigenous forecast as well as integrating it with a scientific forecast.\
    \ \n \nThird, knowledge generated from this dissertation will help to improve\
    \ the \ndesign and/or implementation of agriculture climate services. Documenting\
    \ \nthe challenges of existing information services in this dissertation is critical\
    \ \nfor providing insights that improve the design and delivery of climate \n\
    services. Therefore, it is essential for climate services developers to consider\
    \ \nin their design and information delivery practice, (1) the user unfriendliness\
    \ \nfor easy access and interpretation by farmers especially illiterate farmers,\
    \ (2) \naccuracy of forecast information by providing forecast with better skills\
    \ and \nat a finer resolution targeting a specific location (3) relevance of forecast\
    \ \ninformation tailored to specific needs and timely provided, (4) managing user\
    \ \nexpectation by engaging end-users very early in the design process making\
    \ \nthem familiar with the various limitations as well as communicating \nuncertainty\
    \ and  (5) strengthening collaboration among scientists, farmers and \nother key\
    \ stakeholders by regular consultation and transparent process for all. \nImportantly,\
    \ engaging farmers throughout the project life and involving them \nin data collection\
    \ has helped build their capacity and empower them as well \nas deepen their awareness\
    \ of the difficulties in predicting atmospheric events. \nGiven their new knowledge\
    \ and capacity, farmers would be more \nunderstanding of the challenges that come\
    \ with climate services.  \n \nFinally, this study will be beneficial to climate\
    \ services projects carried out in \nGhana and elsewhere. While this study focused\
    \ on rice farmers, the approach \ncould also be adapted for other kinds of farmers.\
    \ Results from this study also \nshow that rice farmers could potentially improve\
    \ their production if they have \naccessible and usable weather and seasonal climate\
    \ information. Moreover, \nthe state-of-the-art ECMWF-S4 forecast system is skilful\
    \ at predicting \nrainfall, minimum and maximum temperature in Northern Ghana.\
    \ \n \nSynthesis\n197\n7.6 Reflecting backwards; strength and limitations of the\
    \ research \nThe adoption of multimethod research approach in this dissertation\
    \ ensures \nthe validity of the research designed to better understand empirically,\
    \ ways to \nimprove the reliability and acceptability of climate services. This\
    \ section \nreflects on the methodological choices, the overall research validity,\
    \ and \nlimitations of the study. \nThe citizen science method employed in this\
    \ study deepened the \nunderstanding of the role of local people in improving\
    \ climate services. The \nmethod offered a robust approach of gathering and quantitatively\
    \ interpreting \nlocal data in a finer resolution that might be difficult to achieve\
    \ by the \nscientific community. However, the citizen science process was laborious\
    \ and \nexpensive when it comes to using smart mobile phones, training farmers\
    \ and \naccessing forecast data.  \nThe validity of indigenous forecast (IF) data\
    \ was achieved by comparing \nfarmers’ observed rainfall data with GMet data.\
    \ Obtaining a similar pattern \nin both datasets increased confidence in the quality\
    \ of IF data provided by \nfarmers. However, using a relatively short dataset\
    \ to validate the IPF method \ncould not allow stronger claims of results although\
    \ good enough to prove our \nconcept. Unlike, science-based forecast where long\
    \ term datasets are \navailable, this is unfortunately not possible for IF. Therefore,\
    \ longer time \nseries data needs to be collected for a more robust analysis of\
    \ temporal and \nspatial variability of forecast and for validating IPF method.\
    \  \nTo ensure that quality IF data was collected for the analysis, a rigorous\
    \ \nparticipatory process was used to purposively select 12 expert farmers who\
    \ \nwere trained to understand and use scientific terminologies and tools to \n\
    provide data. The sampling method and sample size were relevant \nconsidering\
    \ the fact that not all farmers are good forecasters. Also, it allowed \nin-depth\
    \ study of the indigenous people’ forecast techniques and skills as well \nas\
    \ the use of smart mobile phones. Nevertheless, increasing the number of \nexpert\
    \ farmers will allow the analysis of the variation of results within and \nbetween\
    \ communities. Therefore, subsequent studies should increase the \nnumber of farmers\
    \ in each community. More so, an expansion in the use of \nsmart phones and better\
    \ cell phone coverage will make it easier to repeat this \nwith more farmers in\
    \ future studies.  \nUsing the Fuzzy-logic Cognitive Mapping approach with the\
    \ aid of a \ncomputer-based software (Mental Model), I was able to capture the\
    \ \nChapter 7\n198\n \nunderlying process behind the indigenous forecasting. The\
    \ mental model \nrevealed the cognitive mechanism behind farmers use of indigenous\
    \ \necological indicators for predicting weather and seasonal climate. This \n\
    method fulfilled an important function of demonstrating that farmers do not \n\
    generate indigenous forecast intuitively, rather use a rational process where\
    \ \neach indicator has a degree of influence on the expected event. The method\
    \ \nlay emphasis on the abstraction of farmers thought and perception to \nanticipate\
    \ events by providing an imaginary picture of how farmers produce \ntheir forecast.\
    \ \n \nThe participatory methods (interviews, focus group discussion, workshops)\
    \ \nemployed in the study offered the opportunity for the respondent to construct\
    \ \nversions of reality in an interactive interplay with the interviewer. However,\
    \ \nI acknowledge the possible subjectivity of the data provided by respondents\
    \ \nand participants (Gill et al., 2008; Gubrium & Holstein, 2012). This obviously\
    \ \nhas implications for data validity and reliability. To address this, I embarked\
    \ \non various measures that address both internal and external validity. The\
    \ \nprotocols for the participatory methods were pre-tested among the target \n\
    group to ensure unambiguity and clarity. In all circumstances, changes were \n\
    made to the final protocols based on received feedback. The original protocol\
    \ \nfor these methods containing the questions in English was translated into\
    \ the \nlocal popular Dagbani language. The validity of the collected data was\
    \ \nincreased by the response from the feedback workshops that allowed \nreflection\
    \ and discussions of results by participants to reduce interpretation \nbias.\
    \ Also, the inclusion of open-ended questions allowed further probing for \nclarity\
    \ and certainty. The document and literature review method provided a \nset of\
    \ secondary data and information that served as a baseline for the research \n\
    and at the same time gave new insight into data collection and analysis. \n \n\
    Additionally, using interviews to determine farmers’ information needs in \nchapter\
    \ 3 and acceptability of integrated forecast in chapter 5 had some \nlimitations.\
    \ A more comprehensive design of the questionnaire might have \nallowed for a\
    \ more advanced statistical analysis in search of other possible \nexplanatory\
    \ variables. I suggest that such an extended analysis is warranted \nfor further\
    \ studies. For example, understanding how socio-economic factors \ncould affect\
    \ the acceptability of integrated forecast could provide better \ncontext into\
    \ forecast acceptability and use. Also, in chapter 6, using an ex-\nante evaluation\
    \ approach through the Visually Facilitated Scenario \nWorkshops (VFSW) might\
    \ not have provided realistic and detail analysis of \ndecision farmers will take,\
    \ given different forecast lead times and \nuncertainties. An analysis of real-time\
    \ information provision and farmer’s \nSynthesis\n199\ndecision making could provide\
    \ better insight. Further research is needed to \nevaluate real-time weather and\
    \ seasonal climate information services that \ncommunicate forecast probabilities\
    \ and information at different lead times. \nDoing this will provide a comprehensive\
    \ understanding of the real-time effect \nof these two factors on forecast uptake.\
    \ \nThe forecast verification methods used in this study provided insights into\
    \ the \nquality of ECMWF-S4 over Northern Ghana. Moreover, to first compare \n\
    WFDEI data to locally observed GMet data ascertain the validity of WFDEI \ndata\
    \ for the verification exercise. While this analysis was based on system 4, \n\
    far before system 5 was released, this limits the usefulness of your results.\
    \ \nHowever, it might be easy and useful to repeat the analyses with S5. The \n\
    Waterapps project (http://www.waterapps.net/en-us/home/) is currently \nanalysing\
    \ system 5 forecasts, following the same methodology.  \nAlso in this study, I\
    \ argued that the existence of skill in ECMWF-S4 forecast \nshowed potential for\
    \ predicting identified information needs. Nonetheless \nusing seasonal average\
    \ as a proxy to assess performance and discuss the \npossibility of meeting farmers’\
    \ needs in chapter 3 does not allow for the \nevaluation of the predictability\
    \ of each of the information needs identified. \nFor example, onset and cessation\
    \ are expressed in calendar dates while the \ndam water level requires a hydrological\
    \ method to determine its \npredictability. As a result, the conclusions on the\
    \ predictability of information \nneeds are fuzzier rather than objective. Therefore,\
    \ to make stronger claims on \nthe predictability of each information need with\
    \ ECMWF-S4, further specific \npredictability studies are required.  \nFinally,\
    \ the proposed framework for second-generation climate services in \nchapter 2\
    \ has only been explored and proposed for Northern Ghana. Yet not \npractically\
    \ implemented although several aspects of its elements tested. \nTherefore, in\
    \ order to make stronger claims about its potential to improve \nforecast uptake\
    \ compared to existing systems, there is a need for further \ntesting.    \n7.7.\
    \ Future outlook and directions for further research and \npolicymaking \nInterdisciplinary\
    \ research on societal problems raises many new questions as \nit seeks to provide\
    \ answers. This research is in no way different. Based on the \nfindings, I observed\
    \ the need for further investigation in different areas. In \nthis section, I\
    \ will translate conclusions drawn from the scientific and societal \nChapter\
    \ 7\n200\n \ncontributions in addition to the research strength and limitation\
    \ into a set of \nrecommendations.  \n \nFirst, the suggested second-generation\
    \ climate services framework in chapter \n2 needs to go beyond a conceptual framework.\
    \ The empirical testing of the \nframework could refine the underlying assumptions\
    \ that underpin the current \ndesign and operational logic, thereby allowing a\
    \ better understanding of the \nframework in providing climate services that are\
    \ actionable and influence \nfarmers decision making. Applying this framework\
    \ to different climate \nservices project will reveal which element within the\
    \ framework needs \nadjustment and which needs improvement. Already the Wateraps\
    \ project been \nimplemented in the south of Ghana has adopted this framework\
    \ to provide \nweather and seasonal climate information to peri-urban farmers.\
    \  \n \nSecondly, if one message becomes apparent from this dissertation it is\
    \ that \nindigenous forecast has potential value for climate services. However,\
    \ to \nenhance the understanding and advancement of this field, long-term data\
    \ sets \nare crucial. The amount of data used and the number of farmers engaged\
    \ in \nchapter 4 and 5 did not allow making stronger claims.  I suggest the need\
    \ to \nbuild a database to collect indigenous forecast for a longer period for\
    \ analysis. \nAlso, increasing the number of farmers for IF data collection offers\
    \ the \nopportunity for analysing variation within and between communities. With\
    \ \nWaterapps project, such endeavour is possible as a mobile app is developed\
    \ \nwith the aim to continue collecting indigenous forecast data. Furthermore,\
    \ it \nis expected that climate change will have an impact on land cover and \n\
    landscape. Therefore, there is a need to investigate how climate variability \n\
    and change will affect the indigenous indicators used for indigenous \nforecasting.\
    \  \n \nFinally, in Ghana, agriculture water management and food production is\
    \ \nconstrained by climate variability and change. Effective climate services\
    \ can \nbe crucial to improving farmers’ decision making, developing water \n\
    management strategies and ultimately ensuring food security. Yet climate \nservices/information\
    \ are scarcely mentioned in agricultural policy documents \n(Naab et al., 2019).\
    \ While this study focuses on improving the reliability and \nacceptability of\
    \ forecast information by local farmers, mainstreaming climate \nservices should\
    \ be at the forefront in ensuring resilient agriculture. Ample \nevidence already\
    \ suggests the contributory value of climate services in the \nagriculture sector.\
    \ However, further research is required to evaluate the actual \nimpact of climate\
    \ services on farmers’ livelihood and to determine how \nclimate services may\
    \ influence agriculture policy formulation. In addition, \nSynthesis\ndiffers\
    \ from each other, they can be seen as two opposite sides of a coin whose\nof\

    \ cognitive mapping (FCM) \nFuzzy-logic cognitive mapping (FCM) is a semi-quantitative\
    \ modelling approach \nused to understand behaviours of many complex systems (Glykas,\
    \ 2010). They \ncollect and standardize individual and collective community knowledge\
    \ using \nsimple modelling tasks (Ozesmi and Ozesmi, 2004; Gray et al., 2012)\
    \ in a real-time \nand participatory modelling environment (Gray et al., 2013).\
    \ FCMs are capable of \ncollecting qualitative information from stakeholders and\
    \ quantitatively assigned \nweighted edges usually between -1 and 1, to define\
    \ mathematical pairwise \nassociations. The pairwise relationships between concepts\
    \ are used to calculate the \ncumulative strength of connections between elements\
    \ with weighted edges, \nhighlighting any domain as a system. Further, developed\
    \ semi-quantitative scenarios \nallow scenario analysis of plausible outcomes\
    \ (Özesmi and Özesmi, 2004). This \napproach is becoming an increasingly popular\
    \ way to incorporate local or expert \nknowledge into ecological decision-making\
    \ (Nyaki et al., 2014; Halbrendt et al., \n2014). Mental Modeller uses a participatory\
    \ modelling approach to capture both \nindividual and group mental models using\
    \ a fuzzy-logic cognitive mapping (FCM). \nIt describes how a person views the\
    \ world and how those views affect their \ninteractions (Giordano et al., 2005).\
    \ The mental modeller is widely used in \nfacilitating group decisions and consensus\
    \ in risk analysis, natural resource \nmanagement, and climate change adaptation\
    \ (Biggs et al., 2011). It depends on social \nand cultural influences, to understand\
    \ the factors that influence the decision-making \nof cultural groups (Biggs et\
    \ al., 2011) such as farmers (Halbrendt et al., 2014). \nHowever, the location\
    \ of interviews used in the development of mental models can \nSupplementary information\n\
    283\n \nhave an effect on outcomes. Despite these shortcomings, perhaps one of\
    \ the most \nimportant characteristics of this approach is that it affords transparency\
    \ to \ninformation gathering and knowledge transfer between science and policy\
    \ (Kolkman \net al., 2005). This research uses representations of knowledge and\
    \ belief systems \nheld by rural farmers in Northern Ghana to forecast seasonal\
    \ and weather rainfall. \nThrough a multi-step process based on Fuzzy-logic Cognitive\
    \ Mapping (FCM), we \ncaptured the underlying mechanism for farmers to forecast\
    \ the weather (low, \nmedium and high rainfall) and the seasonal climate (above,\
    \ below and normal \nrainfall, onset and cessation), using a novel computer-based\
    \ FCM software called \nMental Modeler (Gray et al., 2013). \n \nC2. Deterministic\
    \ Binary forecast Verification \n \nMany meteorological phenomena such as rain,\
    \ floods, severe storms, frosts, and fogs \ncan be regarded as simple binary (dichotomous)\
    \ events, and forecasts or warnings \nfor these events are often issued as unqualified\
    \ statements that they will or will not \ntake place. These kinds of predictions\
    \ are sometimes referred to as yes/no forecasts, \nand represent the simplest\
    \ type of forecasting and decision-making situation (Hogan \nand Mason 2012).\
    \  For this study, we used a 2 × 2 possible outcomes (contingencies) \npresented\
    \ in table 1 to evaluate the forecast. For a sequence of binary forecasts, we\
    \ \nused this as a performance measure to determine the number of hits (a), false\
    \ alarms \n(b), misses (c) and correct rejections (d).  \nTable 1: Schematic contingency\
    \ table for deterministic forecasts of a sequence of n \nbinary events. The numbers\
    \ of observations/forecasts in each category are \nrepresented by a, b, c and\

    \ mobile app for collecting forecast \n \nCollecting farmers’ indigenous forecast\
    \ could be done via different methods; \nprimarily paper-based or mobile-based\
    \ recording. We resorted to using a mobile \nphone approach for two main reasons:\
    \ first, it helped us monitor when farmers send \ntheir forecast based on date\
    \ and time and location. Secondly, to appreciate how \nfarmers with low literacy\
    \ levels interact with ICT based tools for future information \nexchange. Several\
    \ options exist for using a mobile-based platform because a growing \nSupplementary\
    \ information\n284\nnumber of mobile data collection platforms have emerged in\
    \ the last decades. \nCyberTracker (Liebenberg et al., 1999), EpiCollect (Aanensen\
    \ et al., 2009) and Open \nData Kit (Anokwa et al., 2009) are some few examples.\
    \ These platforms generate \nlarge and detailed data sets and make it possible\
    \ for scientists to have instant access \nto all the information gathered over\
    \ a period. However, in our research, we selected \nan android mobile app called\
    \ Sapelli (Stevens et al., 2013). Sapelli is an open-source \nproject that facilitates\
    \ data collection across language or literacy barriers through \nhighly configurable\
    \ decision-tree of a pictorial icon-driven user interface. According \nto Stevens\
    \ et al. (2014) Sapelli has a powerful visualisation capability that allows \n\
    usage among users with low literacy. Users can select options by simply touching\
    \ \nthe screen of the mobile device and not have to necessarily read the text.\
    \ While all \nother platform allows offline data collection, postponing data transmission\
    \ to a later \nstage, only Sapelli does not rely on an Internet connection. This\
    \ function makes it \npossible to use in areas where network connectivity is rare,\
    \ unstable, slow or \nexpensive, and when users lack phone experience. Vitos et\
    \ al., (2013) for example, \nused Sapelli to Support non-literate people to monitor\
    \ poaching in Congo.  The \nproject was coded in XML and uploaded to Sapelli android\
    \ platform. The app \npresented a simple iterative process with an interactive\
    \ interface showing images \nagreed upon with farmers (see Figure 3 in the manuscript).\
    \ The farmer first has the \nchance to predict yes or no rain. Should he predict\
    \ a yes rain, he has the option of \nselecting if the predicted rain will be low,\
    \ medium or high rain. He further indicates \nthe particular indicator upon which\
    \ he based his prediction. Next, he indicates the \ndegree of certainty (sure,\
    \ so sure and very sure) of his predictions. He finalizes the \nprediction process\
    \ by saving the data for export else, he cancels and re-start the \nprocess. While\
    \ farmers are sometimes able to combine different ecological indicators \nfor\
    \ a particular forecast, the process was focused on the use of one indicator and\
    \ a \nshort stepwise process to avoid possible complications likely to be associated\
    \ with a \nlaborious process. Moreover, farmers have low literacy in smartphone\
    \ usage and \ntherefore called for simple, easy and effortless processes that\
    \ require less \nengagement and technical competencies. \nSupplementary information\n\

    Summary\nSummary\n303\nSummary \nLocal communities are adaptive and have in the\
    \ past managed different risk \n(such as droughts and floods, disease and pest\
    \ outbreaks, and famines). Yet, \nin recent times, many of these communities are\
    \ overwhelmed by the impact \nof climate variability and change on their farming\
    \ activities. Ghanaian \nfarmers particularly those in the North are faced with\
    \ many decision making \ndilemmas due to water and climate variability. They struggle\
    \ about decisions \nsuch as which seed variety to plant, when to plant, when to\
    \ fertilize, when to \ndo supplementary irrigation and sometimes when to harvest.\
    \ In discussing \npossible spheres of enhancing farmers’ adaptive capacity to\
    \ deal with these \nchallenges, mainstreaming climate services into agriculture\
    \ is tipped to have \ngreat potential.  However, climate information service in\
    \ Ghana has had no \nintrinsic value for farmers as it is unable to influence\
    \ their farming decisions. \nThereby making farmers rely on their own indigenous\
    \ forecast for daily and \nseasonal farm decision making.  \nThis thesis, therefore,\
    \ explored ways to make climate services useful for \nfarmers in the Northern\
    \ region of Ghana. It aimed at improving the reliability \nand acceptability of\
    \ forecast information by integrating indigenous and \nscientific forecast. I\
    \ formulated five iterative research questions with each \nquestion informing\
    \ the other and in whole address the objective. They are: \npromoteeffective climate\
    \ services? (Chapter 4)\nWhat are the skills in indigenous and scientific forecast\
    \ to \n3.\ninformation needs? (Chapter 3)\nHow successful can seasonal climate\
    \ forecast meet farmers’\n2.\nfarming systems? (Chapter 2)\nWhat is the potential\
    \ of climate information services to support rice\n1.\nreliability and acceptability\
    \ of climate services? (Chapter 5)\nHow can the integration of indigenous and\
    \ scientific forecastimprove\n4.\n5.\nfarmers’decisionmaking? (Chapter 6)\nHow\
    \ do weather and climate information influence \nresearch question.\nresearch\
    \ questions, each chapter is independently written to address one\nmajor findings.\
    \ The remaining chapters (Chapter 2 to 6) addresses the five\nmeant to provide\
    \ a general background to the study and a synthesis of the\nPhD dissertation consists\
    \ of seven chapters. Chapters 1 and 7 are respectively\ncollection and analysis\
    \ to gain understanding into the research objective. This\nand different qualitative\
    \ and quantitative methods were used for data\nI adopted a multi-method approach\
    \ where a number of concepts are combined\nSummary\n304\n \n \nIn Chapter 2, I\
    \ carried out a diagnostic of the existing socio-ecological issues \nincluding\
    \ the limitations and strengths of agriculture information systems in \nrice production\
    \ systems in Northern Ghana. I did this by first conducting \nliterature and documents\
    \ review, followed by interviews and focus group \ndiscussions with different\
    \ relevant stakeholders. The central part of this \nchapter is the proposed framework\
    \ for second generation climate services that \nwhen adopted and implemented could\
    \ improve the uptake of forecast \ninformation services. The framework was evaluated\
    \ with the four dimensions \nof responsible innovation (anticipatory, inclusive,\
    \ reflexive and responsive) \nand found to be robust for effective climate services\
    \ in the area. The \nframework is developed to ensure the provision of relevant\
    \ and accurate \nforecast information via a user friendly platform in a way that\
    \ manages user \nexpectation and strengthens collaboration between information\
    \ providers and \nusers. The diagnostics also revealed some essential issues that\
    \ affect the \nuptake of climate information services in the region. These issues\
    \ form the \nbasis for the subsequent chapters. They include (1) the mismatch\
    \ between \nforecast information and farmers need (2) poor quality of forecast\
    \ information \n(3) the disconnect between forecast information providers and\
    \ farmers (4) \nmanagement of unrealistic expectations of farmers.  \n \nBuilding\
    \ on the challenge of mismatch between forecast information and \nfarmers need,\
    \ Chapter 3 was aimed at ensuring that forecast information \nmeets the desired\
    \ needs of farmers. Using interviews and workshops, farmers’ \nhydroclimatic information\
    \ needs were identified and evaluated according to \nfarming types; rainfed, irrigated\
    \ and both rainfed and irrigated. Findings show \nthat farmers need rainfall distribution,\
    \ temperature variations, dam water \nlevel, total rainfall amount, onset and\
    \ cessation, wind speed and direction. \nHowever, some information needs are ranked\
    \ higher than others depending \non the frequency of use and farming type. Also,\
    \ information needs are linked \nto the type and timing of farm decision making\
    \ and that farmers would work \nwith up to lead time 2 seasonal forecast information\
    \ although prefer lead time \n1 the most. Thus, I evaluated the performance of\
    \ the state of the art ECMWF \nSystem 4 seasonal climate forecast system up to\
    \ lead time 2 and discussed the \npotential of meeting these the identified needs.\
    \ The skill analysis shows the \npossibility of meeting farmers’ need at their\
    \ most preferred lead time of 1 \nmonth allowing time for proper planning and\
    \ decision-making. Therefore, \nmodel based seasonal forecasts have the potential\
    \ to provide relevant \ninformation required for farmers’ farm-level decision\
    \ making if information \nproviders ensure that information meets the expected\
    \ needs. However, \nSummary\n305\ninaccurate forecast information will negatively\
    \ affect the reliability even if \nrelevant information is provided. \nChapter\
    \ 4 and 5 focused on the second and third issue identified during the \ndiagnostics;\
    \ improving the quality of forecast information and connecting \nforecast providers\
    \ and farmers to co-produce. The two chapters focussed on \nthe reliability and\
    \ acceptability of scientific forecast information using \nfarmers’ indigenous\
    \ forecast and in the process improve co-production of \nclimate services.  The\
    \ call to integrate indigenous and scientific forecast is \nnot new, yet attempt\
    \ to achieve this is at its infancy stage.  A glance through \nthe literature\
    \ on the subject reveals that very few studies have explored the \nunderlying\
    \ mechanism (techniques) for generating indigenous forecast and \nnone has particularly\
    \ tested quantitatively the skills in indigenous forecast as \nwell as develop\
    \ an objective method to integrate it with scientific forecast. \nTherefore, in\
    \ chapter 4 I first explored the techniques for generating \nindigenous forecast\
    \ (both weather and seasonal forecast) using a mental \nmodeling approach and\
    \ assessed the skills in these forecast comparing it to \nGMet forecast. This\
    \ form the basis for the integration of indigenous and \nscientific forecast in\
    \ addition to testing the reliability and acceptability of \nintegrated forecast\
    \ among farmers in chapter 5. \nIn chapter 4, I first used a fuzzy expert system\
    \ called mental model to \ninvestigate the underlying process behind farmers indigenous\
    \ forecasting \ntechniques. Results show that farmers use observational changes\
    \ in \nindigenous ecological indicators (IEIs) in addition to historical rainfall\
    \ \npatterns to predict the coming season. In particular, there is a relationship\
    \ \nbetween these observational changes and event predicted (rainfall onset, \n\
    cessation and amount [below, normal and above] for seasonal forecast or low, \n\
    medium and high rainfall for weather forecast). The technique to make these \n\
    predictions are not intuitive but rational and improves with age and \nexperience.\
    \ Secondly, I employed the concept of citizen science that allowed \nthe collection\
    \ and exchange of data and knowledge between scientists and \nfarmers, enhancing\
    \ the co-production process that is currently absent in \nclimate services in\
    \ the area. Further, I quantitatively evaluated farmers \nforecast using the World\
    \ Meteorological organization’s acceptable binary \nforecast verification measure\
    \ vis-à-vis GMet’s forecast. Results show that on \naverage, both farmers and\
    \ GMet are able to accurately forecast one out of \nevery three daily rainfall\
    \ events. At the seasonal scale, one out of every three \nfarmers was able to\
    \ accurately make onset prediction while two out of every \nfive farmers are able\
    \ to get rainfall amount and cessation right. Similarly, \nGMet was able to predict\
    \ rainfall amount accurately in one out of every three \nSummary\n306\ncommunities\
    \ and one out of every four communities for onset but was unable \nto accurately\
    \ predict cessation for the communities. This result, therefore, \ninforms the\
    \ integration of farmers’ indigenous forecast and scientific forecast \n(from\
    \ GMet) in chapter 4. \nChapter 5 showed that it is possible to integrate indigenous\
    \ and scientific \nforecast into a more reliable forecast that is acceptable by\
    \ farmers in Northern \nGhana.  First, following a review of existing literature\
    \ to determine the \nstrength and weakness of existing integration methods, I\
    \ developed an \nintegrated probability forecast (IPF) method that is able to\
    \ integrate both \nindigenous and scientific forecasts into an objective and reliable\
    \ forecast \ninformation compared to each in isolation. Specifically, The IPF\
    \ method \ncombines the strengths of IF and SF and subsequently improves their\
    \ \nreliability at both daily and seasonal timescale. Secondly, result of an \n\
    interview with farmers shows that the IPF method had far greater \nacceptability\
    \ potential among farmers (93% of farmers accept) because it \ncombines IF and\
    \ SF into a single forecast, resolves the issues of contradicting \nforecast information,\
    \ requires less meeting time and improves forecast \nreliability. \nIn chapter\
    \ 6, I used a Visually Facilitated Scenario Workshops (VFSW) to \ninvestigate\
    \ the impact of forecast probability and lead times on farmers’ \ndecision making.\
    \  Results show that based on their varying degree of risk \ndifferent types of\
    \ farmers (irrigated, rainfed and both) respond to forecast \nprobabilities in\
    \ different ways. Rainfed rice farmers have high risk level and \na forecast probability\
    \ of less than 0.5 will make them hesitate in taking \ndecisions. Weather forecast\
    \ provided at 1 week and seasonal climate forecast \nprovided at 1 month lead\
    \ times have the most influence on rice farmers’ \ndecision making. Also, fertilizer\
    \ application and planting are highly sensitive \nto forecast lead times because\
    \ of their reliance on water. Finally, for climate \nservices to be useful, forecast\
    \ information needs to be timely provided and \nprobabilities properly communicated\
    \ to the different groups of farmers, \nbearing in mind the varying differences\
    \ in the sensitivity of each group. \nChapter 7 conclude the dissertation by synthesising\
    \ the salient findings and \nproviding some recommendations. This dissertation\
    \ has pushed the agenda to \nmove to a second-generation climate service to support\
    \ farmers. The \nanticipatory, inclusiveness, reflexivity and responsiveness nature\
    \ of the \nproposed framework in Chapter 2 shows the efficiency and robustness\
    \ for \nmaking climate information services useful for farmers. The framework\
    \ \nchampions co-production of climate service where farmers are actively \nSummary\n\
    307\n \nengaged in the design, creation and production process. The framework\
    \ did \nso by introducing citizen science as a principle that enables the co-production\
    \ \nof climate services. This dissertation also provides a novel insight into\
    \ how \nto collect, handle, quantitatively evaluate and integrate indigenous and\
    \ \nscientific forecast in an objective manner such that the reliability and \n\
    acceptability of forecast information are achieved for farmers’ benefit. The \n\
    development of the Integrated Forecast Probability (IPF) method provides an \n\
    answer to the long awaiting question of whether it is possible to integrate \n\
    indigenous and scientific forecast? My dissertation has not only shown that it\
    \ \nis possible but then it also improves the reliability and acceptability of\
    \ \nforecast information among farmers. Lastly, findings from this study \ncontribute\
    \ to improving the uptake of climate information services for \nagriculture decision-making.\
    \ Results demonstrated that a two-directional \nmodel of climate services where\
    \ farmers are actively involved in all stages of \nthe process has the potential\
    \ for forecast information uptake. Showing the \npotential of providing seasonal\
    \ forecast at farmers prefered lead time of 1 \nmonth and beyond which was previously\
    \ problematic for even the best \nmodels is useful to support farmers’ decision\
    \ in a more flexible manner. Also, \nI have demonstrated that forecast information\
    \ with the best possible accuracy \nwill still remain invaluable to farmers if\
    \ does not meet their farming needs. \nTherefore, using an interdisciplinary approach\
    \ to connect forecast products \nwith information needs will contribute to the\
    \ successful uptake of forecast \ninformation by farmers. Furthermore, the utilization\
    \ of farmers in this study \nprovides fresh insights into the interpretation of\
    \ local data and methods which \notherwise may not be possible to generate in\
    \ the scientific community even \nwith their best models. For instance, I observed\
    \ that indigenous forecast is \nfiner in resolution and more valuable at the community\
    \ level than GMet \nforecast which is coarse and issued at a regional level. Rather\
    \ than using \nscientific downscaling techniques (often limited by model inadequacies\
    \ and \nunavailability of observed data) to transform forecast information from\
    \ a \ncoarser to finer resolutions, local knowledge could be helpful. In addition,\
    \ \ncommunicating forecast information at the appropriate lead time and with the\
    \ \nprobability of occurrence have a positive influence on farmers to take better\
    \ \ndecision, proper planning and reducing unrealistic expectations of forecast\
    \ \naccuracy and reliability of climate service in general.   \n \nThe most important\
    \ recommendation of this thesis, therefore, is to test and \nincorporate the proposed\
    \ second generation climate services into National \nAgricultural policy. Doing\
    \ this will not only offer the opportunity to manage \nclimate risk and uncertainty\
    \ in practice but also create a new perspective that \nwill advance our scientific\
    \ understanding of climate information services.\nAbout the author\nAbout the\

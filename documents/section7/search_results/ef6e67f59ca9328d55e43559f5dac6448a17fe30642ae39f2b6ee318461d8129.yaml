    15 March 2024 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in Brazil
    began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of savanna
    with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques for
    improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    an Arduino microcontroller to a Node MCU to the cloud Arduino microcontrollers

    communicating with linked sensors, reading output values, and processing sensor
    data as requested. Arduino microcontrollers gather soil health data from sensors
    as the main data-collecting unit communicating with linked sensors, reading output
    values, and processing sensor data24. The Node MCU stores data in the cloud and
    uses AWS IoT Core for visualization, and these services are accessed through the
    Node MCU as indicated in Fig. 4. Figure 4 The connection between Arduino board

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t
    is the hidden state of the GRU at time step t, h_{t − 1} is the hidden state of
    the GRU at time step t − 1, h_t̃ is the candidate hidden state at time step t,
    gate_update is the update gate, gate_reset is the reset gate. $${h}_{t}=gat{e}_{update}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+gat{e}_{reset}*{h}_{\\widetilde{t}}$$
    (10) The update gate controls which information is allowed to flow into the hidden
    state from the previous time step where W_h is the weight matrix for the hidden-to-hidden
    state connection, U_x is the weight matrix for the input-to-hidden state connection,
    b_h is the bias vector for the hidden state, x_t is the input at time step t.
    $${h}_{\\widetilde{t}}=tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{h}\\right)$$
    (11) Loops from 0 to len(data)—sequence length + 1. This loop generates dataset
    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information
    flow into the hidden state. Apply the forget gate on the previous hidden state
    to determine how much to remember. Update the cell state depending on the input
    gate, forget gate and previous hidden state cell state that stores sequence long-term
    memory. $${C}_{t}={f}_{t}*{C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{i}_{t}*tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{c}\\right)$$
    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate
    \\({i}_{t}\\) is the input gate, tanh is the hyperbolic tangent activation function,
    \\({W}_{h}\\) and \\({U}_{x}\\) are the hidden-to-hidden and input-to-hidden weight
    matrices, respectively. At time step t, \\({b}_{c}\\) is the bias vector for the
    cell state, \\({x}_{t}\\) is the input, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    is the hidden state. Use the output gate to create the current time step output
    that passes cell state information. Gated recurrent units (GRUs) architecture
    trains the dataset properly depending on soil prediction features. At each time
    step, calculate the error between expected and actual output. Back propagates
    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.
    Historical sensor data, growth trends, and FFNN soil health results train the
    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation
    generation Parameters within historical data to represent various ‘what-if’ situations.
    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

  description: Saudi Arabia's agriculture heavily depends on effective water management,
    given its limited freshwater resources and arid climate. Real-time monitoring
    of soil moisture levels, weather conditions, and crop watering needs, facilitated
    by IoT integration, plays a crucial role in conserving water and minimizing waste.
    The resultant improvements in crop yields and quality are essential for the long-term
    success of agriculture in the country. This study employs the Technique for Order
    of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to investigate
    the transformative potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) in enhancing water
    management practices in Saudi Arabia's agriculture sector. The research begins
    by highlighting the significance of water management in agriculture, emphasizing
    the proportion of land in Saudi Arabia allocated to agricultural purposes. The
    problem statement underscores the pressing challenges in water management, encompassing

    Saudi Arabia''s agriculture heavily depends on effective water management, given
    its limited freshwater resources and arid climate. Real-time monitoring of soil
    moisture levels, weather conditions, and crop watering needs, facilitated by IoT
    integration, plays a crucial role in conserving water and minimizing waste. The
    resultant improvements in crop yields and quality are essential for the long-term
    success of agriculture in the country. This study employs the Technique for Order
    of Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method to investigate
    the transformative potential of the Internet of Things (IoT) in enhancing water
    management practices in Saudi Arabia''s agriculture sector. The research begins
    by highlighting the significance of water management in agriculture, emphasizing
    the proportion of land in Saudi Arabia allocated to agricultural purposes. The
    problem statement underscores the pressing challenges in water management, encompassing
    issues such as water scarcity, inefficient irrigation methods, and the need for
    real-time data to inform decision-making. To address these challenges, the study

    Get rights and content Abstract Precision agriculture (PA) has recently employed
    as an innovative agriculture to increase the profitability through enhancing the
    crop yields. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) is widely used in PA to measure the
    agricultural parameters. However, the main challenges of using WSNs in PA are
    to improve the measurement accuracy and to increase the network lifetime of WSNs.
    A novel scheme is developed in this paper to measure soil moisture and temperature
    in heterogeneous farms called Adaptive heterogeneous precision agriculture (AHPA).
    As well as the Extended kalman filter (EKF), AHPA contains two invented algorithms,
    named Optimally sensor selection algorithm (OSSA) and Adaptive sampling interval
    algorithm (ASIA). As part of the EKF, agricultural state is proactively predicted
    and then it is updated through measuring it using WSN so that the noises associated
    with sensor measurements are eliminated. OSSA employs the Genetic algorithm (GA)
    for selecting a group of sensor nodes that are used to sense the agricultural
    state, in order to enhance network lifetime and crop yields. The root system is
    modeled and used in the OSSA to select the nodes inside the area covered by the
    root system. In the prediction stage, the ASIA is used to calculate an adaptive
    sampling interval based on the predicted state of agricultural parameters. The
    simulation results show that the total energy consumption and the reduction of
    the agricultural parameters are improved in the proposed ASIA, compared with other
    fixed sampling interval schemes. Moreover, the number of dead nodes, the time
    of the first node death, the energy balance, the neighbors count, and the number
    of evolved nodes in sensing activities are enhanced in the proposed OSSA, compared
    with other schemes. Hence, the network lifetime and crop yields are enhanced.
    Moreover, the proposed OSSA selects the sensor nodes based on the root age so

    1. Introduction The demands of food are constantly and exponentially increasing
    worldwide [1]. Until 2050, a study predicts a growth in global food demands of
    60 % to 110 % [2]. Furthermore, agriculture is a core source of improving the
    economy of countries [1]. At the same time, the main resources of agriculture
    such as water is decreasing [3]. Agricultural activities such as water irrigation
    requires rigorous labor and intensive time [4]. To enhance the crop yields, the
    agricultural requirements such as water and fertilizer should be provides at the
    right time, right place, and satisfactory amount [5]. Therefore, Precision agriculture
    (PA) is a smart agriculture that overcomes all these challenges and needs. PA
    uses the information and communication technology, sensor devices, and automated
    control to improve the crop productivity, profitability, labor efficiency, energy
    and environmental sustainability, and food safety [6]. Internet of Things (IoT)
    [7], machine learning techniques [8], Extended kalman filter (EKF) [9], Supervisory
    control and data acquisition (SCADA) [10] and optimization methods [11] are examples
    of information technologies needed for PA. The automated control in PA include
    the usage of sensor devices, controllers, and actuators. Sensor devices are used
    in PA to measure the agricultural parameters, including soil moisture, soil temperature,
    soil pH, and ambient humidity. The actuator in PA include water pumps, fans, and
    electronic valves. Microcontroller [12] and Programmable logic controller (PLC)
    [13] are examples of controllers used in PA. The communication technologies in
    PA include single-hop and multi-hop wireless communication to transmit the agricultural
    parameters and receive commands of the appropriate actions. One of the main and
    powerful needs for the PA is the Wireless sensor networks (WSNs). WSNs consists
    of tiny and low-cost sensor nodes with sensing, limited processing, wirelessly
    communication, and limited storage capabilities [14]. WSNs is either deployed
    in fixed or random fashion [15]. Thousands of sensor nodes can randomly be deployed
    using airplane. Sensor nodes cooperatively execute the required tasks and activities.
    Cluster-based WSNs consists of clusters which are a group of sensor nodes that
    are managed using a single cluster head [16]. The communication activities take
    place between the sensor nodes and their cluster heads. The cluster heads forward
    the data to the sink node of WSNs via multi hop communication using other cluster
    head. The sink node relays the received data to the headquarter of the system.
    There are a wide variety of applications for WSNs, including PA, healthcare, wildlife
    habitat monitoring, disaster management, surveillance, environmental monitoring,
    and decision support systems [17]. In this paper, WSN is adopted for PA to measure
    the agriculture parameters such as soil moisture and soil temperature for each
    crop. In addition, WSN transmits the control and sensed data to the main controller
    via multi-hop wireless communication. The algorithms that manage the operation
    of PA and WSN are executed in the main controller according to the received data.
    In this paper, Adaptive heterogeneous precision agriculture (AHPA) scheme is proposed.
    The main components of AHPA are WSN which is used for sensing the agricultural
    parameters and transmitting the sensed data to the main controller, EKF that is
    used to eliminate the sensed noises and predict the future agricultural parameters,
    Optimally sensor selection algorithm (OSSA) which is used to proactively select
    the group of sensor nodes, and Adaptive sampling interval algorithm (ASIA) that
    is used to compute the interval time for the next sensing activities. To enhance
    the crop yields, the PA aims to apply the agricultural inputs such as water irrigation
    at the right time and place, according to the specific needs of each crop. AHPA
    addresses these challenges and needs through sensing the soil moisture and temperature
    which are used to take the right decision of the needed agricultural inputs for
    each specific crop. EKF is adopted in AHPA to eliminate the noises from the measured
    agricultural parameters sensed by the sensor nodes. The main contributions of
    the proposed AHPA scheme are three-fold. Firstly, OSSA is invented to select a
    group of sensor nodes that will be used to sense the agricultural parameters so
    that the network lifetime and the crop yields are optimized. Secondly, ASIA is
    introduced to independently compute the adaptive sampling intervals for each agricultural
    area based on the updated state of agricultural parameters. The sampling interval
    determines the right time interval between each two consecutive sensing activities.
    Finally, mathematical models of the research problem including the performance
    metrics and optimization problem are developed in this paper. This paper is organized
    into eight sections including this introduction. Section 2 explores the related
    work int PA. After that, the framework and modeling of the proposed AHPA scheme
    is presented in Section 3. Section 4 illustrates the EKF. The AHPA formalisation
    and modeling are introduced in Section 5. The proposed algorithms of AHPA scheme
    is presented in Section 6. The evaluation and results of AHPA scheme are explained
    and discussed in Section 7. Finally, the paper is summarized in Section 8. 2.
    Related work Soil moisture, soil temperature, and ambient humidity are measured
    in [18] using WSNs. The measured data is sent to the head nodes that redirect
    it to Internet of thing (IoT) environment. In [19], soil parameters such as moisture
    and pH, temperature, light intensity, and humidity are monitored to increase the
    crop yields. IoT platform is adopted in [20] for agricultural parameter monitoring
    including soil monitor, temperature, humidity, and flow of water sprinkler. Decision
    making is taken for suitable actions such irrigation in [19], and [20]. Precision
    farming using WSNs is developed in [21] to monitoring the apple diseases and taking
    the suitable actions. In [22], IoT and WSNs are used to smartly monitor the crops
    growth. Sensor nodes are randomly deployed in [22] to sense the soil moisture,
    temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and air quality. The agricultural
    land is monitored in [23] using WSNs so that the power consumption for the communication
    activities is reduced. pH, humidity, temperature and moisture sensors are used
    in [23]. Depending of the reading values, the suitable actions such as opening
    of water pump and turning on the fans are triggered to improve the crop yield.
    In [24], Nutrients in the soil including Nitrogen, Phosphorus, and Potassium (NPK)
    are measured using WSNs to obtain healthier crops. Precision irrigation based
    on fuzzy logic using WSNs is proposed in [25]. The crop water stress index and
    the soil moisture content are the inputs of the fuzzy logic controller. The output
    of the fuzzy logic is the water irrigation scheduling which is the pump control
    signal. Cluster-based WSNs is adopted in [26] for PA. Selection algorithm is perform
    in [26] to select the cluster head for each cluster based on the remaining energy
    and location of sensor nodes so that the network lifetime and energy efficiency
    are improved. In [4], the triggering time and period of irrigation process are
    computed based on the measuring data including soil moisture, temperature, the
    level of water tank, humidity, and the forecasting of rain level. IoT web interface
    is developed in [4] to enable farmers monitor the agricultural land. In [27],
    the agricultural field is monitored using IoT sensor nodes. The growth and health
    of crops are monitored through sensing the soil pH, soil temperature, and soil
    moisture. The dates of fertilization and irrigation are optimally computed in
    [3]. In [11], Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to get the rate of fertilization
    for different part in the agricultural land to get the best even distribution
    of nitrogen rates. GA is used in [28] to predict the rain fall so that a decision-making
    system is implemented to decide if the manual water is required or not. In addition,
    soil moisture senses the level of soil moisture. Water irrigation is performed
    using Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) when the soil moisture level exceeds a predefined
    threshold value. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) which is considered
    as Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) is adopted in [48] to get the
    best solutions representing the conflicted objectives so that the crop yield is
    maximized and the total amount of fertilization and irrigation are minimized.
    However, EKF are not used in all above researches to eliminate the noises from
    the measured data by the sensor nodes. Therefore, there is no prediction and update
    stage for the measurement activities. In addition, the sensor node selection is
    not performed to selected the best sensor nodes to measure the agricultural parameters
    in all above researches In [29], sensor nodes are installed in greenhouses to
    measure the agricultural parameters such as soil moisture, temperature, and acidity.
    IoT-based system architecture is used in [29] to get the sensing data. The readings
    strength of the sensor nodes is improved by using Kalman filter through reducing
    the noise associated with the sensor readings. Kalman filter is considered in
    [30] to increase the overall sensing accuracy of the agricultural land. However,
    all above researches adopted fixed sampling interval approach. In [9], Smart heterogeneous
    precision agriculture (SHPA) using WSNs is introduced to measure the soil moisture
    and temperature for agricultural farm. EKF is used in [9] to predict the measurements
    and illuminate the noise from the sensing data. Sensor selection algorithm is
    performed in SHPA to select the sensor nodes to measure the agricultural data.
    However, the selection algorithm in [9] is a greedy algorithm that selects one
    node for each iteration. Thus, the fitness evaluation of the whole selected sensor
    group is not performed. In addition, the sampling interval is fixed in [9]. Variable
    sampling interval is used in [31] to proactively select the adoptive sampling
    interval for each crop separately. However, the sampling interval is calculated
    in [31] based on the soil temperature without considering the soil moisture. Table
    1 succinctly summarize the key findings of the related works mentioned above.

    into PA, this research presents Adaptive heterogeneous precision agriculture (AHPA)
    scheme. AHPA adopts the concepts of spreading and dispersing of the selected sensor
    nodes that are used to sense the agricultural parameters so that the network lifetime
    and crop yields are improved. Moreover, the model of the root system is used in
    the proposed selection algorithm to cope with the root development of plants.
    Furthermore, adaptive sampling interval is proactively computed according to the
    updated value of soil moisture and temperature. 3. AHPA framework and modelling
    In this section, the framework and modeling of the proposed Adaptive heterogeneous
    precision agriculture (AHPA) scheme is presented. In this research, the symbols
    of sets, matrices, parameter variables, and normalized parameter variables are
    denoted by capital and bold letters, capital, bold, and italic letter, small and
    italic letter, and small, and italic letters with hat at the top of the letter,
    respectively. For instance, , , , and are examples of a set, a matrix, and a parametrize
    variable, and a normalized parameter variable, respectively. The transpose of
    matrix is denoted as . In this paper, heterogenous plants and crops are considered
    for the proposed approach so that different types of plants can be plant in the
    same farm as shown in Fig. 1. Therefore, the farm set consists of areas , where
    . Therefore, the farm set is formed as follows: (1) Download : Download high-res
    image (333KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 1. AHPA Framework. As shown
    in Fig. 1, Wireless sensor networks (WSN) is randomly deployed [15] in the target
    farm to sense the soil moisture and soil temperature. Cluster-based WSNs [16]
    is adopted in the AHPA scheme. At time step , WSN consists of sensor nodes. The
    sensor node is denoted as , where is the identification of sensor node, is the
    number of the sensor nodes, and is the identification of the area containing the
    sensor node. Therefore, the set of the WSN at time step is formed as: (2) At time
    step , each area contains a set of sensor nodes. The sets of sensors nodes at
    all areas are not intersect such as: (3) Therefore, the set of the WSN and the
    number of the sensor nodes at time step are calculated as follows: (4) (5) One
    Cluster head (CH) is used for each area. The locations of CHs are at the center
    of the areas. Therefore, cluster-based WSN [16] is adopted for WSN topology. In
    each area, the sensor nodes send all control and information data to the CH of
    the area. The CH forwards the data to the Sink node (SN)/Base station (BS) via
    multi-hop communication using the other CHs. Finally, the data are forwarded to
    the main controller and users via Internet, satellite or cellular communication.
    The proposed algorithms of AHPA scheme are executed in the main controller. Each
    sensor node has two sensors to sense the soil moisture and soil temperature. Therefore,
    the soil moisture and temperature are measured by WSN at different time step .
    The sampling interval at time step of area is the time interval between the current
    time at time step and previous time at time step such as: (6) In this paper, the
    sampling interval for each area is dynamically changed according to the current
    measurements of the area. Therefore, Adaptive sampling interval algorithm (ASIA)
    is proposed to determine the value of the current sampling interval . Consequently,
    according to the Eq. (6), the next time for the new measurements of the soil moisture
    and soil temperature is computed as follows: (7) The second core algorithm in
    AHPA scheme is the Optimally sensors selection algorithm (OSSA). The main aim
    of OSSA is used to proactively select the group of sensor nodes at time step for
    each area according to the plant age and energy remaining of sensor nodes so that
    the network lifetime and crop yields are enhanced. The sensor nodes are numbering
    in their group as where is bounded in the interval . In Fig. 1, the farm consists
    of nine areas planted with different plants and crops. Different number of sensor
    nodes with different distances and angles to the area center are selected for
    each area to sense the soil moisture and soil temperature, based on the plant
    type and age. For instance, two, three, and four sensor nodes are selected for
    area , , and , respectively. Each area and sensor node are characterized with
    several attributes and variables as shown in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively.

    temperature are measured by the AHPA scheme. At each time , the soil moisture
    and temperature of each area, , are sensed. Hence, the state vector at time of
    area contains the soil moisture and temperature as:. (8) The dynamic model of
    the area [32,33,34] is defined as: (9) is the evolution function or system transition
    function which is time-varying function that relates the current state with the
    previous state and is the process noise which models the error associated with
    the system state. is assumed to be a zero-mean white gaussian distribution process
    with covariance matrix so that . 4.2. Measurement model The noise associated with
    measurements at time is modelled [32,33,34] as follows: (10) is the sampling interval,
    , and is the measurement function is the measurement noise. The sampling interval
    is defined as the time between two consecutive measurements. The distribution
    of is independent, and assumed to have a zero-mean white gaussian distribution
    with covariance matrix such that . 4.3. EKF method The Extended kalman filter
    (EKF) consists of two stage named prediction and update stages. The EKF [32,33,34]
    is adopted to calculate the predicted and update states and their covariance matrices.
    The predicted state is predicted for the next time step without knowing the measurements.
    When the measurements are available for the next stage, the update stage is performed
    to update the measurements. 4.3.1. Prediction stage In the prediction stage, the
    predicted state vector and its associated predicted covariance matrix are calculated
    at time . The predicted state vector is computed as follows: (11) The associated
    predicted covariance matrix of the predicted state is given by: (12) is the Jacobian
    matrix of at as follows: (13) 4.3.2. Update stage In the update stage is performed
    at time when the measurements are available. The update state vector and its associated
    updated covariance matrix are computed in this stage. The measurement residual
    is defined as the difference between the actual and predicted measurements and
    is computed as follows: (14) The associated residual or innovation covariance
    matrix of is given by: (15) (16) is the Jacobian matrix of at as follows: (17)
    The update state estimate is given by: (18) The associated updated covariance
    matrix of is calculated as: (19) The filter gain is given by: (20) 5. The AHPA
    formalisation and modelling The essential objective of the proposed AHPA approach
    is to prolong the network lifetime and the crop yields. Therefore, two main algorithms
    are invented to achieve this objective. At each time step , the Optimally sensors
    selection algorithm (OSSA) is performed to proactively select a group of sensor
    nodes to sense the soil moisture and temperature based on the plant age, the variance
    of angle spreading from the area center, and the variance of distance dispersing
    away from the area center. The group of the selected sensor nodes should satisfy
    the following equalities: (21) (22) At each time step , the Adaptive sampling
    interval algorithm (ASIA) is executed to dynamically compute the sampling interval
    according to the current measurement of soil moisture and temperature. In the
    following subsection, the performance metrics of the proposed OSSA and ASIA algorithms
    are defined and mathematically modelled. 5.1. Sensors group spreading To increase
    the crop yields, solid moisture and temperature should evenly sense in the whole
    area where plants are implanted. The selecting of sensor nodes group that are
    concentrated in particular places inside the agricultural area degrades the network
    lifetime because the death of selected nodes cause network gaps in these particular
    places [35,36]. Therefore, the network lifetime is prolonged when a group of sensor
    nodes are selected in spread places inside the agricultural area. This is because
    the possible deaths of sensor nodes are also spread and hence, the gap of the
    empty sensor nodes are reduced. The optimal angle at area between sensor node
    to the next sensor that maximizes the spreading of sensor nodes group is calculated
    as follows: (23) The normalized optimal angle at area between sensor node to the
    next sensor is computed by dividing the optimal angle to the maximums angle (
    ) according to the following equation: (24) (25) Consequently, the squared error
    from the normalized optimal angle of the normalized angle separated between sensor
    nodes pair ( , in the selected group at time step is defined as follows: (26)
    Before computing the errors in Eq. (26), the sensor nodes in the group should
    be firstly sorted in ascending order with respect to the angle between the sensor
    node and the positive direction so that: (27) is any point in the positive direction.
    is the angles between the selected pair of sensor nodes ( , and the at the area
    center, which is calculated based on the triangle low as follows: (28) (29) According
    to Eq. (28), the three points ( , , and ) of the angle are colinear occurs when
    the slopes of , , and are equal. In this case, the value of angle is 180°. The
    distance between any two-point vectors and is computed as follows: (30) The normalized
    angle between the selected pair of sensor nodes ( , and the at the area center
    is computed by dividing the angle to the maximums angle ( ) according to the following
    equation: (31) (32) The mean of all possible squared errors of the normalized
    angle separated between all sensor nodes pairs is calculated as follows: (33)
    (34) Therefore, the sensor group spreading error of area at time step is defined
    as the Root mean square error (RMSE) of the angle errors between sensor nodes
    pairs in the selected group, which is calculated as: (35) (36) In Fig. 2, of sensor
    nodes group are selected at time step to meaure the agricultural parameters for
    time step . Therefore, three possible angles can be calculated between the lines
    connected the selected sensor nodes and the located at the area center. These
    angles are , , and . The RMSE from the optimal angle of these three angles is
    the sensor group spreading . Download : Download high-res image (184KB) Download

    group dispersing The crop yields and the network lifetime are not only enhanced
    by selecting a group of sensor nodes in spread places inside the area with respect
    to the angle separations among sensor nodes, but also by selecting a group of
    sensor nodes with dispersing radius length from the area center where the plant
    is planted. In this paper, the radius variation between each sensor node to the
    next sensor node is linked with the root length of the plant. Therefore, the modeling
    of the plant root system is a key requirement in this research. In agriculture,
    root system for the plants delivers the carbon, energy, water, nutrient, and solutes
    for the plant [37]. Several researches focus on mathematical modeling for the
    growth of the plant root system architecture [38,39]. Root system architecture
    is used to visualize and analyze the branched structure of root system. Therefore,
    the soil volume of the plant can be determined and predicted [39]. Root system
    models are mainly function of space and time [38]. C-Root is one example of a
    continuous and general model of root system growth that emphases on the root growth
    in the soil with time and place. C-Root complies with wide range of plants roots
    type including tap and fibrous root system [40]. The length of the root is modeled
    using linear or exponential growth [37]. In this paper, linear growth of root
    system of area at time step is adopted according to the following relation [37]:
    (37) , , and are the minimum root length, maximum root length and the root growth
    rate of area , respectively. Therefore, with increasing the age of plant, the
    root is more circulated in the soil. The optimal radius variation of area between
    the radius of each sensor node to the radius of the next sensor maximizes the
    dispersing of sensor nodes group. The optimal radius variation of area at time
    step is calculated as follows: (38) The normalized optimal radius variation of
    area is computed by dividing the optimal radius variation to the maximum radius
    variation ( ) according to the following equation: (39) (40) Therefore, the normalized
    optimal radius of sensor node is computed according to the following equation:
    (41) is the number of sensor node in the group . Consequently, the squared error
    from the optimal radius of the normalized radius of the sensor node in the selected
    group at time step is defined as follows: (42) is the normalized radius of sensor
    node from the area center . Before computing the errors in Eq. (42), the sensor
    nodes in the group should be firstly sorted in ascending order with respect to
    the radius of sensor node from the area center so that: (43) The normalized radius
    of sensor node from the area center is computed by dividing the radius to the
    maximum radius according to the following equation: (44) (45) The mean of all
    squared errors of the normalized radiuses for all sensor nodes in the selected
    group is calculated as follows: (46) Therefore, the sensor group dispersing error
    of area at time step is defined as the Root mean square error (RMSE) of the radius
    errors of the sensor nodes in the selected group, which is calculated as: (47)
    (48) In Fig. 3, of sensor nodes group are selected at time step to meaure the
    agricultural parameters for time step . For , the three optimal radiuses for each
    sensor node are , , and . Download : Download high-res image (177KB) Download

    neighbors count percentage To improve the network lifetime, the group of sensor
    nodes is selected so that the neighbors count of the selected nodes are high,
    compared with other neighbors count of sensor nodes inside the area. Accordingly,
    when the energy remaining of selected sensor nodes is ended, other neighbors of
    selected sensor nodes will cover the network and avoid the holes in the network.
    For a communication radio range of , the number of neighbors of sensor node at
    time step are calculated as follows: (49) The Group neighbors count percentage
    is defined the ratio between the summation of neighbors count of the selected
    sensor group to the summation of neighbors counts of all sensor nodes inside the
    area at time step . (50) (51) 5.4. Group energy remaining percentage The energy
    is consumed from of sensor nodes due to the sensing, communication and processing
    activities [41]. Therefore, the selection of sensor nodes group with high energy
    remaining advances the network lifetime because sensor nodes with higher energy
    remaining can remain alive for longer period, compared with lower energy remaining
    nodes. The Group energy remaining percentage is defined the ratio between the
    summation of energy remaining of the selected sensors group to the summation of
    energy remaining of all sensor nodes inside the area at time step . (52) (53)
    is the energy remaining of sensor node at time step . 5.5. Energy consumption
    model The transmitting energy consumption and receiving energy consumption required
    to transmit -bits from sensor node and other sensor node with a separate distance
    of are calculated as follows [42,43]: (54) (55) depends of the transmitter processing
    such as coding, modulation and filtering, and is related to the amplifier energy.
    6. The proposed algorithms of AHPA scheme In this section, the proposed algorithms
    of AHPA scheme are presented. The measurement method of the agricultural parameters
    including the soil moisture and temperature are firstly introduced. After that,
    the detailed description of Optimally sensors selection algorithm (OSSA) is explained.
    OSSA aim to get the optimal group of sensor nodes that are employed to sense the
    agricultural parameters to improve the performance metrics which are sensors group
    spreading, sensor group dispersing, group neighbors count Percentage, and group
    energy remaining percentage. OSSA adopts the Genetic algorithm (GA) as an evolutionary
    optimization algorithm to optimize these performance metrics. Finally, Adaptive
    sampling interval algorithm (ASIA) of scheme is presented to dynamically compute
    the sampling interval according to the current values of the agricultural parameters
    so that the crop yields are improved. 6.1. Agricultural parameters measurements
    In this research, EKF mentioned in Section 4 is adopted to measure the soil moisture
    and temperature. As introduced in [9], the EKF algorithm starts from the initialization
    stage in which the initial updated state and its covariance matrix is initialized.
    After that, the prediction stage is performed to firstly predict the sampling
    interval of the next update stage using the current updated state . Adaptive sampling
    interval algorithm (ASIA) is invented in this research to proactively compute
    the sampling interval. Section 6.3 describes the ASIA in details. Secondly, the
    predicted state and its covariance matrix of the next measurement time are achieved
    using EKF. Finally, a group of sensor nodes are proactively selected to sense
    the soil moisture and temperature in the next update stage. Optimally sensors
    selection algorithm (OSSA) is invented in this paper to select the group of sensor
    nodes so that the performance metrics which are presented in Section 5 are improved.
    Section 6.2 describes the OSSA in details. Then, the update stage is performed
    again after the sampling interval is passed. The prediction and update stages
    continue to be performed until a termination condition is satisfied. 6.2. Optimally
    sensors selection algorithm The Optimally sensors selection algorithm (OSSA) is
    proposed in this paper to get the optimal group of sensor nodes that are used
    to sense the soil moisture and temperature so that the performance metrics described
    in Section 5 are enhanced. The proposed four performance metrics presented in
    Section 5 is combined into two performance metrics which are the Network lifetime
    (NL) and the Root system (RS) metrics. The sensor group spreading and dispersing
    errors are combined and averaged into the RS metric as follows: (56) The proposed
    optimization problem is a minimization optimization problem. Since it is required
    to maximize the group neighbors count and the group energy remaining percentages,
    the inverted version of and are used which are and . Therefore, the inverted group
    neighbors count and the group energy remaining percentages are combined and averaged
    into the inverted NL metric as follows: (57) At each time step , the fitness function
    of the proposed OSSA for the area is the weighted sum of the proposed performance
    metrics as follows: (58) In Eq. (58), the spreading and dispersing (i.e., RS)
    of sensors group are combined and weighted together by . On the other hand, the
    group neighbors count and the group energy remaining percentages (i.e., NL) is
    weighted by . Therefore, the main objective of the OSSA is to search for the optimal
    group of sensor nodes to sense the agricultural soil parameters such that the
    fitness function defined in Eq. (46) is minimized as follows: (59) This is subject
    to the constraints from Eq. (60) to Eq. (64) as follows: (60) (61) is the energy
    level remaining at sensor node and is the minimum energy level that should be
    remained by the sensor node . (62) Eq. (62) indicates that each sensor node at
    the selected group is unique and does not been repeated at the same group. (63)
    (64) Eq. (63) and (64) show that the selected sensor group of the area should
    be belong to the set of the sensor nodes at the same area . To get the best group
    of sensor nodes of the area at time step that minimizes the fitness function stated
    in Eq. (58), the best sensor nodes out from sensor nodes should be determined.
    Therefore, the fitness function stated in Eq. (58) have to be computed for all
    combinations of sensor nodes out from of sensor nodes. The number of these combinations
    is calculated as: (65) In addition, the number of all commination for all areas
    are calculated as: (66) The total number of combinations defined in Eq. (65) is
    large for large values of , , and . Consequently, computing the fitness function
    defined in Eq. (58) for all combinations requires high resources in term of time,
    processing, and communication which are limited in WSN. Therefore, the Genetic
    algorithm (GA) as an optimization technique are adopted to search for the optimal
    or near-optimal sensor nodes groups. It does not require to test all combinations
    using GA. The termination condition to end the searching of GA is determined by
    the algorithm based on different performance requirements. GA is an evolutionary
    optimization algorithm. It is adopted in this research to solve the optimization
    problem described in Eq. (59). GA is a population-based optimization technique
    that processes several solutions at each iteration. Biological genetic operations
    including the crossover and mutation inspire the operation of GA. The genetic
    operations are performed among the current population to produce a new generation
    with better individual. The iterations of generation production are repeated until
    a termination condition is satisfied [44,45]. In this paper, the chromosome is
    the suggested solution which is the group of selected sensor nodes. Therefore,
    the gene of GA chromosome consists of the identification of sensor nodes . Fig.
    4, Fig. 5 show examples of GA chromosomes of area with and area with , respectively.

    current population are arranged and stored in the selected population based on
    the roulette wheel selection. The absolute value of finesses summation of all
    chromosomes in is saved in . After that, a random number is generated between
    . Then, from Line 7 to 10, the absolute value of chromosome finesses in the temporary
    population are added one by one. For every iteration, if becomes greater than
    or equal the total fitness , the summation is stopped. The chromosome at which
    the summation is stopped is added to the selected population and is erased from

    chromosomes (i.e. ones) from the current population and the best half chromosomes
    (i.e. ones) from offspring population . The new population overwrites the current
    population . In Line 24, the best chromosome with highest fitness function is
    obtained from the current population . In Line 25 and 26, the best the best chromosome
    of the current population replaces the best chromosome , if the fitness function
    of is higher than the fitness function of . 6.3. Adaptive sampling interval algorithm
    In this section, the Adaptive sampling interval algorithm (ASIA) of scheme is
    presented. The sampling interval is the time between two successive sensing activities.
    To improve the crop yields, the sensing activities should perform at the right
    time before the soil moisture is getting under its threshold level. On the other
    hand, low value of sampling interval leads to consume more energy for sensing,
    processing and communication activities. Hence, the network lifetime degrades
    with low sampling interval. Therefore, the sampling interval should be dynamically
    computed according to the current values of soil moisture and temperature. The
    sampling interval is chosen to be a high value, for high level of soil moisture
    because the soil moisture takes high time to decrease to its threshold value and
    vis versa. Similarly, when the soil temperature has a lower value, the soil moisture
    can maintain for longer time. Therefore, the sampling interval is assumed to be
    changed linearly with the ratio between the soil moisture and the soil temperature
    as shown in Fig. 8. Download : Download high-res image (111KB) Download : Download

    7. Results and discussion In this section the proposed AHPA scheme is evaluated
    and analyzed. The simulation assumption is firstly stated. After that, the measurements
    technique of AHPA is evaluated and compared with other schemes. Then, the OSSA
    and ASIA are evaluated and compared with traditional schemes. 7.1. Simulation
    assumptions In this research, event driven simulation is adopted to evaluate the
    proposed AHPA scheme. C++ programming language is used to implement the simulation
    environment. Computer with 24GB memory and core i7–7500U-2.70 GHz processor is
    employed to run the simulation. Mersenne Twister random number generator [47]
    is adopted to produce random number from different probability distribution. The
    initial updated state and its covariance matrix for all areas are set as: (71)
    (72) The maximum root length presented in Eq. (37) is set based on the maximum
    area radius which is calculated as follows: (73) For the purpose of this research,
    the system transition function of Eq. (9) and its covariance matrix are assumed
    to be [5,9]: (74) (75) Thus, the Jacobian matrix with size ( ) of the evolution
    function at is computed as follows: (76) (77) (78) (79) (80) The model of measurement
    function of Eq. (10) for sensor node is assumed to be [5,9]: (81) The measurement
    covariance matrix of the selected group of sensor nodes is a diagonal matrix with
    size of . The value of element at the diagonal of matrix is computed as follows:
    (82) For example, for , the measurement covariance matrix is computed as follows:
    (83) Consequently, the Jacobian matrix with size ( ) of at is computed as follows:
    (84) (85) (86) (87) (88) (89) Unless it is specifically stated, the simulation
    assumptions for the evolution of the proposed AHPA scheme is shown in Table 4.

    EKF The updated state at each time step is plotted in Fig. 9. The updated soil
    moisture at each time step for each area is plotted in Fig. 9(a). Since the first
    area has the smallest soil type based on moisture variation , it has lowest soil
    moisture reduction according to the dynamic model assumed in Eq. (74). Fig. 9(b)
    shows the updated soil temperature at each time step for each area. The first
    area has the highest temperature reduction because it has the highest soil type
    based on temperature variation . The variation of the reduction values for soil
    temperature and moisture among areas affects the sampling interval calculation
    for different areas. This effect is discussed in Section 7.2. Download : Download

    the errors of soil moisture and temperature with and without using EKF are computed
    according to the following relations: (93) (94) As shown in Fig. 10 and 11, the
    moisture and temperature errors with using EKF is smaller than the ones without
    using EKF because the EKF can filter the noise from the noisy measurements sensed
    by the sensor nodes. On the other hand, the random noises from the sensor nodes
    will remain associated with the measurements when the EKF is not used. Therefore,
    the proposed AHPA achieves more accurate agricultural parameters measurements,
    compared with other traditional schemes. 7.3. The performance metrics and fitness
    function of the OSSA The root length presented in Eq. (37) with the simulation
    time for each area is plotted in Fig. 12. The first area reaches to the maximum
    root length before any other areas since the root growth rate of it is the highest.
    At the beginning of simulation time, the root lengths of areas persist at the
    minimum root length because the linear model of root system described in Eq. (37)
    gives root length less than the . The root lengths during the simulation time
    for each area are used to selected the appropriate sensor nodes inside the circle

    in Eq. (58). Therefore, the objective of the fitness function devolves into the
    maximization of the network lifetime metric. Hence, the of area 3 and of area
    4 are minimized to maximize the network lifetime metric. Conversely, The RMSE
    of spreading of area 1, RMSE of dispersing of area 2 are minimized in Fig. 13
    when the weighting parameter is one . As shown in Fig. 12, the GA algorithm evolves

    14, Fig. 15, the fitness function described in Eq. (58) versus the GA iterations
    and simulation time, respectively is plotted with different weighting parameter
    for each area. When the weighting parameter is zero , the network lifetime metric
    is maximized without taking the root system metric into account in the fitness

    system metric is eliminated and the network lifetime metric is only considered
    in the fitness function of Eq. (58). Therefore, the averaged neighbor counts and
    remaining energy of the evolved nodes for each area at the end of simulation are
    high, compared with other values for weighting parameter . For , the network lifetime
    metric is removed and the root system metric is only considered in the fitness
    function of Eq. (58). Consequently, the neighbor counts and remaining energy are
    uncontrolled in OSSA. For , both root system and network lifetime metrics are
    considered in the optimization problem proposed in Eq. (59). Thus, the averaged
    neighbor counts and remaining energy of the evolved and unevolved nodes are located
    between their values when and . In addition, the averaged neighbor counts and
    remaining energy of the evolved nodes when and are greater than their values of
    the unevolved sensor nodes, because the OSSA selects the evolved nodes with higher

    counts and remaining energy of the evolved and unevolved nodes cannot be compared

    schemes In this section, the proposed ASIA is compared with the schemes [18],
    [19], [20], [21], [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] that uses fixed sampling interval.
    The adaptive and fixed sampling intervals for each area with the simulation time
    are plotted in Fig. 16. ASIA is performed at each time step to compute the sampling
    interval for each area based on the Eq. (67). The fixed sampling intervals of
    10 min and 15 min are applied for all areas. It is worth to notice that the sampling
    interval of the first area increases with the simulation time because as shown
    in Fig. (9), the first area has the lowest soil moisture reduction and the highest
    temperature reduction, compared with other areas. On the contrary, the fourth
    area has the lowest decreasing in sampling interval with the simulation time because
    it has the highest soil moisture reduction and the lowest temperature reduction
    a shown in Fig. (9). Accordingly, the sensing activities of the agricultural parameters
    increases in the fourth area to take the proper agricultural actions in the right
    time before the soil converts to be unsuitable for plant. Since the first area
    has the largest sampling interval rising, the sensing activities are reduced and
    in sequence, the energy consumption for sensing and communication are reduced.
    As a result, the adaptive sampling interval empowers the agricultural system to
    take the right actions at the right time and place which in turn, leads to improve
    the crop yields and the network lifetime. Therefore, the proposed AHPA scheme
    is a ubiquitous system. Download : Download high-res image (250KB) Download :

    Area. In this paper, the energy is consumed due to the sensing and communication
    activities. The total energy consumption for the fixed schemes of 10 min and 15
    min are averaged for all areas at each time step. In Fig. 17, the total energy
    consumption with the simulation time for ASIA of each area and the fixed schemes
    of 10 min and 15 min are plotted. The fixed sampling interval of 15 min has the
    lowest energy consumption. However, the plant implanted in the areas with the
    high moisture and low temperature reduction will damage due to the late time of
    sensing activities. When the fixed sampling interval is set 10 min, the sensing
    activities increases. Nevertheless, the energy consumption becomes the highest,
    which leads to reduce the network lifetime. For the adaptive schemes, the energy
    consumption depends on the computed sampling interval. When the sampling interval
    is high such as in area 1, the energy consumption is low, and vice versa. Therefore,
    the energy consumption in ASIA rises when more sensing activities are required
    for areas with higher soil moisture reduction and low soil temperature reduction,
    and vice versa. Download : Download high-res image (257KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 17. Total Energy Consumption of different Schemes for each
    Area. The reduction state in the soil moisture and temperature between two consecutive
    measurement activities is defined based on the following equation: (95) Fig. 18
    and Fig. 19 show the reduction of soil moisture and temperature during the simulation
    time for each area by using the ASIA and fixed sampling interval schemes of 10
    min and 15 min. The at a fixed sampling interval schemes of 15 min are higher
    than the ones at a fixed sampling interval schemes of 10 min. This large reduction
    in soil moisture could cause death or damage for the plant root, and hence reduce
    the crop yields. Although the at a fixed sampling interval schemes of 10 min is
    small which maintain more frequent monitoring of the soil, the energy consumption
    increases for small value of sampling interval. In the ASIA, the depends on the
    value of sampling interval for each area, which is computed in Eq. (67) based
    on the current updated value of soil moisture and temperature. For instance, the
    increases with the simulation because its sampling interval rises as shown in
    Fig. (16). In area 3 and 4, reduces with the simulation times because their sampling
    interval decreases as shown in Fig. (16). Finally, the is almost fixed for area
    2 because its sampling interval is almost fixed as shown in Fig. (16). Download

    scheme In this section, the proposed OSSA is compared with other approaches. The
    energy balance and neighbors count metrics of area at time step when the simulation
    is terminated are defined as [9]: (96) (97) Table 6 shows the different performance
    metrics for the proposed OSSA and SHPA scheme [9] with different values of the
    weighting parameter in case of OSSA and in case of SHPA. The number of dead nodes,
    the energy balance, the neighbors count, and the number of evolved nodes in sensing
    activities for the four areas are averaged and recorded in Table 6. The time of
    the first node death of the four areas is noted in Table 6. ASIA is adopted to
    compute the adaptive sampling intervals for both OSSA and SHPA. Table 6. Averaged
    WSN Performance Metrics using OSSA and SHPA Schemes. Scheme Weighting Parameter
    Dead Nodes First Dead Node Time Energy Balance Neighbor Count Evolved Nodes OSSA
    1.5 390.51 0.93 0.98 40.5 3 167.18 0.91 0.97 63.25 5.25 174.41 0.92 0.96 59 SHPA

    number of dead nodes increases with rising the weighting parameter in OSSA or
    in SHPA. This is because the effect of the network lifetime metric on the fitness
    function for OSSA and SHPA reduces with increasing the weighting parameters. Nevertheless,
    the proposed OSSA performs better than SHPA in term of the average number of dead
    nodes because the root system metric also improves the network lifetime through
    selecting spreading and dispersing sensor nodes to sense the agricultural parameters.
    Due to degrading the effectiveness of the network lifetime metric in the fitness
    function with increasing its weighting parameters in OSSA and SHPA, the first
    death time of the sensor node and the neighbor count metric reduces with increasing
    the weighting parameters. With the OSSA, the network lifetime is determined by
    the root system and network lifetime metrics. So, the OSSA has a larger first
    node death and neighbor count metrics than the SHPA scheme. As part of its implementation,
    the proposed OSSA utilizes the concepts of spreading and dispersing in order to
    highly cover the agricultural area and to enhance the load balancing. Due to these
    reasons, the number of sensor nodes evolved in OSSA is greater than that in SHPA.
    As defined in Eq. (96), the energy balance parameter is the summation of the normalized
    energy remaining of all sensor nodes inside the area at the end of simulation.
    Therefore, if the sensor node does not evolve in the sensing activities, its normalized
    energy remaining will be one at the end of simulation. The high value of energy
    balance defined in Eq. (96) indicates that low number of sensors nodes are evolved
    in sensing activities. Consequently, the balancing in term of energy consumption
    among sensor nodes is degraded. In SHPA scheme, the energy balance parameter increases
    with rising the weighting parameter because the weight of the lifetime metric
    decreases with rising the weighting parameter. In the proposed OSSA, both the
    network lifetime and the root system metrics contribute in the load balancing
    among sensor nodes. Thus, considering of the both performance metrics gives the
    lowest energy balance parameter. Furthermore, the proposed OSSA has better energy
    balancing among sensor nodes, compared with the SHPA scheme because of adopting
    the spreading and dispersing metrics in the fitness function evaluation. Fig.
    20 and Fig. 21 illustrate the locations of evolved sensor nodes and dead sensor
    nodes in each area for SHPA and OSSA. This paper introduces the concepts of spreading
    and dispersing in OSSA to improve crop yields and network lifetime. The evolved
    sensor nodes in the sensing activities and the dead sensor nodes are more evenly
    distributed across the area in the proposed OSSA than in the SHPA. OSSA also has
    fewer dead sensor nodes at the end of the simulation time than SHPA, since its
    load balancing is higher. Aside from that, the OSSA monitors and uses the development
    of the plant root system with time to select the sensor nodes. Download : Download

    values of 0.5. 8. Conclusion In this paper, Adaptive heterogeneous precision agriculture
    (AHPA) scheme is invented to measure the soil moisture and temperature in a heterogenous
    farm. According to the root system development of plant, the group neighbors count,
    and the group energy remaining, the AHPA scheme firstly performs the Optimally
    sensors selection algorithm (OSSA) to select a group of sensor nodes that will
    be used to sense the agricultural parameters. OSSA uses the Genetic algorithm
    (GA) as a population-based optimization technique to select the optimal or near-optimal
    group of sensor nodes so that the RMSE of group speeding, the RMSE of group dispersing,
    the inverted group neighbors count percentage, and the inverted group energy remaining
    percentage are minimized. After that, the AHPA scheme adopts the Extended kalman
    filter (EKF) to predicted the agricultural states of the soil moisture and temperature
    for each agricultural area independently. Then, the Adaptive sampling interval
    algorithm (ASIA) is executed to proactively compute the adaptive sampling interval
    based on the predicted agricultural state for each area disjointedly. In the update
    stage, the update states of the soil moisture and temperature is calculated using
    the EKF. The simulation results show that the performance metrics of the proposed
    AHPA scheme is improve, compared with other schemes. The usage of EKF eliminates
    the noises caused by the sensor nodes and associated with measurements. The total
    energy consumption and the reduction in the soil moisture and temperature between
    two consecutive measurement activities are improved in the proposed ASIA, compared
    with other fixed sampling interval schemes. The number of dead nodes, the time
    of the first node death, the energy balance, the neighbors count, and the number
    of evolved nodes in sensing activities are enhanced in the proposed OSSA compared
    with SHPA. Therefore, the network lifetime and crop yields are enhanced. Additionally,
    the sensor nodes are selected based on the root age to sense the whole soil of
    the plants. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have

    Publisher: IEEE Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Modern agricultural systems
    depend on limited soil data to inform the deployment of resources. Inefficient
    use of critical resources, such as fertilizer and water, caused by insufficient
    data, may lead to increased costs. Internet of Things (IoT)-based precision agriculture
    systems offer a potential solution by enabling high spatial resolution monitoring
    of soil conditions that can lead to more judicious use of resources and better
    crop yield [1]. The scalability of precision agriculture systems depends on inexpensive,
    biodegradable sensors, integrated into passive, wireless, and chipless sensing
    nodes. The 902–928 MHz industrial, scientific, medical (ISM) band offers good
    penetration of radio frequency (RF) signals in soil while still enabling relatively
    small antennas, making it ideal for this application [2]. Typical paper substrates,
    while biodegradable, are not well suited for sensor fabrication. These substrates
    are composed of networks of microscale cellulose fibers and have surfaces with
    large roughness and high porosity, thus making it challenging to fabricate structures
    with high fidelity and repeatability. Electrical structures printed on rough paper
    substrates have inferior electrical properties compared to structures printed
    on smooth polymer substrates, such as polyimide and polyethylene terephthalate
    (PET) sheets, that are typically used in flexible electronics [3], [4], [5]. Because
    of this, specialty papers have been developed with additional polymer fillers
    and coatings that considerably improve surface properties. While these are commonly
    used in paper-based electronics applications, the incorporation of non-biodegradable
    polymers makes them incompatible with precision agriculture systems [4], [6].
    Natural clay and mineral-based fillers, typically used to improve paper opacity
    and brightness, do not improve surface properties sufficiently for sensor manufacturing
    [7]. Recently, there has been interest in using nanocellulose-based materials
    for moisture sensing. Cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs), a specific form of nanocellulose,
    are of particular interest because of their excellent mechanical properties. When
    formed into sheets, CNFs have high specific stiffness and strength [8], [9]. The
    dielectric constant of nanocellulose films increases with increasing moisture
    content. This property has been leveraged in recent work to develop humidity sensors
    based on neat nanocellulose films [10], [11], [12]. However, the limited mechanical
    stability of such nanocellulose films when cycled under varying humidity conditions
    makes them unsuitable for precision agriculture applications. For nanocellulose
    to be used in such applications, it must be combined with other materials to ensure
    mechanical stability. Previous work on RF passive wireless moisture sensors rely
    on complicated circuitry for self-powering [13], [14] or readout [15]. These sensor
    nodes, therefore, must include integrated circuits (ICs) that increase complexity.
    Chipless sensor nodes are cheaper, smaller, simpler to package, and degrade more
    quickly than sensor nodes that include ICs. For capacitive soil moisture sensors
    to be integrated into a chipless passive wireless sensing system, sensor self-resonance
    must be well above the desired operating frequency, here the 902–928 MHz ISM band.
    While previous work has characterized electrical structures on cellulose-based
    substrates [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], most of this work focuses on operation
    under standard lab conditions and does not examine changes in electrical properties
    with moisture. There has also been no work to assess the suitability of nanocellulose-based
    substrates for operation at RF. Additionally, previous characterization of the
    electrical properties of paper has been limited to low-frequency studies of dielectric
    properties [21], [22]. We developed a fully biodegradable nanocellulose infiltrated
    cardstock composite that can be used as a substrate for moisture sensors. This
    composite, which includes both nano- and micro-cellulose fibers, has the required
    electrical properties and mechanical robustness for precision agriculture applications.
    Combined with a screen-printing process, we demonstrate the ability to print high-quality
    electrical structures with small feature sizes on this moisture responsive cellulose-based
    substrate. We present a capacitive moisture sensor fabricated on this substrate,
    suitable for direct operation and integration into chipless passive wireless sensing
    systems operating in the 902–928 MHz ISM band. We expand upon previous work [23]
    by including electromagnetic modeling of the sensors and investigate multiple
    sensor sizes. We characterize the electrical properties of the sensor under different
    humidity conditions and quantify the substrate’s moisture uptake and release over
    time. Additionally, we characterize the sensor’s behavior in soil at multiple
    moisture levels. SECTION II. Fabrication Methods A. CNF Composite Fabrication
    CNF-composites were fabricated via infiltration of a CNF solution into standard
    8.5 ′′ × 11 ′′ cardstock paper (Neenah) with an approximate thickness of 200μm
    . The CNF solution was prepared by combining a 1 wt% TEMPO-oxidized CNF gel [24]
    (obtained from USDA Forest Products Laboratory) with deionized water in a 1:1
    ratio to form a 0.5% CNF solution. To prepare the composite, a sheet of cardstock
    is wet evenly and clamped down in an acrylic stencil. CNF solution is coated on
    the surface of the cardstock and allowed to partially infuse for approximately
    1.5 h before a second coating is applied. After partial infiltration of the second
    layer, the sample is heat pressed at 60 °C for 20 min to form the surface layer
    and then oven dried at 60 °C for 12 h to remove any remaining moisture. It has
    been shown that nanocellulose films biodegrade in a manner similar to traditional
    pulp-based microcellulose papers and that the incorporation of nanocellulose with
    other paper based materials does not affect the degradation rate [25]. Additionally,
    previous work has demonstrated that the functionalization of CNFs, such as the
    TEMPO-oxidized CNFs used in this work, does not affect the biodegradability of
    nanocellulose [26]. As such, the fabricated CNF-composite is completely biodegradable.
    B. Sensor Fabrication Two interdigitated capacitive structures, pictured in Fig.
    1, were designed using a finite element-based electromagnetic solver (ANSYS HFSS).
    The number of fingers and their length was selected to obtain a self-resonance
    above the frequency band of interest. The larger capacitor [Fig. 1(b)] has fourteen
    five-millimeter-long, 100μm wide fingers, with a 250μm spacing between each finger,
    while the smaller capacitor has shorter 2.1 mm fingers. The active area of the
    small sensor is 11 mm2 while that of the large sensor is 25 mm2. The capacitive
    structures were fabricated via screen printing using a manual screen printing
    setup (NovaCentrix) and custom screens (SEFAR). Fig. 1. (a) Sensor schematic.
    (b) and (c) Picture of sensors on CNF-cardstock composite with G=250μm , W=100μm
    , N=14 (b) L=5 mm and (c) L=2.1 mm. Show All C. Print Quality Fig. 2 shows SEM
    images of the capacitors printed on polyimide, cardstock, and CNF-cardstock composite.
    The traces printed on polyimide and CNF-cardstock substrates are qualitatively
    superior to the structures printed on cardstock. The traces on the cardstock have
    higher non-uniformity and edge roughness due to the porosity and roughness of
    the surface. The high porosity leads to uneven ink infiltration, while the microscale
    fibers create a non-planar surface. Both of these contribute to poor trace quality
    and variation in the thickness of the traces. Fig. 2. SEM images of screen-printed
    capacitors on (a) polyimide, (b) cardstock, and (c) CNF-cardstock composite. The
    images in the right column are higher magnification images of the structures in
    the left column. Show All Surface profilometry was used to evaluate the roughness
    of the substrates as well as the quality of the printed traces, as is shown in
    Fig. 3. The root mean square (rms) roughness was calculated for each substrate,
    with the CNF-composite and polyimide exhibiting rms roughnesses of 0.52 and 0.47μm
    respectively while the rms roughness of the cardstock was nearly an order of magnitude
    larger at 3.5μm . This difference in the surface roughness is expected since the
    surface of the cardstock is comprised of microscale cellulose fibers. The surface
    roughness of each substrate directly correlated to the quality and consistency
    of the structures printed on them. Traces printed on the CNF-composite and polyimide,
    both low roughness substrates, had average trace heights and standard deviations
    of 13 ± 2.6 and 14 ±1.1μm , respectively while the cardstock structures exhibited
    greater variability with an average height and standard deviation of 15.1 ±6.1μm
    . Fig. 3. Surface profilometry measurements of (a) three sensor substrates and
    (b) sensor traces on the three different substrates [23]. Show All SECTION III.
    Sensor Design and Modeling Nominal sensor capacitances were selected to be 0.5
    and 1 pF, respectively. As sensor trace thickness ( ≈13μm ) is negligible compared
    to the substrate thickness ( ≈210μm ), the following closed-form approximation
    of interdigitated electrode capacitance [27] allows for the selection of initial
    sensor dimensions C=Lq 4 πa ϵ ∑ n=1 ∞ 1 2n−1 J 2 0 ( (2n−1)πG 2a ) (1) View Source
    where J 0 represents the zeroth Bessel function, a=G+W , q=N(G+W)−G , N is the
    total number of fingers constituting the capacitor. L , G , and W are capacitor
    dimensions defined in Fig. 1(a). From there, a relatively large number of fingers
    ( N=144 ) is selected to keep L small and limit the series resistance of the structures.
    A spacing, G , larger than the substrate thickness is selected to guarantee field
    lines travel through the moisture responsive substrate. Fig. 4 shows the equivalent
    circuit model of the capacitive sensor, where R s is the equivalent series resistance
    caused by loss in the sensor fingers, L s is the equivalent inductance of the
    sensor caused by the flow of current through the sensor fingers, and C is the
    capacitance of the sensor. From this equivalent circuit, the self-resonant frequency
    f 0 of the sensor is defined as f 0 = 1 2π L s C − − − − √ . (2) View Source At
    f 0 , the impedance of L s and C are complex conjugates and sum to zero. Above
    this frequency, the inductance dominates the sensor impedance and the sensor no
    longer behaves as a capacitor. The sensor quality ( Q ) factor describes the amount
    of energy stored by the capacitor with respect to the amount of energy dissipated
    by thermal loss Q= 1 2πfC R s . (3) View Source Fig. 4. Equivalent circuit model
    of the capacitive sensor. Show All To allow probing of the sensors at RF using
    ground-signal-ground (GSG) probes, two ground planes are added to the structure,
    one on each side of the sensor [see Fig. 1(a)]. Sensors were simulated in HFSS
    with cardstock as a substrate ( ϵ r ≈2.5 [13]) and with air surrounding the structures
    over a frequency range of 100 MHz–4 GHz. Capacitance values for both sensors are
    simulated using a range of spacings G . Preliminary sensor dimensions obtained
    from (1) are then used to build a sensor model in HFSS. The resulting self-resonant
    frequency, f 0 , and Q -factor at 915 MHz of multiple sensor dimensions are presented
    in Fig. 5. Fig. 5. Self-resonant frequency (full line) and sensor Q -factor at
    915 MHz (dashed) as a function of electrode spacing G for large and small capacitance
    sensors. Show All As the spacing, G , between electrodes increases, electrode
    length L must also increase to achieve the same capacitance. This increases sensor
    resistive losses, which decreases sensor Q . Increased electrode length also increases
    their inductance, which decreases the self-resonant frequency. Smaller sensor
    capacitances have larger Q -factors at 915 MHz as well as a larger self-resonant
    frequency than the larger capacitance sensors. As soil can have relative dielectric
    constants as large as 30 [28], a self-resonant frequency in air that is much larger
    than the operating frequency is necessary. Therefore, a spacing of G=250μm is
    selected, as it is larger than the substrate thickness and large enough for accurate
    and repeatable fabrication through screen-printing. SECTION IV. Sensor Response
    A. Experimental Method Sensor humidity response at RF was measured in a custom
    humidity chamber/RF probe station setup. A vacuum microprobe station chamber (MMR
    Technologies) was modified to allow for the introduction of humid air using a
    cool mist humidifier fit with tubing on one side of the chamber, while a fan was
    installed on the opposite side of the chamber to evacuate excess humid air from
    the chamber. Both the humidifier and fan were controlled to reach and maintain
    the desired relative humidity (RH) using a humidity controller (Inkbird IHC-200).
    In addition to the humidity sensor integrated to the controller, real time humidity
    levels in the chamber were monitored using a separate humidity sensor (Waveshare
    BME 280). The sensors were placed on a glass slide and measured using GSG RF probes
    with a 550μm pitch within the humidity chamber, while probe position was controlled
    from outside the chamber. Sensor electrical response was measured using a Keysight
    P9374A vector network analyzer (VNA). The VNA was calibrated using a short-open-load
    (SOLT)-through method on a standardized calibration set. B. Time Response The
    moisture absorption and desorption properties of the CNF-composite structures
    were measured by placing samples stored at 32% RH into the humidity chamber at
    90% RH. The scattering ( S ) parameters of the devices were recorded until stable
    values were reached. At this point, the humidity chamber lid was removed and the
    sensors were exposed to ambient conditions. Once again, the S -parameters of the
    sensors were recorded until capacitance values stabilized. Collected S -parameters
    were transformed into Y -parameters and the equivalent capacitance of the devices
    at 915 MHz was calculated, using the following equation: C eq = Im[ Y 21 ] 2πf
    (4) View Source where Im[ Y 21 ] is the imaginary part of the Y textsubscript
    21 admittance parameter of the sensor, f is the frequency of interest (here f=915
    MHz and C eq is the equivalent capacitance of the sensor at the specified frequency.
    The results of this experiment are shown in Fig. 6. For both sensor sizes, moisture
    uptake is initially quite large and causes the capacitance to increase dramatically
    before slowly tapering off to its steady-state value. Sensor moisture desorption
    follows the same trend: rapid large decrease in sensor capacitance, followed by
    a slow tapering to its steady-state value. The small difference in initial and
    final sensor capacitance can in part be attributed to the difference in the RH
    between the initial storing conditions (RH ≈32% ) and final ambient conditions
    (RH ≈40% ). Fig. 6. Change in sensor equivalent capacitance at 915 MHz as RH is
    increased to 90% and brought back down to ambient conditions. Sensor moisture
    absorption and desorption over time is fit to a time constant ( τ ) (a) large
    sensor, τ up =8 min τ down =5 min and (b) small sensor, τ up =6 min τ down =4
    min. Show All The increase in RH from 32% to 90% and the decrease from 90% to
    ambient ( ≈40% ) can both be considered as a step function stimulus of a time
    invariant system [29]. As such, the sensor’s response (i.e., its moisture absorption/desorption)
    can be fit to C=ΔC(1− e t/τ )+ C 0 and a system time constant, τ , extracted.
    The sensor with the larger capacitance and area [Fig. 6(a)] has τ≈8 min, while
    the smaller sensor uptakes moisture slightly faster, with a time constant of τ≈6
    min. Both sensors release moisture at a slightly faster rate with τ≈5 min and
    τ≈4 min for the large and small sensor respectively. These values align well with
    CNF-cardstock composite moisture diffusion results [30]. Note, the oscillations
    present in Fig. 6(a) are due to overshoots in RH caused by the humidity controller.
    Because groundwater evaporation and flow typically occurs over a 12 h cycle, data
    from current sensing techniques show that sampling rates of up to 2 h is sufficient
    to capture soil moisture fluctuations [31]. As such, the response rates of our
    sensors are more than sufficient to capture the temporal response of soil moisture.
    C. Humidity Response CNF-composite sensors stored in 32% RH were placed in the
    humidity chamber set at 40% RH and their S -parameters were recorded. Following
    this, every 30 min the humidity of the chamber was increased by 10% up to a final
    RH of 90%. The experiment was repeated with the same structures printed on polyimide.
    For the polyimide measurements, the humidity of the chamber was increased every
    10 min, as the measurements stabilized faster. An increase in equivalent capacitance
    at 915 MHz is calculated over the duration of the experiment and illustrated in
    Fig. 7. The self-resonant frequency of all sensors remained well above 928 MHz
    even at the largest RH, where it was 2.94 and 1.752 GHz for small and large polyimide
    structures and 3.03 and 1.6 GHz for small and large CNF-composite sensors. At
    peak RH, the small moisture sensor had a normalized increase in capacitance, ΔC/

    capacitance, 2.7 times larger. Fig. 7. Change in sensor capacitance over time

    =0.44 pF for CNF-composite. Show All SECTION V. Sensor Measurements in Soil A.
    Experimental Method Sensor response in soil was measured on a Cascade Microsystems
    probe station. A custom 3-D printed soil holder was designed. This holder allowed
    for soil to be placed below and above the sensor’s active area respectively, while
    allowing the 550μm GSG probes to land on sensor leads without touching the soil.
    Once again, electrical response was measured using a Keysight P9374A VNA calibrated
    using a SOLT method. Loamy sand soil with a composition of 85% sand, 9.8% silt,
    4.2% clay and 4.1% organic matter, similar to soil found in midwestern agricultural
    (e.g., corn, soybean) fields, was dried in an oven at 110 °C overnight to remove
    all moisture. Water was subsequently added to the soil to obtain desired moisture
    contents θ g (defined as θ g = m h 2 O / m drysoil ) of 15% and 25%. The upper
    bound of tested soil moisture content was fixed at 25%, which is near the moisture
    saturation limit for loamy sand soil [32]. Any additional water caused soil and/or
    water to seep out of its holder onto the probes. When measured in soil moisture
    conditions, sensors were probed after 18 min of exposure to soil, to allow the
    CNF-composite substrate time to absorb moisture (see Fig. 6). To evaluate the
    sensor’s ability to respond to soil moisture over multiple wetting and drying
    cycles, a large and a small CNF sensor were measured in dry soil and 15% soil
    moisture. These samples were then dried at 150 °C for 1 h to evaporate any moisture
    present in the sensor and the experiment was repeated. To evaluate the ability
    of the sensor to dry in soil, wet soil was placed on a sensor and allowed to dry
    in ambient conditions. B. Sensor Simulation Validation Sensors measured under
    ambient conditions (RH ≈35% ) in the soil holder were compared to simulated versions
    of these sensors. Fig. 8 shows the admittance in dB of the simulated and fabricated
    sensors. Good agreement between simulated and measured sensor admittance is observed
    at lower frequencies, while the self-resonant frequency of the measured sensors
    is slightly larger than that of the simulated structures. Traces in the HFSS model
    are 100μm wide and 10μm thick with a rectangular cross section. From Fig. 3, actual
    trace widths are wider (between 110 and 125μm ). Peak trace height is ≈14μm and
    has a more triangular cross section. This increase in trace width and thickness
    during the manufacturing process could decrease trace inductance which would in
    turn increase sensor self-resonant frequency, explaining the minor discrepancies
    between simulation and measurement. Fig. 8. Simulated (dashed) and measured (line)
    admittance of sensor screen-printed on CNF-composite substrate. Show All C. Results
    1) Soil Wetting: Fig. 9 shows the results of the soil moisture experiment. Fig.
    9(a) shows the phase of the admittance of both sensors for different soil moisture
    levels. The sensor self-resonance occurs when the sign of the phase switches from
    negative to positive. As such, the small sensor’s self-resonance remains above
    928 MHz for all soil moisture conditions (1.19-3.25 GHz), while the self-resonance
    of the larger moisture sensor, at 830 MHz, falls below the 902–928 MHz frequency
    band when soil moisture reaches 25%. The measured amplitude of the moisture sensor’s
    susceptance, the imaginary part of the admittance, is plotted over a 300–930 MHz
    frequency range with each of the corresponding capacitance’s labeled [Fig. 9(b)].
    Fig. 9(c) shows the equivalent capacitance at 915 MHz for the CNF-composite sensor
    as well as for the same structure printed on polyimide at different soil moisture
    conditions. When the sensor goes from being measured in air ( ϵ r =1 ) to being
    measured in dry soil ( ϵ r ≈2.2 [33]), the capacitances of both the structures
    on polyimide and the CNF-composite increases by a factor of 1.2, as both substrates
    are unresponsive to this change in medium. Once water is added to the soil, the
    CNF-composite substrate absorbs moisture, further increasing its capacitance compared
    to the polyimide structure. As such, from dry soil to 15% soil moisture, the sensor
    capacitance increases by a factor of 2.4 and 3.2 for the small and large sensor,
    respectively. Small sensor capacitance increases by a factor of 3.8 from 15% moisture
    to 25% soil moisture. This nonlinear response to soil moisture is caused by the
    quadratic relationship between soil moisture and soil dielectric constant [28],
    [34]. The smaller sensor, once again, shows a lower response to moisture than
    the larger one. Fig. 9. Large (top) and small (bottom) CNF-composite sensors in
    different soil moisture levels (a) phase of sensor reactance, (b) susceptance
    of the sensors, and (c) equivalent capacitance at 915 MHz. Show All 2) Soil Cycling:
    Fig. 10 shows the result of the soil moisture cycling experiment. The equivalent
    capacitance at 915 MHz is shown over time as a function of soil moisture. In dry
    soil the capacitance of the small sensor before and after the drying cycle decreases
    by 2%. In soil with 15% moisture, capacitance before and after drying decreased
    by 5%. These differences in capacitance are negligible compared to the 150% increase
    in capacitance caused by the 15% increase in soil moisture. Similarly, the large
    sensor capacitance in dry soil decreased 5.5% before and after drying, while its
    capacitance at 15% soil moisture varied by 0.3%. These variations are once again
    minimal compared to the 200% increase in capacitance caused by the 15% increase
    in soil moisture. Here, the large sensor capacitance at 15% soil moisture is smaller
    than in Fig. 9. This is caused by a difference in sensor self-resonant frequency.
    The self-resonance of the sensor in Fig. 10 at 15% soil moisture is 1.34 GHz.
    In Fig. 9(a), the sensor self-resonance is 1.16 GHz. However, the phase of the
    sensor at 915 MHz has begun to decrease, which slightly increases the equivalent
    capacitance. This discrepancy in sensor self-resonance can be ascribed to the
    manual screen printing process. Small changes in the characteristics of the sensors
    can be caused by slight differences in applied pressure or squeegee angle. Uniformity
    in sensor performance will be improved in the future using an automatic or semi-automatic
    screen-printing machine. Fig. 10. Equivalent capacitance at 915 MHz for two soil
    moisture conditions over two measurement cycles. Show All 3) Soil Drying: To investigate
    the response of the sensor to changing soil moisture conditions, soil with a moisture
    content between 15% and 20% was placed on top of a small sensor. The S -parameters
    of this sensor were recorded over time, as the wet soil dried under ambient lab
    conditions. The equivalent capacitance of the sensor at 915 MHz was calculated
    and is plotted over time in Fig. 11. To compare the sensor response to the drying
    rate of the soil placed above the sensor, a soil drying experiment was repeated
    in similar lab conditions with the mass of the soil recorded over time using a
    precision scale. Soil moisture content decayed exponentially, and after 7.5 h,
    the moisture content had decayed to 10% of its equilibrium value, with it decaying
    to 5% after 10.5 h. From Fig. 11, the sensor capacitance decreases exponentially,
    and approaches its nominal capacitance in dry soil after approximately 12 h. This
    discrepancy in the response between the sensor capacitance and the soil mass can
    be explained due to the drying behavior of the system. As the soil dries, moisture
    first evaporates from the surface of the soil, followed by moisture from the bulk.
    Therefore, the sensor will only dry, and thus change its capacitance, after the
    soil above it has started to lose moisture. Thus, the sensor is capable of drying
    in soil at a rate acceptable for agricultural soil moisture monitoring [31]. Fig.
    11. Change in sensor equivalent capacitance at 915 MHz as the soil above the sensor
    dries. Show All SECTION VI. Discussion and Conclusion This work focused on the
    fabrication and design of soil moisture sensors on a nanocellulose-coated biodegradable
    substrate. The soil moisture response of the sensors was demonstrated over a timescale
    of several hours to a day. However, in an agricultural field, sensors would have
    to collect data over an entire growing season, which typically lasts several months.
    As the substrate degrades, the response of the sensor is also expected to degrade
    until the sensor is no longer deemed functional. Previous work has used the amount
    of biogas generation of cellulose materials as a method to characterize the rate
    and percentage of degradation. Pulp-based papers, similar to the cardstock in
    our CNF-composite, take 82 days to reach near 100% degradation in a high microbial
    content soil [25]. However, as our device relies on the moisture response of CNF,
    the degradation time of nanocellulose offers better insight into the operational
    lifetime of our sensor. Studies characterizing nanocellulose degradation have
    found that pure nanocellulose films degrade completely in 22 to 30 days [25],
    [26]. These studies suggest that the CNF layer on our device will completely degrade
    after a few weeks. While future work will have to be conducted to evaluate how
    the degradation process impacts sensor performance, we expect the unpackaged sensors
    to have an approximate lifetime of a few weeks. Preliminary work has shown that
    the lifetime of these devices can be extended through the use of appropriate packaging,
    which will be the focus of future studies. Additionally, to fabricate fully biodegradable
    sensors, the use of biodegradable inks, such as copper- or zinc-based inks [35]
    will be investigated. The CNF-cardstock composite’s demonstrated use at RF makes
    it an excellent candidate for developing fully biodegradable, passive, wireless
    sensing systems. Such systems would rely on a frequency-coded, passive chipless-RFID
    sensing mechanism. Fully biodegradable sensor nodes, where the soil sensor is
    integrated with a screen-printed inductor on the CNF-composite substrate, would
    allow for wireless communication ranges up to approximately 15 cm through weak
    inductive coupling. Communication ranges can be increased significantly (up to
    100 m) by integrating a high Q miniature acoustic resonator and replacing the
    inductor with a screen-printed RF antenna [36]. The addition of the acoustic resonator
    would leave a 1 mm3 piece of Si after full degradation of the CNF-composite substrate
    and conductive traces. These two communication schemes thus enable the use of
    this sensor in a variety of operational scenarios. In this work we presented a
    moisture-responsive capacitive sensor printed on a CNF-cardstock composite, an
    all-cellulose biodegradable substrate. The infiltration of nanocellulose reduced
    the porosity and roughness of the cardstock, producing a smooth surface suitable
    for screen printing electrical structures with good fidelity and repeatability.
    Structures printed on the CNF-composite were of high fidelity and of similar quality
    to those printed on polyimide, a standard substrate in printed electronics. The
    hygroscopic nature of the CNF-infiltrated layer leads to a sensor with good moisture
    sensitivity over a wide range of humidity and soil moisture conditions. Additionally,
    the fabricated sensors demonstrated moisture responsiveness throughout the 902–928
    MHz band and the small sensor maintained a self-resonance well above this frequency
    band, making it suitable for passive RF sensing applications. The sensors showed
    a 0.75 (large sensor) and 0.28 (small sensor) normalized increase in capacitance
    from 40% to 90% RH. The small sensor exhibited a 9× increase in capacitance from
    dry soil to 25% soil moisture. The sensor’s ability to respond to soil drying
    was demonstrated. Sensor response after a wetting and drying cycle was shown to
    be very similar to the initial response. A trade-off between sensor sensitivity
    and self-resonance was observed. ACKNOWLEDGMENT The authors would like to thank

    Farmers need to adapt to the shifting demands of the environment as well as those
    of regulators, consumers, food processors, and retailers. The effects of soil
    erosion, biodiversity loss, and climate change are all becoming more and more
    of a burden, as are consumer preferences for food and worries about its production.
    Furthermore, the natural world, in which farming interacts with plants, pests,
    and diseases, continues to provide difficulties. Even if there are many solutions
    available in modern agriculture, the results vary because every farm is different
    in terms of the amount of water needed, the kind of soil, the temperature, and
    the humidity [1]. For these reasons, farmers are looking for technology that can
    solve the issues facing agriculture today. For farmers, a highly promising solution
    is to integrate Internet of Things devices with intelligent controller algorithms
    in agricultural systems. The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized the agricultural
    sector by providing farmers with real-time data on crop health, soil moisture,
    and nutrient levels. These data can be used to optimize crop yield, reduce water
    usage, and minimize the use of pesticides and fertilizers. IoT sensors can be
    used to monitor the health and well-being of livestock, optimize feeding schedules,
    detect illness, and improve breeding programs. Automated irrigation systems can
    be used to monitor soil moisture levels and weather patterns to optimize irrigation
    schedules, which can help reduce water usage and improve crop yield [2]. Many
    researchers have spent their time on the application of IoT devices in agriculture
    without considering the application of different controllers in agriculture to
    date. Furthermore, to sustain the health of the farm and maintain mass productivity,
    it is necessary to implement intelligent controller algorithms such as fuzzy logic,
    adaptive, model predictive, and so on into an agriculture system in order to enhancement
    the communication between faming system. The nature of agriculture structure requires
    flexibility, ease of implementation, robustness, and interpretability. Among the
    intelligent controllers, a fuzzy logic controller is the best fit to address the
    nature of agriculture structure requirements. The reason is that it works with
    imprecise inputs, does not require an accurate mathematical model, and can handle
    nonlinearity. It enables advanced fuzzy logic to control a pump’s switching time
    according to user-defined variables, whereby sensors are the main aspect of and
    contributor to the system [3]. It introduces an innovative irrigation time control
    system for smart farming that leverages fuzzy logic to regulate the timing of
    irrigation in crop fields, effectively curbing water wastage while ensuring that
    crops receive neither too little nor too much water. A smart greenhouse system
    based on an IoT and fuzzy inference system can create an automatic microclimatic
    condition that optimizes the conditions of plant growth through the use of IoT
    sensors and actuators that automate the controlling of weather factors to enhance
    the plant growing process. A smart farm system can optimize water usage for agriculture.
    The system implements an open loop fuzzy logic control system using a Mamdani
    control system. The inputs to the fuzzy logic control system are adapted from
    a humidity sensor, temperature sensor, and the flux sensor in the field [4,5].
    The purpose of this research is to improve automation systems in the agricultural
    industries by integrating intelligent controllers with Cisco Packet Tracer. As
    a result of Internet of Things devices being integrated into the system, farmers
    can now easily determine their current farming situation. The rest of this paper
    is organized as follows: Section 2 carries out a literature review, and Section
    3 presents mathematical models of the system. The results and a discussion are
    presented in Section 4, and conclusions are drawn in Section 5. 2. Literature
    Review Smart agriculture systems can be traced back to the mid-1980s, when research
    into automated fruit harvesting systems began in Japan, Europe, and the United
    States. Impressive advances have been made since then in developing systems for
    use in modern agriculture. To date, agriculture systems have utilized different
    technologies such as precision farming, hydroponics, aquaponics, robots, temperature
    and moisture sensors, aerial images, GPS technology, and vertical farming [6].
    The most popular applications of artificial intelligence in the agriculture industry
    are in three major categories: agricultural robots, predictive analytics, and
    crop and soil monitoring. Computer vision and deep-learning algorithms are used
    to process data captured by drones and/or software-based technology to monitor
    crops. Farmers use technology daily. Automated drones already monitor fields and
    collect data on crops. Agricultural robots are being developed to carry out the
    fieldwork. Robots have successfully planted, tended, and harvested crops. In order
    to realize the full potential of the IoT, there is a need to integrate ubiquitous
    smart devices and cloud-based applications [7,8]; a combined IoT framework with
    a cloud at the center gives the flexibility of dividing associated costs in the
    most logical manner and is also highly scalable. In the combined framework, sensing
    service providers can join the network and offer their data using a storage cloud;
    analytic tool developers can provide their software tools; artificial intelligence
    experts can provide their data mining and machine learning tools useful in converting
    information to knowledge; and computer graphics designers can offer a variety
    of visualization tools [9,10,11,12]. An agricultural management method supported
    by technology monitors, assesses, and evaluates the requirements of specific fields
    and crops. The focus of these efforts is on robotics, which includes sensors,
    aerial images, and sophisticated local weather forecasts, as well as Big Data
    and advanced analytics capabilities. This results in reduced environmental impact,
    financial savings, and optimized fertilizer utilization. Using data and information
    technologies to optimize intricate farming systems is known as smart farming.
    Smart farming does not place as much emphasis on exact measuring or differentiating
    between or within individual animals, as it does with PA. The emphasis is more
    on data application and access—that is, how to make intelligent use of the information
    gathered. Farmers can obtain real-time data regarding the state of the soil and
    plants, the terrain, the climate, the weather, the utilization of resources, labor,
    and funding [13,14]. By using mobile devices like smartphones and tablets, farmers
    now possess the knowledge necessary to base their judgments on factual information
    rather than gut feeling. Regular use of web-based data platforms in conjunction
    with Big Data analysis, internal and external farm networking, and precision and
    smart farming techniques is common. Products for IoT-enabled smart agriculture
    are made to automate irrigation systems and use sensors to monitor crop areas.
    Consequently, farmers and related brands may conveniently and remotely check agricultural
    conditions. Agriculture currently uses a variety of technologies. Therefore, to
    determine the degree of technology employed in the system, it is necessary to
    identify and compare the various technologies. For simplicity, this is compared
    in Table 1. Table 1. Smart flatform comparison to date [15,16]. Researchers are
    using a variety of technologies in agriculture systems, including machine learning,
    remote sensing, image processing, sensor networks, and so on, to boost agricultural
    productivity. In order to gain insights, it is necessary to compare the controller
    algorithms used in agricultural systems. The comparison is based on how easily
    it can be automatically tuned during operation, as demonstrated in Table 2. Table
    2. Comparison of control algorithms in smart agriculture applications [15,16,17].
    3. Mathematical Models of the System Figure 1 demonstrates how the overview of
    the present work begins with the collection of related works and the identification
    of issues. Following accurate problem acquisition, mathematical models of the
    agricultural tanks are created. Appropriate control algorithms are developed based
    on the mathematical models. The complete system is then be tested and simulated.
    After integrating the models with Cisco Packet Tracers and simulating again, if
    the test result validates the requirements, the findings are received and discussed.
    The procedure is repeated until the intended outcome is achieved. If the tested
    results are not validated by the requirements, which are checked against the mathematical
    model, the procedure is repeated. Figure 1. Flow chart of the current work. 3.1.
    Working Principles of Smart Agriculture From Figure 2, it can be understood that
    agriculture can be a field as suitable as industry for the application of automation.
    Addressing the issues in the agricultural sector is challenging because crops
    are unable to communicate their emotions. Furthermore, humans are unaware of all
    the requirements that plants have. Farmers’ extensive and protracted experience
    offers partial, but not complete, comprehension. The use of the Internet of Things
    in smart agriculture would help with issues like industry 4.0 agriculture using
    artificial intelligence and machine learning concepts, and IOT smart farming [18].
    It aids in issue solving, goal keeping, improvement, categorization, and disease
    prediction in agricultural systems. Intelligent controllers (fuzzy logic controllers)
    would receive reference parameters (input) such as temperature, humidity, and
    soil moisture. The controller would then estimate the necessary specification
    and send it to the agricultural system. The Internet of Things is integrated into
    the agricultural system, allowing farmers to receive messages and quickly understand
    any issues. The reference settings would be modified for the farmer based on the
    need [19,20]. Fuzzy logic controller algorithms would be used to make the decision
    and carry out the action itself if the farmers were not given the proper system
    parameters. On the other hand, industrial processes can be designed by modules
    to apply specific robots to specific tasks, whereas the complex tasks of agriculture
    sometimes cannot be split into simple actions. Figure 2. Smart agriculture system.
    3.2. Mathematical Models of the Water Reservoir Tank Level, and Its Opening Valve
    As shown in Figure 3, when considering a tank that has fluid flowing in (input)
    and fluid flowing out, we define the output as depth in the tank. Now, the research
    questions could be: Figure 3. Water tank level for smart agriculture system. How
    does the depth depend upon the inflow and outflow? How does the outflow depend
    upon the depth? In order to answer the questions, it must be understood that the
    outflow will depend upon the pressure in the tank (which depends upon the depth
    and density) and a constant linked to the pipe shape [21]. 𝑓 𝑜𝑢𝑡 =𝑅ρ𝑔ℎ (1) Equation
    (1) represents the outflow models; the rate of the change of the depth will depend
    on the cross-sectional area, the difference between flow in and out. 𝑑𝑉 𝑑𝑡 =𝐴

    (3) show that the time constant depends on the resistance (pipe opening) of the
    outlet pipe and the cross-sectional area. 𝐴 𝑅ρ𝑔 𝑑ℎ 𝑑𝑡 +ℎ= 1 𝑅ρ𝑔 𝑓 𝑖𝑛 (4) Gain
    depends on the resistance (pipe opening) of the outlet pipe: 𝑇= ⎧ ⎩ ⎨    
    𝐴 𝑅ρ𝑔 𝐾= 1 𝑅ρ𝑔 (5) It was noted that the resistance to flow is actually 1 𝑅ρ𝑔
    . If the cross-sectional area is increased, the time constant increases. If the
    resistance to flow K is increased, the time constant and steady state gain also
    increase. We ignore the impact of density and gravity. This marks the end of the
    mathematical models for inflow and outflow models. To adjust the system automatically
    and fulfill the objective, it is necessary to look at the control strategy. This
    model works with inaccurate and hazy data. This is based on degrees of truth and
    is a glaring oversimplification of the real-world issues, as it includes only
    water tanks, which are a component of an agricultural system. For the time being,
    fuzzy logic control works well because some parameters are unknown. 3.3. Fuzzy
    Logic Control Design Fuzzy logic is a mathematical method for representing vagueness
    and uncertainty in decision making. It allows for partial truths, where a statement
    can be partially true or false, rather than fully true or false. Fuzzy membership
    is a concept in fuzzy logic that assigns a degree of membership to an element
    in a set. The degree of membership is a value between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates
    that the element is not a member of the set, and 1 indicates that the element
    is a full member of the set [15]. There are different types of membership functions
    that can be used to model fuzzy sets, as represented in Table 3. While fuzzy logic
    has many advantages, there are also some disadvantages to using it. One of the
    main disadvantages is that it can be difficult to design a fuzzy system that accurately
    models a complex system. Fuzzy systems can also be computationally expensive to
    run, especially if they involve a large number of rules or membership functions.
    Additionally, fuzzy systems can be difficult to interpret, especially if they
    involve a large number of rules or membership functions [22]. Table 3. Comparison
    of fuzzy memberships. Based on the comparison hits, a Gaussian membership function
    was selected for this work [23]. 𝐹(𝑥,σ,𝑐)= 𝑒 − (𝑥−𝑐) 2 2 σ 2 (6) Figure 4 depicts
    the conventional layout of a fuzzy logic controller. Before going into the main
    control block, the inputs which were crisp values produced by the feedback error
    and change in error were conditioned by multiplying by constant gains using a
    preprocessor. The fuzzification block matches data with criteria of rules and
    transforms input data into degrees of membership functions. The Mamdani-type inference
    engine took the rule-based commands as input, calculated the degree of capability
    of the used rules, and produced a fuzzy set for the defuzzification block, which
    took the fuzzy output data and produced crisp values. Through the use of the centroid
    defuzzification approach, the outputs of the fuzzy sets were transformed into
    crisp values [24,25]. Figure 4. Fuzzy logic controller scheme. 3.3.1. Membership
    Function Assignments The membership assignment for temperature is displayed in
    Figure 5. Temperature regulation would be based on function. Low is represented
    in black, normal is presented in red, and high is represented by blue, which have
    been assigned to the values. The Gaussian function is used to represent the function.
    While probability was represented by the vertical axis, the horizontal axis was
    expressed in degrees Celsius. Figure 5. Fuzzy membership function for temperature.
    Figure 6 shows the membership assignment for humidity. Function would be the basis
    for controlling humidity. The values have been given as low, represented in black,
    normal, presented in red, and high, represented in blue. The function is represented
    by the Gaussian function. The horizontal axis was given in mass per cubic meter,
    whilst the vertical axis denoted probability. Figure 6. Fuzzy membership function
    for humidity. The membership assignment for humidity is displayed in Figure 7.
    The foundation for regulating soil moisture would be function. Three values have
    been assigned to the values: low, which is represented in black, normal, which
    is presented in red, and high, which is represented by blue. The Gaussian function
    is used to represent the function. The vertical axis represented probability,
    and the horizontal axis was expressed in mass per cubic meter. Figure 7. Fuzzy
    membership function for soil moisture. Figure 8 shows the membership assignment
    for opening the valve. Function would be the cornerstone for controlling the valve’s
    opening. Wet is represented by blue, cold is shown in red, moderate is presented
    in black, hot is demonstrated in purple, and dry is presented in green. The function
    is represented by the Gaussian function. Probability was represented by the vertical
    axis, while degrees were shown by the horizontal axis. Figure 8. Fuzzy membership
    function for opening valve. As shown in Table 4, the fuzzy logic designs were
    determined by the language rules. Z stands for zero response, P1 shows positive
    small, which means the valve would be open slightly, N2 signifies negative large,
    which means the valve is completely closed, and P2 indicates positive large, which
    means the valve is fully opened and the water is discharging. Table 4. Rule design
    for IOT device. Figure 9a,b demonstrate how these rules base their control efforts
    on a number of if–then statements regarding (e) and (De). Specifically, if the
    error is equivalent to the values for temperature (TV), humidity (HV), and soil
    moisture, then control (c) is changed to open the valve (OV). The system was tuned
    and experiments were conducted to identify the number of these if–then statements.
    It is simple to repeat the procedure by adjusting the input numbers with the aid
    of the vertically positioned red line. It adjusts itself prudently. The yellow
    color in Figure 9a indicates the face of the input parameters, while the blue
    color in Figure 9b shows the output parameters. Figure 9. Density probability
    for rules of the fuzzy interface system. Plotting the first output variable against
    the first two input variables, the fuzzy logic rule surface provides the output
    surface for the fuzzy inference system. The midpoints of each input variable’s
    corresponding range are used as reference values for the other input variables
    in fuzzy systems with three inputs. As a result, Figure 10 shows the smoothness
    of the control signal change and offers the rule surface that corresponds to the
    rules. Figure 10 shows the fuzzy numbers with the lightness change caption and
    colors representing the least and greatest uncertainty levels. and was greatly
    impacted by the work, which offered approaches for visualizing data with uncertainty
    based on variations in saturation, brightness, and/or intensity. The hue of the
    map indicates the degree of uncertainty with respect to the lower values. The
    color-coded map illustrates the degree of uncertainty towards the higher numbers.
    Figure 10. Fuzzy logic rule surface. The aim of this controller design is to enhance
    communication between ground mobile robots, aerial vehicles (quadcopters), and
    farming fields. In order to achieve the goals of this work, this section provides
    a case study for the intelligent fuzzy logic controller and formulations of air
    properties in agricultural fields. Figure 11 shows that the components consist
    of three inputs: soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, and humidity sensors.
    The fuzzy logic controller then receives signals from the three inputs in order
    to control the pumps and valve opening conditions. As the valve opens, input fills
    the water tank. The filled water levels are measured by water level sensors and
    flow rate sensors, which send feedback to the fuzzy logic controller. Based on
    the feedback signals, the fuzzy logic controller automatically adjusts the input
    signals and then sends them to the respective outputs. Figure 11. Block diagram
    of smart agriculture system. Figure 12 shows the working principles of the IoT
    implementation in the agriculture system. The system starts up and initializes,
    then collects data from the agricultural fields. It then prints whether the soil
    moisture (SM) is less than 27%, in which case the sprinkler turns on, or if the
    soil moisture (SM) is greater than 27%, in which case the sprinkler turns off.
    Figure 12. Schematics of the model. 3.3.2. Case Study for the Intelligent Fuzzy
    Logic Model These rules can be used to create a fuzzy logic-based system that
    can control a pump’s switching time according to user-defined variables, whereby
    sensors are the main aspect of and contributor to the system. The proposed system
    can help automate irrigation and reduce water consumption and watering time [15,16,17,18,19].
    Here are some fuzzy rules for temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and soil acidity
    as input and output in a smart agriculture system: Temperature: ◦ If the temperature
    is low, then the output is cold; ◦ If the temperature is normal, then the output
    is moderate; ◦ If the temperature is high, then the output is hot. Humidity: ◦
    If the humidity is low, then the output is dry; ◦ If the humidity is normal, then
    the output is moderate; ◦ If the humidity is high, then the output is wet. Soil
    Moisture: ◦ If the soil moisture is low, then the output is dry; ◦ If the soil
    moisture is normal, then the output is moderate; ◦ If the soil moisture is high,
    then the output is wet. Soil Acidity: ◦ If the soil acidity is low, then the output
    is basic; ◦ If the soil acidity is normal, then the output is neutral; ◦ If the
    soil acidity is high, then the output is acidic. These rules can be used to create
    a fuzzy logic-based system that can control a pump’s switching time according
    to user-defined variables, whereby sensors are the main aspect of and contributor
    to the system. The proposed system can help automate farms and reduce water consumption
    and watering time. 3.3.3. Formulation of the Air Properties in the Agricultural
    Field It was assumed that the opening of the valve, moisture in the sounding,
    pump flow rate, and water levels during the valve’s operation would be taken into
    account. However, other factors were not considered in the work. Based on this
    assumption, the following parameters would be formulated as follows [20]: Moisture
    in sounding (%)= γ𝑝 ρ − − − √ ∗100 (7) where γ is the constant ideal ratio, p
    is the pressure sound in the system, and ρ is the specific density of the air.
    Outflows(Q)= π∗D 2 ∗𝑛∗𝐻 4∗𝑔 (8) where D is the diameter of the reservoirs, n is
    the number of moles, H is the head of the water in the field. Pumps flow (rpm)=GPM
    (9) where gallons per minute (GPM) is the flow rate. Valve opening=Q proportional
    to Area×Sqrt of DP (10) where DP is the pressure drop across the valve. 4. Results
    and Discussion The purpose of this research article was to create an Internet
    of Things (IoT) weather station that also incorporated a soil moisture monitoring
    component. The device is intended to notify the user when the moisture content
    of the soil drops below a certain value. To notify the user that the moisture
    content of the soil is too low, sprinklers, which correspond to the three soil
    moisture sensors, will turn on. The initial idea was to feed all of these data
    onto a server designed to handle IoT projects and then plot the data continuously.
    From Table 5, it was understood that IoT devices (temperature sensors, ADH sensors,
    and water vapor per kg) are used as inputs for the fuzzy logic control. The outputs
    are rotations of the pumps, moisture in the sounding, water level sensors, outflow,
    and valve opening. Of these output parameters, valve opening is constant throughout
    the process, while the input parameters vary. Table 5. Simulation results of the
    IOT application in smart agriculture system. Table 6 presents the comparison between
    the previous results [2,3,4] and the current results. Table 6. Comparison of previous
    work and current work. Figure 13 demonstrates the water levels in the fields.
    The vertical axis indicated the water level in mega metric cube (Mm3), whereas
    the horizontal axis showed the time in hours. At the beginning, it slowly increases
    since the amount of water required by the field was not much. It increases slowly
    until about 9.8 h, after which it dramatically increases, indicating that the
    field requires more water. Too much water in agricultural areas can affect how
    the soil functions, hinder plant growth, and increase the risk of nutrient runoff.
    Too little water, on the other hand, can have devastating effects on crops and
    their ability to take up nutrients from the soil. Intensive groundwater pumping
    for irrigation depletes aquifers and can lead to negative environmental externalities,
    causing significant economic impact on the sector and beyond. Figure 13. Measurements
    of water level in agricultural fields. As seen in Figure 14, valve opening is
    a term used in irrigation to describe the degree to which a valve is open or closed.
    It is typically expressed as a percentage, with 0% indicating that the valve is
    completely closed and 100% indicating that the valve is completely open. The valve
    opening determines the amount of water that flows through the valve and into the
    irrigation system. By adjusting the valve opening, the controller can control
    the amount of water that is delivered to their crops. For this case, its opening
    slowly increases, because the level of the water discharge flow rate is directly
    proportional to the product area and the drop in pressure. The water level has
    a minimum of 10 m3, meaning that when the valve is opened, the water level will
    likewise gradually rise from 10 m3. Figure 14. Valve opening mechanism. As shown
    in Figure 15, in the IoT, a controller effort is a term used to describe the amount
    of torque or force that is applied to a pump and valves in order to achieve a
    desired performance. Controllers are defined by the type of control input and
    the type of output they use to drive the pump and valves. For example, a flow
    rate controller accepts flow rate commands as input and produces torque (effort)
    commands as output. Figure 15. Controller effort. Figure 16 represents the discharge
    of water in the agricultural fields. It means that flow rate discharge is the
    volume of water that flows through a pipe or channel per unit of time. In the
    agricultural sector, flow rate discharge is an important parameter for irrigation
    systems. It is used to determine the amount of water that is delivered to crops
    automatically, and to ensure that the farm system is operating properly. Figure
    16. The discharge rates. As shown in Figure 17, errors related to water level
    grow proportionately. An inaccuracy characterized as a proportional error depends
    on how much the water level variable changes. Thus, the relationship between the
    change in water level and the change in time (hours) is straightforward. Time
    (hours) divided by water level always equals the same constant, since this change
    is always of an equally quantifiable quantity. A statistic that shows how much
    a water levels sample percentage is expected to deviate from the proportion in
    the overall proportion that constitutes the standard error of a proportion. Figure
    17. Water level error. After the controller design was finished, it was implemented
    in Cisco Packet Tracer with integrated MATLAB/SIMULINK environments. Figure 18
    shows the real-time flow of data packets during the simulation. The fuzzy logic
    intelligent controller is the home gate connected to the IoT backend server. The
    IoT connection enables users to check the status of the IoT parameters such as
    temperature, humidity, and soil moisture from an IoT browser homepage. The IoT
    browser homepage shows a list of the smart devices, allows visualization of their
    status, and permits remote interaction with the devices. Logical interaction between
    smart devices can be set while connected to the IoT main homepage. Interactions
    between devices are based on set conditions, such as starting a chiller when the
    temperature of a particular unit needs to be lowered or reducing oxygen supply
    to a boiler in order to reduce fire tube temperatures. The central control PC,
    manager smartphones, and tablets, which are connected to the local central office
    wireless LAN (WLAN), can connect to the dedicated IoT homepage via a browser in
    order to monitor all connected IoT devices. Cisco Packet Tracer has a feature
    with the possibility to switch from real-time to simulation mode. The first mode
    enables the possibility to create the underlying network, connect IoT devices,
    and define IoT backend logic. However, only in the simulation mode, it was possible
    to validate that the network communication layer really happened between the devices.
    In the simulation mode, it was possible to simulate packet traffic between nodes
    and devices in order to check the connectivity, routing protocols, and other network
    logic. This mode helped to physically visualize and troubleshoot any kind of network,
    for example, setting up pings or more complex packages between nodes. Figure 18.
    Real-time flow of data packet. 5. Conclusions This study aimed to incorporate
    an Internet of Things (IoT) agricultural system that monitors soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity as input parameters and automatically opens the valve as an output.
    In order to achieve these goals, a wide range of pertinent research papers were
    looked into to determine the current problems. One of the problems was the difficulty
    of having valves in agricultural fields that open automatically. Based on well-founded
    concerns, mathematical models of agricultural tanks were created. Fuzzy logic
    controllers were designed using the mathematical models that were provided. It
    was determined to create fuzzy logic controllers by utilizing the language-based
    membership function. Fuzzification of fuzzy language started next, and was followed
    by rule evaluation and defuzzification. Next, a fuzzy logic surface and fuzzy
    logic rules were created. When the fuzzy logic system was complete, it was all
    transferred to a mathematical model of a water tank to watch how the controller
    functioned. After that, Cisco Packet Tracers were used to integrate the entire
    system within the MATLAB environment. Sprinklers that correspond to the three
    soil moisture sensors activate, and the gadget notifies the user when the soil
    moisture content falls below a predetermined threshold. After being loaded onto
    a server built to handle IoT devices, the data are continually plotted. The field’s
    water requirement rises gradually for approximately 9.8 h before sharply increasing,
    suggesting that the field needs more water. In agricultural settings, an excess
    of water can disrupt soil structure, impede plant development, and raise the possibility
    of nutrient runoff. Crops and their capacity to absorb nutrients from the soil
    can suffer greatly from inadequate watering. Aquifers are depleted, and adverse
    environmental externalities may result from intensive groundwater pumping for
    agriculture, which has a substantial financial impact on the industry and beyond.
    In agriculture, “valve opening” refers to the extent to which a valve is open
    or closed. A percentage is usually used to represent it, where 0% denotes a fully
    closed valve, and 100% denotes a fully opened valve. The amount of water that
    passes through the valve and enters the agricultural system is determined by the
    valve opening. Farmers can regulate how much water is applied to their crops by
    changing the opening of the valve. The amount of torque or force supplied to a
    pump and valves to accomplish a specified performance is referred to as the controller
    effort in the Internet of Things. The kind of control input and output that a
    controller uses to operate the pump and valves characterizes the controller. For
    instance, a flow rate controller generates torque (effort) commands as an output
    after receiving flow rate commands as input. Flow rate discharge is a crucial
    agricultural system element in the agriculture industry. It is used to figure
    out how much water is automatically applied to crops and to make sure the farm
    system is running smoothly. Smart gadgets are linked to the IoT backend server
    through a house gate. Through the IoT connection, users can remotely interact
    with the devices and check their status from the homepage of an IoT browser. While
    linked into the IoT main portal, smart device interactions can be configured logically.
    Device interactions are dependent on predetermined parameters. For example, a
    chiller may be started when a certain unit needs its temperature dropped, or the
    oxygen supply to a boiler may be reduced to lower fire tube temperatures. All
    linked IoT devices may be monitored by the central control PC, management cellphones,
    and tablets by connecting them via a browser to the specific IoT site. One characteristic
    that makes integrating MATLAB/Simulink with Cisco Packet Tracer possible is the
    ability to transition between simulation and real-time mode. It is feasible to
    confirm that the network communication layer between the devices actually occurred
    in the simulation mode. To examine network logic, routing protocols, and connectivity
    between nodes and devices, a packet tracer simulation can be performed. This mode
    facilitates the physical visualization and troubleshooting of any type of network,
    including the configuration of more intricate packages or pings between nodes.
    It was discovered that the optimal outcome came from combining the Cisco Packet
    Tracer with the MATLAB environment. If agricultural temperature, humidity, and
    soil moisture content were all effectively controlled, as well as if water tanks
    could open on their own, these outcomes would occur. Farmers and crops would be
    in communication at the same time. Consequently, in comparison to earlier research
    studies, the suggested intelligent control system is the most appropriate with
    IoT gadgets for the implementation of smart farm systems. Author Contributions

    farmingFuzzy logicNational food security 1. Introduction Agriculture poses a significant
    concern for humanity, as it is the primary source of food production. Many individuals
    suffer from hunger due to food scarcity, particularly in Third-world countries
    [22]. Food scarcity has been associated with socioeconomic elements like the expanding
    population [48]. Over the last five decades, the global population has risen by
    3–6 billion, intensifying the demand for food resources [5,35]. Shockingly, hunger
    led to the chronic malnourishment of over 800 million people worldwide in 2016.
    Furthermore, more than 10 million individuals perish annually due to starvation
    [14]. Therefore, increasing food production is crucial in eradicating hunger and
    poverty. However, the reality is far from simple; agriculture remains largely
    unmodernized in many countries, leading to low food output [44]. Due to this necessity,
    there is a requirement for the advancement of intelligent agriculture by enhancing
    farming methods beyond conventional practices, which is crucial to boosting production
    yields qualitatively. This necessitates integrating constantly evolving technological
    innovations [49]. Its purpose is to empower farming methods to match agricultural
    production with the increasing population, thereby reducing prevalent hunger [2].
    The global rise in mushroom cultivation can be attributed to the nutritional richness
    and distinctive culinary characteristics of mushrooms [50]. There is a forecast
    that the worldwide mushroom market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons
    by 2028 [21]. Regrettably, mushrooms have not garnered significant interest among
    farmers due to the high labor requirement during the practice. Additionally, cultivating
    specific mushroom varieties poses challenges, especially in regions where wild
    mushroom cultivation is prevalent [17]. Unlike most agricultural species, mushrooms
    must be cultivated in a specific environment, avoiding high temperatures and low
    humidity to achieve the most favorable harvest [[18], [19]]. Historically, mushrooms
    have been naturally grown in the wild and harvested from their natural habitats
    [36], affecting the harvest of this crucial agricultural product. Over the past
    ten years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has become a crucial tool across various
    domains [53]. Specifically in agriculture, IoT is employed to create interconnected
    farming systems that optimize productivity while conserving resources [26]. This
    advanced technology enables farmers to enhance agricultural productivity sustainably
    with reduced environmental risks [31,47]. Through the deep integration of state-of-the-art
    technologies such as deep learning, artificial intelligence, IoT, and cloud computing,
    smart agriculture represents a strategic approach for the agricultural sector
    to autonomously monitor, control, and make informed decisions with the assistance
    of information and knowledge [1,4,39]. This integration is achieved through the
    deployment of IoT sensors in agricultural practices. This proves particularly
    beneficial in agricultural activities, especially for crops that demand extra
    care during cultivation, such as mushrooms. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    mushroom cultivation by incorporating various intelligent systems, primarily concentrating
    on regulating temperature and air humidity through automated watering systems
    [32]. Nevertheless, other crucial factors remain overlooked in mushroom plant
    cultivation, such as managing light exposure [23], addressing insect disruptions
    [9] and utilizing natural or artificial lights a crucial environmental factor
    that significantly enhances the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest
    [24,27,33,54]. These factors play a vital role in the growth and metabolism of
    mushrooms, influencing mycelium characteristics (growth rate, density, and color)
    and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies (stalk, cap, and color formation)
    [23]. It is worth clarifying that light plays a major role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms [52]. Moreover, the research work of Bellettini et al. [8]
    focused on the identification of the presence of insects, mites, crustaceans,
    and other arthropods that feed on mushrooms, as well as decomposers on synthetic
    or wooden substrates, as detrimental factors to the optimal growth of mushrooms.
    It is worth noting that Bellettini et al. [8] presented a challenge of manually
    addressing the issues of external agent''s presence, which can be mitigated by
    automatically spraying the pesticide on the farm. To alleviate the challenges
    with the current mushroom production, this study aims to provide an IoT-based
    system that integrates various modules to intelligently control vital parameters:
    temperature, humidity, substrate moisture, light intensity, and pest management.
    The proposed method integrates Fuzzy Logic (FL) in the IoT module to enable the
    sensor-recorded data use as enablers of the system functionality based on their
    comparison with the pre-recorded standard data, specifying optimal ranges for
    each vital parameter. The system triggers actuators when sensor data falls outside
    the desired range to keep the environmental parameters of the farm in the desired
    range, effective for mushroom cultivation. It is important to note that the proposed
    method incorporates self-decision-making through FL, a mathematical modeling technique
    mimicking human decision-making. To achieve our objectives, the contributions
    of this work are highlighted as follows: 1. Monitoring the sensors'' recorded
    data for an intelligent and adaptive environment, ensuring optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation, and automating the farm''s vital environmental parameters.
    2. Optimizing agricultural resources, namely, water and pesticide, by introducing
    the sensors not used in the previous works. Keeping the objective of this work
    under the mushroom cultivation field, the diversification of our method leads
    to a more nuanced understanding of the environmental factors that can be applied
    to several types of mushrooms. The structure of this paper is outlined as follows:
    In Section 2, the literature review and the current state of the art about the
    focal point of this study are presented. Section 3 outlines the design and methodology
    employed in this work. The results are deliberated in Section 4, with concluding
    remarks provided in the last Section 5. 2. Literature review and materials 2.1.
    Existing literature Intelligent environmental control applications have successfully
    enhanced agricultural applications, particularly in mushroom farming research.
    The research works in Jararweh et al. [28] employed FL connected to various actuators,
    which have been adjusted based on the data gathered during the process. The results
    obtained by Jararweh et al. [28] showed significant improvement over the existing
    works. However, optimal farm control has not been achieved. The study by Chandrappa
    et al. [12] focused on using sensor automation technology to aid farmers in making
    manual and automatic agricultural decisions. However, these efforts mainly concentrated
    on monitoring moisture content in the substrate, air temperature, and humidity
    in the mushroom field, ignoring other crucial parameters that may impact the quality
    and quantity of the mushroom yield. Factors such as cultivation techniques, mechanical
    damage, storage conditions, and post-harvest manipulation also play a significant
    role [11,40]. It is worth noting that the integration of FL in agricultural applications
    [13,29,30,42] has been proven to be one of the most efficient techniques to control
    the variation of the farms’ parameters based on the classification of the data
    in place classification in various sets. The introduction of IoT in agricultural
    applications has also shown promising improvement in crop production, such as
    in Marzuk and Ying [34] and Thong-u and Wongsaroj [45]. Specifically, the work
    by Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45] conducted across three mushroom fields and one
    adjacent sample area, employing wireless communication to merge the data from
    these fields utilized the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol
    to centralize information from each field, which was then uploaded to an online
    platform. Similarly, Marzuki and Ying [34] utilized an online interface for real-time
    monitoring. However, their approach involved a more comprehensive array of sensors,
    measuring additional parameters such as air temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide
    levels, and light quality. They used ThingSpeak as a cloud platform connected
    to the web-based visualization window. Moreover, the work of Rahman et al. [38]
    automated agricultural decisions and executed the process according to fixed time
    interval-based schedules. 2.2. The state-of-the-art Edible mushrooms are highly
    prized for their nutritional and medicinal properties, thanks to the presence
    of diverse bioactive elements, including proteins, polyunsaturated fatty acids,
    polysaccharides, dietary fibres, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals, making them
    a valuable food resource [3]. Due to their nutritional and medicinal advantages,
    mushrooms have gained widespread popularity worldwide in recent years. Global
    mushroom production has jumped 21.3 times since 1990, reaching 44 million tons
    in 2021 [7]. Various research works have predicted that the worldwide mushroom
    market will achieve a volume of 24.05 million tons by 2028 [21]. These statistics
    demonstrate that mushrooms are a natural resource experiencing growing demand
    annually. Considering this information, various cultivation methods have been
    created by preserving traditional practices or incorporating technological advancements.
    Some research has shown that implementing innovative cultivation techniques in
    mushroom farming can boost production to meet the annual demand figures. The significance
    of mushrooms in sustaining human life is underscored in earlier sections, emphasizing
    the role of technology in enhancing agricultural productivity and highlighting
    the importance of technology, particularly the IoT, as a solution to enhance efficiency
    in agriculture, leading to the development of intelligent crop production systems.
    This study applies IoT to intelligently monitor the substrate for mushroom cultivation
    based on the features of existing works, such as sensor integration, digital data
    transmission, and wireless sensor networks. These technologies enable diverse
    devices, fostering IoT implementation in agriculture. Intelligent irrigation,
    optimized fertilizer usage, pest control, and water and soil quality monitoring
    are among the practices benefiting from IoT applications [41]. Wireless Sensor
    Networks facilitate crop monitoring and intelligent agricultural applications
    by enabling long-distance communication and enhancing energy efficiency [51].
    Monitoring technologies within IoT solutions play a crucial role in ensuring food
    safety and quality. Furthermore, IoT-based solutions establish information networks
    for effective decision-making and product management for crops and the entire
    agricultural supply chain. Integrating networks, sensors, and data processing
    offers water-use solutions, especially in regions with limited water resources.
    This leads to water conservation and food security. IoT technology also provides
    real-time information, reduces labor, enhances productivity in planting activities,
    and promotes efficient water usage. Furthermore, the impact of this information
    extends to the utilization of lighting, pumps, and agricultural machinery [41].
    FL is an approach to reasoning that relies on approximations and assumptions,
    mirroring human thought processes. FL-based algorithms have extensive applications
    in areas like data hiding based on adaptability [17,46], automation of production
    lines [37], and digital images forensics with steganalysis [15,16]. FL represents
    an improvement over Boolean logic by introducing the concept of partial truth
    [45]. FL, on the other hand, incorporates the highest Boolean logic value with
    a degree of truth ranging between 0 and 1. One of the critical advantages of FL
    is its departure from classical logic, enabling the direct utilization of expert
    knowledge without the need for extensive training. It also integrates seamlessly
    with conventional control methods rooted in natural language [10]. It is crucial
    to note that FL is known for its superior energy efficiency compared to classical
    logic [6]. Applying FL, which involves setting a threshold value for the desired
    parameter unit to regulate the environmental factors in agricultural crop cultivation,
    specific parameters are defined as reference points for the implementation and
    tailored to the individual sensors utilized in the test area. Typically, FL is
    integrated into agricultural machinery automation systems to administer treatments
    based on the derived decisions. Based on the in-depth analysis, this research
    proposes a new IoT-based smart system using FL to manage the environmental parameters
    of the mushroom cultivation substrate. The proposed system incorporates sensors
    such as light intensity and infrared sensors to gather more comprehensive information
    aligning with the specific needs of mushroom plants to regulate parameters like
    lighting levels and manage the presence of insects, which significantly affect
    mushroom production. 3. Methodology This section outlines the overall approach
    and fundamental principles of the model under consideration. It comprises five
    crucial subsections that detail the proposed system''s important features. In
    this article, we employ FL to self-regulate the vital parameters within the mushroom
    substrate to improve the existing methods based on traditional human-controlled
    methods. 3.1. Workflow overview of the proposed model This subsection provides
    comprehensive details of the proposed model''s workflow in Fig. 1. The proposed
    model mainly comprises sensors, actuators, and cloud components. It is worth noting
    that the proposed model delves into a detailed examination of the various modules
    employed, elucidating their contributions to the overall functionality of the
    proposed method. Download : Download high-res image (351KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Comprehensive architecture of the proposed method. The
    system is crafted using two microcontrollers, with the primary microcontroller,
    NodeMCU ESP8266, serving as the central hub for data acquisition and embedded
    FL control. Simultaneously, the secondary microcontroller, Arduino UNO, is dedicated
    to disseminating information to farmers through a web-based platform. Additionally,
    specific sensors tailored to the environmental control needs of mushroom plants
    have been chosen. These sensors are connected to the main microcontroller, which
    reads and processes data. The gathered data are compiled into data packets before
    being transmitted and then uploaded to a digital platform. The schematic circuit
    for the designed system is illustrated in Fig. 2. As previously described, the
    main microcontroller incorporates FL to autonomously determine the treatment and
    decision-making in managing the environmental control process. The user can control
    all these parameters based on the real-time data recorded concerning the soil
    moisture, temperature, humidity and light intensity. Download : Download high-res

    proposed method. 3.2. Data collection To collect the data, this work uses the
    sensor unit. The sensors unit comprises dedicated sensors designed to focus on
    specific parameters established as references in this work. These sensors encompass
    a soil moisture meter, a light sensor for measuring light intensity levels, a
    temperature and humidity measuring sensor for recording ambient temperature and
    humidity, and a motion detection sensor. Calibration has been conducted on all
    sensors to avoid acquiring irrelevant data values that could result in irregularities
    during the operational process. 3.2.1. Soil moisture sensing The chosen sensor
    for measuring soil moisture content is the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor v1.2.
    This selection is based on its capability to measure soil moisture levels using
    capacitive sensing. Constructed with corrosion-resistant materials and coated
    with a layer of PCB paint, this sensor offers an extended service life and an
    aesthetically pleasing appearance. Its operation involves measuring changes in
    capacitance resulting from variations in soil electrolyte content. With an operating
    voltage range of approximately 3.3 to 5.5 V, the sensor is well-suited for application
    with microcontrollers that typically output low voltages, such as 3.3 V or 5 V,
    as used in this work. 3.2.2. Light intensity sensing This work employs a module-based
    Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) to measure light intensity levels. The rationale
    behind selecting this module is the work''s preference for output in the form
    of an analog value regarding light intensity levels, and this module is more straightforward
    to implement. As its name implies, this sensor relies on a resistor whose resistance
    value can vary based on the received light levels. This module operates at a compatible
    voltage, making it suitable for integration into this project. The module can
    capture light intensity levels ranging from 0.1 to 10,000 lux. On the other hand,
    this sensor''s resistance value spans 0.1 to 1000 kΩ. Additionally, it can function
    within a temperature range of −60 to 75 Celsius, aligning with the optimal temperature
    and humidity conditions for mushrooms, maintaining elevated humidity levels and
    lower temperature levels. 3.2.3. Temperature and humidity sensing The optimal
    temperature required for mushroom cultivation ranges from 22 to 28 Celsius, while
    the optimal air humidity ranges from 80 % to 90 % [38]. Therefore, the DHT22 sensor
    is employed to measure the air temperature and humidity levels. Its use of a calibrated
    digital signal output enhances its effectiveness. Moreover, its low voltage requirement
    underscores the sensor''s suitability, operating within the 3.3 to 6 V DC range.
    The sensor exhibits a measurement range of 0–100 % for air humidity, with an accuracy
    of +-2 %, and −40 to 80 Celsius for temperature, with an accuracy of 0.5 degrees
    Celsius difference. Notably, the sensor demonstrates responsive performance, boasting
    an average sensing period of 2 s. These attributes make the DHT22 sensor a promising
    choice for implementing intelligent agricultural environmental control processes.
    3.2.4. Motion detection sensing Detecting the presence of insects is a crucial
    consideration in all stages of crop cultivation. Farmers can identify the presence
    of insects using a sensor known as the Passive Infrared Receiver (PIR), with the
    HC-SR501 PIR sensor specifically employed in this work. This module detects the
    levels of infrared radiation the embedded pyroelectric module receives. The sensor
    exhibits noteworthy sensitivity, featuring an adjustable sensitivity range and
    a detection area angle of approximately 110 degrees from the sensor knob. Moreover,
    it can detect movement between 3 and 7 m perpendicularly. Despite its capabilities,
    the sensor is power-efficient, requiring only a low power supply within the range
    of 5 to 12 V and accommodating temperatures from −15 to 70 Celsius. These attributes
    make the sensor highly suitable for the requirements of this work. 3.3. Data processing
    The data processing is mainly based on the controlling unit. For the controller
    unit of this study, two microcontrollers are employed, each with distinct roles.
    Both microcontrollers are supplied with a working voltage of 9 V using a power
    supply. This facilitates the implementation of the designed tool, allowing direct
    connection to electricity with a higher voltage range of 220–240 V. The primary
    microcontroller reads and processes data from each sensor, enabling automatic
    decision-making to maintain optimal farm environmental conditions based on the
    implemented FL. The Arduino UNO R3 is the chosen controller for this processing
    task. The selection is based on the specific pin requirements for this project,
    where two analog pins and ten digital pins are necessary. The two analog pins
    are utilized to interface with the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor and LDR Sensor,
    as the data processing for these sensors rely on acquiring analog values. Additionally,
    the ten digital pins serve various purposes. Two are allocated for connecting
    the DHT22 and PIR sensors, two receivers (RX) and a Transmitter (TX) establish
    communication with other microcontrollers, and the remaining six are designated
    for connecting relays with six channels. Given the inherent incapacity of the
    main microcontroller, Arduino UNO R3, to establish an internet connection, an
    additional microcontroller is employed to facilitate data upload to the internet
    in this work. This component is called NodeMCU ESP8266, featuring an embedded
    ESP8266 WiFi Module chip that enables seamless internet connectivity. By utilizing
    this embedded chip, this module assumes the role of an agent responsible for executing
    the data upload process to the chosen web-based digital platform. Consequently,
    it facilitates the real-time presentation of agricultural land data to farmers.
    3.4. Cloud platform As previously mentioned, using two microcontrollers accommodates
    all acquired sensor data. It facilitates its upload to a web-based digital platform
    named ThingerIO. The data obtained by Arduino UNO R3 is transmitted to NodeMCU
    ESP8266 through serial communication. This communication is established by reverse
    interconnecting each module''s RX and TX pins. On the Arduino UNO microcontroller,
    pin D0 is the RX, and pin D1 is the TX. In contrast, on the NodeMCU ESP8266 microcontroller,
    pin D6 is designated as the RX and D7 as the TX. The data transmission initiates
    with NodeMCU ESP8266 initializing a data request through the serial transmission
    of a specific character to Arduino UNO R3. Subsequently, Arduino UNO R3 continually
    checks for requests at intervals of 2 s. Upon detecting a data request, Arduino
    UNO R3 consolidates the sensor data into a single packet. Then, it transmits it
    to NodeMCU ESP8266 via serial communication. 3.5. System functionality This section
    provides a comprehensive overview of the design and functionality of the proposed
    system. It delves into the intricacies of the system''s architecture, elucidating
    the operation of FL within specified parameter boundaries established in this
    study. Fig. 3 illustrates the system''s overall workflow, outlining the specifics
    of input segmentation derived from various sensors. The process includes a detailed
    examination of microcontrollers and the integration of FL, ultimately resulting
    in automated and intelligent monitoring control. Download : Download high-res

    to pin A0 on the Arduino UNO R3 using analog pins. Consequently, the data displayed
    on the Arduino is initially in the form of raw analog data, which is then transformed
    into a percentage format using the map() function, designating 0 as the lower
    limit and 100 as the upper limit. This conversion results in a final percentage
    value for the Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor within the 0–100 per cent range.
    Similarly, the LDR sensor is connected to pin A2 on the Arduino UNO R3, and its
    initial output is raw analog data. A formula derived from the calibration process
    is applied to convert this value into lux, utilizing the coefficient values obtained
    from a previously conducted linear regression. The × value represents this equation''s
    analog data obtained from the LDR. The DHT22 is linked to pin D4 on the Arduino
    UNO R3 for digital pins. With the assistance of the available library, incorporating
    the DHT22 sensor into the system is a straightforward process. The acquired data
    from the DHT22 sensor provides direct outputs in degrees Celsius for temperature
    and percentage values for humidity. Moving on to the next sensor, PIR, is connected
    to pin D3 on the Arduino UNO R3. In the program, this sensor is designated as
    a digital input value. It is solely utilized to display acquisition data within
    the ``high'''' and ``low'''' value ranges. The other digital pin connects two
    relays, each comprising 4 and 2 channels, with each relay point linked to pins
    D6-D11 on the Arduino UNO R3. In addition, for the power requirements of all the
    modules, this work does not establish a direct connection between the sensors''
    two power pins (GND and VCC) and relays with the power pin on the Arduino UNO
    R3. Instead, these pins are directly linked to the primary 9 V power source obtained
    from the power supply, which has been reduced to a 5 V voltage using a 3296 step-down
    module. 3.5.2. Decision making The actuation decision in the mushroom farm depends
    on the output from the Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The implementation of Fuzzy
    Logic (FL) is utilized to produce appropriate output based on the given input.
    This study involves five input parameters: soil moisture (Moist), light intensity
    (Light), temperature (Temp), humidity (Hum), and motion detection (Mot). Each
    parameter has a distinct number of memberships based on the specific characteristics
    of the variable it represents. Soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection,
    and humidity typically have three memberships (low, medium, and high) using a
    triangular membership function to capture the varying states relevant to the desired
    ranges. Light intensity is set to have four memberships (very low, low, medium,
    and high) utilizing a trapezoidal membership function, allowing for more nuanced
    categories that align with the specific illumination needs in the mushroom farm.
    For all parameters, the choice of memberships is tailored to the inherent complexities
    and variations of each parameter, enabling the fuzzy logic system to effectively
    model the intricacies of the monitored conditions in applications like smart farming
    or agriculture. In essence, the preference for triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions arises from their simplicity, ease of interpretation, and ability to
    accurately model the gradual and non-linear transitions inherent in agricultural
    and environmental parameters. While other membership functions like Gaussian,
    bell-shaped, or sigmoidal can be employed, their suitability depends on the specific
    characteristics of the parameters being modeled. Gaussian functions, for instance,
    are adept at representing symmetric and bell-shaped distributions but may not
    be as intuitive for the gradual transitions seen in agriculture. Similarly, bell-shaped
    functions may be suitable for certain parameters with a well-defined peak. However,
    they might not capture the asymmetry found in soil moisture or air temperature
    transitions. Sigmoidal functions, known for gradual transitions, may lack the
    flexibility needed to represent the specific ranges and categories vital in the
    mushroom cultivation context. The choice of triangular and trapezoidal membership
    functions for soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, humidity, and
    light intensity in the context of mushroom cultivation proves advantageous due
    to their ability to accurately capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of environmental
    conditions. Triangular membership functions are well-suited for parameters like
    soil moisture, air temperature, motion detection, and humidity, as they allow
    for a smooth and gradual transition between low, medium, and high levels. This
    is crucial in representing the continuous and variable characteristics of these
    parameters in mushroom cultivation. Trapezoidal membership functions, on the other
    hand, provide a more flexible and detailed representation, particularly suitable
    for light intensity. In mushroom farming, where lighting conditions are pivotal
    for different growth stages, the trapezoidal function''s additional category allows
    for a more refined categorization of illumination levels. Triangular and trapezoidal
    membership functions offer precision, flexibility, and adaptability, making them
    superior choices for modeling the intricacies of the monitored conditions in smart
    mushroom farming. Drawing on the insights presented in [43], this research introduces
    a three-membership model for soil moisture, aiming to categorize moisture content
    into low, medium, and high ranges. A low soil moisture level (0 % to 30 %) suggests
    drier conditions that may hinder optimal mushroom growth. The medium soil moisture
    category (25 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range conducive to various stages
    of mushroom development. Conversely, high soil moisture (60 % to 100 %) indicates
    excessive wetness, posing challenges such as waterlogging and heightened vulnerability
    to diseases. Extending this methodology to air temperature, a three-membership
    model is applied. Low air temperature (0 °C to 15 °C) signals cooler conditions
    that might slow down mushroom development. The medium air temperature category
    (10 °C to 25 °C) supports diverse growth stages, from mycelium colonization to
    fruiting body formation. Conversely, high air temperature (20 °C to 30 °C) requires
    careful management to avoid heat stress. Furthermore, based on insights from [25],
    a three-membership model is employed for humidity. Low humidity (0 % to 50 %)
    suggests that drier conditions are less favorable for optimal mushroom growth.
    The medium humidity category (40 % to 70 %) represents a balanced range supporting
    various mushroom development stages. Conversely, high humidity (60 % to 100 %)
    indicates excess moisture, posing challenges like increased susceptibility to
    diseases and issues related to waterlogged substrate. Aligning with motion detection
    and light intensity, referenced by Sun et al., low motion detection indicates
    minimal movement, the standard condition during cultivation. Medium motion detection
    suggests occasional disturbances, while high motion detection indicates undesirable
    continuous motion in a controlled mushroom cultivation environment. Finally, regarding
    light intensity, this research employs a four-membership model to define distinct
    illumination levels. Very low light intensity (0 to 500 lux) is suitable for specific
    phases like spore germination. Low light intensity (400 to 1000 lux) caters to
    mycelium growth. Medium-light intensity (800 to 2000 lux) is conducive to various
    growth stages, including fruiting body formation. High light intensity (1500 to
    5000 lux) supports intense lighting conditions beneficial for mushroom maturation.
    The implementation of FL entails connecting the input values gathered from all
    sensors, which are then employed to ascertain the output values following a predefined
    set of rules (see Table 1). To achieve this, a series of if-then rules are devised
    to work in conjunction with the membership function of each parameter. The Mamdani''s
    type is chosen in this work due to its suitability for the proposed approach.
    In this context, the fuzzy output translates into the automation of various paired
    actuators. Table 1. Proposed fuzzy logic rules. IF soil moisture AND air temperature
    AND humidity AND motion detection AND light intensity THEN action Low (0–30 %)

    humidity, Stop motion, Decrease light intensity Fig. 4 represents the design of
    this FL flow, focusing on how it is optimized. The optimization of fuzzy parameters
    in the proposed model involves a meticulous process tailored to each environmental
    parameter. Soil moisture, air temperature, humidity, motion detection, and light
    intensity are systematically categorized into appropriate membership functions
    and ranges. For soil moisture, a three-membership model is employed, with specific
    ranges such as low moisture (0 % to 30 %) hindering optimal growth and high moisture
    (60 % to 100 %) indicating excess wetness. Air temperature, humidity, and motion
    detection follow similar optimization, aligning temperature and humidity ranges
    with different growth stages. Download : Download high-res image (256KB) Download

    categories reflect the standard and undesirable movement during cultivation. Notably,
    light intensity is optimized with a four-membership model, allowing for precise
    categorization suited to the level of light needed in the mushroom farm. Following
    the data acquisition of these parameters, the subsequent step in the FL workflow
    involves fuzzification. Here, each parameter''s input value is adapted to conform
    with the established FL rules. This fuzzification process occurs within the rule
    evaluation segment, where several fuzzy membership rules are integrated. The outcome
    of this phase undergoes a defuzzification process, resulting in a fuzzy output
    value readable by the device and ready for further management to operate the connected
    actuator. 3.5.3. System monitoring This section details how sensor-acquired data
    becomes immediately accessible to farmers. The Arduino UNO R3 microcontroller
    oversees the data acquisition, packaging the dataset for transmission to the data-uploading
    microcontroller. Following receiving data from the Arduino UNO R3, the NodeMCU
    ESP8266 executes the data upload process to the web-based digital platform. The
    NodeMCU ESP8266 is configured to receive a Service Set Identifier (SSID) connection
    exclusively from a specific access point, as it can only connect to the singular
    SSID designated in the program. An LED indicator signifies a successful internet
    connection for the module. Once the NodeMCU ESP8266 receives the data, the subsequent
    step involves breaking down the data based on the acquisition from each sensor.
    After this breakdown, the data upload process unfolds on the digital platform.
    A deliberate delay is incorporated between each data upload event to prevent the
    potential occurrence of a data upload process deemed spam. The digital platform
    interface uses numeric, gauge, and graphical representations. Numerical and gauge-based
    information is consolidated within one feature, while graphical displays are presented
    separately. Each graph''s x-label provides detailed time information, while the
    y-label indicates specific data acquisition details. The x-label on each graph
    is intentionally designed with varying time intervals. For instance, the graphs
    depicting soil moisture, light intensity, and air humidity display data every
    5 s, while the graph for air temperature is programmed to show data every 30 s.
    This adjustment is made considering the responsiveness of the temperature changes,
    which necessitate a longer time frame compared to other parameters. 4. Result
    and discussion In this section, we present the results obtained and their related
    discussions. It is important to note that the features of the proposed method
    are based on its ability to assess soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity,
    and light intensity and identify the presence of insects. In line with the validation
    of the results, calibration is essential to verify that each sensor employed as
    a data retrieval module adheres to established measurement standards. Moreover,
    to provide the proposed method''s context and validate the findings, the preliminaries
    of this section consist of comparing the proposed mushroom cultivation model with
    baseline models as reported by Sun et al. [43] and Dela Cruz and De Leon [20].
    Table 2 presents a comparative analysis of baseline models commonly employed in
    mushroom cultivation, including Open Field Cultivation, Automated Watering Systems,
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control. Each
    model is briefly characterized by its main features, outlining the strengths and
    limitations of these existing methodologies. The proposed new model, IoT and Fuzzy
    Logic-based Control is introduced as a comprehensive advancement. It integrates
    IoT for real-time data acquisition and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control.
    This integration aims to optimize environmental conditions for mushroom growth,
    addressing the shortcomings observed in the baseline models. Table 2. Comparison
    of the proposed model with benchmark algorithms. Model Main features Open field
    cultivation Traditional method with limited control over environmental parameters.
    Automated watering system Enhances water management but lacks adaptive control
    based on real-time conditions. Sensor network-based environment control Provides
    real-time data but may not adapt dynamically to varying cultivation needs. IoT-based
    environment control Offers remote monitoring and control but may require more
    sophisticated decision-making. Proposed IoT and fuzzy logic-based control Integrates
    IoT for real-time data and fuzzy logic for adaptive and nuanced control, optimizing
    environmental conditions for mushroom growth. The proposed IoT and Fuzzy Logic-based
    control model represents a significant advancement in mushroom cultivation methodologies,
    surpassing the capabilities of the baseline models in several key aspects. While
    traditional Open Field Cultivation and Automated Watering Systems offer basic
    approaches, they lack the adaptability and precision required for optimal growth.
    Sensor Network-based Environment Control and IoT-based Environment Control models
    provide real-time data. However, the former may not dynamically adapt, and the
    latter may face challenges in sophisticated decision-making. In contrast, our
    proposed model combines the strengths of IoT for continuous, real-time data acquisition
    and fuzzy logic for adaptive, nuanced control. This integration enables the system
    to make precise, context-aware adjustments based on the complex interplay of environmental
    variables, fostering an optimized and responsive cultivation environment. By leveraging
    these modern technologies, the comprehensive and advanced nature of our approach
    positions it as a valuable and innovative contribution to the field, poised to
    elevate the standards of mushroom cultivation practices. 4.1. Results based on
    sensor precision The soil moisture sensor undergoes calibration by obtaining analog
    values at two humidity levels: very wet (immersing the sensor in water) and dry
    (placing the sensor in a dry location). Subsequently, the map function is employed
    to convert the analog values into percentage values. Following this, calibration
    is executed using the Gouevn Soil Moisture Meter, comparing values acquired at
    four water depth points: 25 ml, 50 ml, 75 ml, and 100 ml. The outcomes of the
    soil moisture sensor calibration are detailed in Table 3. Post-calibration, the
    average error value is 4,79 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 95,21 %. Table

    error 4,79 Accuracy 95,21 In contrast to other sensors, the calibration procedure
    for this sensor involves comparing the reading from the reference sensor with
    the analog-to-analog-to-digital converter (ADC) value acquired. The Digital Lux
    Meter AS803 serves as the reference sensor in this process. The coefficient value
    is derived and then applied to the Arduino UNO R3 using the linear regression
    function. The x-value represents the ADC value from the sensor. At the same time,
    the y-value corresponds to the lux value determined through the comparative analysis.
    Like the previous step, the calibration is executed by re-evaluating and converting
    ADC values to lux values on the Light Dependent Resistor sensor against the digital
    readings on the reference measuring device. In this instance, the average error
    is 3,62 %, indicating a high accuracy level of 96,38 %. The outcomes of the light-dependent
    resistor sensor calibration are detailed in Table 4. The calibration of the DHT22
    involves comparing it with the Sanfix TH-308A. The data collection, performed
    nine times, includes air temperature measurements ranging from 16 to 40 degrees
    Celsius. Additionally, air humidity levels are measured using the Ultrasonic Humidifier
    Support Arduino module to manipulate humidity levels. Like the prior sensors,
    calibration is achieved by computing the average error value, resulting in a 97,33
    % accuracy for air temperature measurements and a 97,85 % accuracy for air humidity
    measurements, with an average error of 2,67 % for air temperature measurements
    and 2,15 % for air humidity measurements. The outcomes of the DHT22 sensor calibration

    overall system A crucial element in intelligent mushroom cultivation involves
    a real-time regulation of vital parameters in the farming space. This method benefits
    from the FL paradigm by optimizing the environmental parameters, ensuring favorable
    conditions for cultivation, and achieving high-quality productivity in mushroom
    farming. The FL program makes decisions to oversee multiple actuators, aiding
    in executing environmental control tasks for the mushroom farm. The evaluation
    process entails subjecting each measurement parameter to manipulated conditions
    and comparing it with sensor data. This work seeks to omit a timeframe for implementing
    FL to avoid excessive decision-making, significantly leading to potential overtreatment.
    The monitoring procedure is conducted using a web-based system with a sample interface
    illustrated in Fig. 5, which consists of a display accessible to farmers on a
    real-time basis. The interface gauge for soil moisture and air humidity depicts
    data in percentage units (%), ranging from a minimum value of 0 to a maximum value
    of 100. In contrast, the design of the interface gauge for light intensity differs.
    It presents data in lux units, with a minimum value of 58 lux (equivalent to a
    value of 1023 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor) for dark conditions and a maximum
    value of 500 lux (equivalent to a value of 6 ADC on a Light Dependent Resistor)
    for bright conditions. The interface gauge for air temperature displays data in
    centigrade units, with a defined minimum value of 14 degrees Celsius and a maximum
    value of 40 degrees Celsius. Download : Download high-res image (483KB) Download

    information through an interface gauge, we have also incorporated information
    delivery to farmers through a graph, as depicted in Fig. 6. In this context, the
    graph serves as a data logger within a specified time frame. The x-axis of the
    graph represents time, while the y-axis displays data obtained from each sensor.
    We set one minute for soil moisture, air humidity, and light intensity graphs,
    with data appearing every five seconds. In the case of the air temperature graph,
    a period of three minutes is defined, with data appearing every thirty seconds.
    Graphs with one minute allow a precise observation of line level changes when
    the sensor registers data outside the reference range. In essence, FL can promptly
    provide information for decision-making on each actuator to execute environmental
    control in less than five seconds. Download : Download high-res image (664KB)

    Besides the features comparison, it is worth noting that the number of monitored
    farm''s vital parameters consists of significant results to take care of to highlight
    the relevance and significance of the engineering findings, which emphasize the
    contribution of the proposed method in the current research landscape. Table 7
    offers a nuanced evaluation of the proposed method alongside existing state-of-the-art
    approaches. Beyond the conventional features comparison, the introduction underscores
    the significance of the number of monitored vital parameters as a pivotal metric
    for highlighting the engineering findings'' relevance and importance in the current
    research landscape. Based on the table data, it is evident that the proposed method
    stands out prominently. It excels in monitoring a comprehensive set of 5 vital
    parameters, surpassing the more limited scopes of the approaches outlined by Rahman
    et al. and Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45]. This expanded range implies a heightened
    capacity to capture diverse facets of the mushroom cultivation environment, enhancing
    the depth and richness of the data collected. Table 7. Comparison of the results.

    number of 6 actuating tools. This surpasses the comparatively lower tool count
    in the methods presented by Rahman et al. [38] and Thong-un and Wongsaroj [45].
    The greater number of actuating tools signifies a more sophisticated and versatile
    control mechanism, suggesting a higher degree of precision and adaptability in
    steering the farming of the mushroom environment. Crucially, the proposed method
    shares with Thong-un & Wongsaroj [45] the ability to monitor in real-time. This
    capability is recognized as essential for dynamic and responsive control, ensuring
    timely adjustments to changing conditions. In contrast, Rahman et al. [38] and
    Chandrappa et al. [12] lack this critical feature, potentially limiting their
    effectiveness in adapting to the rapidly evolving dynamics of the mushroom cultivation
    setting. The results prove that the proposed method emerges as a pioneering contribution
    to the current research landscape. Its prowess in monitoring an extensive array
    of vital parameters, utilizing a higher number of actuating tools, and facilitating
    real-time monitoring underscores its potential to revolutionize the field. 5.
    Conclusion Mushroom cultivation technology is a structured framework for overseeing
    and homogenizing the mushroom farm''s substrate environmental parameters. This
    study concentrates on the cultivation of mushrooms sharing a range of environmental
    parameters, where growth dynamics are contingent upon various physical factors,
    such as temperature, light, and humidity. Numerous research endeavors have explored
    intelligent systems in mushroom cultivation, particularly focusing on automating
    temperature and air humidity control through watering systems. Despite these efforts,
    there remains an oversight of other crucial factors in mushroom plant cultivation.
    For instance, managing light exposure, addressing insect disruptions, and utilizing
    natural or artificial lights are critical environmental considerations that significantly
    impact the quality of edible mushrooms before and after harvest. These factors
    are vital in influencing mycelium characteristics, such as growth rate, density,
    color, and the physical appearance of fruiting bodies, including stalk, cap, and
    color formation. It is crucial to emphasize light''s pivotal role in the cultivation
    of edible mushrooms. Additionally, research has identified the presence of insects,
    mites, crustaceans, and other arthropods feeding on mushrooms and decomposers
    on synthetic or wooden substrates as detrimental factors affecting the optimal
    growth of mushrooms. Consequently, there is a compelling need to advance agricultural
    technologies by considering all critical factors, enhancing both the quality and
    quantity of mushroom production. This study aims to address challenges in current
    mushroom production by developing an IoT-based system. The system integrates various
    modules to intelligently control crucial parameters, including temperature, humidity,
    substrate moisture, and light intensity. Moreover, the system incorporates a mechanism
    for pest control by automatically spraying pesticides when an external agent is
    detected in the mushroom farm. Fuzzy Logic (FL) is integrated into the IoT module,
    allowing the recorded sensor data to enable system functionality based on comparisons
    with pre-recorded standard data, defining optimal ranges for each vital parameter.
    The system activates actuators when sensor data falls outside the desired range,
    effectively maintaining the environmental parameters within optimal conditions
    for mushroom cultivation. Importantly, this method introduces self-decision-making
    through FL, a mathematical modeling technique emulating human decision-making.
    The contributions of this work include intelligent and adaptive monitoring of
    sensor data for creating an optimal environment for mushroom cultivation, as well
    as the optimization of agricultural resources, such as water and pesticides, through
    the introduction of previously unused sensors. Diversifying this method allows
    for a nuanced understanding of environmental factors applicable to various types
    of mushrooms within the field of mushroom cultivation. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: An optimized irrigation system maximizes agricultural productivity,
    ensures efficient water use, and reduces off-site effects caused by excess percolation
    of water. To address the problems associated with conventional irrigation systems,
    a drip irrigation system that is based on Internet of Things (IoT) technology
    for automation of irrigation scheduling was developed and tested for Egg Plant
    (Brinjal) crop in vertisols. The study compared crop performance under two different
    drip irrigation systems - one based on IoT and the other based on crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc). An intelligent data collection system, including sensors and a microcontroller
    was used in the experiment to monitor relative humidity, soil temperature, air
    temperature, and soil moisture content. The sensors collect data wirelessly transmitted
    to a cloud server via the IoT, allowing worldwide access from anywhere. The performance
    of the egg plant crop revealed significantly higher plant height and crop yield
    (12.05%) under a drip irrigation system utilizing IoT technology, which could
    be due to the optimum and timely application of water over ETc-based drip irrigation.
    Along with improved crop performance, water savings of 35.2% were observed as
    compared to ETc-based drip irrigation. The developed system can be evaluated in
    a large field with several sensors together along with a mobile app for a user-friendly
    system.

    In this work, the objective is to identify the source of leaf wetness on the leaf

    I. Introduction Crops and plants are prone to attack by various diseases and pests.
    These attacks are detrimental to the quality of crops produced and, subsequently,
    to the livelihood of the farmers. According to the literature, diseases, pests,
    and weeds contribute to 36% loss of crops [1]. The foremost cause of frequent
    plant diseases is a lack of supervision and monitoring. To overcome this challenge,
    advanced sensors based technology could be employed to install a supervision system
    in place. Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensor technology is one of the leading
    solutions to monitor and keep track of the plant growth environment. Sensor signals
    along with machine learning algorithms have been shown to create robust disease
    detection and prediction systems [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. To abate crop loss due
    to diseases, researchers have proposed various disease warning systems. A few
    essential parameters for these models are leaf wetness duration (LWD), ambient
    temperature, and relative humidity [7], [8], [9]. The presence of water molecules
    on the surface of the leaves, paired with suitable ambient temperature and relative
    humidity, enables the germination of fungal diseases on the leaf canopy [10].
    Therefore, consistent measurement of LWD plays a crucial role in developing a
    sound disease prediction model. Researchers have explored various types of leaf
    wetness sensors (LWSs) out of which electronic LWS is deemed suitable for in situ
    measurements [10]. A lack of standard measurement practices has affected the in
    situ estimation of LWD values. In this work, an in-house affordable, temperature-compensated
    LWS has been used, which has been reported in our earlier works [11]. It highlights
    the key features of the novel LWS. The IoT-based sensor system enables remote
    sensing of the field parameters; thus, the system would work autonomously. The
    source of leaf wetness could be a valuable insight for predicting diseases. It
    would help farmers identify the cause of leaf wetness and enable them to take
    instant preventive measures. In a remote setting, the output from LWS can be used
    to determine the cause of moisture on the surface of the leaves. As suggested
    in [44], dew, rainfall, or irrigation are the plausible sources of wetness on
    the leaf canopy. In this work, these three causes of leaf wetness have been accounted
    for dew, rainfall, and irrigation. The LWS used in this work generates a frequency
    output corresponding to the presence of water on the leaf surface [44]. If water
    is present on the surface, the frequency declines from the baseline level and
    ascends again once the surface is dry [11]. As mentioned, each event produces
    a different frequency output when subjected to dew, rainfall, and irrigation.
    Therefore, the pattern generated through the frequency output of the LWS provides
    critical insight for detecting the source of wetness on the surface of leaves.
    Pattern recognition is a famous classification and detection technique. It is
    a process wherein the machine tries to classify the data according to the information
    gained from the regu- varieties observed in different types of data. There are
    several applications of pattern recognition like speech recognition, object identification,
    and classification of medical and explosive signals [13], [14], [15], [16], [17],
    [18]. In this work, pattern recognition has been explored for LWS data wherein
    the data points correspond to either dew, rainfall, or irrigation. Syntactic,
    template matching, and statistical models are used for pattern recognition [19].
    The rising popularity of neural networks (NNs) for feature extraction has driven
    researchers to explore NNs for pattern recognition [20]. NN is capable of feature
    extraction from numerical, image, and text-based datasets. Multilayer perceptrons
    (MLPs) are fully connected NN used for pattern recognition [21], [22], [23]. A
    class of NN called convolutional NN (CNN) is widely used for image classification
    [24], [25], [26], [27]. Networks like VGGNet [28], AlexNet [29], and GoogLeNet
    [30] are famous CNN structures used for pattern recognition from image datasets.
    In this work, an ensemble model is proposed, which takes the numerical and image
    data for classifying the source of wetness (dew, rainfall, or irrigation) on the
    plant. Based on the sensor data, this article aims to classify the leaf wetness
    events in one of the three categories: dew, rainfall, or irrigation. LWS data
    plays a crucial role in determining the source of leaf wetness. While the sensor
    produces time-series data, significant information can be extracted from the patterns
    observed in the frequency domain. Therefore, the time-series data has been converted
    to image form using short-time Fourier transform (STFT) and spectrogram representation.
    In addition to LWS, the disease prediction system uses other sensors like ambient
    temperature and relative humidity sensors [11]. These sensors monitor the environmental
    conditions. Rainfall and dew are natural phenomena and are characterized by distinct
    environmental conditions. SECTION II. Materials and Methods A. Sensors System
    and Field Deployment In this work, the LWS and IoT-enabled system have been used,
    which is reported in [11]. Fabricated LWS produces frequency output when subjected
    to the water molecule on its sensing surface. Further, for the temperature and
    humidity measurements, commercial sensors MCP 9710 and HIH 5030 are used, respectively.
    Subsequently, these sensors are interfaced with the in-house developed signal
    conditioning and processing circuits. The data collected from these sensors are
    uploaded to the ThingspeakTM server every 30 min. For the field measurement, fabricated
    LWS was deployed on the Mango tree at 45° angles, as shown in Fig. 1. Further,
    the field measurements are carried out for four months where approximately 5000
    data points are collected. Fig. 1. Deployment of the sensor on the leaves. Show
    All SECTION III. Data Preprocessing The primary focus is to prepare the data for
    classifying the source of wetness on the leaf, which can arise mainly due to dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. This involves feature extraction to identify leaf wetness
    events caused by dew, rainfall, and irrigation. Further, data labeling is done
    for both numerical and image data. Numerical attributes are standardized and fed
    into the MLP model and subsequently image data is transformed into spectrograms,
    which are fed into the CNN model. Data augmentation techniques are applied to
    enhance dataset size and diversity. These processes collectively aim to facilitate
    the accurate classification of leaf wetness events in a dataset comprising 392
    instances of dew, rainfall, and irrigation events, which helps reduce overfitting
    and improve model accuracy. A. Feature Extraction The main objective of this work
    is to determine the cause of leaf wetness by analyzing the patterns generated
    by an LWS. Three distinct events, namely dew, irrigation, and rainfall, can make
    leaves wet. To apply a classification algorithm effectively, it’s crucial to isolate
    and extract these individual wetness events and create training and testing datasets.
    This is achieved by identifying specific points at the start and end of each event
    using the find_peaks function from the sciPy library. This function detects the
    highest values in a 1-D signal within a specified height range. Fig. 2 represents
    the signal with starting and ending points marked using orange and green colors.
    The resulting signal is then divided into separate events, leading to the creation
    of a dataset comprising 98 leaf wetness events, each marked by distinct starting
    and ending points. Fig. 2. Leaf wetness events marked with points. Show All B.
    Data Labeling 1) Tabular Data: In this work, a hybrid model is trained using both
    numerical and image data. Numerical data comprise data from sensors like ambient
    temperature sensors, relative humidity sensors, and LWS. Each wetness event is
    numerically characterized by four features, namely, LWD value, average ambient
    temperature, average relative humidity, and maximum magnitude of frequency. Average
    temperature and humidity values are calculated for the duration of each event,
    and the maximum magnitude of frequency is obtained from the output of LWS. LWD
    values are extracted from the frequency response of LWS after smoothening the
    signal. The procedure followed for calculating LWD values has been reported in
    our previous work [11]. The numerical features corresponding to a single-leaf
    wetness event vary broadly in magnitude. To avoid bias due to differences in the
    range of magnitude during the training process, the features are normalized using
    Minmaxscaler function available in scikit-learn library [33]. After normalization,
    all features would lie within a range of 0–1, eliminating any bias due to their
    magnitude. 2) Image Data: The dataset comprise individual frequency output responses
    corresponding to a particular event. To make it suitable for training a machine
    learning model, it has to be classified appropriately with the cause of the wetness.
    Three possible events are responsible for wetness on the leaves’ surface: dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. For ease of classification, the signal is inverted about
    the y-axis, such that a rise in the magnitude of frequency above baseline frequency
    marks the events. This is denoted by ( ΔF ) as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 3. Isolated
    events from the frequency response of leaf wetness sensor corresponding to (a)
    dew, (b) rainfall, and (c) irrigation. Show All In this work, the time-series
    numerical data from LWS is transformed into image format to leverage the 2-D CNN
    model. CNN is one of the most popular NNs for image classification due to its
    high accuracy [34]. The signal is converted into the frequency domain from the
    time domain using an STFT to convert the numerical data for LWS into image form.
    STFT captures the signal’s frequency components over a small window length of
    256, which is the function’s default size, and tracks them across the duration
    of the signal. STFT of the frequency output of LWS has been computed using the
    scipy library [32]. In doing so, an attempt is made to capture the salient features
    of the patterns observed in the sensor output. These patterns are observed when
    the sensor detects the presence of water on the surface. Fig. 4 represents the
    spectrograms of STFT of the LWS sensor signals. It is evident from the spectrograms,
    as depicted in Fig. 4 that the intensity of frequency components differs for the
    different categories of events viz., dew, rainfall, and irrigation. Therefore,
    these spectrograms could be used for training a CNN-based classification model.
    The images are resized and converted to binary to assist the edge-detection capacity
    of CNN. Fig. 4. STFT spectrograms of leaf wetness sensor data for (a) dew, (b)
    rainfall, and (c) irrigation. Show All The frequency magnitude is the first indicator
    of the possible event that could have caused leaf wetness [44]. Leaf wetness due
    to dew is characterized by a frequency output response with a maximum magnitude
    less than or equal to 4 kHz. Therefore, all events for which the rise in frequency
    ( ΔF ) is less than or equal to 4 kHz are labeled “Dew.” Out of 98 leaf wetness
    events and 13 events for Dew have been obtained. Apart from considering the magnitude
    of the frequency output of LWS, to differentiate between the events due to irrigation
    and rain, a second parameter, LWD has been used. The events with a maximum magnitude
    of frequency greater than 10 kHz or LWD more than 19 h have been labeled as “Rain.”
    Subsequently, the rest of the events were labeled as “Irrigation.” From the given
    signal, 48 events due to rain and 37 events due to irrigation has been observed.
    Fig. 3 shows five signals, each corresponding to the three natural phenomena discussed
    above. The magnitude on the y -axis is under the criteria used to classify the
    events in the appropriate categories. C. Data Augmentation Data augmentation is
    a crucial strategy to prevent overfitting in NNs due to limited data. This study
    is critical because leaf wetness events are uncontrollable. Techniques like horizontal
    flipping and adding random Gaussian noise are applied to image data while preserving
    original patterns. Numerical data are also augmented with Gaussian noise. After
    using these techniques, the dataset grows from 98 to 392 leaf wetness events,
    enhancing the dataset’s size and robustness for machine learning purposes. SECTION
    IV. Proposed Model for Classification In this work, artificial neural network
    (ANN) is an attractive choice because it ensembles NNs that can be built to deal
    with different types of data at the same time. In this work, NN is devolved that
    is capable of learning both numerical data and image data simultaneously. The
    sub-model trained to learn numerical data is an MLP and that trained using the
    image data is a CNN. The model proposed in this work, has been implemented using
    the tensorflow library [36]. A. Multilayer Perceptron MLP is a class of feed-forward
    NNs with fully connected layers. It comprises input and output layers connected
    between multiple hidden layers. In this work, the MLP is supplied by four input
    features—LWD values, average ambient temperature, average relative humidity, and
    maximum magnitude of frequency observed for the event. As mentioned, the three
    types of layers in MLP have neurons responsible for propagating the information
    to the following layer. Fig. 5 shows a descriptive diagram of an MLP (sub-model
    1). The input features are supplied to the input layer. In this work, four features
    are used namely, LWD value, average ambient temperature, average relative humidity,
    and maximum magnitude of frequency. Let the input vector be represented by X i
    for i∈[1,4] . The input is passed on to the hidden layer. The output of the ith
    neuron in the lth hidden layer of MLP, y m [l]i , is the weighted summation of
    its input provided from the preceding hidden layer. The process is called forward
    propagation, accomplished by the following equation [23]: y m [l])i =F( ∑ i=1
    n−1 w m [l]i . a m [l−1]i + b m [l]i ) (1) View Source where w m (l)i and b m
    (l)i are the weight and bias of the neuron, respectively, and a m (l−1)i is the
    activated neuron from the previous layer. The function F(x) is the activation
    function assigned to each layer. For the hidden layers, it is a linear function
    called rectified linear unit (ReLu). This function maximizes the speed of training
    due to less computation and avoids the vanishing gradient problem [37]. In case
    of the input layer a m [l−1]i is replaced with X i . The output vector of MLP
    (sub-model 1) is denoted by Y m . Fig. 5. Proposed model for leaf wetness events
    classification. Show All B. Convolutional Neural Network A CNN was implemented
    for training the image data due to its superior image classification performance.
    CNN models learn by identifying the edges of the images during the training process.
    The convolutional layer is composed of 2-D filters, i.e., kernels, traverse over
    the entire image depending on the size of the kernel. The kernel is a 2-D weight
    matrix. The layer performs convolution of the filter and overlapping input and
    extracts the features of the given image. CNN follows the same process of forward
    propagation, as described in MLP, to transfer the information through the network
    layers. However, in this case, the input images of spectrograms are convolved
    with the filters. It is a multiplication operation on the 2-D input matrices,
    i.e., image and kernel. The following equation defines the convolutional process
    [45]: y c [l]u,v =F( ∑ i=0 p−1 ∑ j=0 q−1 w c [l]i,j . a c (l−1)(u+i),(v+j) + b
    c [l]u,v ). (2) View Source y c (l)u,v is the output of the lth convolutional
    layer at the (u,v) position. The variables w c [l]i,j and a c [l−1](u+i),(v+j)
    are the kernel and input image, respectively. Here, the dimension of the kernel
    is (p×q) . The activation function, F(x) , for intermediate layers is ReLu [37].
    Furthermore, a max-pooling layer is used to prevent over-fitting. The data is
    down-sampled by replacing the output of the convolutional layer with the maximum
    value observed in a particular neighborhood. The MaxPooling2D layer from tensorflow
    implements the max-pooling function [36]. A window of size 3×3 with a stride of
    2 is employed. This operation reduces the dimensions of the data and makes the
    computation much more efficient. An additional layer was added to ensure an effective
    learning process called batchnormalization. The principal objective of this method
    is to normalize the input to the following layer. The batch normalization layer
    from the tensorflow library is added to the model to ensure that the inputs are
    normalized and smooth and that the learning does not suffer due to bias toward
    a specific input owing to nonuniform distribution. Y c denotes the output vector
    of CNN (sub-model 2). C. Training the Hybrid Model The main advantage of the dataset
    collected in this work is data availability from various sensors. While the pattern
    observed in the frequency output of LWS directly corresponds to identifying the
    event that caused wetness on the leaves, the other sensors measuring ambient temperature
    and relative humidity offer critical insights into the environmental conditions
    when the leaf wetness event occurred. These environmental factors could assist
    the model in making a decision. As discussed in Section III-A, the sensor data
    is preprocessed and organized in tabular format. The patterns observed in the
    LWS data are converted to images, as discussed in Section III-B. Fig. 5 illustrates
    the model used to predict the leaf wetness event. The tabular and image data are
    processed parallelly using the first two sub-models. Sub-model 1 is a multilayer
    perceptron described in Section IV-A. It has three hidden layers, each activated
    using a ReLu function. Sub-model 2 is a CNN, as Section IV-B describes, with two
    convolutional and max-pooling layers and a final batch-normalization layer. The
    convolutional layers are activated using the ReLu activation function. The output
    of the two sub-models is concatenated and provided as to the standard NN. The
    connected outcomes can be represented as C=[ Y m , Y c ] T . (3) View Source The
    input passes through the model via forward propagation as described in (1) and
    (2), depending on the sub-model. The two sub-models are responsible for feature
    extraction from the original data received from the sensors. The NNs are adept
    at feature extraction because of their densely connected structure [22]. The sub-model
    outputs are concatenated into a single vector and used further for training. The
    final sub-model denoted in Fig. 5 is responsible for the predictions. The outcome
    of the NN ensemble is obtained from the last layer of the final sub-model. It
    has three neurons corresponding to each leaf wetness event—dew, rainfall, and
    irrigation. The output is the probability of occurrence of the event based on
    the input features. This output is achieved by applying “softmax” as the activation
    function to the output layer [38]. The process finds the normalized exponential
    value for each class σ( c o )= e c o ∑ N j=1 e c j . (4) View Source In the above
    equation, c o is the output value of a neuron for a particular class. The exponential
    divided by the exponential of every neuron in the output layer. Thus, (4) calculates
    the probability of occurrence of one of the events. The model is trained by back-propagation.
    The method aims to minimize the cost function of the prediction by reassigning
    weights. The cost function chosen for training this model is “categorical cross-entropy”
    which is suitable for multiclass classification [38]. In the multiclass category,
    the events belong to only one of the possible classes. The following equation
    represents the loss function: Loss=− ∑ o=1 3 t o log( y o ) (5) View Source where
    t o is the class’s true value, and y o is the predicted probability from the output
    layer, which uses the softmax function. The model has been trained for 200 epochs
    with a batch size of 32 because of the small size of the dataset. This combination
    would converge to a loss value faster. The optimizer used is Adam because of its
    superior performance [39]. Fig. 5 shows the complete ensemble model used in this
    work. SECTION V. Result and Discussion A. Exploratory Data Analysis This section
    uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize data trends. A pie chart in
    Fig. 6 illustrates the distribution of leaf wetness causes, showing that rainfall
    is the most common (about half of the events), followed by irrigation (37.8%)
    and dew (13.3%). The June to October 2021 study aligns with the monsoon season,
    explaining the prevalence of rain-induced leaf wetness. Fig. 6. Pie chart distribution
    of leaf wetness events. Show All B. Model Performance The experiments are conducted
    for various hidden layers and neurons, and it has been found that the best accuracy
    achieved is around 96.13% for the ensemble model. Both model sub-model 1 (MLP)
    and sub-model 2 (CNN) were combined with another NN (final sub-model). As a result,
    the hidden layers are changed and neurons in sub-model 1, sub-model 2, and the
    final sub-model. It has been found that the best layers and neurons are three
    layers and 30-24-16 neurons for sub-model 1, four layers, and 128-64-24-12 neurons
    for sub-model 2 and four layers and 30-24-16 neurons for the final sub-model.
    Table I displays a comparison of many models. The recommended model outperformed
    several techniques in Table I, with an accuracy of 96.13%. TABLE I Comparison
    of Different Models As mentioned in Section IV-C, the ensemble model is trained
    for 200 epochs with a batch size of 32. Fig. 7(a) and (b) shows the training and
    validation accuracy and loss for the proposed model. In this work, the proposed
    model architecture learns from a combination of numerical data and image data.
    The MLP is responsible for learning the numerical tabular data, while the CNN
    learns the image data, as described in Section IV. Fig. 7(b) demonstrates the
    characteristic decline of the loss curve, which validates the learning process.
    The steady decline of the loss curve for validation data indicates learning and
    the absence of overfitting by the model. From Fig. 7(b), it can be observed that
    the ensemble model converges the fastest to the lowest loss value. Fig. 7. (a)

    Show All Fig. 7(c) shows the receiver operating characteristics (ROCs). This curve
    gives information about the classification capability of the trained model. The
    45° reference line shown in Fig. 7(c) denotes a model incapable of differentiating
    between positive and negative outputs. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) graph
    is a point where the true positive rate (TPR) is 1 and the false positive rate
    (FPR) is 0. A good ROC curve is closer to the top left corner and away from the
    45° line. Fig. 7(c) shows three ROC curves, one for each of the classes- dew,
    rainfall, and irrigation. The AUC is an insightful indicator of the model performance.
    AUC measures the model’s capability to differentiate between the classes. In this
    work, the AUC for dew, rainfall, and irrigation is 0.99, 0.95, and 0.97, respectively.
    The output layer of the NN ensemble described in Section IV uses softmax activation
    function which produces a probability of each possible outcome. These probabilities
    are converted to absolute values of 0 or 1, where 0 indicates negative output
    and 1 indicates a positive output. Further, the precision and recall have been
    calculated as tabulated in Table II. Precision is the fraction of predicted positive
    values, which are actually positive the following equation. On the other hand,
    recall is the fraction of actually positive values that have been correctly predicted
    the following equation [43]: Precision Recall = (True Positive) (True Positive+False
    Positive) = (True Positive) (True Positive+False Negative) . (6) (7) View Source
    TABLE II Evaluation Metrics for Classification of Dew, Rainfall, and Irrigation
    Table II gives the precision and recall values for all the events, along with
    the F1 score. The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It measures
    the model’s performance, accounting for the trade-off between precision and recall.
    From Table III, it can be observed that the version of the model is suitable for
    all the events. Slightly less memory is observed for dew. However, it is due to
    the limited number of samples. The average value of the F1 score is 0.8396, which
    signifies a good balance between precision and recall. The significance of a high
    F1 score is that the model can correctly identify the positive data samples. Table
    III presents a comparison of various ensemble models across different applications.
    Researchers have employed the CNN-LSTM model for applications in medical, robotics,
    pedestrian navigation, and e-commerce, while the Darknet19-CNN-LSTM model has
    been utilized for computer vision tasks. In this work, the MLP-CNN model has been
    adopted for agricultural applications and achieved an accuracy of 96.13%. TABLE

    VI. Conclusion Agriculture plays a pivotal role in a country’s economy and methods
    to make it more efficient should be devised. In this work, with the motivation
    of reducing the cost of early plant disease prediction systems, the leaf wetness
    sensor is used to detect the LWS and also the source of wetness on the leaf canopy.
    For this purpose, the data is collected from LWS, ambient temperature sensor,
    and relative humidity sensor. The initial preprocessing and data engineering helped
    us create a dataset that could be used to train a machine-learning model capable
    of predicting the natural event responsible for leaf wetness. The sensors produced
    numerical time series data indicative of the three leaf wetness events- dew, rainfall,
    and irrigation. STFT is applied to the LWS data to obtain an image since the patterns
    obtained in the sensor output for different events are different. Further, an
    MLP-CNN model is built, which is capable of learning from tabular data as well
    as image data simultaneously. The MLP with numerical data produced a satisfactory
    accuracy of 92.86% while the CNN model with image data produced an accuracy of
    62.93% and the ensemble NN (MLP-CNN) classifier produced an accuracy of 96.13%.
    It has been observed that the final model classified the leaf wetness events with
    an average precision and recall of 0.84 and 0.85, respectively. Authors Figures

    systems can waste approximately 60% of water. Using IoT for irrigation based on
    soil moisture can help reduce waste. This study used multidimensional time series

    learningDeep learningAnd statistical method 1. Introduction In 2018, Brazil consumed
    approximately 65 billion cubic meters of water, 50% of this water used for irrigation.1
    However, up to 60% of irrigation water is wasted due to inefficient irrigation
    practices [1]. With the expansion of agriculture and the growing risk of water
    shortages, the development of new irrigation strategies to avoid water waste is
    becoming increasingly important. Technology can play a vital role in addressing
    this challenge by creating efficient irrigation water management systems. An example
    is the Smart Water Management Platform (SWAMP) project, which used intelligent
    tools to manage irrigation plans. The SWAMP platform leverages technologies such
    as the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and data science to offer farmers
    an intelligent strategy to monitor and plan irrigation schedules. The fields can
    be monitored by sensors and drones connected to a management system that receives
    real-time data. All data are processed and stored in the cloud, and historical
    data is used to train forecasting models that predict soil moisture (SM). The
    predictions generated by the models provide valuable information for farmers in
    planning irrigation schedules [2], [3]. Similarly, Amarendra Goap, Deepak Sharma,
    and their team have developed a fully autonomous irrigation system that combines
    IoT, cloud computing, and data science to predict SM levels in real time [4].
    The intelligent system collects data from soil sensors, air, and light radiation
    and uses machine learning models to forecast SM. The output of the model feeds
    into a decision system to control field irrigation. Furthermore, time series forecasting
    has proven applicable in various problem domains in recent years. For example,
    Yassen et al. [5] used time series prediction to predict water flow in Malaysia.
    Their study aimed to improve water management to ensure drinking water for citizens
    and energy production. Sezer, Gudelek, and Ozbayoglu [6] systematically reviewed
    the literature on studies that used time series forecasting to model financial
    time series. These studies applied machine learning and deep learning models to
    predict commodity values such as oil, coffee, and sugar and the values of company
    shares, currencies, and digital coins. Furthermore, Ediger and Akar [7] used time
    series forecasting to model fuel demand in Turkey. On the contrary, Barak and
    Sadegh [8] proposed to model annual energy consumption in Iran using time series
    forecasting. In both studies, the researchers aimed to predict the need for energy
    resources for government planning. Efficient irrigation is essential to ensure
    better water management and the continuity of agricultural production. Esfahani,
    Rua, and McKee [9] described how efficient irrigation prevents soil leaching and
    crop stress from excess water, thus ensuring productive capacity during water
    scarcity. Estimating the future value of the SM variable is essential for irrigation
    planning to ensure adequate water volume for cultivation. Typically, physical
    models that simulate the dynamics of water in the soil over time generate estimates
    for the SM variable [10]. These models require knowledge of soil properties to
    effectively simulate water dynamics in the soil [11]. Furthermore, the evapotranspiration
    of soil water, irrigation, precipitation, and transpiration of the cultivated
    plant are essential factors in estimating the variable SM [12]. There are various
    tools for generating SM estimates using physical models, with HYDRUS software
    being one of the most widely used [13].” A drawback is that obtaining all the
    calibration data from the HYDRUS software can be challenging. Thus, alternative
    approaches, such as time series forecasting with machine learning and deep learning,
    are being explored. Karandish and Simunek [14] compared various time series forecasting
    algorithms to predict SM, using the output model to feed a system that creates
    the irrigation schedule. Esfahani, Rua, and McKee [9] combined machine learning
    and sensor data to create an optimization system for the irrigation process. In
    their work, Goap and Sharma [15] used a regression model to forecast SM. The regression
    model output was then classified using a cluster model to generate a binary output,
    which determined whether to continue the irrigation process. Goldstein and Fink
    [16] utilized machine learning algorithms to predict SM time series, and the resulting
    predictions were used to plan the weekly irrigation strategy. Accurate SM forecasting
    is crucial for intelligent platforms and fully autonomous irrigation systems to
    generate information on irrigation schedules [17]. Applying time series modeling
    for soil moisture forecasting requires careful consideration of many technical
    details. These include the selection of appropriate models, the choice of input
    and window lag variables, and the optimization of parameters. Additionally, the
    accuracy of the forecasts must be evaluated to ensure that the model performs
    as expected. This paper proposes time series modeling of SM data and investigates
    the performance of univariate and multivariate algorithms for forecasting SM.
    Our experiments aim to explore the influence of data window size on algorithm
    performance and compare the performance of traditional algorithms with modern
    ones. We investigate the ideal sample data size required to build an efficient
    model, considering different scenarios of data availability ranging from one to
    twelve months or more. We also examine the impact of updating the fitting model
    on the prediction performance. Finally, we compare the performance of univariate
    and multivariate algorithms in ten datasets from various regions of the world.
    Our goal is to provide information on the performance of different SM forecasting
    algorithms and to identify the most efficient algorithms for this task. 2. Background
    This section presents the background of our research. 2.1. Soil moisture The target
    variable in this study is SM, which represents the amount of water content in
    a soil volume ( ) [18]. The study focuses on investigating the capability of machine
    learning algorithms to forecast future SM values, which is essential to create
    an efficient irrigation schedule. 2.2. Forecasting algorithms We used statistical
    and machine learning algorithms to analyze the SM forecast. Statistical algorithms
    included Naive [19], Vector Autoregression (VAR) [20], Exponential Smoothing (ES)
    [19], and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) [21]. The naive method
    predicts the value of the future series as the last known observation [19]. ES
    predicts future values using weighted averages that exponentially prioritize recent
    samples, assigning them higher weights [19]. The VAR model predicts the future
    value of a series as a linear combination of past values of the target series
    and the series that influence it [20]. On the other hand, the machine learning
    algorithms consisted of Random Forest (RF) [22], Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)
    [23], Neural basis expansion analysis for interpretable time series forecasting
    (N-BEATS) [24], and Spectral Temporal Graph Neural Network for Multivariate Time
    Series Forecasting (StemGNN) [25]. RF is an ensemble technique derived from bagging.
    RF comprises n predictors built using decision trees. It distinguishes itself
    from bagging by introducing random variable selection during predictor construction.
    It enables the algorithm to be trained with diverse input sets, reducing predictor
    variance and improving the accuracy of the final prediction [22]. XGB is a Gradient
    Boosting Machines implementation that incorporates decision trees as weak predictors
    and includes regularization in the cost function to prevent overfitting during
    training [23], [26], [27]. The N-BEATS architecture for univariate time series
    prediction consists of M stacks, which function as an ensemble model similar to
    boosting. Each stack specializes in predicting the residual of the previous stack.
    Stacks are made up of K blocks, which operate similarly. Each block predicts the
    residual of the previous block and comprises two parts: a fully connected neural
    network (FC) with four layers and two single-layer FC neural networks [24]. The
    StemGNN combines Graph Discrete Fourier Transform (GDFT), Discrete Fourier Transform
    (TFD), and deep learning components. StemGNN transforms multivariate time series
    into a multivariate temporal graph in the first layer. It uses a Gated Recurrent
    Unit (GRU) layer to calculate the adjacency matrix W for series computation and
    self-attention. The second layer, StemGNN, involves a GDFT transformation, followed
    by a sequence of operations. It includes TFD, 1D CNN, Gated Linear Unit (GLU),
    and the inverse Fourier transform to capture intraseries patterns. The spectral
    matrix is filtered through a graph-convolutional neural network. The output consists
    of future value predictions and input series reconstruction. The loss function
    optimizes the network parameters by minimizing prediction and reconstruction errors.
    We have designated the Naive and ES models as the univariate baseline and the
    VAR model as the multivariate baseline. We selected the well-known ARIMA algorithm
    [28], [29], [30], [31] to provide a benchmark for statistical time series forecasting.
    We selected N-BEATS, a state-of-the-art algorithm that has demonstrated exceptional
    performance in time series forecasting [24] for deep learning models. To investigate
    decision tree-based models for multivariate time series forecasting, we selected
    RF [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39] and XGB [40], which represent
    ensemble bagging [41] and boosting [40] based on decision tree models, respectively.
    Finally, we explore StemGNN, a cutting-edge deep learning algorithm, as a representative
    for multivariate time series forecasting [25]. 2.3. Data description Throughout
    the work, we used a set of datasets to investigate SM forecasting using various
    algorithms. The Cook Agronomy Farm (CAF) [42] data set was the result of the Long-Term
    Agroecosystem Research Group (LTAR), which consists of researchers associated
    with Washington State University who monitor the soil of an agricultural cultivation
    farm [43]. We also collected nine data sets from the International Soil Moisture
    Network (ISMN) project, an international collaborative initiative to store and
    make available SM records collected from soil monitoring sites worldwide [44].
    Our research comprises two sets of experiments to compare the performance of multivariate
    and univariate algorithms. In the first group of experiments, we focused on evaluating
    the influence of data window size on the performance of multivariate algorithms
    using the CAF dataset. The CAF data set comprises data from 42 sensors installed
    on a farm, divided into 42 zones, each monitored by one sensor. Each sensor records
    SM, temperature, and bulk electrical conductivity at five depths: 0.3, 0.6, 0.9,
    1.2, and 1.5 meters. Additionally, the data set includes daily temperature and
    rainfall data from the nearest meteorological station. Therefore, three new features
    were added to the data set: daily precipitation, maximum daily temperature, and
    minimum daily temperature. The data set contains daily measurements for two years.
    For our experiments, we selected the data generated by the CAF095 sensor and used
    SM, soil temperature, and bulk electrical conductivity from depths of 0.3, 0.6,
    and 0.9 meters. Therefore, our final data set consisted of nine soil features
    and three meteorological features. The second group of experiments focused on
    comparing the performance of multivariate and univariate algorithms on SM forecasts.
    For this purpose, we used ten data sets from different regions worldwide, including
    the CAF data set from the first group. We obtained the other nine data sets from
    the ISMN project, a global initiative that stores and provides access to data
    sets that contain SM records [44]. The ISMN partners monitor SM levels around
    the world and make the data available in the cloud. Table 1 shows the details
    of the location of the data set. Each station monitored air and soil using sensors
    and registered a feature group, generating each data set. Table 2 presents a comprehensive
    list of feature names, corresponding abbreviations, and accompanying descriptions.
    Meanwhile, Table 3 offers an overview of the constituent features of each dataset.

    in terms of the features they included. We selected SM, temperature, precipitation,
    and air temperature as our main features. In some cases, the sensors generated
    SM and soil temperature readings at different depths, and we used both whenever
    possible. We selected two years for each time series and grouped the hourly data
    into daily values using the trimmed mean at 80%. Our study highlights the importance
    of data window size in multivariate algorithms and sheds light on the performance
    of multivariate versus univariate algorithms for SM forecasting. Our results have
    implications for the design and development of future forecasting models in this
    field. 2.4. Performance measures Throughout this work, we used some metrics to
    measure the efficiency of our algorithms in forecasting SM. Our time series consists
    of daily values, so we aim to predict the next day''s value. To compare the performance
    of our algorithms, we use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), the Mean Absolute
    Error (MAE), and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Using time series
    data from different locations throughout the world, we chose MAPE to compare the
    performance of the algorithm across different data ranges. In addition, we used
    RMSE and MAE to evaluate the impact of outliers on the forecast. While the former
    imposes a higher penalty for larger errors, the latter does not. Therefore, we
    use both metrics to analyze the effect of outliers on our forecasts. 3. Methodology
    The methodology used in our study consists of three scenarios designed to address
    key research questions. In the first scenario, we conducted seven experiments,
    each with varying training window size, to assess their impact on the performance
    of multivariate algorithms. We also evaluated the prediction stability over a
    year for each training configuration. Scenario two mirrored scenario one but with
    a reduced fitting frequency for multivariate algorithms, conducted every 15 days
    instead of 30. It allowed us to investigate the impact of the fitting frequency
    for model updating. In scenario three, we performed ten experiments comparing
    the best performing multivariate algorithm from scenarios one and two with univariate
    algorithms across ten diverse datasets from different geographical locations,
    providing insight into multivariate algorithm performance relative to univariate
    counterparts. The research questions were as follows. • How does the size of the
    training window influence the performance of multivariate algorithms? • Does the
    frequency of fitting the multivariate algorithm influence the prediction efficiency?
    • Does the multivariate algorithm outperform the univariate algorithms? We conducted
    seven experiments in scenario one to gain insight into the first research question.
    For each experiment, we defined a different training window to compare the impact
    of the training window size on the performance of multivariate algorithms. Additionally,
    we analyzed the performance of each multivariate algorithm over a year to assess
    the prediction stability of each training configuration. For scenario two, we
    conducted seven experiments identical to scenario one, but with a lower frequency
    of fitting of the multivariate algorithms. Specifically, the algorithms were fitted
    in scenario two every 15 days, compared to every 30 days in scenario one. This
    strategy allowed us to investigate whether the frequency of fitting the multivariate
    algorithms impacted their performance. Finally, in scenario three, we performed
    ten experiments that generated results to discuss the fourth question. We selected
    the multivariate algorithm with the best performance in scenarios one and two
    experiments and compared it with univariate algorithms. We considered ten datasets
    from different geographical points for the comparative study. Thus, we obtained
    results to discuss the performance of the multivariate algorithm compared to the
    univariate algorithms. 3.1. Scenario one In scenario one, we utilized the CAF
    dataset, as described in section 2.3. The target variable was the SM at a depth
    of 0.3m. The data set was divided into two periods of one year, with the first
    period used to optimize the hyperparameters of the models and the second period
    used for validation. For the training stage in scenario one, we used a sliding
    window format over the first data period, with the test dataset defined as 25%
    of the size of the training dataset. The training window was slid across the first
    year''s data, with one-third of the training dataset data updated in each iteration.
    We recorded the optimized hyperparameters and the predicted and test series for
    each training cycle to calculate performance metrics. During hyperparameter selection,
    we stored the model with the best performance per iteration of the experiment
    and grouped the hyperparameters into discrete and continuous categories. The discrete
    hyperparameters with the highest frequency were selected in the iterations of
    each experiment, whereas the mean was used for the continuous hyperparameters.
    Performance was used as a tiebreaker for hyperparameter selection. Experiments
    six and seven were exceptions to the described process. In both cases, the training
    window was one year, the training data set defined as 80% of the data and the
    test data set as 20%. After selecting the hyperparameters, we fitted the models
    using the entire available data set in the first period. During the validation
    stage, we did not perform hyperparameter optimization. Instead, we utilized the
    hyperparameters selected in the training stage and fitted the algorithms using
    the data window of the period prior to the prediction. For each day''s prediction,
    we used data from the previous days and, after 30 days, we fitted the model again.
    We recorded the predicted series values to calculate the MAE, RMSE, and MAPE evaluation
    metrics. Experiment seven was an exception to the previously described process,
    with the training window not sliding. After predicting the first month of the
    validation dataset, we added the data to the training data set and used the entire
    period for algorithm fitting. 3.2. Scenario two In scenario two, except for the
    prediction step, we replicated the experiments conducted in section 3.1. Specifically,
    we conducted seven experiments to evaluate the impact of fitting the multivariate
    algorithms every 15 days compared to every 30 days in scenario one. We used the
    same data set in scenario one for each experiment and the same methodology for
    hyperparameter optimization and performance evaluation. The only difference was
    the frequency of fitting the multivariate algorithms, done every 15 days in scenario
    two. For prediction, we make forecasts one day ahead for the next 15 days. The
    primary goal of scenario two was to investigate the effect of the frequency of
    fitting of the models on their performance. 3.3. Scenario three In scenario three,
    we selected the multivariate algorithm that demonstrated the best performance
    in scenarios one and two and conducted ten experiments. Next, we compare the performance
    of the selected algorithm with the univariate algorithms using ten data sets from
    various geographical points. The results allowed us to evaluate the performance
    of the multivariate algorithm against the univariate algorithms at different locations.
    Section 2.3 describes the data sets used in the experiments. We used the results
    from scenarios one and two to design the experiment plan for scenario three. We
    selected the modeling arrangement in which the algorithms evaluated in the previous
    scenarios presented the best performance. We began the experiment by selecting
    the original data sets, from which we chose samples for two years. Next, we selected
    the algorithms evaluated in the comparative study, which included the RF multivariate
    algorithm that outperformed the other algorithms evaluated in scenarios one and
    two. We also selected four univariate algorithms, including three traditional
    statistical methods: Naive, ES, and ARIMA. The fourth univariate algorithm selected
    was the N-BEATS neural network architecture. We divided the data samples in scenario
    three into two periods of one year. We used the first period to optimize the hyperparameters
    of the algorithms, and we used data from the second period to validate the results.
    The experiments in this scenario compared the performance of the univariate algorithms
    with the multivariate RF algorithm, which had achieved the best performance in
    the previous scenarios. During the training stage of the experiments in scenario
    three, we optimized the hyperparameters of the RF and N-BEATS algorithms. The
    other algorithms evaluated at this stage of the study did not require optimization
    due to the nature of the algorithms. We used the same strategy as in experiments
    six and seven of the previous scenarios, using a training window of one year.
    The training base was defined with 80% of the sample data and the test base with
    20%. Once the hyperparameters were selected, we fitted the algorithms using one
    year for the validation stage. To select hyperparameters, we stored the model
    with the best performance per iteration of the experiment. We grouped the hyperparameters
    into discrete and continuous ones, selecting the discrete hyperparameters with
    the highest frequency in the iterations of each experiment. We use the mean to
    select continuous hyperparameters, with performance as a tiebreaker for hyperparameter
    selection. We did not optimize the hyperparameter during the validation stage
    using the hyperparameters selected in the previous step. However, we calibrated
    the algorithms using the entire available data period. The strategy was similar
    to experiment seven of the previous scenarios, using a daily aggregation window
    strategy before prediction and performing algorithm calibration with all available
    historical data. By expanding the daily training base, the model would have accessed
    the most significant sample variability. Finally, we recorded the predicted series
    values to calculate the MAE, RMSE, and MAPE evaluation metrics. 4. Results and
    discussion This section discusses project questions based on the experiment results.
    4.1. How does the size of the training window influence the performance of multivariate
    algorithms? To investigate the first design question, we developed seven configurations
    of training windows, namely, monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, half-yearly, and annual.
    The annual window was used in two configurations, as explained in 3.1. Fig. 1
    presents the MAPE performance graph per experiment for all algorithms evaluated
    in scenarios one and two. The training windows successively increase from the
    first to the last experiment. There was no direct relationship between performance
    and an increase in the training window. The VAR algorithm in scenario one improved
    performance from the first to the second experiment, but the performance decreased
    from the second to the third one. The StemGNN algorithm showed continuous worsening
    from the first to the fifth experiment and has improved in the last. RF achieved
    similar results in experiments one to four, worsened in experiment five, and improved
    in experiments six and seven. The XGB algorithm presented regular results from
    the first to the fifth experiment and improved performance in experiments six
    and seven. Therefore, increasing the training window did not guarantee better
    algorithm performance. However, the results revealed that a one-year or longer
    window applied to experiments six and seven significantly improved the performance
    of all algorithms. Evidence found to explain the better performance referred to
    the periodic behavior of the series of CAF data sets. Table 4, Table 5, Table
    6, Table 7 shows the result metrics for each experiment in both scenarios. Download

    the frequency of fitting the multivariate algorithm influence prediction efficiency?
    To investigate the second research question, we separated the fit algorithm frequency
    in experiments conducted in scenarios one and two. In scenario one, we split the
    validation step into 12 parts and predicted 30 observations continuously. Subsequently,
    we added the predicted observations to the training base and refitted the models.
    We repeated a similar configuration for scenario two, but with a prediction period
    of 15 observations. We present all the result metrics for each experiment in both
    scenarios in Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7. Fig. 1, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 present
    the results of the experiments in each scenario, with scenario one illustrated
    in blue and scenario two in orange. We presented the results of the MAE, RMSE
    and MAPE metrics. In all three metrics, reducing the calibration period improved
    the algorithms'' performance, except for experiment six of the StemGNN algorithm,
    which showed worsened performance for all analyzed metrics in scenario two compared
    to scenario one. Moreover, in experiment seven, we observed that the RMSE and
    MAE obtained for the XGB algorithm achieved slightly lower performance in scenario
    two. Therefore, the frequent calibration strategy generally resulted in better
    performance of the algorithms explored in the study. Download : Download high-res

    To address the third research question, we analyzed the results obtained from
    the experiments conducted in scenario three. Our objective was to compare the
    performance of multivariate and univariate algorithms in forecasting SM. For this
    comparison, we chose the RF algorithm, which demonstrated the best performance
    in scenarios one and two. We evaluated and compared the performance of four univariate
    algorithms: ARIMA, N-BEATS, ES, and Naive. Table 8 presents all the algorithms
    evaluated. We conducted ten experiments using different datasets, and the target

    CAF Interestingly, the RF algorithm could not outperform the Naive method in nine
    out of ten experiments. In particular, Naive, one of the simplest methods available,
    outperformed the RF algorithm in most experiments. The results suggest that the
    components registered in data sets containing SM series did not add predictive
    capacity to multivariate methods. The N-BEATS algorithm could not outperform the
    ES, Naive, and ARIMA algorithms in most experiments. These findings highlight
    the difficulty of modern methods in surpassing straightforward but practical approaches,
    at least with regard to the data sets used in this work. 5. Conclusions Through
    the investigation of SM prediction, we modeled the problem as a univariate and
    multivariate time series prediction problem, conducting a total of 28 experiments
    to answer three design questions: • How does the size of the training window influence
    the performance of multivariate algorithms? • Does the frequency of fitting the
    multivariate algorithm influence the prediction efficiency? • Does the multivariate
    algorithm outperform the univariate algorithms? In the first scenario, we performed
    seven experiments to generate results for discussing the first question. These
    experiments evaluated the performance of four multivariate algorithms (VAR, StemGNN,
    RF, and XGB) for the prediction of SM. We designed the experiments with seven
    modeling strategies that varied the configuration of the training sample size,
    using monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, half-yearly and annual samples. We used the
    results to investigate the effect of sample size on algorithm performance. We
    used scenario two to investigate the importance of recurrent fitting of the models.
    We conducted seven experiments similar to scenario one, with the only difference
    being the validation step, in which we fitted the models every 15 days. We compared
    the results of the experiments in scenario two with those of scenario one to answer
    the second question of the project. In scenario three, we designed ten experiments
    to compare the prediction performance of a multivariate algorithm with that of
    univariate algorithms, generating results to discuss the third question of the
    project. Based on the results of scenarios one and two, we selected the RF algorithm
    as the most efficient among the multivariate solutions evaluated in the study.
    We then compared its performance with the ARIMA, Naive, ES, and NBEATS algorithms.
    We considered ten datasets from different geographical points for the comparative
    study, enabling us to evaluate the algorithms'' performance in predicting SM under
    different exogenous conditions. In conclusion, we could answer all the questions
    posed in the study. Models with higher predictive capacity were obtained using
    data samples with more records, whereas shorter-period training samples resulted
    in unreliable and unstable models. Our experiments demonstrated that the multivariate
    RF and XGB methods outperformed the StemGNN neural network and the VAR method.
    These results are consistent with the findings of the M5 competition [38], which
    indicated that machine learning methods were more effective than traditional statistical
    methods and neural network architectures. Furthermore, our comparison between
    univariate methods and the RF algorithm showed that univariate approaches were
    more efficient in predicting SM. Our results suggested that exogenous variables
    had little predictive value in the SM series data sets. However, it remains to
    be investigated to what extent exogenous variables affected the performance of
    multivariate methods. When compared to Naive, the RF algorithm''s low performance
    could be attributed to exogenous series that only added noise and made it difficult
    to predict the RF algorithm. Our experiments showed that deep learning methods
    did not outperform the traditional methods evaluated. This finding is similar
    to that presented in [52], which showed that neural network architectures must
    be improved to be superior to traditional methods for predicting time series.
    In future work, we suggest exploring additional techniques for creating variables
    based on the original bases to advance the understanding of multivariate time
    series modeling. In the current study, we only added a series of variables delayed
    by one, two, and three days. Adding more variables could increase the predictive
    capacity of multivariate methods. Furthermore, the low performance of the RF algorithm
    compared to the univariate methods suggests that exogenous variables may have
    a low predictive value. For future work, it would be interesting to investigate
    the importance of each variable for multivariate methods and determine whether
    exogenous variables positively affect or not the methods'' performance. Regarding
    the modeling strategy, we did not explore optimization of the parameters of machine
    learning and deep learning algorithms with frequent periodicity. Additionally,
    we recommend incorporating the data component as an attribute in the training
    strategy. For example, the model could be trained using monthly windows, with
    data from January used to predict the series for January of the following year.
    Similarly, for a semester window, the algorithm could be trained using data from
    the first semester of a year to predict the first semester of the following year.
    It would also be valuable to investigate the prediction of periods longer than
    one day. Using the SM variable for windows larger than one day is typical in irrigation.
    Therefore, understanding algorithms'' behavior when predicting larger windows
    would be significant. We limited the experiments to evaluate the prediction of
    SM at an exact value. However, in the irrigation problem domain, it is essential
    to maintain the moisture concentration within a range in the soil volume where
    the crop root is located. The health of the crop depends on the respect of the
    upper and lower limits of the moisture concentration range. Therefore, future
    studies could investigate strategies to predict the volume of water necessary
    to maintain an adequate concentration for each crop category. In this study, we
    compared the performance of different algorithms for predicting SM, but we did
    not explore traditional physical models that simulate soil water dynamics over
    time. Comparing the performance of different algorithms with traditional physical
    models to predict SM would be of great value. Moreover, we could design hybrid
    solutions to achieve better performance in SM prediction. Declaration of Competing

    Wireless fidelity 1. Introduction 1.1. Agriculture - Population, Climate Change,
    Sustainability, and Globale market size Agriculture was one of humanity''s first
    endeavors, and it remains a mainstay of our civilization. It has changed greatly
    throughout time in order to fulfill the needs of an expanding global population,
    adjust to shifting climatic circumstances, and solve sustainability-related issues.
    The relationship between agriculture and important variables including population
    dynamics, climate change, sustainability, and the size of the global market has
    had a significant impact on the agricultural landscape. The agricultural sector
    needs to provide enough food to cope with the world''s ever-increasing population.
    Innovative agricultural technologies, such as advanced technologies and crop management
    systems, are needed to increase productivit. Due to the high population growth,
    the globe will need to produce more than 70 % of food by 2050 [1]. Moreover, agriculture
    is also at the forefront of the fight against climate change. Agricultural yields
    and livestock are under serious threat from the effects of global warming, manifested
    in variable weather patterns, high temperatures, and changing levels of precipitation.
    Farmers are increasingly exposed to the risks of climate change, which requires
    rigorous strategies to mitigate the effects of climate change in order to maintain
    agricultural productivity [2], [3]. It has become crucial to strike a balance
    between the need to produce food and the need to safeguard the environment and
    conserve natural resources. Sustainable agricultural methods are becoming increasingly
    popular as they promote ecological stability and resilience. According to Dhanaraju
    et al. (2022) [4] sustainable agriculture is a farming technique that tries to
    satisfy the needs of the present generation without jeopardizing the ability of
    future generations to satisfy their own needs. It focuses on reducing the negative
    environmental consequences of agriculture while ensuring that farmers can maintain
    their livelihoods and provide healthful food. It may boost the economy of nearby
    towns and farms, support regional food systems, promote rural development, and
    provide jobs for rural areas [5]. Overall, sustainable agriculture is a vital
    method of farming that may assist to ensure future generations have access to
    food and a healthy environment [6], [7], [8]. In parallel, the interconnectedness
    of the agricultural industry worldwide makes international trade in goods and
    commodities possible. To make wise choices and improve the allocation of resources
    among farmers and agri-food businesses, we need to understand market size, demand
    trends, and trade dynamics. Additionally, in the upcoming years, the value of
    the worldwide smart agriculture market will significantly rise.The rising need
    for food, the requirement for sustainable farming methods, and the adoption of
    cutting-edge technology in the agriculture field are all factors contributing
    to the market''s expansion [9], [10]. 1.2. Application of IoT, Blockchain, Embedded
    electronics, Robotics, and Automation in smart agriculture The rapid development
    of technology in recent years has paved the way for creative solutions in a variety
    of industries, and agriculture is no exception. Modern farming practices have
    been changed by the integration of the latest technologies, such as the IoT, robotics,
    blockchain, embedded electronics, and automation, giving rise to the idea of smart
    farming. This new paradigm involves the intelligent application of data-driven
    technology to improve the productivity, efficiency, and sustainability of agricultural
    methods. Smart agriculture will require the integration of new technologies like
    the IoT in order to gain a substantial competitive advantage. To meet the demands
    of the growing population, agricultural output must be raised [11], [12]. IoT
    is improving farming methods by providing connectivity and intelligence through
    automated irrigation systems and intelligent livestock monitoring. So that the
    agricultural sector will benefit from important advantages such as improving operational
    efficiency, reducing cost and waste, and improving crop quality thanks to intelligent
    agriculture based on the blockchain and IoT [13], [14], [15]. The agricultural
    supply chain is transparent and traceable thanks to blockchain technology. Immutable
    records boost consumer and stakeholder confidence by confirming the provenance
    of products and facilitating interactions between farmers and buyers. Smart agriculture
    also has a connection to the utilization of digital technologies, including embedded
    electronics, robotics, and automation [16], [17], [18], [19], [20]. Embedded electronics
    are crucial for smart agricultural equipment and gadgets. IoT is reinforced by
    robotics, which automates operations such as planting and harvesting to increase
    production and reduce manual labor. Automation driven by real-time data improves
    yields and optimizes the use of resources while reducing errors in farming practices.
    This technology seeks to simplify operations and improve productivity and decision-making.
    An agricultural control system known as “smart farming” offers a thorough approach
    to dealing with the geographical and temporal variability of soils and crops in
    order to enhance product quality, and boost profitability [21], [22]. 1.3. Application
    of sensors in smart agriculture and focus of this work Through the use of real-time
    data in smart agriculture, made possible by sensor technology, agricultural yields
    can be increased, costs can be cut, and there is less environmental harm. By acquiring
    data on a range of environmental factors, including nutrients, soil moisture,
    temperature, and others, farmers may make decisions about irrigation, fertilization,
    and pest control [23], [24]. Thanks to smart agriculture, farmers can continuously
    monitor crop growth and environmental conditions, anticipate potential problems,
    and take quick action in reaction to changes. This approach, which promotes efficient
    and environmentally friendly farming methods, is essential in light of climate
    change and other environmental problems. The application of sensor technology
    in agriculture is anticipated to have a substantial influence on future food production
    [25]. Every element of conventional agricultural operations has been significantly
    improved by the integration of cutting-edge sensors and IoT technology. Currently,
    smart agriculture has the potential to advance agriculture to previously unthinkable
    levels by seamlessly integrating wireless sensors and the IoT [26], [27], [28].

    in smart agriculture The IoT has made smart agriculture, which is the most significant
    area for innovation in contemporary agriculture, conceivable. The combination
    of sensors, IoT, and data analytics technologies allows for real-time monitoring
    and management of farming activities, which helps to maximize resource utilization
    and increase crop yields. This section examines some of the most important IoT
    applications in smart agriculture, with a particular emphasis on 1) irrigation
    monitoring systems, 2) fertilizer administration, 3) crop disease detection, 4)
    monitoring (yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing monitoring), forecasting,
    and harvesting, 5) climate conditions monitoring, and 6) fire detection. IoT technology
    has the potential to change the farming sector through these applications, fostering
    more effective, and sustainable agricultural methods. 3.1. Irrigation monitoring
    system smart irrigation based on IoT is a cutting-edge technology that automates
    and improves irrigation systems by harnessing the power of the IoT. This system
    reduces waste and conserves water resources while ensuring that gardens, lawns,
    and crops receive the proper quantity of water. Sensors, controls, and cloud-based
    software are used in smart irrigation systems to gather real-time data on plant
    water needs, weather, and soil moisture. Using this knowledge, irrigation plans,
    water flow rates, and other variables are modified to ensure that plants receive
    enough water when required [49], [50], [51], [45], [52], [53], [54]. These systems
    may be used in a variety of contexts, including landscaping for homes and businesses,
    golf courses, and agriculture. Reduced water waste, enhanced plant health, higher
    efficiency, and cheaper costs are all advantages of smart irrigation systems [55],
    [56]. By doing away with manual watering, users of smart irrigation systems may
    save time and money. They are the best option for anybody looking to install a
    more ecologically friendly and economical irrigation system since they allow users
    to preserve water resources while enhancing plant health and production [57],
    [58], [59], [60]. 3.2. Fertilizer administration Administration of fertilizers
    based in the realm of smart agriculture, IoT is a crucial application that makes
    use of IoT technology to maximize the usage of fertilizers. With the help of this
    application, farmers will be able to get up-to-the-minute information on the state
    of their soil and its nutrient content, which they can use to modify how much
    and what kind of fertilizer they apply to their crops [61], [63], [65], [67].
    Employing a variety of sensors, like the NPK sensors, temperature sensors, soil
    moisture sensors, and humidity sensors, farmers can determine when and how much
    fertilizer is required for their crops, resulting in more efficient and effective
    crop growth and development [62], [64]. Increased agricultural yields are one
    of the main benifits of IoT-enabled fertilizer administration [65]. Farmers may
    optimize the usage of fertilizers, which can result in better crop growth and
    development, by employing IoT sensors to monitor soil conditions and nutrient
    levels [63], [66]. For instance, NPK sensors may help farmers determine the right
    amount of nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium needed for their crops [62], [64],
    [67], [69]. These nutrients are crucial for plant growth [62]. Farmers may change
    the type and amount of fertilizer applied by using real-time data on nutrient
    levels, which increases crop yields and improves crop quality [62], [63], [68].
    The decrease in fertilizer waste and associated costs is another advantage of
    IoT-based fertilizer management. IoT-based fertilizer administration can increase
    fertilizer application accuracy and precision in addition to optimizing fertilizer
    consumption and cutting waste [61], [62], [63], [70]. Overall, IoT-based fertilizer
    administration is a critical smart agricultural application that may support more
    productive and efficient farming methods. This technology lets farmers to utilize
    fertilizers more intelligently by giving them real-time data on nutrient levels
    and soil conditions. Higher agricultural yields, improved crop quality, and less
    environmental impact are the outcomes of this. 3.3. Crop diseases detection Controlling
    crop diseases is an essential part of contemporary agriculture. Illnesses may
    drastically lower agricultural production, costing farmers money and jeopardizing
    the world''s food supply [71]. The overuse of pesticides and other chemicals can
    also have negative environmental impacts, such as polluting water supplies and
    upsetting natural ecosystems [72]. Fortunately, improvements in IoT technology
    are opening up fresh possibilities to tackle these problems. In the field, IoT
    and sensors may be used to monitor crop health in real-time and spot early symptoms
    of disease or insect infestation. These sensors may gather information on a variety
    of environmental and biological elements, including temperature, humidity, soil
    moisture, and plant development patterns, that have an impact on crop health [73],
    [74], [75], [76], [77]. The prevention of disease propagation and the reduction
    of pests'' negative effects on crop yields are made possible by the use of sensors
    and IoT in agricultural disease and pest control [76], [78], [79]. Additionally,
    IoT technology supports data-driven decision-making for pest and agricultural
    disease management [73]. By analyzing data received from sensors and other sources,
    farmers may learn about the effectiveness of their pest management strategies
    and make adjustments to their operations. By evaluating the data produced by IoT
    and sensors using ML and other data analytics technologies, farmers may identify
    patterns and trends in crop health and choose efficient pest management strategies
    [73], [80]. In terms of intelligent agriculture, the application of IoT and sensors
    for pest management marks a significant achievement. IoT technology provides more
    precise and sustainable pest management procedures, minimizing the use of toxic
    chemicals and fostering a more effective and environmentally friendly agriculture
    sector by giving farmers real-time data on crop health and insect activity. 3.4.
    Monitoring, forecasting and harvesting Yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing
    monitoring, logistics monitoring, forecasting and harvesting are crucial aspects
    of smart farming that are increasingly using IoT technology to their advantage..
    In the field, IoT and sensors may be used to gather information on a variety of
    elements that influence agricultural yields, including temperature, humidity,
    soil moisture, and plant development patterns [61]. In order to estimate future
    harvests and get real-time insights on agricultural yields, this data may then
    be evaluated using new technologies [81], [82], [83], [84]. Real-time agricultural
    yield monitoring enables farmers to spot failing farms and make necessary adjustments
    to increase yields. IoT sensors may also offer information on the efficacy of
    various farming techniques, enabling farmers to adjust their plans for optimal
    output. The use of IoT in smart agriculture has the potential to transform the
    sector and solve pressing problems. IoT may have a significant positive impact
    in several crucial areas, including quality, processing, and logistical monitoring,
    predicting, and harvesting. Product compliance is ensured through quality control,
    while IoT sensors assist improve elements like soil condition. IoT-powered cameras
    are used for processing monitoring to guarantee constant product quality. Transportation
    efficiency is improved by using IoT devices like trackers for logistic monitoring.
    Another area where IoT technology might be quite helpful in crop forecasting[85].
    Farmers may employ machine learning algorithms to anticipate future harvests by
    examining previous data on crop yields and climatic variables. IoT and sensors
    may be utilized to increase productivity and reduce waste during the harvesting
    process [81], [83], [84]. In general, smart agriculture has advanced significantly
    with the use of IoT technologies for Yield monitoring, quality monitoring, processing
    monitoring, logistics monitoring, forecasting, and harvesting. IoT technology
    provides more efficient and effective agricultural methods, leading to better
    yields, decreased waste, and increased sustainability by giving farmers real-time
    data on crop yields and anticipated harvests. 3.5. Climate conditions monitoring
    Smart farming is greatly impacted by the weather. Due to climate changes, agricultural
    produce''s quality and quantity may be impacted. Alternatively, farmers may place
    sensors like water level, humidity, and temperature sensors in the sector using
    the IoT as a way to gather real-time environmental data [86], [87], [88], [89].
    In contemporary agriculture, it is normal practice to utilize sensors to keep
    an eye on the health of crops and the environment in which they are growing. These
    sensors are essential for capturing real-time data, giving farmers insightful
    information, and assisting them in making decisions regarding their agricultural
    methods [86]. When a potentially hazardous environmental problem is discovered,
    it is either automatically fixed or a notice is provided to the farmer advising
    them to act quickly to avoid agricultural losses [88], [90]. 3.6. Fire detection
    Fire detection is a significant IoT application in smart agriculture. Farmers
    may employ IoT devices to monitor potential fire dangers in their crops and forests
    [91], [92], [97]. These sensors are able to detect changes in flame as well as
    the presence of smoke and other fire-related indicators [93], [94], [95], [96],
    [98], [99], [100], [101]. The IoT system may warn the farmer and/or the neighborhood
    fire department if a fire is found, enabling them to act immediately and stop
    the fire from spreading. IoT fire detection systems can monitor controlled burns,
    which are frequently used in agriculture to manage land and encourage new development,
    in addition to preventing fires from starting in the first place. These fires
    may be carried out safely and successfully by using IoT sensors to monitor the
    smoke and other parameters [93], [94]. In general, adding fire detection to IoT
    systems in smart agriculture may aid farmers in safeguarding their land, crops,
    and animals as well as avoiding harm to neighboring populations and natural resources
    [92]. 4. Sensors for smart agriculture The way we grow our food might be completely
    changed by the introduction of the IoT and sensors in the agricultural sector.
    With the use of these technologies, farmers can gather and evaluate data in real-time
    on a range of environmental elements that impact crops, including temperature,
    wind speed, soil moisture, smoke, flame, etc. Farmers can monitor the health of
    their crops, spot fields that require more attention, and decide when to sow,
    irrigate, fertilize, and harvest their crops by employing smart agriculture sensors.
    As a result, there may be more production and efficiency, less waste, and less
    negative environmental effect. For instance, farmers may plan when to irrigate
    their crops using soil moisture monitors, only applying water when it is required.
    In addition to saving water and money, this can avoid overwatering, which can
    cause soil erosion and nutrient depletion. Similarly to this, farmers may employ
    targeted treatments just where they are required by utilizing sensors to track
    soil quality and nutrient levels. This reduces the need for pesticides and fertilizers
    while supporting sustainable agricultural methods. The majority of sensors widely
    used in smart agriculture are shown in Table. 2 name of sensors in column 1, sensor
    application type of data collect and description in column 2. Finaly type of data
    collect and description in column 3. Table 2. Agricultural sensors: Sensor application,
    type of data collecting and description. Sensor name Sensor application Type of
    data collect and description Soil NPK Sensor Fertilizer Administration. Determines
    the concentration of potassium, phosphorus, and nitrogen in the soil to aid in
    fertilization. Using soil NPK sensors to track changes in soil nutrient levels
    over time, growers may adjust fertilizer application rates and timing. The application
    of soil NPK sensors can reduce fertilizer waste, enhance crop productivity and
    quality, and prevent nutrient runoff into nearby rivers [66]. Soil Moisture Sensor
    Irrigation Monitoring Systems, Forecasting and Harvesting. Measures the amount
    of water in the soil to determine when and how much to irrigate. These sensors
    may be positioned at various soil depths to monitor the water availability at
    varying depths. Soil moisture sensors can aid in crop growth optimization, water
    conservation, and avoiding overwatering, which can result in nutrient loss and
    soil erosion [19], [102]. Nitrate Sensor Fertilizer Administration, Crop Disease
    Detection. Determines the nitrate content of the soil to aid in fertilizer application.
    Growers may alter fertilizer application rates and timing by using nitrate sensors
    to monitor changes in soil nitrogen levels over time. In addition to improving
    crop output and quality, nitrate sensors can assist minimize nitrogen runoff into
    surrounding waterways and decrease fertilizer waste [67], [104]. Soil pH Sensor
    Fertilizer Administration, Crop Disease Detection. Determines the soil''s pH level,
    which can aid in enhancing plant nutrient absorption. Growers may modify soil
    amendments and fertilizer application rates by using soil pH sensors to monitor
    variations in soil acidity over time. The use of soil pH sensors can improve crop
    production and quality, reduce nutrient deficits and toxicities, and stop soil
    acidification over time [104]. Electrical Conductivity Sensor Fertilizer Administration,
    Quality Monitoring. Determines the electrical conductivity of water or soil, which
    may be used to check salt and nutrient levels. Adjusting irrigation procedures
    and preventing salt accumulation in soils may both be accomplished with electrical
    conductivity sensors [105]. CO2 Sensor Quality Monitoring, Processing Monitoring,
    Climate Conditions Monitoring. Measures the quantity of carbon dioxide in the
    air, which may be used to keep track of plant development and respiration. Growing
    conditions may be improved by adjusting ventilation and lighting systems, which
    can be done with the use of CO2 sensors, which can track changes in CO2 levels
    over time. By adjusting ventilation and illumination as necessary, CO2 sensors
    can assist minimize CO2 buildup, which can result in decreased plant growth and
    productivity. They can also aid in lowering energy use [98]. Temperature and Humidity
    Sensor Irrigation Monitoring Systems, Quality Monitoring, Processing Monitoring,
    Forecasting and Harvesting, Climate Conditions Monitoring. Monitors environmental
    conditions by taking air temperature and humidity measurements. Extreme temperature
    ranges, high humidity levels, and other environmental variables that may affect
    plant growth and development may all be found with these sensors. Sensors for
    temperature and humidity can be placed in a variety of places, such as outside
    weather stations or within greenhouses. These sensors can aid in improving growth
    conditions, guarding against pests and disease, and lowering energy expenditures
    [98]. Sensor name Sensor application Type of data collect and description Light
    Sensor Quality Monitoring, Climate Conditions Monitoring. Measures the amount
    of light that plants receive, which can aid in maximizing growth and output. These
    sensors can measure the amount of light in different parts of a greenhouse or
    field and may be used to modify lighting or shade arrangements to improve growing
    conditions. By decreasing illumination or shading as necessary, light sensors
    may assist producers in producing high-quality crops with optimal yield and quality
    while also reducing energy use [106]. Weather Station Logistics Monitoring, Forecasting
    and Harvesting. Gathers information on the wind''s direction and speed, the amount
    of rain that has fallen, the barometric pressure, and other weather-related data
    that may be used by farmers to make choices about planting, harvesting, and other
    agricultural tasks. With the use of these sensors, producers can foresee weather-related
    hazards and improve crop management techniques by tracking weather trends over
    time. Weather stations can be set up on a farm or in a particular area and used
    to track regional weather patterns and microclimates [103]. Water Level Sensor
    Irrigation Monitoring Systems, Logistics Monitoring. The level of water in a tank,
    pond, or other body of water can be determined with a water level sensor. In order
    to monitor the water levels in irrigation systems and other bodies of water, water
    level sensors are frequently employed in agriculture [19]. Livestock Sensor Logistics
    Monitoring. Observes the health and conduct of cattle, which can aid in disease
    prevention and maximize output. Animal activity, body temperature, and eating
    habits may all be monitored with livestock sensors, among other parameters. These
    sensors can aid in improving feeding and breeding procedures, reducing animal
    stress, and promoting animal welfare [15]. Plant Disease Sensor Crop Disease Detection
    Analyzes plant tissue or soil samples to look for plant diseases. Plant disease
    sensors can be used to keep an eye out for illness in crops and assist producers
    in taking steps to stop its spread or potential harm [107]. Smoke Sensor Fire
    Detection The smoke sensor calculates how many smoke particles are present in
    the air at any one time, which may signal the existence of a fire. The sensor
    alerts the smart agricultural system when smoke particles are found so that it
    may take the necessary precautions to stop the fire from spreading [99], [100].
    Flame Sensor Fire Detection Using infrared light emission, the flame sensor locates
    fires. The sensor can recognize the infrared radiation that a flame releases when
    it is present. The sensor alerts the smart agricultural system when a flame is
    found so that it may take the necessary steps to stop the fire from spreading
    [99], [100]. Flexible sensor Yield Monitoring. An advanced, flexible, wearable
    sensor called the plant and food quality monitor was created specifically to track
    the quality of plants, fruits, and food. Real-time data collection is made possible
    by its soft and versatile shape, which makes it easy to install easily on the
    surface of various food items and plants without causing any damage [108]. In
    addition, as the world''s population continues to expand, IoT and smart agricultural
    sensors can assist farmers in meeting the rising food demand. Farmers may boost
    productivity while decreasing expenses and environmental effects by implementing
    these technologies. On the other hand, wave-based technologies are rapidly being
    used in industrial applications and smart sensors, due to their efficiency in
    analyzing and processing complex signals [109], [110], [111]. Together, these
    studies highlight the variety of applications for wavelet-based signal processing,
    from denoising and analysis in industrial environments to applications for smart
    sensors and machine learning. Given their versatility and efficiency in processing
    complex signals, wavelet methods are increasingly used in a variety of fields
    as useful tools for industrial processes and current sensor technology. Overall,
    the application of IoT and smart agriculture sensors in the agricultural business
    has the potential to alter the way we grow our food. These technologies can boost
    production and efficiency, and support sustainable farming methods by letting
    farmers gather and evaluate real-time data on numerous environmental conditions.
    This will be essential for supplying the world''s growing population with food
    in the future. 5. The benefits and challenge of IoT in agricultural 5.1. Benefits
    IoT application in agriculture, as in other sectors, provides previously unavailable
    efficiency, resource savings, cost, automation, and data-driven operations. IoT-enabled
    smart agriculture offers a number of noteworthy benefits, including superior efficiency,
    expansion, reduced resources, cleaner method, agility, and also product quality
    improvement. Numerous research papers have looked into the advantages of implementing
    the IoT in intelligent agriculture [30], [60], [112], [113]. As shown in Fig.
    6, the six benefits of the IoT in agriculture, we will discuss each benefit separately
    following: 1) Superior efficiency: Today''s agriculture is competitive. Farmers
    must produce more despite unfavorable soil conditions, diminishing land availability,
    and rising weather whims. Farmers can track their fields and environmental conditions
    in real-time thanks to IoT-based agriculture. They can generate ideas rapidly,
    foresee issues before they happen, and determine how to avoid them by employing
    information. IoT solutions for agriculture are also introducing automation, including
    irrigation, fertilization, automated harvesting, etc. 2) Expansion: By the next
    several years, there will be 9 billion people on the planet, with 70 % of them
    living in cities. Thanks to systems based on the IoT, especially systems that
    provide food supply chains, these people can be supplied with vegetables and fruits.
    It is now feasible to grow food practically everywhere, even on walls and roofs,
    in shipping containers, and inside everyone''s houses, thanks to intelligent closed-cycle
    farming systems. 3) Reduced resources: A lot of IoT solutions for agriculture
    are built to maximize the use of resources like electricity, water, and land.
    With the help of data gathered from numerous field sensors, IoT-based precision
    farming helps farmers to accurately distribute the proper quantity of resources.
    4) Cleaner method: Smart agriculture that supports the IoT is an effective way
    to reduce the use of fertilizers and pesticides. Intelligent farming helps farmers
    save water, energy, and the environment while drastically reducing the usage of
    pesticides and fertilizers. Compared to conventional agricultural methods, this
    technique enables the production of a cleaner end product to be produced. 5) Agility:
    IoT use in agriculture has the benefit of accelerating a number of processes.
    Farmers can quickly react to significant changes in weather, humidity levels,
    air quality, fires, and the state of specific crops and soil in the field thanks
    to real-time monitoring and forecasting systems. With the use of this technology,
    agricultural personnel may now save crops in the case of extreme weather or fires.
    6) Product quality improvement: The use of sensors and the IoT in agriculture
    improves and raises agricultural output. Crop sensors, drone-based overhead surveillance,
    and farm mapping are tools that farmers may use to better understand the intricate
    relationships between crop quality and the environment. They may duplicate ideal
    circumstances and improve the nutritional value of their crops by using linked
    systems.. Download : Download high-res image (233KB) Download : Download full-size

    few decades, there have been enormous technology improvements that have impacted
    our everyday lives. By placing resources at our fingertips, we are credited with
    improving the convenience of our lives. Smart sensors collect real-time data and
    establish connections with each other or the internet to initiate required actions.
    IoT has successfully captivated a vast audience due to the numerous ongoing innovations.
    However, the adoption of IoT technology brings both advantages and challenges.
    The difficulties of using the IoT in smart agriculture have been covered in several
    research [29], [30], [32], [114], [115], [116], [117]. Despite the IoT''s development
    over the past two decades, significant conceptual, structural, and problems remain.
    Fig. 7 depicts the most important challenges to implementing the IoT in agriculture,
    like 1) superior efficiency, 2) cost and standardization, 3) heterogeneity and
    accessibility, 4) adaptability and energy optimization, 5) compatibility and reliability,
    6) mobility and environmental conditions.Here are the most pressing immediate
    problems of the IoTs: 1) Superior efficiency: Agriculture is nowadays a race.
    Despite poor soil conditions, dwindling availability of land, and increased vagaries
    of weather, farmers must produce more. Farmers can monitor their products and
    environmental conditions in real-time thanks to IoT-based agriculture. They can
    quickly get ideas, anticipate problems before they arise, and decide how to prevent
    them from using knowledge. Automation is also being introduced by IoT solutions
    in agriculture, such as demand-based irrigation, fertilization, and automated
    harvesting. 2) Cost and Standardization: Due to regional economic disparities,
    creating a cost-effective strategy for IoT installations in agriculture is difficult.
    Economic models must be developed to control setup and operational expenses, which
    include the price of IoT devices, recurring subscriptions, data processing, maintenance,
    and energy. For devices, applications, systems, and products to function properly
    together, standardization is essential. Interoperability is challenging to achieve,
    though, because diverse IoT devices lack standardized formats and protocols. To
    enable the success of IoT implementations, interoperability is therefore required
    at the organizational, technological, semantic, and conceptual levels. 3) Heterogeneity
    and Accessibility: System design makes use of heterogeneous devices. Each gadget
    has a different set of operational and maintenance needs. Since the majority of
    models in agriculture use heterogeneous equipment, it is essential to create a
    connection between communication technologies and heterogeneous modules. The network
    becomes increasingly complex due to heterogeneity, which might occasionally result
    in the appearance of falsified results. Any IoT-based or other device-based farming
    decision support system must be built with the assumption that current software
    and hardware are always available everywhere. These problems must be fixed in
    order to ensure that services are available whenever and wherever they are needed.
    A lack of the required tools may result in chaos and service delays. 4) Adaptability
    and Energy Optimization: For smart farming, it is important that the devices are
    able to adapt to other devices in addition to the environment. Some hardware is
    incompatible with one another owing to the environment''s continually changing,
    as well as occasionally because of particular hardware or connection concerns.
    The most recent problem with communication devices, and other IoT is energy. Up
    until now, the designing and operating models have been supported by traditional
    sources of energy. However, with more gadgets on the market, using traditional
    energy is no longer a viable option. Aside from testing unconventional energy
    sources like solar, wind, and water energy harvesting plans, which haven''t had
    much success, new approaches also need to be developed. 5) Compatibility and reliability:
    The produced models or software should be adaptable and scalable in order to comply
    with the criteria of fragmentation and scalability. Reliability is a vital issue
    for IoT devices to effectively and seamlessly transmit data. The devices must
    collect and communicate accurate data since judgments are made utilizing the information
    that has been received and analyzed. Due to system failures, node failures, battery
    problems, and other interventions, reliability is still a difficulty. 6) Mobility
    and Environmental Conditions: The generated systems or models are often static.
    Because most devices and applications are portable, mobility is essential for
    the framework''s efficient implementation. The challenge of sustaining connectivity
    still exists in mobile models. Agricultural landscapes come in a variety. As a
    result, it becomes challenging to respond to those changes, which puts data and
    services at risk. This modifies a system''s accuracy. Download : Download high-res

    in agriculture. 6. Conclusion and perspective In conclusion, the Internet of Things
    (IoT) and sensor technology, then, provide significant potential for enhancing
    food security and sustainable agricultural methods. In addition to presenting
    four layers of the IoT architecture for smart agriculture, including the perception
    or sensing and actuator layer, the network layer, the cloud layer, and the application
    layer, this study also offers insights into the size of the global market for
    smart agriculture in the years 2021 to 2030. This review paper addressed the current
    state of IoT and sensor technologies for agriculture, as well as some of their
    potential applications, such as 1) irrigation monitoring systems, 2) fertilizer
    administration, 3) crop disease detection, 4) monitoring (yield monitoring, quality
    monitoring, processing monitoring, logistic monotoring), forecasting, and harvesting,
    5) climate conditions monitoring, and 6) fire detection. A variety of sensors
    for agriculture are also included in this study, including those that can detect
    soil NPK, moisture, nitrate, pH, electrical conductivity, CO2, temperature, humidity,
    light, weather station, water level, livestock, plant disease, smoke, flame, and
    flexible wearable. The advantages of IoT in smart agriculture are also highlighted,
    particularly in terms of of superior efficiency, expansion, reduced resources,
    cleaner method, agility, and product quality improvement. However, there are still
    problems that must be fixed before IoT technology can be employed in agriculture,
    which is what this study has discussed. further offer hints on potential future
    study avenues. Future readers and scholars will benefit from this study''s insights
    into the current status of academic accomplishment in this field. Agriculture
    has the potential to be revolutionized by the development and application of IoT
    and sensor technologies, enabling more sustainable and effective food production.
    The need for food will rise as the world''s population expands, and the agriculture
    industry must come up with novel solutions to fulfill this demand while preserving
    sustainability. IoT and sensors, which provide real-time monitoring and management
    of crops, soil, and environment, present a possible answer to these problems.
    However for them to be widely used and implemented, a lot of money must be spent
    on infrastructure, training, and research. To encourage the use of IoT and sensor
    technologies in agriculture and to address the difficulties facing the industry,
    governments, private sector players, and other stakeholders should work together
    to establish policies and strategies. The development of sustainable and effective
    agricultural techniques that can fulfill the requirements of a rising population
    while protecting the environment for future generations, as well as the successful
    integration of IoT and sensor technologies, are key to the future of smart agriculture.

    Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Greenhouse and vertical farming, which
    provide optimum growing environments for plants, are becoming more and more important
    in modern agriculture. As reported, there are more than 9 million greenhouses
    around the globe [1], and their market worth is expected to rise to almost 1.3
    billion dollars by 2022 [2]. Precision irrigation aims to increase crop output
    and reduce water consumption [3], [4], [5]. To enable this vision, soil moisture
    sensing plays a key role since a suitable moisture level not only improves plant
    productivity but also saves up to 25% of irrigation water [6]. To measure soil
    moisture, existing commercial soil moisture sensors are expensive despite their
    high accuracy (e.g., an ECHO-EC5 sensor costs 169 USD [7]), preventing their large-scale
    application in real-world farm fields or greenhouses. To reduce the system cost
    and bring the wireless connection to the system, recent studies propose to employ
    low-cost IoT wireless devices (i.e., Wi-Fi [8], RFID [9], UWB [10]) for soil moisture
    sensing. For example, Strobe [8] proposes to estimate soil moisture by placing
    a Wi-Fi transmitter in soil and placing a Wi-Fi receiver on-ground to measure
    the time of flight (ToF) of the signal traveling the soil. However, a pair of
    transceivers can only measure soil moisture in one location. Thus, it is costly
    to deploy thousands of sensors and power them with batteries or power cables on
    large farmland. To achieve low-cost and battery-free, GreenTag system [9] employs
    the commercial RFID tag as the soil moisture sensor and achieves 4% sensing error.
    However, it can not measure the deep soil moisture, i.e., the root moisture. To
    measure the deep soil moisture, recent work [11] buries a battery-powered tag/sensor
    in soil and measures the ToF of LoRa signals from the tag to the on-ground receiver.
    However, it requires battery power and may incur soil contamination due to battery
    corruption during long-term monitoring. Ideally, a soil moisture sensing system
    needs to satisfy the following four requirements: Battery-free and low-cost: It
    should be battery-free and low-cost so that sensing devices can be widely used
    and easily maintained, e.g., the battery-free can reduce the cost and avoid soil
    contamination. A high moisture sensing accuracy: It should achieve high accuracy
    (e.g., 2% sensing error) so that smart agriculture can make fine-grained irrigation
    control decisions to improve irrigation efficiency [12]. A wide moisture sensing
    scale: Its sensing scale should cover the soil moisture range that is suitable
    for the growth of most plants, i.e., 20% ∼ 60% [13], [14]. A deep moisture sensing
    depth: It should detect soil moisture at depth because the roots of most plants
    are at a depth of 5 ∼ 75 cm [15], [16]. To the best of our knowledge, there is
    no such system that can meet all the above requirements. To fill this gap, we
    are inspired by chipless sensors [17], [18], [19], [20], which are fully passive
    and made of low-cost metal surfaces and substrates. Thus, the chipless sensor
    is low-cost for massive production and has the advantages of flexible design and
    easy fabrication for meeting different requirements. Moreover, due to the pervasive
    availability of Wi-Fi devices and their inexpensive hardware, we further reduce
    the sensing system cost by leveraging ambient Wi-Fi signals to activate chipless
    sensors and capture their readings. In this paper, we introduce SoilTAG, a battery-free,
    chipless Wi-Fi tag-based high accuracy, and low-cost soil moisture sensing system.
    It consists of a pair of Wi-Fi devices and at least one chipless Wi-Fi tag. The
    chipless Wi-Fi tag, which acts as the moisture sensor, is attached to the soil
    surface or buried in soil as shown in Fig. 1. Benefiting from the chipless, our
    soil moisture sensor (i.e., the tag) is battery-free and designed as a low-cost
    microstrip resonator [21]. The key insight is that the resonant frequency of the
    tag changes in response to variations in soil moisture levels, which shares the
    same insight as our recent research [20] but this work aims to develop a dedicated
    soil sensing system and validate its performance in practical application scenarios.
    To illustrate this, Fig. 2(a) shows the simulated resonant frequencies (i.e.,
    f 1 , f 2 , f 3 , f 4 , and f 5 ) when soil moisture levels are 0%, 4%, 8%, 11%,
    and 90% (theoretical value). As we can see, even though there is a small moisture
    level change (e.g., 0% to 4%), the resonant frequency varies significantly (e.g.,
    about 350 MHz from f 1 to f 2 ). It implies that it is possible to achieve fine-grained
    moisture sensing. Fig. 1. Application example of SoilTAG: detecting soil moisture
    levels in a strawberry greenhouse. Show All Fig. 2. Illustration of frequency
    responses for different soil moisture levels. (a) The raw frequency responses
    in a wide frequency band. (b) Ideal frequency responses increase the sensitivity.
    Show All It is non-trivial to realize the high accuracy of soil moisture sensing
    due to the limited bandwidth of most commercial IoT/RF devices. For example, Bluetooth
    devices only have a bandwidth of 2 MHz, RFID devices only have a bandwidth of
    28 MHz, and even the most recent advanced Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) devices have a bandwidth
    of no more than 160 MHz. Thus, it is impossible to capture all the resonant frequencies
    that spread out over a few GHz bandwidth, as illustrated in Fig. 2(a). To overcome
    the bandwidth constraint, we detect soil moisture through the amplitude of a given
    narrow frequency band. For example, Fig. 2(a) shows that there are large power
    amplitude changes (e.g., Δ d 1 ) in the Wi-Fi band (i.e., the pink region) for
    different moisture levels. However, there are two practical problems when applying
    the amplitude for soil moisture sensing. First, the sensing resolution is limited
    at some moisture range. For example, Fig. 2(a) shows that when the soil moisture
    changes from 8% to 11%, the power amplitude only changes by 1 dB, which may limit
    the sensing accuracy. Environmental noise may cause an average of 3 dB of amplitude
    variations [22], which would easily distort the small power changes caused by
    soil moisture change. To solve this challenge, we introduce a solution to optimize
    resonator hardware design parameters so that it can enlarge the frequency response
    power difference of adjacent moisture levels, i.e., the power changes can exceed
    3 dB as shown in Fig. 2(b). By spacing these frequency responses properly, we
    can increase the sensitivity in detecting soil moisture levels and enable a high
    sensing accuracy. To further cover the best/whole soil moisture scale for most
    plants, we propose a multiple resonator ensemble design strategy. Specifically,
    the whole soil moisture range is divided into several segments and each resonator
    is designed to work in each moisture segment. In this way, the sensing accuracy
    of SoilTAG can be improved in the whole soil moisture range. Second, both the
    tag location and soil moisture changes could cause amplitude variations in the
    channel frequency response, resulting in soil moisture estimation error. To cope
    with this problem, we use the amplitude ratio rather than the absolute amplitude
    of channel frequency response [23]. Specifically, we first measure a reference
    channel frequency response before attaching the tag to soil. Then, when the tag
    is attached to the soil, we get another online channel frequency response. By
    calculating the ratio between the two channel measurements, we get the relative
    ratio which is only related to soil moisture level and independent of the tag
    location. In Section III-D we theoretically prove that the frequency response
    ratio feature is independent of the distance changes. After resolving the two
    practical problems, we finally theoretically analyze the maximum working range
    of SoilTAG, as well as the application scenarios of the system. Specifically,
    we model SoilTAG as a bistatic radar [24] and use the radar equation to analyze
    the transmission power, as well as the tag antenna configuration, and the signal
    frequency band on the coverage area of SoilTAG, which is an important system deployment
    guide in the real-world for meeting requirement of working range. The analysis
    reveals that in order to improve the working range, the key is to increase the
    received signal at the tag side and to increase the signal to interference noise
    ratio at the receiver side. Following this insight, we design a high gain antenna
    to improve the received and reflection signal of tag, and employ beamforming and
    beam-nulling at the transceiver side to increase the incident signal to tag and
    reduce the interference signal to the receiver [19], [20]. In Section IV-A, we
    show the theoretical analysis. In Section IV-B, we present the tag antenna design
    in detail. We built two prototypes of SoilTAG system in 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band with
    WARP software radios and commodity Wi-Fi cards (Intel 5300 and Athero 9580). We
    evaluated SoilTAG with extensive experiments in five kinds of environments including
    both indoor and outdoor. Experimental results show that: (i) WARP radios-based
    system achieves 90th percentile moisture sensing error of 2% , 3.64% and 8% when
    the distance between the transmitter and the tag is 6 m, 10 m, and 13.9 m; (ii)
    commodity Wi-Fi cards based system achieves over 83.8% accuracy (iii) SoilTAG
    achieves the sensing depth up to 1 m. Contributions: Our contributions are summarized
    as follows: SoilTAG is the first battery-free, chipless Wi-Fi tag-based high accuracy
    and low-cost soil moisture sensing system. By employing the narrow bandwidth signal
    power feature and optimizing the resonator-based tag design parameters, we break
    the barrier of bandwidth limitation and deliver high sensing accuracy. We propose
    a new moisture sensing feature, i.e., the relative amplitude ratio, which is not
    only independent/robust to tag location changes but also only related to the soil
    moisture. We theoretically analyze the maximum working range of our system, which
    is an important system deployment guide in the real world for meeting the working
    range and coverage requirements. Extensive real-world experiments demonstrated
    the effectiveness of the proposed system. SECTION II. Related Work Our work is
    broadly related to the literature in the following four categories: • Commercial
    Soil Sensors: Commodity soil moisture sensors can be divided into three types,
    including TDR-based (time domain reflectometry) [25], FDR-based (frequency domain
    reflectometry) sensors [26], and neutron method based sensors [27]. Although they
    can provide high accuracy soil moisture sensing, they are extremely expensive
    with a price higher than 150 USD, which limits their widespread use. Furthermore,
    most of them require users to hand-hold, which is inefficient to measure soil
    moisture in a large number of locations in a farm field or a greenhouse. • Wireless
    Sensor Network: To realize automatic monitoring, wireless sensor networks were
    proposed [28], [29], [30] where the wireless module is responsible for data transmission
    with gateways and the sensor is responsible for soil sensing. Although WSNs can
    achieve large-scale soil moisture sensing, sensor nodes require battery power,
    and a large number of sensor nodes could be very costly. For example, the cheapest
    node mentioned in [29], [31] is $ 20. It requires battery and regular maintenance.
    In contrast, SoilTAG employs low-cost and battery-free chipless tags as soil moisture
    sensors and does not require maintenance. • Wireless Soil Moisture Sensing: Recent
    works [8], [10], [11], [32] exploit the changes in the wireless signal propagation
    speed in the soil to estimate soil moisture. Strobe [8] achieves a sensing range
    of 1.5 m by burying an active Wi-Fi transmitter and a 3-antenna array in soil.
    Another work [11] expands the working range to 100 m by burying an active and
    customized LoRa node in soil. The work [10] pushes the sensing depth to up to
    1 m theoretically. Unfortunately, all these techniques need to bury battery-powered
    nodes in the soil, which has the risk of soil contamination from battery corruption
    and adds additional maintenance cost in real usage and thus limiting the long-term
    monitoring. Different from the above works, a recent work CoMEt [32] exploits
    an ultra-wideband RF signal (2 GHz) to measure the ToF from the soil to the receiver
    which does not need to bury a tag/node in the soil, achieving a median error of
    1.1%. In contrast, SoilTAG is a chipless tag-based sensing system that does not
    require battery power or an energy harvester and has the potential for long-term
    and deep soil monitoring. It does not need an extra assistive mobile device to
    collect the sensing data and thus has a lower cost but also achieves a comparable
    sensing accuracy to the systems mentioned before. • Battery-Free Tag Based Soil
    Moisture Sensing: To address the power supply problem of sensor nodes in practice,
    previous research proposed the use of battery-free RFIDs for sensing soil moisture
    sensing [9], [33], [34]. Some previous studies [33], [34] have studied attaching
    RFID tags on the soil surface to measure soil moisture but it can only measure
    coarse-grained moisture variations. GreenTag [9] achieves high accuracy by capturing
    the DMRT feature of the RFID tag''s backscatter signal to estimate soil moisture.
    However, RFID tags are not suitable for sensing soil moisture in deep soil because
    the soil detunes the tag''s antenna. In contrast, SoilTAG can detect moisture
    underground up to 1 m. Past studies have also proposed chipless resonator based
    soil moisture [35], [36], air humidity [37], [38], [39], building wall humidity
    [40], and finger touch sensing technique [19]. Gopalakrishn et al. proposed a
    chipless resonator based soil moisture sensor [36], which employs VNA as the reader
    and requires a bandwidth of 100 MHz (0.875–0.975 GHz). Dey et al. proposed a chipless
    soil moisture sensor that estimates soil moisture based on the channel pulse response
    [35]. Similarly, to sense the humidity of air or building wall [37], [38], [39],
    [40], the researchers designed a special resonator to measure the resonant frequency
    or TDR. However, these systems require large bandwidth and are not suitable for
    widespread IoT devices. In contrast, SoilTAG works in 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi ISM band which
    is the most widely used frequency band. LiveTag [19] designed a chipless Wi-Fi
    tag to sense a finger''s touching or not touching. Different from LiveTag, SoilTAG
    aims to precisely measure fine-grained soil moisture changes. In addition, our
    recent work proposed a reconfigurable design framework for the chipless resonator
    based tag [20], which aims to eliminate the design effort. Similar to the previous
    work, SoilTAG employs DGS resonator as the sensing component. Unlike the previous
    work, SoilTAG aims to develop a dedicated soil moisture sensing system, including
    the robust moisture sensing feature selection, the new resonator hardware design
    optimization for improving the sensing accuracy, the theoretical analysis of maximum
    working range, and new antenna design for improving the working range. • Comprehensive
    Comparison: As reported in the literature [10], there are several important design
    considerations in soil moisture sensing system design, including accuracy, sensing
    depth and cost. In addition, we also take the moisture sensing scale into account,
    which is another important factor in practical usage. Table I lists the important
    parameters of most related sensors/systems. The overall cost of SoilTAG includes
    the cost of two commodity Wi-Fi cards, the chipless resonator, and two antennas.
    The price of the tag and antenna is the unit price of producing ten thousand units.
    Table I Comprehensive Comparison to Existing Soil Moisture Sensors/Systems Remarks:
    From Table I, we have the following remarks: 1) Commodity high-end sensors provide
    high accuracy but cannot capture moisture data wireless and also incur a lot of
    labor costs in real applications; 2) The wireless sensing system that employs
    LoRA signal as the sensing medium has the potential for large-scale monitoring
    but has limitations on the power supply for in-ground nodes; 3) Using radar/ultra-wideband
    signal has good sensing resolution in moisture and depth but has a risk of causing
    soil contamination due to battery corrosion in long-term monitoring; 4) Although
    the battery-free sensing system has a limited working range compared with LoRA
    based sensing system, it can be addressed by deploying a lot of tags in a large-scale
    farm since the tag is ultra-low cost and easy to fabricate. It also provides good
    resolution in moisture and depth and reduces maintenance costs. SECTION III. System
    Design This section introduces the system design. In Section III-A, B, and C,
    we present the design of the tag''s resonator for battery-free and low-cost soil
    moisture sensing. In Section III-D, we propose a new moisture sensing feature
    that is robust to the tag location changes. In Section III-E, we propose a light
    weight machine learning based soil moisture estimation model. A. Resonator-Based
    Soil Moisture Sensing To achieve the sensing purpose, the chipless sensing technique
    relies on the passive resonator [17], [45]. Specifically, the soil moisture level
    [46]1 would change the resonator circuit parameters (e.g., the capacitor), thus
    changing the frequency response of the resonator. The passive resonator can be
    realized by various geometrical structures such as defected ground structure (DGS)
    [21], microstrip ring [19], and spiral planar resonator [48]. To simplify the
    design process, we adopt the DGS resonator for soil moisture sensing since it
    has a more simple structure with only two parameters, i.e., the length and width
    of the etched slot. Fig. 4(a) shows the DGS resonator, which is made by printing
    metal strips/surfaces on a substrate. By attaching the ground layer''s DGS structure
    to the soil, the soil moisture can be transduced into the frequency response of
    the resonator. It has three layers including the transmission line on the top
    layer, the substrate in the middle layer, and the metal surface etched with DGS
    on the ground layer. The SMA connectors on both ends are used to connect the antennas
    for receiving and transmitting wireless signal. Fig. 3. Soil moisture θ versus
    Frequency response. Show All Fig. 4. The chipless DGS-based resonator and its
    equivalent circuit. Show All It can be equivalently modeled as an RLC parallel
    resonance circuit as shown in Fig. 4(b). The RLC parallel resonance circuit can
    be viewed as the sensing port as shown in the blue dash line in Fig. 4(b). Placing
    the circuit on the soil is equivalent to connecting the soil with the sensing
    port. The blue part represents the soil''s equivalent impedance Z soil . Z L is
    the impedance of the transmission line. C 1 represents the capacitor between the
    transmission line and the metal ground plane. L c , C c and R c represent the
    equivalent inductor, capacitor and resistor of the defected ground structure.
    Theoretically, the frequency response is the ratio between the output voltage
    and input voltage [49], which can be expressed as: FR(f)=20 log 10 | 2 Z D Z 2
    L +2 Z L +2 Z L Z D +2 Z D +1 |, (1) View Source where Z D is the impedance of
    the DGS resonator and f is the frequency of the input signal. When the resonator
    is attached to the soil, Z D can be expressed as: Z D = 1 1 R c +j2πf C c + 1
    j2πf L c + 1 Z soil – – – – – + 1 j2πf C 1 , (2) View Source As we can see, the
    soil moisture θ determines Z soil , and thus changes the impedance Z D as well
    as the resultant frequency response FR(f) in (1). Simplifying the soil as a capacitor2
    denoted as C soil , then it is equivalent to adding a capacitor in parallel to
    the original resonator circuit. Based on (2), when the imaginary part of impedance
    reaches zero, the circuit reaches resonance. Then, the resonant frequency f c
    can be written as: f c = 1 2π L c ( C 1 + C C + C soil – – – – – ) − − − − − −
    − − − − − − − − − − √ . (3) View Source Thus, the resonant frequency f c is also
    affected by soil moisture. (1) and (3) explain the results shown in Fig. 3, where
    each soil moisture level has a unique frequency response FR(f) and a unique resonant
    frequency f c . In summary, the DGS resonator can convert the soil moisture level
    into the frequency response feature. Next, we show how to design and optimize
    the DGS resonator parameters to increase the frequency response sensitivity to
    soil moisture changes. B. Optimize Resonator Parameters for High Accuracy Moisture
    Sensing As illustrated above, the DGS resonator has three adjustable components
    including the substrate, the transmission line, and the DGS structure, which determine
    the resulting frequency response. We detail the design of the three components
    below. 1) Substrate Selection and Transmission Line Design To reduce the tag''s
    cost, the substrate employs inexpensive FR4 material and the thickness is designed
    to 1.2 mm, retaining firmness. In addition, to ensure the maximum signal transmission
    and achieve a long working range, the impedance of the transmission line should
    be equal to the antenna''s impedance of 50 Ω . The transmission line''s width
    determines its impedance Z line [49]: Z line = 87 ε r +1.41 − − − − − − − √ ⋅ln(
    5.98H 0.8 w l +T ), (4) View Source where w l is the width of the transmission
    line, ε r is the permittivity of substrate, H is the thickness of substrate, and
    T is the thickness of transmission line. Note that ε r , H and T are known at
    the fabrication process, i.e., ε r =4.4, H =1.2 mm, T =0.036 mm. Given Z line
    =50 Ω , we can calculate the value of w l . For the resonant frequency f c =2.45
    GHz, the width w l is 2.24 mm. The length only determines the phase of the ongoing
    electromagnetic wave and does not impact the resonant frequency. To satisfy the
    soil sensing purpose and save the substrate usage, the length and width of the
    substrate are 100 mm and 30 mm. 2) Optimized Design Process for DGS Size Above
    we introduced how to design the transmission line and substrate. Here, we show
    how to design the DGS''s size to make the frequency response change uniformly
    with the changes in soil moisture levels, so that we can increase the sensing
    sensitivity and accuracy. We tune the DGS''s geometric size since the width and
    length of the DGS determine the equivalent capacitor and inductor of the resonator,
    thereby determining its resonant frequency. The design goal can be formally described
    as finding a proper DGS size to ensure that the frequency responses of different
    soil moisture levels [F R 1 (f, θ 1 ),F R 2 (f, θ 2 ),⋯,F R i (f, θ i )] are as
    evenly distributed as possible within the WiFi band. To this end, the size parameters
    of the DGS structure should be carefully designed. The standard method relies
    on exhaustively searching the optimal parameter through multiple iterations of
    HFSS simulation, which however is time-consuming. To reduce the time cost, a straightforward
    method is to employ an optimization algorithm [51], [52] to optimize the resonator.
    In general, the basic idea of the optimization algorithm is to continuously update
    the population iteratively, so that their fitness values are getting higher and
    higher, that is, getting closer and closer to the optimal solution. However, in
    our implementation, we have two observations 1) the major time consumption comes
    from HFSS simulation, and 2) some parameters in the current generation are directly
    inherited from the former generation. This means the program will repeatedly conduct
    HFSS simulations for the same size parameters. The repeated simulation inevitably
    wastes the computation resource and time. Based on the two observations, we design
    a cache table based acceleration mechanism. Specifically, before the optimization
    program conducts HFSS simulation, it checks whether the current parameter is in
    the built cache table. If not, it will conduct HFSS simulation and record a ternary
    array including length, width, file address termed as {a,w,ind} , else, the program
    will retrieve the file address recorded in the cache table and compute its fitness,
    and then skip to the next individual parameter. By using this cache table, we
    can save time wasted on the repeated HFSS simulation. To achieve this, we present
    the optimization design flow by jointly using MATLAB and HFSS software (Fig. 5(a)).
    Given the soil moisture range [ θ 1 , θ 2 ] , the key to meeting the design goal
    is to make the resonant frequency of the low moisture θ 1 close to high frequency
    boundary or the one that makes the resonant frequency of high moisture θ 2 close
    to the low frequency boundary. Fig. 5. The workflow of the optimization algorithm
    and the parameter convergence process. Show All To do so, we define the fitness
    function as: Fitness= f 2 − f 1 | f i − f 1 |+| f i − f 2 | , (5) View Source
    where f 1 , f 2 are the target frequency boundaries, and f i is the simulated
    resonator frequency of the i - th DGS size individual < a i , w i > . To ensure
    the solved frequency f i is slightly higher than the upper boundary of Wi-Fi band,
    one can set f 1 =2.48 GHz and f 2 =2.5 GHz. The two parameters f 1 , f 2 can be
    set based on the design requirement. Thus the frequency responses can be approximately
    evenly distributed in Wi-Fi band. The optimization algorithm goes through five
    steps: Initialization: Set the population number n and the overall iteration times
    k , randomly initialize a set S with DGS size parameters of < a i , w i > , 1≤i≤n
    , the permittivity range of ε 1 ∼ ε 2 with the corresponding soil moisture scale
    θ 1 ∼ θ 2 in MATLAB.3 Check cache table and call HFSS: Based on these set parameters,
    the MATLAB program firstly checks the cache table and finds individuals that do
    not occur repeatedly. Then it generates a .vbs script to set HFSS project parameters,
    enabling HFSS simulation via .vbs script. HFSS simulation: HFSS simulates the
    frequency response of the DGS model for each size parameter < a i , w i > , 1≤i≤n
    , and saves n frequency responses F R i (f,θ) into a file, records its file address
    and updates the cache table. Fitness calculation: The optimization program reads
    the simulation results and calculates the resonant frequency f i and the fitness
    of each < a i , w i > based on (5). If the number of individuals whose fitness
    is equal to 1, exceeds a ratio β (i.e., 80%) of the population number, then the
    algorithm will obtain the optimal result. Selection, crossover and mutation: The
    optimization program selects the DGS size that corresponds to the n/2 larger fitness
    value as half of the new generation S ′ . Then, the program transforms the decimal
    codes of a,w to binary codes, and performs crossover and mutation to generate
    another half of the population. Then it generates the next generation DGS size
    set S ′ comprised of n/2 current individuals and n/2 new individuals. Repeat Step
    2,3,4,5 until the iteration process end. Finally, the optimization algorithm outputs
    the optimal DGS size. In this optimization algorithm, there are 3 parameters that
    affect the optimization results and the time consumption. The population number
    n , the iteration time k , and the convergence degree β . Too few populations
    will lead to non-convergence of results, while too many populations will lead
    to a low mutation rate and take a long time. In our experience, the population
    number n is set at 40–60. Similarly, the iteration number k is set at 10–15. The
    convergence degree β is determined by the design requirement. If one wants most
    individuals to satisfy the design requirements, the β should be set at 80%–100%.
    If the requirements are not too stringent, the β can be set at 20%–50%. Smaller
    β will reduce the optimization time since when the β achieves the preset value,
    the program will end even if the program has not executed the preset number of
    iterations. To visualize the process, we show the convergence process of parameters
    in Fig. 5(b), where the x-y plane represents the size parameter < a,w > and z
    -axis represents the iteration times. It shows that the < a,w > gradually converges
    to a smaller range with the iteration time increasing. Fig. 5(c) shows the mean
    error of each generation''s individuals. It is clear that the error gets close
    to zero when the iteration process reaches the 12th generation. It is noted that
    in our current implementation, the population is set at 60 and the iteration time
    is set at 15. Such a setting can output a good size parameter in 5 hours. In addition,
    by counting the number of repeated simulations in the optimization process, we
    found that if disabling the cache table, the number of simulations that HFSS needs
    to perform is 720 times (60 × 12), while enabling the cache table, HFSS only needs
    to perform 259 times, reducing 461 repeated simulations and saving about 64% of
    the time. Fig. 6. The frequency responses measured via VNA. Show All Fig. 7. The
    results of two-resonators tag design. Show All Fig. 8. The relative frequency
    response feature for soil moisture sensing. Show All After the five steps, the
    designed DGS resonator is ready for fabrication and testing. C. Extend The Soil
    Moisture Sensing Scale In order to cover the most suitable soil moisture scale
    (i.e., 20% ∼ 60%) for the growth of most plants, we introduce multiple resonators
    to customize the soil moisture sensing range. To do so, the soil moisture can
    be divided into 8 segments. Each resonator is responsible for detecting one moisture
    segment. To flexibly design the tag for a specific range, one can integrate different
    resonators into one tag. In theory, the sensing soil moisture scales can be divided
    as 0% ∼ 23%, 23% ∼ 30%, 30% ∼ 40%, 40% ∼ 50%, 50% ∼ 60%, 60% ∼ 70%, 70% ∼ 80%
    and 80% ∼ 90%, and customize the resonator size for each segment by using the
    design process shown in the previous subsection. However, in practical measurement,
    we test moisture no more than 67% since the soil approaches saturation when the
    water content is close to 60%. Fig. 6(a) shows the intrinsic frequency responses
    of 8 resonators. The geometric size of the eight resonators is a = {10,7,6,4.9,4.9,4.1,4.2,4}(mm)
    and w = {0.1,1,1,1,0.64,0.6,0.9,0.9}(mm) . To demonstrate the feasibility of this
    idea, we integrate # 2 and # 3 resonators into the same substrate. The simulation
    and testing results (Fig. 7(a) and (b)) show two different notches in the frequency
    response curves, which represent two resonators. Fig. 7(a) shows the simulation
    results – R1 for sensing 28.5%–32.5% and R2 for sensing 18.5%–23.5%. Fig. 7(b)
    shows the results measured with VNA - R1 for 21%–24% and R2 for 28%–31%. We can
    see that the actual frequency responses of the 8 moisture levels are basically
    consistent with the simulated results, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-resonator
    tag on sensing different moisture ranges.4 Further, we evaluate the accuracy of
    #1–#6 resonators for sensing 0%–67% soil moisture [53] in Section VI-B. The experimental
    results show that the 90th percentile sensing error is lower than 2%, verifying
    that the multiple resonators based tag is able to work in the most suitable moisture
    scale for the growth of most plants. D. Robust Soil Moisture Sensing Feature In
    the previous section, we designed the tag''s resonator that can convert soil moisture
    into the frequency response feature. However, when there are changes in the tag''s
    location, the distance between transceivers and the tag will change, resulting
    in variations in the channel frequency response. Thus, we may suffer from large
    sensing errors if using the absolute amplitude of the channel frequency response.
    To cope with this problem, we propose a new sensing feature – the relative frequency
    response, which is independent/robust to tag location changes and only related
    to the soil moisture. To obtain this feature, we first measure a reference power
    amplitude A ref of the frequency response when the tag''s resonator is shorted
    at the deployment stage. During the online measurement, we get another power amplitude
    A tag of the frequency response. Then, the relative frequency response is computed
    as A tag/ A ref . Next, we mathematically prove that the relative frequency response
    A tag / A ref is independent of the tag deployment distance and only related to
    the soil moisture. The idea is also used in existing RFID tag based sensing systems
    [9], [54] which obtain the RSS/phase difference between the sensing tag and the
    reference tag, whereas we compute the relative ratio between two frequency responses.
    The Channel State Information (CSI) represents the wireless channel response,
    mathematically denoted as H . A wireless signal S is typically represented as
    a complex number with amplitude |S| and phase θ , i.e., S=|S|⋅ e jθ . Suppose
    that S tx =| S tx |⋅ e j θ tx is the transmitter''s transmission signal. In practice,
    the received signal S rx is the superimposing of multiple components, because
    the signal also propagates along LoS path and multipath between the transmitter
    and the receiver. Mathematically, it can be formulated as (6) where h 1 is the
    frequency response of Tx-to-Tag channel and h 2 is the frequency response of Tag-to-Rx.
    h 1 and h 2 are directly related to the tag location. h tag is the frequency response
    of tag, which is only related to the soil moisture. When sensing soil moisture,
    the tag''s reflection signal received by Rx can be written as follow: S tag =
    S tx ⋅ h 1 ⋅ h tag ⋅ h 2 =| S tx h 1 h tag h 2 | e j( θ tx + θ 1 + θ tag + θ 2
    ) . (6) View Source And the wireless channel response of Tx-Tag-Rx is: H tag =
    S tag / S tx = h 1 ⋅ h tag ⋅ h 2 . (7) View Source When the tag''s resonator is
    shorted, the tag''s reflection signal received by Rx is: S ref = S tx ⋅ h 1 ⋅
    h 2 =| S tx h 1 h 2 | e j( θ tx + θ 1 + θ 2 ) . (8) View Source And the wireless
    channel response of Tx-Tag-Rx is: H ref = S ref / S tx = h 1 ⋅ h 2 . (9) View
    Source Then, the ratio between H tag and H ref can be written as follow: H tag
    / H ref A tag A ref = | h 1 h tag h 2 | e j( θ 1 + θ tag + θ 2 ) | h 1 h 2 | e
    j( θ 1 + θ 2 ) =| h tag | e j θ tag , =| h tag |. (10) (11) View Source It is
    clear that the relative frequency response is not related to h 1 and h 2 (i.e.,
    the tag location) and only related to the tag h tag . Note that we employ beam
    nulling to reduce the direct channel between Tx and Rx and do not consider the
    impact of the direct channel here. Therefore, by calculating the ratio between
    the power amplitude A tag and A ref , we can get the feature that is not only
    independent of the tag location but also is related to the soil moisture. Further,
    we demonstrate the effectiveness of the relative frequency response feature through
    a real-world experiment. We isolate the direct channel between the transmitter
    and the receiver manually. The transceivers are implemented with WARP software
    radios [55]. We fix the distance between the receiver to the tag and vary the
    Tx-to-Tag distance from 0.5 m to 3 m at a step size of 0.5 m. At each distance,
    we measure the reference CSI amplitude by shorting the resonator and taking another
    CSI amplitude measurement of the normal tag. Then we calculate the ratio of the
    two measurements. The CSI amplitude value is calculated by averaging the CSI amplitude
    of data subcarriers in the Wi-Fi band. Fig. 8(a) shows that the CSI amplitude
    measurements of the tag change significantly by distance variations (the red dashed
    line). In contrast, the relative frequency response (i.e., the ratio shown as
    the gray line) is robust and remains nearly constant over different distances.
    Finally, we examine whether the relative frequency response feature of different
    soil moisture is distinguishable in the Wi-Fi band. Specifically, we measure the
    relative frequency responses of 9 different soil moisture levels 0%, 3%, 5%, 8%,
    10%, 12%, 15%, 18% and 20%. The distance between the transmitter/receiver and
    tag is set at 0.5 m respectively. Fig. 8(b) shows that features of different soil
    moisture levels are distinguishable. With the soil moisture increasing, the relative
    frequency response gets higher. This trend is consistent with the results measured
    by VNA as shown in Fig. 6(b). This result shows that the relative frequency response
    is a robust feature for soil moisture sensing. E. Machine Learning Based Soil
    Moisture Estimation So far, we have designed chipless tags that can convert the
    soil moisture level into the relative frequency response (Fig. 8(b)). Then we
    need a method to identify soil moisture by using these relative frequency responses.
    A simple method is to fit a mapping function between the averaged frequency response
    and the soil moisture [9], as shown in Fig. 9(a). The circles represent the mean
    value of measured frequency response for different soil moisture levels, and the
    dotted line is the fitted exponential polynomial. Given a frequency response measurement,
    one can estimate soil moisture by using this fit function. However, this approach
    works well only when the measured frequency responses of soil moisture are accurate
    (e.g., by using VNA or in a clean environment). In practice, the captured frequency
    responses of the wireless channel are likely to deviate from the actual frequency
    response caused by soil due to direct signal interference between Tx and Rx. Therefore,
    using the fitted function may obtain wrong estimations. To cope with this problem,
    we instead resort to machine learning (ML) based moisture estimation. Recently,
    a lot of wireless sensing works have shown that ML-based classification/regression
    model has good robustness in the task of feature identification [56], [57]. To
    show the effectiveness of ML model in improving the soil moisture estimation accuracy,
    we adopt a non-linear dimension reduction method (named t-SNE [58]) to extract
    the two-dimensional feature of the relative frequency response for each soil moisture.
    Fig. 9(b) plots the two-dimension features of 9 soil moisture levels. It is clear
    that each cluster can distinguish from other clusters. Recall Fig. 8(b) where
    the frequency responses of 5% and 8% moisture are close to each other, while the
    two-dimensional feature clusters of 5% and 8% (the yellow and purple clusters)
    are clearly distinguishable, which can be easily identified. This explains why
    the ML model can improve the estimation accuracy. This task for inferring soil
    moisture can be formulated as a regression problem. Specifically, the process
    goes through two steps. The first step is offline training: we train a regression
    model by collecting the relative frequency response samples of each soil moisture
    level as the training dataset. The second step is an online estimation: we input
    a measured frequency response sample into the regression model, then the model
    will output the estimated soil moisture. Next, we show the data collection and
    model selection. Data Collection: To make the system more robust to environmental
    variation, we collect data from the five environments to train a comprehensive
    model. This ensures the diversity of the training dataset. We collect 33200 relative
    frequency responses of different soil moisture levels in five environments. The
    five environments are 1) the anechoic chamber which is a static environment without
    multipath; 2) the open room which is a static environment with less multipath;
    3) the home courtyard with less multipath and human motion; 4) the open farmland
    with the static environment; 5) the office room with the more multipath and static
    environment. In each environment, we collect the training dataset and test dataset,
    termed as S i ={ S train , S test },1≤i≤5 . The feature dimension of relative
    frequency response is 1×N and N is the number of subcarriers. In our implementation,
    we select 246 frequency subcarriers across the entire Wi-Fi band with 312.5 KHz
    space between two adjacent frequency subcarriers. The feature vector x and label
    y of training data <x,y> can be formally written as <[ A 1 , A 2 ,..., A 246 ],θ>
    , where A i is the relative frequency response of i - th subcarrier computed from
    (11) and θ is the soil moisture value. ML Model Selection: In order to achieve
    better soil moisture estimation accuracy in different environments, we test 9
    regression models including Linear regression (Linear), Ridge regression (Ridge),
    Lasso regression (La), Elastic Net (EN), Decision Tree (DT), KNN, Random Forest
    (RF), XGBoost (XGB), and Support Vector Machine (SVM). We compare the estimation
    accuracy of 9 models in 5 environments respectively. The comparison results are
    shown in Section VI-C7 and Fig. 25. We find that three models (DT, XGB, and KNN)
    perform better than other models in all five environments. In addition, the XGBoost
    performs best in the commodity Wi-Fi cards based soil moisture sensing system,
    as shown in Fig. 27(b). Finally, we select the XGB model as the moisture estimation
    model. Fig. 9. (a) shows the fitted function based soil moisture estimation method.

    In this section, we first analyze the system''s theoretical maximum working range
    and identify key parameters that have a great impact on the system''s working
    range. Then, we propose solutions to tune those parameters to improve the working
    range of SoilTAG. A. Theoretical Working Range Analysis Following existing backscatter
    studies [59], [60], we model SoilTAG as a bistatic radar. According to the radar
    equation [24], the received signal power can be modeled as: P r = P t G t G r
    λ 2 σ (4π ) 3 d 4 , (12) View Source where P t is the transmission power, G t
    is the transmitting antenna gain, G r is the receive antenna gain, λ is the signal
    wavelength, d is the distance from Radar to the target and σ is the radar cross
    section of the target. SoilTAG has a bistatic setup with two splitting links,
    called the downlink from Tx to Tag, and the uplink from Tag to Rx as shown in
    Fig. 10(a), where d down is the distance of the downlink, d up is the distance
    of the uplink. For the downlink, the received power of the tag can be modeled
    as: P tag = P t G t G ant λ 2 (4π d down ) 2 . (13) View Source Similarly, for
    the uplink, the received power of Rx can be modeled as: P r = P tag G tag G ant
    G r λ 2 (4π d up ) 2 , (14) View Source where G ant is the tag''s antenna gain
    and G tag is the transmission efficiency of the tag''s DGS resonator. Therefore,
    the working distance can be calculated as: d down ⋅ d up = P t G t G ant G tag
    G ant G r λ 4 P r − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − − √ =D, (15) View Source
    where, D is a constant for a given configuration, i.e., transmission power, antenna
    gain, and frequency band. From the above equation, we have three observations:
    When the Tx and Rx are co-located, the maximum range for both the uplink and downlink
    is d up = d down = D − − √ when the self-interference between Tx and Rx is well
    canceled. When the locations of Tx and Rx are fixed, which is a more realistic
    setup in reality where only the tag moves, the maximum working range of uplink
    and downlink is limited by d up ∗ d down ≤D . The downlink distance is inversely
    proportional to the uplink distance under the same transmission power. Thus, to
    increase the downlink distance, the uplink distance should be reduced, and vice
    versa. For example, Fig. 10(b) shows the theoretical and measured working range
    of downlink and uplink, which is consistent with this observation. In practice,
    it is challenging to achieve the maximum working rang D − − √ for both the uplink
    and downlink, due to the strong self-interference when Tx and Rx are co-located.
    To avoid strong self-interference, our system uses the bistatic setup where transceivers
    are placed separately. Next, we show a numerical analysis of the impact of different
    system parameters on the working range when transceivers are separated by 4 m
    ( ≈ 12 ft). These analysis results help determine the optimal parameter setting
    for different application scenarios. According to (15), the parameters P t , G
    t , G ant , G tag , G r ,λ, P r have a great impact on the working range. In our
    implementation, some parameters are fixed: G tag =−23dB , G t = G r =8dBi , P
    r =−95dBm which is the minimum received power, called receiver sensitivity. Thus,
    we analyze the impact of P t , G ant , and λ on the working range. Coverage area
    under different transmission power P t : Fig. 11 shows that a higher transmission
    power can increase the sensing/working coverage, which is a well-known result.
    However, our new observation is that the maximum working range area is not centered
    at the transmitter like the traditional communication system, since the range
    is still constrained by the receiver as shown in (15). Coverage area under different
    tag antenna gain G ant : Fig. 12 shows that a high gain antenna for the passive
    tag has a great improvement on the sensing coverage area.5 It suggests that the
    tag should be configured with a high-gain antenna to increase the sensing coverage
    area. Coverage area under different frequency bands (i.e., signal wavelength λ
    ): Fig. 13 compares the coverage area of using 2.4 GHz and 5.8 GHz Wi-Fi bands.
    As we can see, the system has a larger coverage area when using the 2.4 GHz band
    than the 5.8 GHz band. This is because 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi signal has a longer wavelength
    which can easily bypass obstacles, helping to increase the sensing range. This
    result indicates that 2.4 GHz band is more suitable for sensing soil moisture
    in the greenhouse scenario. In summary, we have analyzed the maximum working range
    of SoilTAG and identified three key factors (the transmission power, the antenna
    gain of tag, and the signal frequency band) that have a great impact on the working
    range. The analysis provides an important system deployment guide in the real
    world for meeting the working range and coverage requirements. Next, we show how
    to improve the working range of SoilTAG by boosting these three parameters. B.
    Improve The Working Range Based on the above analysis, we improve the working
    range by (i) using the 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi band, (ii) increasing the transmission power
    via beamforming at the transceiver side [19], [20], and (iii) designing a high
    gain tag antenna. In this section, we focus on the high gain tag antenna design.
    A simple approach is using a commodity high gain antenna such as horn antenna
    RFMAX [61] or employing the large phased-array antenna. However, the commodity
    horn antenna is not only expensive ( ∼ $ 144) for large-scale deployment but also
    hard to be integrated with the resonator. Another approach is using a large phased
    array, but it requires multiple expensive phase shifters and the chip (e.g, FPGA)
    to control the phase setting, which is also infeasible for the battery-free tag.
    To harvest the benefits of high gain and low cost, we choose the printed patch
    array antenna [62], which consists of multiple metal patches printed on the low-cost
    FR4 material substrate. Moreover, the patch array antenna has the advantages of
    easy fabrication, low cost, and flexibility to suit different types of tags. In
    designing the tag antenna for SoilTAG, the key is a trade-off between the gain
    and the geometric size. On one hand, we want to keep the antenna as small as possible.
    On the other hand, a high antenna gain requires many patches, which increases
    the antenna size and the overall cost [49]. Finally, based on our experience,
    we designed a 4×4 patch array antenna for achieving a high gain and a relatively
    small antenna size. Compared with an omnidirectional antenna, it has an improvement
    of ∼ 10 dBi while costing no more than $ 15 based on the manufacturer''s price
    estimation. Fig. 14(a) shows the fabricated patch array antenna with a size of
    31×31 cm 2 . To ensure a good impedance matching state in Wi-Fi band, we measure
    the return loss of the antenna using VNA. Fig. 14(b) shows that the antenna''s
    return loss is lower than -10 dB in 2.3 ∼ 2.7 GHz, demonstrating it has a transmission
    efficiency of over 90% in 2.4 ∼ 2.5 GHz Wi-Fi band. Fig. 14(c) shows the radiation
    pattern of the designed antenna. We can see that it achieves a maximum gain of
    16.8 dBi at 2.45 GHz. In summary, by designing a proper high gain antenna design,
    we can improve the working range of SoilTAG. SECTION V. Implementation SoilTAG
    system consists of three components: the chipless tag, Wi-Fi transceiver, and
    the backend soil moisture estimation software. Next, we present the implementation
    of three components. Chipless tag: The chipless tag is comprised of a DGS resonator
    and two antenna connectors as shown in Fig. 15(a). The chipless resonator is wrapped
    in a waterproof box that can be buried in the soil as shown in Fig. 15(b). To
    produce the resonator, we first design the DGS resonator of the chipless tag by
    the design method proposed in Section III-B. A laminate board consists of two
    copper layers and the dielectric substrate in between. We employ standard PCB
    milling technology to fabricate the 2D layout of the conductive layer on one side
    of the laminate, whereas the back side is directly used as the ground layer. The
    substrate is low-cost FR4 material with a thickness of 1.2 mm. The width of the
    transmission line is 2.24 mm. The two antennas are connected to the DGS resonator
    through two RF cables. To sense soil moisture, the user can bury the chipless
    resonator in the soil at a deep depth while keeping the antenna in the air for
    a long working range. Transceivers: We employ two types of devices as transceivers.
    To implement the beam-forming mechanism, we use the WARP software radio which
    works at 2.4 GHz with 80 MHz spectrum. The transmitter is configured with an 8-antennas
    linear array (Fig. 16(a)) to perform beam scanning and the receiver is configured
    with a 4-antennas linear array (Fig. 16(b)). The beam scanning implementation
    program is the same as our recent work [20]. The transmission power is set at
    lower than 30 dBm. In addition, to show the feasibility of sensing soil moisture
    using commercial Wi-Fi cards (Fig. 16(c)), another kind of transceiver is implemented
    with Intel 5300 NIC as the transmitter and Athero 9580 NIC as the receiver together
    with PicoScenes platform [63]. Backend implementation: Our CSI data processing
    and soil moisture estimation algorithm are implemented in MATLAB and Python code
    respectively. We use a laptop with a 2.3 GHz CPU (Intel i7-10875H) and 16 GB memory
    to run our software. The laptop is connected to WARP radios through a switch and
    Ethernet cables, and they communicate using WARPLab mode [64]. SECTION VI. Evaluation
    A. Experimental Method Definition of the Soil Moisture, Sensing Accuracy and Ground
    Truth: We use the gravimetric water content (GWC%) as the definition of soil moisture,
    which equals the mass of water divided by the mass of dry soil [13]. The sensing
    accuracy is defined as the absolute error between the estimated soil moisture
    and the ground truth. Two methods are used for measuring the ground truth moisture
    of different amounts of soil. Oven-based dry weigh method for a small amount of
    thin soil: In order to acquire the ground truth moisture as accurately as possible,
    we use the oven-based dry weigh method to make the soil samples (Fig. 17). However,
    this method can only deal with a small amount of soil since the whole process
    is complex. Specifically, we need to first dry the soil in the oven and then add
    the exact amount of water to the soil according to the desired soil moisture level.
    Finally, we need to stir it evenly with a stirring rod. Dedicated moisture sensor
    for deep and a large amount of soil: To measure the ground truth moisture of deep
    and a large amount of soil, we use the dedicated soil moisture measurement device
    [42] and also bury our tag close to the dedicated device, as shown in Figs. 18
    and 19. To avoid ground-truth measurement errors, we calibrate the moisture sensor
    using a standard soil calibration setting. We select the organic soil since the
    soil used in experiments was taken from organic farmland. As illustrated in Section
    III-E, we collect the training dataset and test dataset in five environments.
    In all environments, we bring the soil samples into the experiment area to conduct
    testing. To measure the soil moisture at different depths, we punched holes in
    the side of the plastic box and inserted the sensor into the soil. The position
    of the hole is where the tag is placed, which ensures that the soil moisture we
    measure is the soil moisture value sensed by the tag, as shown in Fig. 18. The
    plastic box has a size of 53 cm×40 cm×28 cm (Fig. 18(a)) for evaluating sensing
    accuracy at depths of 5 cm, 15 cm, and 25 cm. The acrylic box has a size of 30cm×30cm×100cm
    (Fig. 18(b)) for evaluating sensing accuracy at depth of 1 m. The experimental
    setup is shown in Fig. 20 where Tx and Rx are placed at 4 m space. Experiment
    Road Map: We first evaluate the overall sensing accuracy of SoilTAG for three
    types of soil. Next, we evaluate the impact of several factors on the sensing
    accuracy in Section VI-C including 1) the effect of the patch array antenna, 2)
    the effect of the beamforming, 3) the impact of tag antenna''s orientation, 4)
    the depth of tag buried into the soil, 5) the impact of Tx-to-Tag distance, 6)
    the impact of human motion around the system, 7) the impact of different ML models,
    and 8) the impact of different environments. Then, we evaluate the sensing accuracy
    using commercial Wi-Fi cards in Section VI-D. Finally, we conduct a case study
    to evaluate the performance of SoilTAG through continuous soil moisture monitoring.
    B. Overall Accuracy of Soil Moisture Sensing We evaluate the sensing accuracy
    of three types of soil – loam soil, clay soil, and sandy soil. The soil samples
    are prepared by the dry weight method, which is shown in Fig. 17. The tag is attached
    to the soil samples’ surface. Note that we test different types of soil with different
    moisture ranges. Because the water absorption capacity of different soil is quite
    different. For example, the water absorption capacity order of the following three
    soil is clay > loam > sand. At a low moisture level, it is hard to make the clay
    soil sample with an even moisture distribution due to its strong water absorption
    capacity. At a high moisture level, the sand soil becomes a mixture of soil and
    water with a lot of liquid. Thus, to avoid the ground truth error for clay and
    sand soil, we set the moisture range of clay soil at 20%–50% and the moisture
    range of the sand soil at 10%–30%. For the loam soil, we set its moisture range
    at 0%–67% due to its relatively good (i.e., medium) water absorption capacity
    which covers the maximum moisture range and more extreme moisture level. Moreover,
    loam soil is the most common type in farms for most plants. Accuracy of Loam Soil:
    For loam soil, we set 30 moisture levels from 0% to 67%. For each soil moisture
    level, we collect 100 data packets and extract the relative frequency response
    features. Then, we input these features into a well-trained regression model to
    estimate the soil moisture. Fig. 21(a) shows the estimated soil moisture value
    and the ground truth. As we can see, the standard deviation estimation error is
    only ± 2%. We compute the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of estimation
    errors, which is plotted with the red curve in Fig. 21(b). We find that the 90th
    percentile estimation error is 1.9%. Accuracy of Clay Soil and Sand Soil: For
    the two types of soil, we prepare four moisture levels. Fig. 22 plots the mean
    error (marked as the red circle), the maximum absolute error (marked as the gray
    bar), and the standard deviation of errors (marked as the red bar). Fig. 22(a)
    shows the sensing results of clay soil. The standard deviation estimation errors
    are no more than 0.5%. Fig. 22(b) shows the sensing results of sandy soil. The
    STD of errors is no more than 1.65%. In addition, we can see that the absolute
    error at 20% for clay soil and the absolute error at 15% are large, up to 5%.
    The high absolute error comes from occasional abnormal measurements, possibly
    due to experimental operation errors, such as poor contact between the tag and
    the soil, or uneven soil sample moisture. Statistically, the maximum error occurs
    very rarely. Thus the results demonstrate that the designed tag can achieve high
    accuracy in moisture sensing for different types of soil. C. Impact of System
    Parameters and Environment Noise We discuss the improvement of the tag''s high
    gain antenna and beam-forming on the working range, the impact of different system
    parameters (e.g., the tag''s deployment depth and range) and the environmental
    noise (e.g., the moving objects around the setup) on the sensing accuracy. 1)
    Effect of Tag''s Antenna on Working Range To boost the tag''s reflection signal,
    we designed a patch array antenna for the tag shown in Section IV-B. In this experiment,
    we aim to evaluate the effect of patch array antenna on improving the working
    range. Specifically, we compare the patch array antenna against a commodity omnidirectional
    dipole antenna which has a 5 dBi radiation gain. The main beams of the transmitter
    and receiver point to the tag''s two antennas. The Tx-Tag distance changes at
    a step size of 1 m. The soil samples are prepared by using oven-based dry weigh
    method. Fig. 23(a) reports how the sensing error varies with distance when the
    tag is equipped with the two types of antennas. For the omnidirectional antenna,
    we can see that even within 1 m Tx-Tag distance, the sensing error is more than
    10%. When the Tx-Tag distance is over 3 m, the sensing accuracy gets worse because
    the relative frequency response features are indistinguishable. In contrast, when
    the tag is configured with the patch array antenna, the working range can achieve
    7 m that keeping the estimation error less than 5%. This is because the received
    signal and the reflection signal of the patch array antenna are much stronger
    than that of the omnidirectional antenna. For the omnidirectional antenna, when
    the SNR of tag''s reflection signal gets worse and even reaches the noise floor,
    the obtained relative frequency response will be invalid. 2) Effect of Beamforming
    on Working Range To evaluate the effect of the beamforming mechanism on improving
    the working range, we compare the sensing error with and without the beamforming.
    The tag is configured with the patch array antenna and is placed in front of the
    transmitter''s antenna array ( 0 ∘ direction). The transmitter''s main beam is
    fixed at 0 ∘ direction. The Tx-Tag distance increases from 1 m to 11 m at a step
    of 2 m. The soil samples are prepared by using oven-based dry weigh method. Fig.
    23(b) reports the sensing error under different Tx-Tag distances. We find that
    in the case without beamforming, the working range where the sensing error keeps
    lower than 5% is about 3 m. In contrast, in the case of using beamforming, the
    working range can reach 9 m. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of the
    beamforming in improving the working range. In addition, we find that the sensing
    error also increases with the Tx-Tag distance increasing. The reasons are twofold.
    One is that the received signal strength of the tag gets weaker when moving the
    tag away from Tx. The other is the presence of weak LoS signal leakage from Tx''s
    side lobes to Rx since the beam-nulling can not totally isolate the direct path
    between Tx and Rx. Despite that, the beamforming technique can still improve the
    working range significantly. 3) Impact of Tag Antenna''s Orientation In a real
    deployment, multiple tags are placed around a pair of transceivers. Here we examine
    how the sensing accuracy changes when the tag''s antennas are placed in different
    orientations relative to Tx. We change the orientation of the tag''s antenna relative
    to Tx and measure the frequency responses while fixing the tag''s transmitting
    antenna in 0 ∘ direction relative to Rx. The 0 ∘ indicates that the two antennas
    are facing each other. The directions are set at − 90 ∘ ,− 60 ∘ ,− 30 ∘ , 0 ∘
    , 30 ∘ , 60 ∘ , 90 ∘ . The distance between Tag and Tx is set at 1 m, 3 m, and
    5 m. The soil samples are prepared by using oven-based dry weigh method. Fig.
    24(a) shows the sensing error under different antenna orientations. By observing
    the two figures, we have two remarks: 1) The sensing error changes with the tag''s
    orientation changes, which is consistent with the beam pattern of the patch array
    antenna. 2) As the distance increases, the sensing errors at 0 ∘ keeps almost
    unchanged while other orientations’ error increase. This is because as the orientation
    of the main beam deviates from the Tx''s main beam and the distance gets farther,
    the received signal strength at the tag decreases while the strength of the noise
    signal remains almost unchanged, i.e., the SNR decreases, resulting in higher
    sensing errors. 4) Impact of The Deployment Range The tags may be deployed at
    various ranges away from the transceivers, which may affect the sensing accuracy.
    Thus, we discuss the impact of a tag''s working range on moisture sensing accuracy.
    The soil samples are prepared by using oven-based dry weigh method. The transmitter
    and receiver are placed at a separation of 4 meters. We fix the Rx-Tag distance
    and change the Tx-Tag distance from 0.3 m to 13.9 m at a step size of 0.8 m by
    moving the tag''s receiving antenna. At each distance, we collect 500 packets
    for each soil moisture level and calculate estimation errors. Fig. 24(b) shows
    the CDF of moisture estimation errors under different Tx-tag distances. We have
    two observations. First, when the Tx-to-Tag distance is less than 6.7 m, SoilTAG
    achieves high accuracy with the 90th percentile moisture estimation errors of
    1.78%. Second, the sensing accuracy decreases with the increase in distance. Overall,
    SoilTAG still achieves a 90th percentile of sensing error of 8% even when the
    working range is 13.9 m. 5) Impact of The Sensing Depth As illustrated before,
    the root depth of some plants (e.g., trees) can reach over 75 cm. Thus, in practical
    usage, the tag is buried in the soil at a relatively deep location. To evaluate
    the working depth of SoilTAG, we bury tags at depth levels of 5 cm, 15 cm, 25
    cm, and 1 m respectively to measure the sensing accuracy. The tag has a resin
    material coat to prevent it from shorting the circuit by the soil/water, as shown
    in Fig. 15(b). To measure the soil moisture at the depth of 5 cm, 15 cm, and 25
    cm, we use a plastic box full of soil (shown in Fig. 18(a)). To measure the soil
    moisture at the depth of 1 m, we fabricate an acrylic box full of soil, which
    has a size of 30 cm × 30 cm × 100 cm (shown in Fig. 18(b)). Then, we bury a tag
    into the soil at the box''s bottom (1 m depth). The system automatically collects
    data every half an hour. At the same time, we measure the ground truth of soil
    moisture at the four depths using the dedicated sensor. Fig. 24(c) shows the boxplot
    of soil moisture estimation errors at four depth levels. We can see that SoilTAG
    achieves median error of 9.9%, 2.58%, 1.4%, and 2.14% at the depth of 5 cm, 15
    cm, 25 cm, and 1 m respectively. By observing the measurements, we discovered
    that our system''s soil moisture estimate values are rather steady at four depths,
    whereas the sensor''s readings at the depth of 5 cm are lower than SoilTAG''s
    estimation. As a result, the estimation error at a depth of 5 cm seems to be higher
    than 15 cm, 25 cm, and 1 m. The reason is that deep soil moisture is more homogeneous
    and steady. This means that both the tag and the sensor must be in full contact
    with the soil in order to acquire a more accurate soil moisture measurement in
    practice. In addition, by observing the error at depths of 15 cm, 25 cm, and 1
    m, we find there is no correlation between the sensing accuracy and the sensing
    depth. Therefore, this result verifies that SoilTAG can reach 1 m sensing depth,
    showing the potential of SoilTAG to work in a deeper depth. 6) Impact of The Environmental
    Variations In real application scenarios, environmental variations, such as the
    movement of the human body, would cause dynamic multipath, which may result in
    estimation errors. Thus, we evaluate the impact of environmental variations on
    sensing accuracy. To create a dynamic environment, we ask one person to move nearby
    the experiment deployment. The continuous movement results in occasional direct
    signal blockage and dynamic multipath interference which forms a more complex
    real environment. The distance between the moving person and transceivers is within
    0.2 ∼ 1 m, and the person continuously walks around during the data collection
    period. For each soil moisture sample, we collect 2500 packets with and without
    human motion and then calculate the estimation errors. The soil sample is the
    plastic box full of soil (Fig. 18(a)) that is brought into the experiment area.
    The sensing tag is buried at the depth of 15 cm. We inserted the commercial sensor
    probe into the hole on the side of the box and measured the moisture ground truth
    at the tag position. Fig. 24(d) shows the CDF of soil moisture estimation errors
    with and without human motion. Compared with the static environment, the 90th
    estimation error increases from 2% to 8% when there is human motion. Because human
    movement would introduce dynamic interference signals, the direct signal from
    Tx to Rx increases, resulting in the relative frequency response features being
    inaccurate. Thus the estimation error in a dynamic environment is higher than
    that in a static environment. Overall, SoilTAG still achieves 90th percentile
    error of 8% in a dynamic environment. 7) Impact of Different Machine Learning
    Models To analyze the sensing accuracy when using different ML models, we use
    9 ML models to estimate moisture for five environments respectively. Specifically,
    in each environment, the training dataset and the test dataset each accounted
    for half of the total dataset. For each environment, we prepare new soil samples
    using the oven-based dry weigh method and attach the tag to the soil samples’
    surface to measure the frequency responses of each moisture. The experiments are
    carried out with 5 ∘ C ∼ 30 ∘ C air temperature spanning four seasons. In the
    five environments, the Tx-Tag distance is set at 3 m. Fig. 25 shows the sensing
    accuracy results. We find that in all environments, the three models (i.e., Decision
    Tree, XGB, and KNN) perform better than other models. In addition, we also find
    that the XGBoost model performs best in the experiment where two commodity Wi-Fi
    cards are used as the transceiver. The two results show XGBoost model can achieve
    the most accurate estimation result in the five environments, and thus is selected
    as the estimation model for the current system. 8) Impact of Different Types of
    Environments To analyze the impact of different multipath environments on sensing
    accuracy, we take the sensing result of XGBoost model for the five kinds of environments.
    Fig. 26 shows the boxplot of the soil moisture estimation error in the five environments.
    We can see that the median error for all environments is 0%, demonstrating our
    system''s high accuracy in soil moisture sensing. The anechoic chamber achieves
    the lowest sensing error since it is a clean environment without multipath-related
    direction signal leakage and human motion. Except for the anechoic chamber, the
    sensing errors in real scenarios have a slight increase. This is because there
    is static/dynamic multipath-related direct signal leakage from Tx to Rx due to
    the complex multipath or frequent human motions around the experiment area. Despite
    that, the 10th – 90th percentile errors are lower than 2%, implying that SoilTAG
    is suitable for the common soil moisture sensing application scenarios, e.g.,
    the farmland, courtyard, etc. D. Soil Moisture Sensing With Commercial Wi-Fi Card
    To show the feasibility of sensing soil moisture with commodity Wi-Fi cards, we
    conduct this experiment with two Wi-Fi cards (i.e., Intel 5300 as Tx and Athero
    9580 as Rx) and use PicoScenes platform [63] to collect CSI. The two cards’ working
    frequency is tuned in 2.4–2.48 GHz band through a script program to achieve hopping
    channels. We prepare soil samples with 10 moisture levels from 5% to 50% at a
    step size of 5% using oven-based dry weigh method. We collect ∼ 800 frequency
    responses for each soil moisture level. The data collection is conducted twice
    – the first is to collect the training samples and the second is to collect the
    testing samples. To illustrate the relative frequency responses measured by WiFi
    cards, we plot the relative frequency responses of 5%, 10%, 15%, and 20% in Fig.
    27(a). It is clear that they are distinguishable in 2.4–2.48 GHz. Then, we use
    the ML model to estimate the soil moisture of the testing samples. Finally, we
    compute the sensing accuracy and find the sensing accuracy over 83.8% as shown
    in Fig. 27(b). This result demonstrates that SoilTAG can also work with commodity
    Wi-Fi devices to achieve a high sensing accuracy. E. Case Study: Continuously
    Soil Moisture Monitoring Finally, we conduct a case study to monitor continuous
    changes in soil moisture. We bury the tag into the soil at the depth of 15 cm
    to detect soil moisture because the moisture at this depth does not change too
    fast or too slowly during a long period according to practical experience. The
    tag has a resin material coat to prevent it from shorting circuit by the soil.
    The MATLAB program automatically collects CSI data every half an hour. In order
    to measure the ground truth, we manually measure the soil moisture every half
    an hour using high accuracy commodity sensor. Fig. 28 plots the soil moisture
    in two weeks. The blue line is the ground truth and the red dotted line is the
    estimated value of our system. We can see that there are estimation deviations
    during the long-term monitoring but has the same changing trend as the ground
    truth value. The maximum error is only 2.38% and the mean error is 0.33%. In addition,
    we can see that the ground truth soil moisture decreased by 5.5% from 22.5% to
    17%. Most cheap soil sensors cannot accurately detect such small changes in soil
    moisture. Actually, for some plants, slight soil moisture changes would affect
    their growth. Such application requires a system that is able to detect small
    changes in soil moisture, to tell the farmer to irrigate the plant timely. This
    result demonstrates our system is capable of continuously monitoring soil moisture
    changes on real-world farms. Fig. 25. The soil moisture estimation error when
    using different ML models. Show All Fig. 26. The soil moisture estimation error
    in five environments. Show All Fig. 27. Soil moisture sensing with commodity Wi-Fi
    cards. Show All SECTION VII. Discussion • Calibration cost: SoilTAG exploits the
    relative frequency response to remove the impact of distance. Thus, in real applications,
    we need to collect the reference frequency response of each tag at the deployment
    stage. The user does not need to perform calibration frequently once the devices
    are settled down in an application area. Thus, the calibration cost is low. •
    Working range: The maximum working range of the current SoilTAG is insufficient
    for large open farm fields. Therefore, proper use scenarios are greenhouses or
    indoor vertical farms. To extend the coverage area and apply SoilTAG to large-scale
    farms, a possible solution is to divide the farm into several small areas and
    deploy a pair of transceivers in every area. This solution would enlarge the coverage
    area but at the expense of increasing the overall deployment cost. Fig. 28. Continuously
    soil moisture monitoring. Show All • Work with multi-tags: To work with multiple
    tags, we proposed a spatial direction based tag identification method in the previous
    work [20]. In this work, we employ the same approach as before. Based on this
    method, we can measure the moisture distribution of deep soil at different levels
    by deploying multiple tags at different depths. • Improve the generalizability
    of sensing model: When there are changes in SoilTAG''s deployment setup or the
    RF environment, our machine learning based moisture sensing model needs to be
    retrained for high sensing accuracy in the new setup or the new environment. However,
    the retraining cost of ML models usually is high [65]. To reduce the retraining
    cost, one may improve the generalizability of ML models. For example, one can
    use the transfer learning approach [66] to fine-tune an existing (or pre-trained)
    sensing model for the new setup or the new environment. We will explore this direction
    and improve the generalizability of our moisture sensing model in the future.
    • Make SoilTAG work with the transceiver with a single antenna: In this work,
    the Wi-Fi transceivers used in SoilTAG have multiple antennas and are capable
    of performing digital beamforming. If the transceiver devices have only one antenna,
    they can be configured with the high gain directional antenna to improve radiation
    power. Moreover, a possible self-interference avoidance solution is to make the
    two antennas be polarization orthogonal [67] since the signal goes through a large
    attenuation between two antennas with complete polarization mismatching. • Extend
    SoilTAG to the temperature sensing: In addition to sensing soil moisture level,
    the tag can also be used for sensing temperature. According to the work [68],
    some substrate materials have thermal coefficient of dielectric constant (TCD,
    termed as α ϵ ), which means that the permittivity change ( Δ ϵ r ) of the substrate
    is linearly proportional to temperature changes ( ΔT ) (namely Δ ϵ r / ϵ r = α
    ϵ ∗ΔT ). Therefore, by replacing the current FR4 substrate with other materials
    (e.g., Rogers ), the tag''s resonant frequency and the frequency response feature
    would change with the temperature varying. To verify this feasibility, we fabricated
    a tag with Rogers substrate and measured its frequency responses under different
    temperatures. The results show that the resonant frequency changes by Δf (5.0
    GHz–5.043 GHz) when the temperature changes by ΔT= 9 ∘ C ( 27 ∘ C – 36 ∘ C ).
    By carefully selecting the substrate material, the designed tag can be sensitive
    to a specific temperature range. Therefore, SoilTAG can also be extended to the
    passive temperature sensing application. SECTION VIII. Conclusion This paper presented
    SoilTAG, a chipless Wi-Fi tag based high accuracy, low-cost and in-ground soil
    moisture sensing system. The moisture sensor is a battery-free, passive chipless
    Wi-Fi tag that is low-cost. The key insight of moisture sensing is to convert
    changes in soil moisture level into the frequency response of the tag''s resonator.
    Based on this insight, we designed a DGS-based passive resonator for soil moisture
    sensing and optimized key resonator parameters to increase the frequency response
    sensitivity for sensing even small soil moisture changes. To improve the working
    range, we analyzed the key factors that have impacts on the working range and
    designed a high gain patch array antenna for the tag and realized beam-forming
    at the transceiver side. Extensive experiments show that SoilTAG achieves 90th
    percentile moisture sensing error of 2% , 3.64% , and 8% when the distance between
    the transmitter and the tag is 6 m, 10 m and 13.9 m. The sensing depth can reach
    1 m, covering the root depth of most plants. We believe SoilTAG has promising
    potential for improving the productivity of farm fields and our exploration of
    passive sensor design can enrich other passive sensing applications. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

    is proper water management which can be achieved by using IoT that is by using
    Arduino, raspberry pi, solenoids, moisture sensor, temperature sensor and humidity

    by altering the water supply so that farmers can get good results. This not only
    increases soil fertility but also increases efficiency and decreases water consumption
    which can be used for later usage so the farmers will never face water scarcity.

    of the soil beneath the tree and plants within the domestic cultivate and in case
    the dampness is moo it demonstrates the message and pours water naturally to the
    plants from the water capacity to which it is associated. The exact utilization
    of water system strategy is needed as there may be a requirement of precipitation
    or there may be dried regions. For this cause, a mechanized water system framework
    is utilized in which it is appropriate in all weather conditions. The soil dampness
    detector will sense the water substance and demonstrate either to pump the water
    or not. This will offer assistance to diminish the wastage of water additionally
    makes a difference to grow the plants indeed in the event that the human isn’t
    physically present. The developed IoT framework has been tested in several field
    tests to calculate sensor accuracy, independent monitoring and operation, and
    usability monitoring, and to evaluate its capabilities and functionality. This
    framework appears to have been used effectively for the management and control
    of various water resources: water, groundwater, seawater and wastewater. By extension,
    it has been shown that the frame can be used for long periods without a source
    of control, which will make it a ideal device for using in annual crops. Topics

  description: Irrigation system is widely used in agriculture sector and has significant
    impacts to the growth of the plantation or crops. Traditional method of irrigation
    system always counter problems such as time consuming, human labour cost, inefficient
    of water usage and monitoring challenging throughout the process. Thus to address
    the issues, this paper proposed the development of smart irrigation system that
    embedded various types of sensor and Internet of Things (IoT) platform used for
    monitoring plant growth. In this work, there are three module have been developed
    which are hardware, software and integration module of the proposed system. In
    hardware module, Raspberry Pi is used to calculate and process the data based
    on the sensors parameters. Different types of sensors have been employed such
    as soil moisture, humidity, temperature, ultrasonic and vision sensors. In this
    framework, the reading of soil moisture sensor was obtained from the base station.
    The Raspberry Pi will receive the information and starts to pump the water from
    the tank until the condition of soil moisture content is normal (i.e. reach the
    threshold value). In addition, the DHT22 sensor will act as the monitoring system
    in terms of temperature and humidity data. While, the ultrasonic sensor will send
    the information to the microprocessor and calculate the water level. Furthermore,
    the webcam vision is used for monitoring the plant growth during the day and night.
    While, the dripping process runs in real-time application to the plant. The microcontroller
    ESP8266 used to control the state of ON or OFF light bulb depending on the value
    of LDR sensor. Based on the results and monitoring process, the proposed smart
    irrigation system able to works in promising environment with real time data in
    which it has been monitored through the IoT platform.

  description: The agricultural sector faces several difficulties today in ensuring
    the safety of food supply, including water scarcity. This study presents the design
    and development of a low-cost and full-featured fog-IoT/AI system targeted towards
    smallholder farmer communities (SFCs). However, the smallholder community is hesitant
    to adopt technology-based solutions. There are many overwhelming reasons for this,
    but the high cost, implementation complexity, and malfunctioning sensors cause
    inappropriate decisions. The PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project aims to make digital and
    innovative agricultural technologies more appealing and available to these communities
    by advancing the intelligent irrigation “in-the-box” concept. Considered a vital
    resource, collected data are used to detect anomalies or abnormal behavior, providing
    information about an occurrence or a node failure. To prevent agro-field data
    leakage, this paper presents an innovative, smart, and sustainable low-cost irrigation
    system that employs artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to analyze anomalies
    and problems in water usage. The sensor anomaly can be detected using an autoencoder
    (AE) and a generative adversarial network (GAN). We will feed the autoencoders’
    anomaly detection models with time series records from the datasets and replace
    detected anomalies with the reconstructed outputs. When integrated with an IoT
    platform, this methodology is a tool for easing the labeling of sensor anomalies
    and can help create supervised datasets for future research. In addition, anomalies
    can be corrected by prediction models based on deep learning approaches, applying
    CNN/BiLSTM architecture. The results show that AEs outperform the GANs, achieving
    an accuracy of 90%, 95%, and 97% for soil moisture, air temperature, and air humidity,
    respectively. The proposed system is designed to ensure that the data are of high
    quality and reliable enough to make sound decisions compared to the existing platforms.

    the datasets and replace detected anomalies with the reconstructed outputs. When
    integrated with an IoT platform, this methodology is a tool for easing the labeling
    of sensor anomalies and can help create supervised datasets for future research.
    In addition, anomalies can be corrected by prediction models based on deep learning
    approaches, applying CNN/BiLSTM architecture. The results show that AEs outperform
    the GANs, achieving an accuracy of 90%, 95%, and 97% for soil moisture, air temperature,
    and air humidity, respectively. The proposed system is designed to ensure that
    the data are of high quality and reliable enough to make sound decisions compared
    to the existing platforms. Keywords: IoT; smart farming; anomaly detection; low

    to increase by close to 2 billion by 2050, causing a rapid escalation in food
    demand. To cater to the needs of the increasing population, the agricultural industry
    needs to be modernized, smart, and automated [1]. The food and agriculture organization
    (FAO) [2] claims that small-scale farming significantly contributes to rural economies
    and food security. On the other hand, smallholders usually deal with a range of
    restrictions that reduce their ability to produce profitably and advance the economy
    [3]. However, smallholder farmer communities (SFCs) have not benefited from adopting
    solutions to increase irrigation efficiency because of the high starting costs
    and the high skill levels needed to understand the technology. Recently, the fourth
    industrial revolution (IR 4.0) paradigm shift has ushered in a surge in technological
    innovation and sustainable transformation across various industries and sectors
    [4]. The innovative use of printed sensors for measurement and monitoring in smart
    agricultural applications has garnered considerable attention. Smart farming utilizing
    printed sensors is in its infancy and requires additional research [5]. Significant
    limitations restrict SFCs’ productivity and profit potential. As a result of a
    variety of crucial issues, including a lack of agricultural expertise, financial
    resources, climate change, and market access to address these challenges, we propose
    in this research a low-cost (USD 260) smart farming system for monitoring and
    prediction that will assist SFCs in forecasting future data in order to compute
    their water demands and properly schedule irrigation. The sensor component employs
    a low-cost design that is basic but sturdy and efficient, inspired by various
    do-it-yourself (DIY) initiatives and previous contributions [6,7]. In terms of
    accuracy and error reduction, the system outperforms others. In this context,
    the goal of the PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project [8] is to increase the visibility and
    accessibility of digital and smart agricultural technologies among small and medium-sized
    farms. To meet the needs of this community, the suggested solutions must be economical,
    easy to implement in the field, and, most importantly, adaptable to current agricultural
    techniques. As a result, by inventing a low-cost, smart irrigation control system,
    INTEL-IRRIS hopes to transform the view that SFCs have of what was formerly highly
    expensive technology. INTEL-IRRIS also hopes that by using the “intelligent irrigation
    in a box” idea, they can make smart irrigation systems as easy to set up and use
    as home appliances, with a small investment compared to how much money they make.
    The main objective of this research is to improve on our previous work [3,9] by
    increasing the accuracy of low-cost sensors for data collection so that our water–soil–plants–climate
    interaction models will provide increased accuracy of predicted environmental
    factors to enhance the irrigation efficiency of smallholder farmers. There is
    a current need for our low-cost fog-IoT/AI system, version 1.0, that employs deep
    learning to analyze in real-time the anomalies and problems that appear in low-cost
    sensors. To reach this goal, we propose a low-cost, sustainable irrigation system
    that helps smallholder farmers manage irrigation more efficiently by providing
    a low-cost, open-source, autonomous, and easy-to-use smart irrigation control
    system that takes advantage of IoT capabilities, as shown in Figure 1. Figure
    1. “Intelligent irrigation in a box” idea of PRIMA INTEL-IRRIS project. We will
    implement the “Intelligent Irrigation in a Box” idea by presenting a sensor/ control/actuator-based
    “plug-and-sense” system using significant technological advances from the last
    few years, including IoT, artificial intelligence (AI), and decision support systems
    (DSS). This technology may be linked with existing irrigation infrastructure [10,11],
    allowing it to be controlled according to smallholders’ customs. Using sensor
    technologies, the provided platform collects critical physical phenomena such
    as soil moisture, air temperature, air humidity, water level, water velocity,
    and light intensity using a DL methodology. An unsupervised learning approach
    is well-suited for detecting anomalies, especially in cases with limited labeled
    time-series samples and complex, nonlinear climate and soil patterns. According
    to the literature, the most promising approaches for anomaly detection are Autoencoders
    [12] and GANs [13] in time series. The sliding window technique is highly appropriate
    for predicting future sensor readings through a supervised learning approach.
    Utilizing a hybrid deep learning architecture, combining convolutional and recurrent
    neural networks, enables the attainment of a minimal estimation error for similar
    sequence-to-sequence prediction problems [14]. Consideration is given to a novel
    Fog-IoT-Cloud platform for storing, analyzing, and using vast volumes of acquired
    data to assist SFCs in managing the irrigation mechanism efficiently. This work’s
    main contributions are as follows: (i) The design and development of a low-cost
    fog-IoT/AI system, version 1.0, fully targeted towards smallholder farmer communities
    (SFCs) to enhance irrigation decision making. (ii) We provide a comprehensive
    performance assessment and comparison between the autoencoders (AE) and generative
    adversarial networks (GAN) to detect anomalies in environmental factors data.
    (iii) Predicting the most important environmental factors (air temperature, air
    humidity, soil moisture) based on field sensory data and weather forecast data
    using CNN/BiLSTM architecture to provide SFCs with recommendations. The rest of
    the paper is structured as follows: Section 2 presents a review of the relevant
    literature on irrigation systems. The INTEL-IRRIS fog-IoT/AI system, at the heart
    of the architectural design discussed in this paper, will be presented in Section
    3. Sensor anomaly detection for smart irrigation systems is provided in Section
    4. Section 5 describes the most important environmental factors that can be predicted
    using deep learning. Finally, conclusions and future trends are given in Section
    6. 2. Related Studies In this section, we present a review of the relevant literature
    on irrigation systems. Each of them has focused on various aspects of the irrigation
    task. As illustrated in Table 1, we categorize the studies based on the following
    criteria: (i) Underground sensing: the IOUT requirement emerges partially or fully
    buried underground for real-time monitoring and soil sensing; several essential
    irrigation characteristics include soil moisture, soil texture, soil salinity,
    etc. (ii) Environmental sensing: it is used to monitor important weather pattern
    changes in real-time. (iii) Geographic information systems (GIS): provide a potent
    instrument for near-real-time analysis of crop status. Ground-based equipment,
    aerial drones, and satellites all collect GIS agriculture data. (iv) Soil texture:
    on precision agriculture (PA), we computed the useable reserve of water (RU) based
    on the soil texture (clay, limon, sand, organic matter). (v) Machine learning
    approaches: it indicates whether the study considered machine learning approaches
    for intrusion detection systems. (vi) Deep learning approaches: it specifies if
    the study was focused on deep learning approaches for intrusion detection systems.
    (vii) Low-cost: the objective of the Intel-Irris project is to use low-cost sensors
    by dividing the cost by a factor of 10 to 100. (viii) Anomaly detection: the detection
    of anomalies is a crucial stage that will enhance the quality of results in predictive
    modeling and pattern extraction, enabling the identification of problems and facilitating
    decision making in data-based services. In our previous works [3,9], we suggested
    an Edge-IoT-Cloud platform based on a deep learning methodology for monitoring
    and predicting farmers’ ability to satisfy crop water demands when there is insufficient
    rainfall. Recently, Citoni et al. [15] published a review and analysis of currently
    available LoRaWAN-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) applications for intelligent
    agriculture. Vuran et al. [16] focus only on the underground factors; however,
    environmental sensing and SIG play a very important role in irrigation tasks.
    Optimizing water resources for agricultural production using an automated irrigation
    system has proven feasible and cost-effective, as proposed by Gutierrez et al.
    [17]. Table 1. A comparative analysis between the proposed platform and previous
    platform.   A few scientific studies focus on the application of data processing
    techniques to agricultural data in order to develop a more robust decision support
    framework. Roopaei et al. [22] presented an appropriate approach to identifying
    key parameters to schedule irrigation: the amount of water used was monitored,
    irrigation was scheduled on the basis of the canopy temperature distribution of
    the plant, and data were collected by means of thermal imaging. However, using
    the thermal imaging technique has many drawbacks that affect irrigation scheduling:
    different emissivities and reflections from surfaces obstruct precise temperature
    measurements, and most thermal imaging cameras have ±2% accuracy. Also, thermal
    images are difficult to interpret for specific objects with erratic temperatures.
    Aurora et al. [25], using unsupervised algorithms, devised and tested a three-step
    irrigation system for urban parks. By extracting prior knowledge using a multivariate
    approach, this methodology reduces the time required by univariate anomaly detection
    systems to analyze the entire univariate time series. Goap et al. [19] proposed
    a smart irrigation architecture based on IoT and a hybrid approach that relies
    on DL to predict soil moisture. The proposed algorithm uses sensor data collected
    from recent and past weather forecasts to predict soil moisture. However, environmental
    sensing is not sufficient to make a good irrigation schedule, and the authors
    also do not take into consideration the crop coefficient and the soil texture.
    Chen et al. [26] suggest a new approach for making irrigation decisions in paddy
    rice farming that uses deep Q-learning and short-term weather predictions. The
    new method was compared to the widespread practice of flooded irrigation in southern
    China. The results indicated the reliability of the daily rainfall forecast and
    the efficiency of the Deep Q-Learning strategy for saving water. Boursianis et
    al. [23] discussed the AREThOU5A IoT platform subsystems and their primary operations,
    as well as the deployed layered architecture stack. Within the context of the
    AREThOU5A IoT platform, an innovative method for delivering power to the platform’s
    IoT modules has been implemented. Cheema et al. [24] constructed an intelligent
    system with multiple sensors and devices related to internet of things (IoT) technologies.
    In addition, they developed an Android application called \"Kistan Pakistan\"
    that allows illiterate and low-literate farmers to remotely administer its functions.
    Pham et al. [20] described a low-cost and full edge-IoT/AI system targeting smallholder
    farmer communities and how it can provide the intelligent irrigation “in-the-box”
    concept. It offers an “out-of-the-box” function, meaning that the control component
    that recommends irrigation is integrated into the IoT gateway and, as a result,
    does not need an internet connection, as implemented by WAZIUP partner [27]. In
    contrast to previous research, the current study incorporates four factors to
    improve irrigation efficiency, productivity, quality, profitability, and the sustainability
    of agricultural production. In particular, we take into account the following
    factors: (i) soil texture; (ii) crop coefficient; (iii) sensed data with the weather
    forecast; and (iv) sensing of the subsurface parameter, in this instance, soil
    moisture. The objective is to calculate the requisite water quantity based on
    these variables. 3. Supplying Smallholder Farmers with Smart Technology 3.1. A
    Summary of the INTEL-IRRIS and PNR Projects As stated earlier, INTEL-IRRIS [8]
    aims to make digital and intelligent agricultural technology more appealing and
    accessible to small and medium-sized farms. However, a compromise will be made
    to accomplish the primary aim: to create a low-cost irrigation system that SFCs
    can implement out of the box. The soil moisture sensor component follows a basic,
    resilient, and cost-effective design that has been substantially influenced by
    several do-it-yourself projects and prior contributions [6,20]. Unlike low-cost
    sensors that often offer unreliable data, INTEL-IRRIS will significantly improve
    the quality of collected data with (i) improved calibration of various sensors;
    (ii) the calculation of the needed amount of water based on the farm’s soil texture
    and crop coefficient; and (iii) the prediction of environmental factors based
    on field sensory data using DL. 3.2. Smart and Sustainable Irrigation System Figure
    2 shows how the smart farming system architecture collects, transfers, and processes
    physical parameters from small-scale farming, such as soil moisture, air temperature,
    air humidity, water level, water flows, the intensity of light, combustible gas,
    etc., in order to improve irrigation efficiency by deploying a low-cost, open,
    autonomous irrigation control system based on IoT and AI techniques [28]. The
    irrigation scheduling algorithm determines the amount of water required to maintain
    the maximum production potential without wasting water (i) for a particular crop,
    (ii) at a specified time, and (iii) for a specific soil type. The following section
    summarizes the proposed platform’s details. Figure 2. Global view of our proposed
    operational architecture. 3.3. Hardware Architecture As illustrated in Figure
    2, the network component of our platform is supplied via multi-hop communication
    between box A (the sensor layer) and box B (the gateway node) up to box C (the
    fog layer). Finally, a virtual machine (VM) is created on the Azure cloud to deploy
    multiple anomaly detection and prediction models. In addition to using NRF24L01
    modules for wireless communication and Arduino boards as microcontrollers, we
    also intended to use Raspberry Pi 3 B+ boards as a fog layer. 3.4. Software Architecture
    Using open-source development tools, we created a software architecture to reduce
    bandwidth, latency, cost, load balancing, and scalability, as shown in Figure
    3. Using the Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, communication
    between the gateway and server is established. The TCP transport layer protocol
    ensures dependable data transmission (COAP uses UDP). Because of this, it is encrypted
    with SSL, supports quality of service (QoS parameter 2: requires messages to be
    delivered exactly once), and has a much shorter message header than HTTP. Figure
    3. Global view of our software architectural proposal. 3.5. Box A: Sensing Node
    The sensing node, which depicts the field data gathering tool, falls short of
    the total of USD 140. An Atmega328 microprocessor reads the output from these
    sensors. For around two dollars (USD), it may be used to construct a cheap design
    strategy for the Arduino. As seen in Figure 4, this box’s sensor layer devices
    are designed to collect data from smallholder farmers and transmit it using the
    NRF24L01 radio module, which is available for roughly 5 dollars (USD) and enables
    the supply of a radio communication layer with an SPI interface. The farmer can
    examine the data and keep an eye on the crops in real-time since the data may
    be kept in a private database or in the cloud to construct a dataset. Figure 4.

    and NRF module are in the box. Figure 4 provides a comprehensive description of
    the box’s sensors. We then set the NRF24L01 module to write mode and supply the
    destination address; we read the sensor values using the analogRead function on
    the data pins. The measured data are structured and transmitted to the IoT gateway
    every hour, where historical data are stored to detect anomalies at the fog layer.
    For the power supply of the sensor node, we used rechargeable 9 V batteries. Table
    2 lists the cost of all components. In total, a sensing and actuation node costs
    USD 260. A large portion of the budget is for the cost of box C. Table 2. The
    proposed platform cost. 3.6. Box B: Relay Node The relay node acts as an intermediate
    device and transmits the packets to the IoT gateway. In listening mode, we set
    up the gateway node by supplying the node address from whence the packets come,
    the channel number (122), and the data structure; if the data are received, it
    changes to sending mode, at which stage we provide the address of the next node.
    The power supply of the relay node was improved by using two AA batteries. 3.7.
    Box C: IoT Gateway Fog computing facilitates the operation of computation, storage,
    and networking services between end devices and cloud computing. Box C permits
    data to be transmitted to the internet network, but not for a total of USD 90.
    We picked a Raspberry Pi 3 B+ type board since it has adequate hardware resources
    for processing and is based on the Linux kernel, making it compatible with most
    languages and AI libraries. It needs a 5 V power supply, an external Wi-Fi 802.11
    card, and an Ethernet connector to connect to the internet. We used Python to
    create a concurrent TCP server (one thread per request), and we started by loading
    the prediction models from disk into the main memory (the kind of “*.tflite” files
    after the conversion to Tensorflow Lite). When a request comes in, a thread handles
    the receiving and preprocessing, resulting in the prediction. If we are looking
    for anomalies, we must compare the model outputs to an error threshold and provide
    the answer. On demand, we can also utilize the service to adjust the error levels
    of the various models. The server regularly delivers messages that include information
    such as the node’s IP address, available resources (RAM and CPU), and network
    latency. NodeJS listens on the serial port “/dev/tty0” at 115,200 baud. We extracted
    the measurements whenever new data were written to the port (separated by commas).
    We verified that all of the sensors were operational. This information is saved
    in the MySQL database for the time being. Finally, we produced a structured package
    including the latest six readings of each sensor, which had to correlate to the
    detection model anomaly entries. Then, we transmitted the latter to the Python-implemented
    service, which includes the various models; after receiving the answer, we checked
    for anomalies. An HTTP server configured using the “Express” module and listening
    on port 7000 sends the application pages to the browser. The route to each page
    is specified, and communication occurs via the “WebSocket” protocol. Every hour,
    a temporal event is triggered, which transmits the last received packet if none
    has come, allowing us to forecast it. The integrated Wi-Fi card is employed as
    an access point for configuration and adjusting the thresholds of anomaly detection
    models (leaving a means to reach the local network). Finally, data visualization
    from the gateway is required to assist the developer during maintenance. We investigated
    adding slave nodes that handle resource-intensive processing to enhance computing
    power and load balancing. The Raspberry Pi 3 B+ card’s Wi-Fi card creates a wireless
    network that the cluster uses to communicate. 3.8. Cloud Layer We suggest using
    cloud services to store significant volumes of data generated by sensors in order
    to guarantee the accessibility and availability of our platform everywhere and
    at any time. Furthermore, we use them to anticipate future meters, ensuring scalability
    and more resources when our platform is overloaded (elasticity). A free student
    offer was provided to us, and we will utilize it to create a VM with a public
    IP address that we can access via the remote desktop protocol (RDP). As seen in
    Figure 5, Influx DB offers a limited free cloud service, so setting up a user’s
    dashboard for data analysis and monitoring is straightforward. Figure 5. Monitoring
    and analysis of data on the cloud service. 4. Sensor Anomalies Detection for Smart
    Irrigation Systems Deep learning is becoming increasingly popular for tasks beyond
    image recognition, segmentation, and classification. Non-image data have been
    gaining more and more attention in recent years due to the advancement of IoT
    [29]. The main idea of unsupervised anomaly detection in time-series data is to
    identify whether data observations conform to normal data distributions over time.
    With this technique, we can discover patterns and anomalies that are otherwise
    hard to find. In order to spot unexpected patterns or anomalies as the data changes
    over time, it is crucial to comprehend how each variable within the time series
    affects the others. As shown in Figure 6, the received measurements are consolidated
    with the time series records in the local database. These merged data are used
    as input for anomaly detection models, which aim to identify any anomalies or
    unusual patterns within the data. The reconstructed inputs from the model are
    employed to estimate a corrected value for the abnormal measurement. The goal
    is to correct any inaccuracies or abnormalities identified in the original measurement.
    Once the new measure has been adjusted using the sensor value estimation model,
    it is stored back in the local database. This ensures that the corrected measure
    is available for future reference or analysis. In our research, the scarcity of
    labeled anomaly data poses a challenge. Therefore, GANs and AEs present advantageous
    options as they can effectively perform anomaly detection. Additionally, these
    techniques are capable of learning representations that capture both global and
    local dependencies within the data, enabling them to understand complex patterns
    effectively. GANs, in particular, leverage a discriminator network that can accurately
    classify anomalies. AEs focus on reconstructing input data and strive to minimize
    the reconstruction error. A threshold on the reconstruction error allows for the
    efficient identification of anomalies. Figure 6. Illustration of IoT gateway sensor
    anomaly detection and correction process. 4.1. Generative Adversarial Networks
    (GAN) Unsupervised anomaly detection using generative adversarial networks (GAN),
    as illustrated in Figure 7, involves training two models: a generator and a discriminator.
    The generator learns a model representing normal time series variability, while
    the discriminator learns to identify data points that do not conform to the normal
    behavior. The discriminator can then distinguish between time-series data corresponding
    to normal behavior. Moreover, using GANs for unsupervised anomaly detection in
    time-series data helps identify more complex anomalies than traditional methods
    since it can learn more complex dependencies between different variables within
    the time series (backpropagation). Figure 7. Overview of GAN structure. 4.2. Autoencoder
    (AE) Autoencoders are popular-deep learning-based anomaly detection models that
    have been observed to be reliable and effective. What makes this model so successful
    is its ability to reduce the time-series data to a lower dimension and reconstruct
    them in a higher dimension. As illustrated in Figure 8, this encoding and decoding
    can be performed with the help of different deep learning layers, such as convolutional
    layers. Then, the data are decoded to a higher dimension using an autoencoder
    algorithm. These reconstructed data can then be compared to the primary data to
    detect anomalies. Autoencoders have been a successful tool for anomaly detection
    in time-series data. Their efficiency can even be increased with the use of regularization,
    dropout, and noise-reduction techniques. Moreover, the autoencoder model is able
    to independently extract features from the input data, leading to better accuracy
    and lower computing costs. Figure 8. Overview of autoencoder network architecture.
    4.3. Problem Formulation Considering a time-series dataset 𝐷=[ 𝑋 1 ,  𝑋 2 ,…,  𝑋
    𝑛 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡×𝑛 , where each 𝑋 𝑖 =[ 𝑥 1𝑖 ,  𝑥 2𝑖 ,…,  𝑥 𝑡𝑖 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡 (for 𝑖=1,…,𝑛 ) comprising
    data obtained from sensors over a specific period of time t, the suggested model
    is trained with a subset of the dataset 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 ∈ ℝ 𝑡×𝑘 which only contains normal
    samples, where k is the number of training samples. The samples for testing are
    𝐷 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 =[ 𝐷 𝑣 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 , 𝐷 𝑢 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 ]∈ ℝ 𝑡×(𝑣+𝑢) , with v and u representing the number
    of normal and abnormal samples, respectively, and 𝑛=𝑘+𝑣+𝑢 . Due to the imbalanced
    nature of the time-series data, the size of normal samples is greater than that
    of abnormal samples. A GAN-based model is trained with 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 to reduce the output
    for each output 𝑋 𝑖 in 𝐷 𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 . After the training process as shown in Appendix
    A, 𝐷 𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 is passed through the trained model to evaluate it according to unseen
    samples during the learning. The trained generator can then generate fake normal
    samples from the noise vector. The discriminator model is used to accurately classify
    samples into normal or abnormal sequences. Autoencoders can be used as techniques
    for unsupervised or semi-supervised anomaly detection. To train an autoencoder,
    this technique involves training a model on a dataset that contains only normal
    data. We use a supervised learning approach by dividing the dataset into training
    and testing sets. The training 𝐷𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑖𝑛 and testing 𝐷𝑡𝑒𝑠𝑡 sets are divided into
    input and output components by applying the sliding window approach. This approach
    uses the previous time intervals as both the input and output variables. This
    technique allows us to apply supervised learning to the autoencoder network. To
    evaluate the performance of the trained model, we used the reconstruction error,
    ℒ(𝑥, 𝑥 ̂  ) , which measures the differences between the original input and the
    consequent reconstruction. The amount of discrepancy between a reconstructed representation
    and the original instance is used to calculate the anomaly score. The larger the
    difference, the greater the probability that it is an outlier. Moreover, the cutoff
    point for identifying anomalies can be adjusted by employing cross-validation
    to determine the most suitable threshold (Th) for the reconstruction error. 4.4.
    Dataset Preprocessing The data used in this analysis were obtained from distinct
    sources, as shown in Table 3. These datasets were selected as they encompass soil
    and weather information and have the same hourly sampling rate to address the
    univariate anomaly detection and forecasting queries. The transformation for anomaly
    detection models involves three steps. Firstly, the time series are scaled between
    0 and 1 using MinMaxScaler. This is an important step as it helps the network
    learn faster and converge with ease. Secondly, the time series is split into training,
    testing, and validation data. The training set consists of the first 80%, the
    testing set consists of the next 10%, and the validation set consists of the last
    10%. Lastly, the training and testing splits are divided into input and output
    components by using the sliding window technique with sequence length 6 for anomaly
    detection models. Table 3. Description of datasets used to train deep learning
    models. 4.5. Implementation We implemented a Generator network to produce fake
    samples. As shown in Table 3, it consists of one-dimensional convolution, LSTM,
    and dense layers with a binary cross-entropy loss function. Binary cross-entropy
    measures the performance of a binary classification model whose output is a probability
    value between 0 and 1. We implemented a Discriminator Neural Network that outputs
    a score for each sample, indicating whether it belongs to the real or fake sample.
    This Discriminator consists of one-dimensional convolution, LSTM, and dense layers.
    To obtain a probability value, a Sigmoid activation function is applied to the
    final layer. We implemented an Autoencoder Neural Network that tries to output
    the same inputs with less reconstruction error. This neural network consists of
    one-dimensional convolution, LSTM, and dense layers, followed by a dropout layer
    to help prevent overfitting. Adam optimization is a stochastic gradient descent
    method based on the adaptive estimation of first-order and second-order moments.
    In our case, we used the Adam optimizer implemented in the Keras/TensorFlow library,
    with a learning rate of 0.001 and β 2 set to 0.5. GAN models are trained for 2000
    epochs with a batch size of 128, and the autoencoder models are trained for 50
    epochs with a batch size of 8. After each epoch, the model is stored on the hard
    drive to select the best model before overfitting occurs. The detailed network
    architecture of the autoencoder model can be found in Table 4, and the detailed
    network architecture of the GAN is presented in Table 5. Table 4. Network architecture
    of AE model. Table 5. Network architecture of GAN model. 4.6. Description of Evaluation
    Metrics After the learning process, the best model was selected and evaluated
    using balanced class validation data that contain 1000 normal and 1000 abnormal
    samples labeled by agronomy experts. Table 6 summarizes the evaluation metrics
    of the anomaly detection models related to soil moisture, air temperature, and
    air humidity. Table 6. Evaluation metrics of anomaly detection models. The metrics
    used for evaluating the anomaly detection models include precision, recall, F1
    score, and accuracy. They are calculated as follows: Accuracy= 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑇 𝑛 𝑇 𝑝 +
    𝑓 𝑛 + 𝑓 𝑝 + 𝑇 𝑛 Precision= 𝑇 𝑝 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑓 𝑝 Recall= 𝑇 𝑝 𝑇 𝑝 + 𝑓 𝑛 F1−score=2× 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛×𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙
    𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛+𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 True Positive (TP): represents the number of abnormal samples
    correctly classified as attacks (correct detection). False Positive (FP): represents
    the number of normal samples wrongly classified as attacks (incorrect detection).
    True Negative (TN): represents the number of normal samples wrongly classified
    (correct detection). False Negative (FN): represents the number of abnormal samples
    wrongly classified as attacks (incorrect detection). Accuracy: reports the proportion
    of properly categorized samples to all other samples in the testing set. Precision:
    reports the percentage of samples properly categorized for all TP and FP in the
    testing set. Recall: the ratio of TP samples to the total number of TP and FN
    samples is known as recall. The F1-score reports the harmonic mean between precision
    and recall. 4.7. Results and Evaluation We trained a GAN model on soil moisture
    data for 2000 epochs, with an early stop mechanism implemented to stop training
    if the discriminator and generator losses remained low for 20 epochs. The GAN
    model for soil moisture at 5 cm depth converged at 500 epochs, while the model
    for 20 cm depth converged at 2000 epochs. Autoencoders were also trained for 100
    epochs, with models saved to the hard drive after each epoch. The model before
    the overfitting occurred was selected, with the models at epoch 38 and epoch 20
    being chosen for soil moisture models at depths of 5 cm and 20 cm, respectively.
    According to Table 6, the accuracy of each model ranged from 57.10% to 97.60%,
    while the F1 score ranged from 43.40% to 97.60%. Among the models, AE obtained
    the maximum accuracy and F1 score of 97.60% and 97.60%, respectively, while GAN
    achieved accuracy and F1 scores of 87.50% and 88.88%, respectively. The autoencoder
    error thresholds were set according to the 95% percentile of training data. As
    shown in Figure 9, we chose four-month time-series data from a soil moisture dataset,
    covering the time period from October 2010 to January 2011. Figure 9. Results
    of anomaly detection models on the soil moisture parameter. The GAN anomaly detection
    model identifies many anomalies in the normal behavior of soil moisture sensors,
    which may lead to false alarms for the farmer. On the other hand, the autoencoder
    model only picks up anomalies in the curves’ peaks that result from irrigation
    or rainfall. We trained a GAN model for detecting anomalies in air temperature
    for 3000 epochs and added an early stopping feature that would stop the training
    if the loss for the generator and discriminator remained low for 20 consecutive
    epochs. The training of the GAN model for air temperature in New York was observed
    to converge at 2700 epochs, while the training of the model for Philadelphia converged
    at 1870 epochs. Additionally, we also trained autoencoders for 100 epochs, saving
    the models after every epoch. The model that was trained before overfitting occurred
    was selected, with the models at epochs 95 and 87 chosen for air temperature models
    in New York and Philadelphia, respectively. The error thresholds for the autoencoder
    models were set based on the 95th percentile of the training data. This resulted
    in high accuracy, recall, and F1 scores for the autoencoder models compared to
    the GAN models, with the precision being similar for both. As illustrated in Figure
    10, we selected four-month time-series data from an air temperature dataset, from
    October 2012 to January 2013. The GAN anomaly detection model detects abnormalities
    in the normal behaviour of the air temperature sensor, whereas the autoencoder
    model recognizes the typical pattern of the air temperature sensor and does not
    detect any anomalies. Figure 10. Results of anomaly detection models on the air
    temperature parameter. We trained a GAN model for anomaly detection in air humidity
    for 2000 epochs with an early stopping mechanism in place to stop training if
    the discriminator and generator losses remained low for 20 epochs. The GAN model
    for air-humidity in New York converged at 680 epochs, while the model for Philadelphia
    converged at 1412 epochs. Additionally, autoencoders were trained for 100 epochs,
    and the models were saved after each epoch. The model before overfitting occurred
    was chosen, with the models at epochs 93 and 100 selected for air humidity autoencoder
    models in New York and Philadelphia, respectively. This resulted in high accuracy,
    precision, recall, and F1 scores for the autoencoder models, which performed better
    than the GAN models. The data used in Figure 11 were a four-month time series
    of air humidity from October 2012 to January 2013. The GAN model identifies anomalies
    in the normal behavior of the sensor, while autoencoders recognize the normal
    patterns of the data and detect only a few anomalies. As per the model validation
    results, the autoencoder-based models demonstrated high accuracy and precision
    in detecting anomalies compared to the GAN models. To optimize the models without
    sacrificing accuracy, they were converted using TensorFlow Lite and deployed on
    IoT gateways. An API and a simple web UI were established to configure the anomaly
    error thresholds and alert end users of any sensor malfunctions, as presented
    in Figure 12. Figure 11. Results of anomaly detection models on the air humidity
    parameter. Figure 12. Configuring anomalies and error thresholds in the IoT gateway
    web application. 5. Irrigation Factors Forecasting Using Deep Learning As illustrated
    in Figure 13, the developed system incorporates various microservices, including
    anomaly detection, forecasting, and data analytics, to enhance farmers’ ability
    to make irrigation decisions. These microservices are exposed through the system.
    To provide the farmer with the necessary tools for monitoring and forecasting
    climate and soil measurements, we have implemented a time-series NoSQL database
    to efficiently handle the large volume of sensor data. This type of database is
    particularly well suited for managing time-dependent data and enabling efficient
    manipulation operations. Additionally, it supports auto-scaling capabilities,
    ensuring that the system can handle increased data loads if required. To provide
    accessibility to the system, we have deployed multiple web servers that host web
    applications. Figure 13. Illustration depicting the interaction between end users
    and cloud services within a system. This allows the farmer to access the system
    and its functionalities through a user-friendly interface. To an ensure optimal
    performance and distribution of user requests, load balancers are implemented
    to evenly distribute the incoming traffic across the deployed web servers. In
    the next experiment, we will test the accuracy of the soil and weather forecasting
    models using autoencoders. In the first stage, we will feed the autoencoders’
    anomaly detection models with data from the datasets and replace detected anomalies
    with the reconstructed inputs. The obtained data are structured into sequences
    in the next stage by applying the sliding window approach. This methodology improves
    those observed in previous studies [3,28] when integrated with an IoT platform,
    as a tool for simplifying the labeling of actual anomalies, and can assist in
    the creation of supervised datasets for future research in the field. Prediction
    models based on deep learning techniques can also correct anomalies. We use the
    previous 24 records as inputs and the next 24 as outputs. This technique allows
    us to apply supervised learning to soil and weather parameter forecasting tasks.
    5.1. Forecasting Model for Potential Irrigation Factors Based on the previous
    comparison of generative adversarial networks (GANs) and autoencoders (AEs) for
    finding anomalies, it was found that AEs are more accurate and have a lower rate
    of false alarms. As a result, AE models were chosen for the data collection process.
    This section aims to evaluate the performance of the forecasting models after
    applying data clearing and correction techniques, which are intended to enhance
    the data’s quality and reliability for accurate forecasts. Table 6 shows the architecture
    of the model. This architecture is a sequence-to-vector transformation, where
    the input sequence goes through a series of operations to pull out features and
    capture temporal relationships. This process involves using both convolutional
    and LSTM layers. The convolutional layers extract pertinent features from the
    input sequence, while the bidirectional LSTM architecture processes the input
    sequence in both forward and backward directions, enabling the model to capture
    past and future context simultaneously. Finally, the output of the LSTM layer
    is fed into a fully connected layer for additional processing and to generate
    the final output of the model. This architecture enables the model to effectively
    analyze and understand the input sequence, producing a condensed vector representation
    as the ultimate result. 5.2. Evaluation Metrics of Forecasting Models Based on
    Deep Learning Models When analyzing prediction models of future measurement performance,
    the following metrics are typically used: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Square
    Error (MSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are the three most commonly used
    loss metrics to evaluate the performance of DL models related to regression problems.
    They are given as follows: MSE MAE RMSE = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 |
    𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 | = ∑ 𝑁 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − √ 5.3. Results and
    Discussion According to our empirical study, the Adam optimizer from Keras/TensorFlow
    with a learning rate of 0.001 was used for training the CNN/BiLSTM models for
    200 epochs using a batch size of 32. The model was saved after each epoch to pick
    the best model before overfitting occurred. Table 7 displays the in-depth structure
    of the CNN/BiLSTM models. The model inputs a sequence of 24 previous values to
    predict the next 24 subsequent sensor measures. As shown in Table 8, the evaluation
    results for the soil moisture forecasting model are presented for two different
    depth sensors (sm_5 and sm_20). For sm_5, when no anomalies were replaced, the
    model achieved an MSE of 1.2273, an RMSE of 1.1078, and an MAE of 0.999. However,
    a significant performance improvement was observed when 1025 anomalies were replaced,
    resulting in a notable decrease in MSE to 0.272243, RMSE to 0.52176, and MAE to
    0.4703. These findings demonstrate that replacing anomalies positively impacted
    the model’s ability to forecast soil moisture at sm_5 sensors, leading to more
    accurate predictions. In the case of sm_20, when no anomalies were replaced, the
    model yielded an MSE of 1.70128, an RMSE of 1.3043, and an MAE of 1.234. Table
    7. Network architecture of parameter forecasting model. Table 8. Evaluation of
    soil moisture forecasting model. Subsequently, when 716 anomalies were replaced,
    a slight performance improvement was observed, resulting in a reduced MSE of 0.8740,
    an RMSE of 0.9348, and an MAE of 0.861. The decrease in the MSE, RMSE, and MAE
    values indicates enhanced accuracy in the model’s predictions for sm_20 sensors,
    although the improvements were comparatively smaller than those observed for sm_5.
    These results underscore the significance of replacing anomalies in the dataset
    to improve the forecasting accuracy of the model. The improvements achieved for
    the sm_5 sensors demonstrate the substantial impact of addressing anomalies on
    the model’s performance. However, for the sm_20 sensors, the improvements were
    relatively modest, suggesting that anomalies had a lesser effect on the model’s
    predictions in this particular case. According to the results, the autoencoder
    model trained on clean data demonstrated the best forecasting performance, as
    shown in Figure 14. The actual and expected soil moisture were nearly identical,
    with minor discrepancies at the 5 cm and 20 cm depths. Table 9 presents the evaluation
    of an air temperature forecasting model for New York and Philadelphia, considering
    scenarios with and without anomaly replacement. The air temperature model in New
    York, not replacing anomalies, resulted in an MSE of 20.1318, an RMSE of 4.4868,
    and an MAE of 3.497. However, when 1140 anomalies were replaced, the model’s performance
    improved significantly, with the MSE decreasing to 17.7633, the RMSE decreasing
    to 4.2146, and the MAE decreasing to 3.436. This suggests that replacing anomalies
    enhanced the model’s accuracy in predicting air temperature in New York. Figure
    14. Results of soil moisture forecasting models over four months. Table 9. Evaluation
    of air temperature forecasting model. Similarly, for air temperature in Philadelphia,
    the model achieved an MSE of 16.2342, an RMSE of 4.0291, and an MAE of 3.3 when
    anomalies were not replaced. After replacing anomalies, the model’s performance
    improved further, resulting in an MSE of 4.635611, an RMSE of 2.1530, and an MAE
    of 1.648. This indicates that anomaly replacement positively influenced the model’s
    forecasting accuracy in Philadelphia. Overall, the results underscore the significance
    of anomaly replacement in improving the accuracy of the air temperature forecasting
    model, as depicted in Figure 15. The findings demonstrate that addressing anomalies
    led to more precise predictions for air temperature in both New York and Philadelphia.
    As indicated in Table 10, the evaluation results of an air humidity forecasting
    model for two locations are as follows. In New York and Philadelphia, the model’s
    performance was assessed under different scenarios where anomalies were either
    not corrected (corrected anomalies = 0) or replaced using a correction model.
    In the case of air humidity forecasting in New York, the results show that replacing
    anomalies had a minor positive effect on the model’s performance. Although the
    improvements in MSE, RMSE, and MAE values were relatively small, they indicate
    a slight increase in the accuracy of the model’s predictions after anomaly replacement.
    Figure 15. Results of air-temperature forecasting models over four months. Table
    10. Evaluation of air humidity forecasting model. Similarly, for air humidity
    forecasting in Philadelphia, replacing anomalies had a limited impact on the model’s
    performance. The reduction in MSE, RMSE, and MAE values was minimal, suggesting
    only a slight improvement in the accuracy of the model’s predictions. Overall,
    the results indicate that replacing anomalies had a limited influence on the performance
    of the air humidity forecasting model in both New York and Philadelphia, as shown
    in Figure 16. Anomalies may have a relatively small effect on the accuracy of
    the model’s predictions for air humidity in these locations. However, the long-term
    forecast error was significantly high due to various factors that can impact air
    humidity patterns, such as air temperature, air pressure, wind speed, and air
    pollution. After validating the models obtained, they were converted using TensorFlow
    Lite to improve efficiency without sacrificing accuracy and deployed on the cloud.
    An API and web dashboard were developed to display and predict weather and soil
    parameters, as shown in Figure 17. Figure 16. Results of air-humidity forecasting
    models over four months. Figure 17. Estimating irrigation measures using a web
    application accessible online. 6. Conclusions and Future Trends This article introduces
    version 1.0 of the INTEL-IRRIS low-cost and fog-IoT/AI system, developed by the
    University of Oran 1 for SFCs. We present an IoT-based smart farming system that
    integrates anomaly detection based on autoencoders, demonstrating superior performance
    compared to GANs with accuracy rates of 90% for soil moisture, 95% for air temperature,
    and 97% for air humidity. Additionally, anomalies can be adjusted using reconstructed
    inputs from autoencoder models. The results showcase minor estimation errors for
    soil moisture and air temperature hourly forecasting models, indicating the effectiveness
    of our approach. The proposed solution improves the effects observed in previous
    studies and can also assist in creating supervised datasets for future research
    in the field. This platform will need more research that takes into consideration
    several perspectives: To enhance the accuracy of the acquired data, we will increase
    the accuracy of low-cost sensors using autonomous and remotely managed techniques
    to improve the different sensors’ calibration [32]. As a consequence, our water–soil–plant–climate
    interaction models will prescribe more correct measures. To enhance the reliability,
    accessibility, and tracking of sensors and actuators, incorporating a blockchain
    security framework is recommended. This integration will establish a strong mechanism
    for data integrity, availability, and traceability in the system. The design and
    implementation of precision PA-based Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) technologies
    like Lora and Sigfox. These approaches are designed to conserve energy, like the
    Long-Range Wide-Area Network (LoRaWAN), and enhance the irrigation efficiency
    of large-holder farmers. Offer the “out-of-the-box” function, meaning that the
    control component that recommends irrigation is integrated into the IoT gateway
    and, as a result, does not need an internet connection, as implemented by WAZIUP
    partner [27]. Traditional deep learning systems need centralized data gathering
    and processing, which is becoming more unfeasible due to efficiency issues and
    rising data privacy concerns. Due to these qualities, federated learning has been
    a hot topic in smart agriculture. We intend to conduct a comprehensive assessment
    of the FL approach and the centralized machine learning models. Author Contributions

    In recent years, IoT sensors have enabled smart agriculture to grow rapidly with
    many compelling real-world applications. One such application is the case of smart
    irrigation. A particular interest exists in forecasting soil water potential to
    allow for the establishment of more efficient irrigation systems. Nonetheless,
    forecasting soil moisture is a complex task and depends on various information
    sources. Most existing work relies on local approaches, which are less effective
    at leveraging shared information across different data sources. Therefore, this
    paper presents a robust global approach for soil water potential forecasting,
    combining various environmental factors through the cutting-edge Temporal Fusion
    Transformer. Our proposed approach outperforms established baselines for forecasting
    soil water potential. As such, this work contributes to the growing body of research

    irrigationSoil water potentialSensor data 1. Introduction In many domains, anticipating
    the future path of a time-series is of key importance. Smart agriculture is one
    such domain where forecasting holds a significant role, as demonstrated in [1].
    Smart agriculture contains a panoply of compelling predictive use-cases, including
    but not limited to, crop yield prediction [2] and automated crop disease detection
    [3]. A comprehensive overview of such applications can be found in [1]. Smart
    irrigation – a subfield of smart agriculture – has gained a specific interest
    in recent years due to its direct relationship with water scarcity [4]. To this
    end, soil moisture sensors have proven useful in facilitating smart irrigation
    systems by providing real-time insights [5]. Besides real-time monitoring, there
    is also a critical need for accurate soil moisture forecasting — especially over
    a multi-day horizon [6]. Accurate soil moisture forecasting can help farmers with
    smart irrigation scheduling and other precision agricultural decisions such as
    smart fertilization [7]. However, forecasting soil moisture is non-trivial due
    to complex non-linear temporal dynamics of both endogenous and exogenous nature
    [8]. Moreover, gaining insight from a wide variety of data sources in agriculture
    remains an open challenge [4]. Until recently, there was a heavy emphasis on time-series
    forecasting techniques that focus on isolated time-series — so called local forecasting
    methods [9], [10]. However, we argue that in a complex agricultural setting, such
    models would perform poorly since they do not exploit external information from
    e.g. other (IoT) sensors. As such, forecasting soil moisture requires models that
    can capture these complex non-linear relationships through data fusion. To this
    end, we suggest the use of the state-of-the-art Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT)
    [11] as a global forecasting model for efficient integration of various data sources
    in smart agriculture. Our contribution is three-fold: (i) To the best of our knowledge,
    we are the first to apply the state-of-the-art TFT – a transformer-based architecture
    – to multi-day sensor forecasting in the context of smart agriculture. (ii) We
    present a detailed comparison between global and local forecasting approaches,
    enriching the ongoing discussion on global vs. local forecasting. (iii) We overcome
    the significant data integration challenges associated with forecasting soil moisture
    sensors due to its dependency on a wide array of data sources stemming from various
    environmental conditions across fields. The remainder of this paper is structured
    as follows: in Section 2, we review related work. Section 3 through Section 5
    discuss, respectively, the specific setting along with a formal problem description
    and the methods used. Details on training and evaluation are covered in Section
    6. The results are presented and discussed in Section 7. Finally, the conclusion
    and future directions are presented in Section 8. 2. Related work A benefit of
    the rise of (IoT) sensors in smart agriculture, is the high volume of data captured
    by those sensors. This high volume creates leeway for more advanced data analysis
    techniques such as deep learning [12]. Since soil moisture sensors typically generate
    temporal data with non-obvious patterns, multiple studies investigated the use
    of advanced analytics techniques for the prediction of soil moisture. For example,
    in [13] multiple LSTMs were trained – one per site – for one-day-ahead prediction.
    The learned models were shown to generalize by testing them on independent fields,
    though with similar soil characteristics as the train data. Notably, the naive
    model yields strong performance for one-day-ahead predictions — though their discussion
    on this is limited. This may indicate a high correlation between current and next-day
    measurements. While one-day-ahead forecasts serve as a valuable proof-of-concept,
    the greater challenge lies in the realm of multi-day forecasting [6]. Other works,
    such as [14], include future open-source information from e.g. weather forecasting
    services to obtain better multi-horizon predictions for soil moisture and show
    promising results, though only for a single plot. The authors of [10] used a bidirectional
    LSTM for forecasting soil moisture and soil electrical conductivity. They used
    5 nodes ( plots), all located in one orchard. A forecasting horizon of 14 days
    was used, and the model was trained separately for each plot (i.e. a local approach).
    They point out that it could be valuable to include static variables such as soil
    properties and that training could be more efficient by utilizing knowledge obtained
    from the other fields (e.g. a global approach). However, the small dataset size
    for each node raises concerns about overfitting. Additionally, the use of a bidirectional
    LSTM may be impractical when not all variables are known 14 days in advance, as
    is often the case in real-world settings. The authors of [15] used a novel attention-aware
    LSTM model for predicting soil moisture and soil temperature on a one- and seven-day
    forecasting horizon. Their attention mechanism allowed for an interpretable network
    permitting expert validation of the learned model. It is worth noting that – while
    they obtained data from multiple sites – they trained a separate LSTM model per
    site, essentially treating the LSTM as a local model. While the size of their
    data permits the use of LSTMs as a local model, recent work [9] has shown that
    neural networks can indeed be used as local models given sufficient data, but
    produce superior results when used as a global model. As such, we identify several
    key challenges. For instance, local modeling approaches restrict the ability to
    integrate information across various fields or plots. This becomes problematic
    in scenarios with limited local data causing risks of overfitting or restricting
    model choice — as is the case for our dataset. This limitation is a significant
    driver for our work, as we advocate for a more efficient global modeling technique
    that can harness insights from multiple sources — even when those sources have
    only limited data available on a local level. Another important consideration
    is the challenge of multi-day soil moisture forecasting. This limitation has practical
    implications for agricultural planning and highlight the need for advanced techniques
    capable of addressing longer-term forecasting. Additionally, while there is recognition
    of the potential value of incorporating static properties and future information,
    the adoption of these factors remains limited in existing approaches. To this
    end, recent advances in deep learning permit to build global models that can address
    these challenges through the use of TFTs [11]. TFTs can include both static and
    future information along the historic endo- or exogenous measurements. This work
    presents a global soil moisture fusion transformer, applied on a challenging multi-source
    agricultural dataset. 3. Application We demonstrate the benefit of global data
    fusion over local data fusion on a challenging dataset generated by Watermark
    soil moisture sensors (Irrometer Company, Inc., USA), retrieved from [16]. These
    sensors (i.e. our targets) were located on three different pear orchards in Belgium
    and were operational from 2007–2009, measuring the soil water potential ( in kPa)
    every four hours during the months June-August. This yields a time-series of approximately
    three months for each sensor per year. Due to this discontinuity in time, we consider
    a sensor to produce a separate time-series for each year rather than one time-series
    over all three years. Given the low intra-day variability of the sensors, it was
    deemed appropriate to calculate the daily average for , in accordance with the
    daily frequency at which all other variables, such as rainfall and reference evapotranspiration,
    were measured to obtain a common frequency. This yields a multivariate time-series
    with an average length of 80 (e.g. 80 -measurements for each sensor for a given
    year). The value of the target, , is negative, expressed in pressure units (kPa)
    which indicates how strongly the water is held in the soil pores by capillary
    and adhesive forces in a soil that is not saturated. Basically, the drier the
    soil, the stronger these forces are, the more negative the soil water potential
    is, and the more difficult it is for plant roots to extract that water. Furthermore,
    each field was divided into several plots which each contained six sensors at
    different depth levels: three sensors at a depth of 30 cm, two at a depth of 60
    cm, and one at a depth of 90 cm. These sensors recorded soil moisture levels at
    different depths, providing a comprehensive picture of the . Other temporal variables
    measured at plot-level are irrigation-amount and plot-specific treatments (e.g.
    root pruning). These variables capture the effects of irrigation and other treatments
    on soil moisture levels. At field level, precipitation and reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo) were – respectively – recorded and calculated over time. These variables
    provide information about the overall water availability and demand in the field.
    All of these variables have a proven relationship to the target, [16]. A full
    overview of all variables and their characteristics is presented in Table 1. The
    collection and integration of these heterogeneous information sources posed several
    challenges. Missing values typically only occurred at the beginning of a time-series
    since some sensors were deployed earlier than others. Selecting a common measurement
    period solved this discrepancy. Remaining missing values, although limited, were
    imputed using forward filling. Lastly, some -sensors were entirely removed from
    the analysis due to concerns regarding data quality. During certain periods, the
    readings from these sensors exceeded their measurement range, rendering them unable
    to provide data for those time frames. Furthermore, the trustworthiness of these
    sensors could not be guaranteed as it is unclear whether they would remain reliable
    once they returned to their normal measurement ranges. Despite these challenges,
    the final dataset consisted of approximately 560 unique time-series or 220 sensors
    per year1 (70 per orchard), totaling 50k data-points. Fig. 1 depicts the distribution
    of ten randomly selected -sensors from one of the pear orchards for a given year.
    Observe how both the mean and variance vary widely between sensors. This suggests
    that a model trained on one sensor (i.e. a local approach), might not generalize
    well to other sensors. Furthermore, the top row in Fig. 1 shows the -values for
    the Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test. The -values are obtained through regression
    surface approximation from MacKinnon [17], using the updated 2010 tables [18].
    The ADF test indicates that many of the randomly selected sensors show random
    walk patterns, suggesting the use of e.g. methods that allow for inclusion of
    exogenous information. Table 1. Overview of variables included in each model with

    description Formally, we consider a time-series problem with inputs containing
    multivariate time-series along with potential metadata, where the goal is to learn
    a function that accurately forecasts the output . Let be a dataset of observations,
    where is a multivariate time-series input with time-steps and features, and represents
    static metadata with features. is the output with forecast-horizon . Our goal
    is to learn a function that maps the inputs and to the output . That is, we seek
    to find the parameters of the function that minimize the following objective function
    — Eq. (1) [19]: (1) where is a task-specific loss function. 5. Methodology Forecasting
    natural phenomena such as soil moisture requires a model that can exploit exogenous
    information while simultaneously exploiting a potentially non-linear relationship
    with lagged values of the target (see [20], [21] for a similarly complex task
    in evapotranspiration prediction). To this end, we distinguish between global
    and local forecasting methods. 5.1. Local methods In short, given many time-series
    (or sensors in our case), a local method would independently estimate model parameters
    for each individual time-series (or sensor) with its corresponding local input
    variables [9]. Since each time-series measures on average 80 data-points (see
    Section 3), the local method should be limited in terms of parameters to be estimated
    in order to avoid the curse of dimensionality. A visual overview is provided in
    Fig. 2(a). Naive model. As a baseline, a naive model is introduced which simply
    uses the last known value as the multi-horizon forecast. That is, a constant line.
    Including a naive baseline permits to investigate whether the more advanced forecasting
    methods actually obtain any skill (see e.g. [22] for a similar approach). Download

    2(a) shows a local approach where each (in this case) plot gets assigned its own
    model while 2(b) shows a global approach with one model for all plots. Vector
    AutoRegressive model. Next, a state-of-the-art flexible local method is considered
    which can exploit exo- and endogenous relationships present in the data. To this
    end, a Vector AutoRegressive model is used as a strong local method [23], [24].
    A Vector AutoRegressive (VAR) model is a linear multiple-equation model that allows
    to model and forecast multivariate time-series. Section 3 described the multivariate
    nature of the problem. Moreover, it is known [25] that some input variables are
    influenced by (i.e. the target) raising issues of endogeneity, especially in multi-horizon
    forecasts. As such, to jointly model such dynamic interdependencies the Vector
    AutoRegressive (VAR) model is a feasible local method with proven theoretical
    properties and parsimonious parameterization, leading to a small model for the
    small local dataset. For full details we refer to the original paper [23] of VAR
    models. Note that VAR models can only include numerical historic variables. To
    this end, the final VAR model in concise matrix notation [24] is shown in Eq.
    (2): (2) with a -matrix for variables with forecasting horizon . a coefficient
    matrix with the size of the look-back window (or lag-length), a -matrix containing
    the lagged variables, and the error matrix. The actual variables included in the
    VAR model are indicated in Table 1. Observe how the number of variables , the
    size of the look-back window , and the forecasting horizon entirely govern the
    complexity of the model in terms of parameters. Therefore, since we need to include
    multiple exogenous time-series and are interested in a multi-horizon forecast,
    the look-back window will need to be properly tuned to avoid overfitting. Lastly,
    since VAR models assume stationarity, some variables (e.g. the target variable
    soil water potential — see Fig. 1) need to be transformed to obtain stationarity
    using e.g. differencing. 5.2. Global methods For global methods, the entire set
    of sensors and their corresponding predictors are considered at once, giving rise
    to a larger dataset (see Section 3). Global methods estimate the parameters jointly
    from all available time-series (or sensors). To this end, neural networks have
    shown to be particularly promising as global forecasters since they thrive in
    large data contexts [9]. In fact, given enough data, global forecasting methods
    such as neural networks can inherently model more complex non-linear structures
    in the data compared to local methods that are restricted in terms of complexity
    since their access is limited to local data only. A visual overview is provided
    in Fig. 2(b). LSTM. First, an LSTM network [26] is considered. LSTMs are widely
    considered to be a solid baseline in forecasting (multivariate) time-series data
    (see e.g. [22]). An LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is capable
    of learning long-term temporal dependencies in sequence data. A key component
    of the LSTM are so-called memory gates that mitigate the problem – typical for
    traditional RNNs – of exploding/vanishing gradients. Temporal fusion transformer.
    The TFT [11] is a state-of-the-art model for time-series forecasting. It stands
    out compared to e.g. LSTMs thanks to its ability to include static (i.e. time-invariant)
    variables and its efficient architecture. In an agricultural context this permits
    to condition on field-specific time-invariant variables which ultimately allows
    for efficient data fusion across different static properties. TFTs rely on a sophisticated
    transformer-based [27] architecture allowing them to model complex interactions
    between the different temporal (future or historic) and static inputs while preserving
    interpretability. The use of a quantile-based objective function, enables the
    TFTs to output -quantiles instead of point forecasts. The full architecture is
    shown in Fig. 3. We discuss the main components from the bottom-up (for a full
    overview we refer to the original TFT paper in [11]): Download : Download high-res

    obtained from [11]. The left (in brown) shows the static variables encoder, followed
    by the past inputs encoder (in blue) and the known future inputs decoder (in dark
    red). Observe the variable selection units for all inputs. Multiple gates are
    present with skip-connections making the network efficient. The multi-head attention
    block permits for efficient information fusion. Parts with the same colors indicate
    weight-sharing. 1. Variable selection network: The network is trained on global
    data with different variable types: static (i.e. time-invariant), historic (i.e.
    exo- or endogenous time-series), and known (i.e. a priori known future inputs,
    e.g. day of week). By implementing a variable selection module, the model itself
    can select important and ignore irrelevant variables at different time-steps.
    2. Static variable encoders: In an agricultural context, e.g. soil characteristics
    can have a big impact on soil moisture dynamics [10]. Hence, mapping static variables,
    such as soil type, to a higher-dimensional embedding space can help the model
    to condition the temporal embeddings on such static properties allowing for conditional
    information fusion. 3. LSTM encoders: LSTMs [26] are incorporated for local processing
    of the time-series. Here, a sequence-to-sequence structure is employed for the
    LSTM-layer to learn fixed-length temporal embeddings as input for the attention
    heads. 4. Gating mechanisms: Throughout the network, multiple gating mechanisms
    with skip-connections (and normalization) are put in place. As such, the network
    itself can regulate its complexity and learn more efficiently if possible, even
    when limited data is available. 5. Temporal multi-head attention: A key component
    of the TFT is the multi-head self-attention block [27] which enables the network
    to attend to the most relevant dependencies present in the network. Thanks to
    a grouping operation (i.e. averaging) over the multi-head attention mechanism
    in the TFT, efficient information fusion takes place. Moreover, investigating
    the final grouped attention vectors can help with interpreting to which time-steps
    the TFT pays attention. 6. Quantile Forecasts: The final dense layer directly
    outputs a quantile forecast for the given prediction horizon. This results in
    a distribution forecast rather than a point forecast, providing a notion of uncertainty.
    6. Training and evaluation For a given time-step , we want to predict steps ahead
    (here, ), using a window of past observations with size . These past observations
    can include exogenous time-series as well as the target itself . For the TFT specifically,
    known future observations (numerical or categorical) can also be included . Finally,
    static information can also be included in the TFT. A full overview of the included
    variables and their type for each model is provided in Table 1. Next, the data
    is split into a train ( k - 92%), validation ( - 4%), and a test set ( - 4%).
    To respect the temporal nature and prevent data leakage, the validation set is
    represented by the penultimate forecasting window for the years 2008, 2009 — i.e.
    with . The test set is comprised of the last forecasting window of each sensor
    for 2008, 2009 — i.e. with . A graphical overview is presented in Fig. 4. Note
    that every time-series of 2007 is left entirely for training only. This allows
    the model to observe at least one entire growing season during training. To evaluate
    the performance of the local and global model, the mean absolute error (MAE) Eq.
    (3), the root mean squared error (RMSE) Eq. (4), and the mean directional accuracy
    (MDA) Eq. (5) are computed for each time-series [28], [29] as follows: (3) (4)
    (5) where represents the measurement of a given sensor at time and the length
    of the forecasting horizon. is the forecast by the model. These metrics, respectively,
    give insight in general performance, large errors, and directional skill of the
    model. Note that for the local models, by definition, the forecast for each time-series
    implies a different model. As such, for time-series, VAR-models would be created.
    Hence, for local models, the final MAE, RMSE, and MDA are aggregated across all
    local models to obtain global metrics. This ultimately allows for a fair comparison
    between the local and global models. For the MAE and RMSE the median is calculated
    across forecasts, and for MDA the mean. This permits to perform statistical tests
    to compare the performance across models. As such, the MAE and RMSE are compared
    across models with a one-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the MDA is compared
    using a -test. A Bonferroni correction [30] is applied to account for multiple
    testing. Lastly, following [11], the normalized quantile loss across the forecast-horizon
    is also considered, through -Risk (see Eq. (6)): (6) with the domain of the given
    dataset and (see Eq. (7)) the quantile loss [11]: (7) Here, represents the quantile
    of interest and . Note, when , then Eq. (7) MAE. Furthermore, -Risk is a global
    metric by definition and is not calculated for each time-series separately. As
    such, no statistical tests are performed for the -Risk. Download : Download high-res

    of a certain sensor for a given year for a given orchard. Note that each year
    for a given sensor per orchard is considered as a unique time-series as described
    in Section 3. 6.1. Training - Naive model The naive model simply forward-propagates
    the last known value for each sensor per year across the horizon . Hence, no actual
    training is done for this model. 6.2. Training - VAR model Since the VAR model
    is a local method, training is done on local time-series data only. That is, one
    model is trained per sensor, per year, taking into account exogenous information
    from that time-period. We refer to Table 1 for a full overview of the included
    exogenous information per sensor, per year. The main interest is in comparing
    predictive performance of the local and global methods on the unseen test data.
    As such, since 2007 is kept as a train set for the TFT (see Fig. 4), it is omitted
    for the local method estimation as it does not contain a test set. This preserves
    the fairness in comparing both methods. Given the non-stationarity of the target
    (see Section 3), first-order differencing is applied such that the target becomes
    . The target is then reverted to its original form for evaluation. This is done
    to obtain stationarity which is a requirement for VAR models. Other exogenous
    temporal variables that were non-stationary were also transformed through first-order
    differencing. The lag is a key hyperparameter that governs the model complexity.
    As such, the optimal lag (limited to a maximum of four to prevent overfitting)
    is determined using the Akaike Information Criterion [31] on both the train and
    validation set for a given sensor. A constant is added to allow for a time-series
    with a non-zero intercept. Lastly, each VAR-model with optimal lag is then refitted
    on the local train and validation set after which the final results are obtained
    on the local test set. 6.3. Training - LSTM The LSTM is trained on the train data
    shown in Fig. 4. Hyperparameters were selected using the validation data with
    a full grid search — see A.1. The data is normalized — a requirement for any neural
    network. While first-order differencing of the target (as done in Section 6.2)
    is not a necessity for neural networks, better results where observed for the
    LSTM when first-order differencing was applied. Hence, the target becomes . The
    target is then reverted to its original form for evaluation. The final model contained
    two LSTM-layers (i.e. a stacked LSTM network), each with 64 LSTM cells and a dropout-rate
    of 0.2. A final fully connected layer is added with five nodes to obtain a five-day-ahead
    forecast. The network is trained for 50 epochs using the AdamW optimizer [32]
    with a learning rate of 0.001 on a single Nvidia T4 GPU and implemented in Pytorch
    Lightning v1.6.5. 6.4. Training - temporal fusion transformer The TFT contains
    multiple hyperparameters. The original paper [11] also showed that the performance
    of the TFT on a given dataset, largely depends on the set of hyperparameters.
    Due to the complexity of the TFT, a full grid search (as done for the LSTM in
    Section 6.3) is not feasible. To this end, we use Bayesian hyperparameter optimization
    [33] to tune the hyperparameters of the TFT. Bayesian hyperparameter optimization
    is a computationally efficient manner for finding that optimizes a given objective
    function. Bayesian hyperparameter tuning relies on Bayes theorem to approximate
    the true objective function shown in Eq. (7) with a surrogate objective function
    – here, a Gaussian Process regression – that can be sampled efficiently. Recursively
    optimizing yields repeatedly improved sets of hyperparameters. Essentially, this
    allows for an informed search in the hyperparameter space when a full grid search
    is not feasible. For more details on Bayesian hyperparameter optimization we refer
    to [33]. The actual Bayesian hyperparameter optimization was done through Weights
    & Biases [34]. The final set of hyperparameters is shown in Table 2. An overview
    of the priors can be found in A.2. All variables were normalized and here too,
    an improvement was observed when predicting the first-order difference rather
    than the raw target. The target is then reverted to its original form for evaluation.
    The TFT implementation was obtained from Pytorch Forecasting v0.10.1, and Pytorch
    Lightning v1.6.5. Training was done for 50 epochs on a single Nvidia T4 GPU. Table

    We present a comparative analysis that highlights the effectiveness of our approach
    and provide insights into the practical relevance in varying agricultural scenarios.
    7.1. Model comparison The results are presented in Table 3. The TFT significantly
    outperforms all other approaches on all metrics. The discrepancy between the MAE
    and the RMSE shows that all methods might have (a few) larger forecasting errors,
    potentially due to the noisy dataset. Indeed, Fig. 5(a) shows that almost all
    models make some larger errors for orchard one — except for the VAR model. Furthermore,
    the MDA shows that the learned directional insight of the TFT is better. In fact,
    the other methods are only correct about the direction of the forecast in 50%
    (or less) of the forecasts — i.e. a random guess. Note that the naive method –
    by definition – does not have any directional insight, since it simply predicts
    a constant. The TFT on the other hand, shows more prowess about the direction
    of the forecast. In terms of -Risk, the TFT outperforms the other methods — though
    the LSTM gets close for the 0.9-risk. Table 3. Performance of the TFT compared
    to the global and local baselines on the unseen test set. The TFT outperforms
    the other approaches on all metrics with statistical significance. For the MAE
    (in kPa) and RMSE (in kPa) the Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. For the MDA,
    a test was used. *** marks the 0.01 significance level. For all tests the Bonferroni
    correction for multiple testing was applied [30]. No tests are performed for the
    -risk since those are global metrics. Model Type Test set performance Empty Cell

    the practical benefit of the TFT – allowing for conditional global information
    fusion due to the addition of static information – versus the other methods. Interestingly,
    the VAR-model has fewer larger errors in orchard zero compared to the other models.
    This suggests that the local approach flexibly adapts to sensors that are out
    of the ordinary. Though, note that its median MAE is higher than the other models
    in orchard zero indicating that the local gains are only marginal. Perhaps surprisingly,
    the naive model scores relatively good as shown in Table 3 and Fig. 5. However,
    a closer look at Fig. 5(b) shows that the good performance of the naive model
    is mainly due to its accuracy in the earliest forecasts, which are close to the
    last known value. This is further supported by Fig. 6, which shows the correlation
    between the last known value of and the true values at different forecasting horizons.
    Specifically, Fig. 6 shows a strong correlation during the earlier time steps,
    which weakens as time passes. As such, it is important to note that the naive
    model is not useful for longer-term forecasts as supported by Fig. 5(b) and Fig.
    6. For example, a prediction at for the naive model would not capture important
    changes in . Orchard one and two in Fig. 5(a) demonstrate the superior capability
    of the TFT to efficiently fuse the information from the different orchards in

    horizon representing the correlation between at time and at to . 7.2. Model interpretability
    One argument against global models – typically neural network-based – is their
    lack of interpretability. A key novelty of TFTs is the interpretable multi-head
    attention mechanism for time-series data. The attention heads permit for an interpretation
    of which time-steps the model pays attention to. Fig. 7(a) shows an example of
    a forecast on a random sample from the unseen test set. Note how the model pays
    the highest attention at the moment where the history of the target changes direction.
    Looking at the global attention in Fig. 7(b), a broader understanding of the attention-mechanism
    in the model can be acquired. On average, the model pays most attention to the
    value from seven days ago and then – in a downward trend – takes into account
    values from closer to the present day. However, attention varies widely across
    time as shown by the boxplots in Fig. 7(b). Note that the size of the look-back
    window was considered as a hyperparameter during Bayesian hyperparameter tuning
    (see Section 6.4) with seven being the minimal value considered. The insights
    from such attention mechanism can foster interesting discussions with e.g. agricultural
    experts and perhaps even deliver novel insights to the experts. Download : Download

    a five-day-ahead forecast of the first difference of soil water potential. The
    gray line (secondary y-axis) illustrates the attention of the model for this sample.
    Note how attention is the highest at the point where the observed value changes
    direction. The attention across the forecast-horizon sums to one. 7(b) shows side-by-side
    boxplots of attention per timestep (with mean-indicator) obtained from the model
    on the test set. Furthermore, thanks to the variable selection networks present
    in the TFT (see Section 5.2), a measure of variable importance can be established.
    The static variable importance in Fig. 8 corresponds well to expert knowledge.
    For example, the name of the particular pear orchard, the measurement year, and
    the depth of the sensor have the highest importance. This is to be expected since
    soil moisture will differ substantially depending on the orchard-specific characteristics
    and the year considered [10]. Further, different depth levels can have different
    root distributions. Sensors at different depths (especially those in deeper levels)
    might have a delayed soil moisture response to e.g. precipitation. As such, Fig.
    8 confirms that the TFT is capable to pick up on these regional and temporal differences.
    Note that the inclusion of static variables in the TFT allows to train a global
    model on this data despite the different characteristics present in the data.
    This is – inherently – not possible with local methods or other global methods
    such as the LSTM. Download : Download high-res image (500KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 8. Variable importance learned by the variable selection
    networks of the TFT. Fig. 8 also shows the variable importance for the historic
    and known variables. For historic information, the measurement month and soil
    temperature both receive nearly equal importance. The importance of the measurement
    month is as expected and shows again that the TFT picks up on temporal patterns
    available in the data. Soil temperature on the other hand, does not directly reflect
    expert knowledge. However, soil temperature is a proxy of evaporative demand.
    This could potentially explain why this variable is considered as important by
    the model since evaporative demand is known to influence soil water potential.
    In terms of known variables, the precipitation amount receives the highest importance,
    followed by measurement month and ETo. This is not a surprise since precipitation
    and ETo act as a supply and demand mechanism for soil moisture. As such, it is
    worth observing that the model accurately emphasizes those variables as important.
    It should be noted that precipitation and ETo are taken from the actual data and
    provided as future input. In reality however, one could rely on weather forecasting
    services to obtain future information for those variables. 7.3. Practical implications
    The practical applications of our findings are significant in the realm of smart
    agriculture. The advanced forecasting capabilities of the TFT model could potentially
    lead to more efficient and sustainable irrigation practices, tailored to specific
    needs of fruit orchards. This would not only enable optimization of water usage
    but would also support farmers in making informed decisions. This could ultimately
    enhance agricultural productivity and sustainability. However, to obtain actionable
    irrigation advice based on the -forecasts, further work is needed. To this end,
    one could rely on a simple rule-based system that gets triggered when a -threshold
    is reached (see e.g. [35]). More advanced prescriptive analytics or automated
    policy learning could also be explored to get a more precise or self-adapting
    advice. 8. Conclusion and future work In this work, we contribute to the literature
    by comparing global and local forecasting methods for the complex case of soil
    moisture forecasting in smart agriculture with various information sources. We
    showed that a transformer-based global approach outperforms the local and previous
    state-of-the-art global approaches with statistical significance. We discussed
    how – for noisy agricultural sensor data – efficient combination of heterogeneous
    information is necessary to skillfully forecast soil moisture sensors across multiple
    days. It is argued that the use of TFTs permits to build skillful global models
    due to its unique structure and its ability to incorporate static information,
    next to historical and temporal future information. This demonstrates the utility
    of an advanced global model such as the TFT for the complex use-case of soil moisture
    forecasting given limited local data. We built and trained all models on a challenging
    and unique dataset from pear orchards collected at different points in time from
    different locations. The statistically significant results indicate that the TFT
    better succeeds at exploiting the various exogenous data sources while the other
    approaches struggle with finding signal in the noise. As such, the TFT successfully
    incorporates multiple real-world datasets, ranging from soil moisture readings
    to weather station data across fields. It also aligns closely with expert knowledge
    by focusing on relevant variables. While all models are thoroughly trained and
    fine-tuned, it is noted that the local model – i.e. the VAR model – is a linear
    model. As such, more complex non-linear interdependencies that potentially exist
    in the data cannot be captured by a linear model like VAR, thus giving the TFT
    and LSTM a potentially inherent advantage. Improved multi-day forecasting of opens
    multiple future avenues of research. For example, the demonstrated ability to
    learn the underlying characteristics of can potentially help in forecasting other
    important measures such as — a measure of tree water status directly related to
    irrigation. Given our successful integration of various climatic data sources
    into one model, the use of such model as a foundation for domain adaptation towards
    other crops could also be explored. Additionally, exploring the feasibility and
    strategies for on-edge deployment can provide crucial insights into the practical
    application of these techniques in real-world scenarios. Lastly, prescriptive
    analytics should be explored to transform the forecasts into actionable irrigation
    advice as to directly reflect economic value for farmers. CRediT authorship contribution

    (IoT) plays a vital role in the entity sharing and minimizing the workload of
    the human beings in various aspects. Nowadays the term IoT is used in various
    fields such as health care, automobiles, industry, agriculture, and so on. Agriculture
    is the main source of food to whole world. There are various problems faced by
    the farmers in agriculture due to shortage and wastage of water and fertilizers.
    In this regard, an optimal IoT model has been developed and proposed to attain
    an effective crop field. The proposed IoT model will monitor, record temperature,
    and soil moisture values, which will be continuously analyzed to achieve optimal
    plant growth and yield. The motor will be connected to the IoT model which automatically
    switch on/off based on optimal threshold temperature and soil moisture content
    value. A novel irrigation algorithm named differential waterflow algorithm has
    been proposed and deployed in the proposed IoT model for the automatic usage of
    the motor in the field. The proposed IoT model provides a web interface to the
    user through the cloud storage, so that the farmer can control and monitor the
    system in remote. The proposed system will reduce the water consumption and will
    ensure the uniform water distribution to the crops through the Poisson distribution
    which results in increasing yield. 1 INTRODUCTION Economy of any country mainly
    deals with the growth in the agriculture. For the survival the countries in the
    world utilize their three-fourth of their human resource in the occupation of
    the agriculture. But nowadays growing an agricultural field is difficult when
    compared to the ancient days.1 The major reason for the decrease in the crop yield
    is wastage and shortage of the water and fertilizers.2 Many existing systems provide
    the irrigational methodology where the scarcity of water arises in the agricultural
    field. This is because of unavailability of rain and nonstorage of water in the
    wells. Another reason is the water storage body is also placed in maximum heights
    as well as in far distance.3 Based on the survey, agriculture utilizes more than
    three-fourth of the granted water in the world. Due to the growth in population,
    the maximum usage of water for agriculture occur which in turn leads to the rising
    demand in food items. The necessity arises in the current world to face the challenges
    in the shortage and wastage of water in achieving the optimal yield in the agricultural
    crop fields. So, there is a need for the work in maximizing the yield of the agricultural
    field with any of the effective measures. The current world is fully surrounded
    by technological components and improvements in various domains. One of the major
    domains named Internet of Things (IoT) will be highly useful to face the challenges
    in the agricultural crop field. IoT is the combination of various domains such
    as embedded system, wireless sensor networks, data analytics, and cloud computing.
    By using its features, the challenges faced by the current agriculture field can
    be addressed and solutions are provided to increase the yield in the crops of
    the agriculture field. Many feasibility studies have been performed before conduting
    the experimental analysis of the particular crop environments. In any irrigation
    system of an agricultural field, the crops in the soil get the water based on
    the variety of the soil. The water capacity for the crop is also measured based
    on the variety of the soil. The existing smart irrigation system infrastructure
    is built based on the processors like advanced RISC machines and radio frequency
    (RF). The objective of the RF model is to exchange the information to the controller
    in the irrigation model. This existing system consists of three end-user components
    to interact among themselves for the purpose of irrigation of crops of the particular
    agriculture field. The traditional smart irrigation systems are useful in improving
    the procedures of irrigation technology by using the algorithms in a schematic
    way and provide the improvised structure in the required nodes for the irrigation
    model.4, 5 The mobiles phones can be integrated with the IoT components for any
    useful work. IoT connects various electrical components located at various geographical
    locations. This connection establishes the communication between these devices
    using the internet. The sensor in the device acts as input and output of the model.
    The analysis can be performed by the IoT model for the prediction results and
    evaluation. The cloud technology of the IoT model is used to store the data of
    the process in any location of the cloud which is integrated with the IoT model.
    The current state of the component can be changed dynamically at a set interval
    to modify the inputs and to attain different results for the environment. AWS
    cloud storage has been used for this experimental setup and the connections are
    made default by the AWS interface after the login procedure. The processing unit
    of the IoT model contains the interaction devices which establish the communication
    to the user. Wireless fidelity device can be used for the interaction purpose
    in the IoT model. The sensor captures the input of the environment and analyses
    the input and translates into human understandable form and sends to the user.
    The mobile phones or any electronic interfaces can be used to receive the data
    from the IoT model by the user. This IoT model can be used to solve the water
    and fertilizer shortage and wastage problem of the agricultural field. Our proposed
    system will provide an optimal solution and will develop an effective irrigation
    model based on the humidity, temperature, and soil moisture of the field. As already
    mentioned the proposed model provides optimal solution for water scarcity in the
    agricultural crop fields by observation the various parameters such as temperature
    of the environment, humidity of the environment, and soil moisture of the particular
    field using the sensors of the parameters said above. The results of the parameters
    above said are sent to the user''s interface having the allotted IP address where
    the user can view the results of the parameters. The IoT model gathers the information
    from the allocated IP address in a nonstop way for analyzing the information.
    When the resultant values of the parameters such as temperature, humidity, and
    moisture exceed the threshold values of the environment, the IoT model automatically
    controls the motor of the field. Based on the values only the motor will ON/OFF
    automatically. The values are assumed as the threshold value through the proposed
    optimal algorithm called Differential Water-flow algorithm (DWA). The threshold
    value is based on three categories best, moderate, and worst. The working of the
    DWA has been depicted in the forthcoming sections. The interface which is connected
    to the cloud provides the resultant view to the user. The interface is a noncomplex
    utilized application which includes four icons. These four icons mention the state
    of the water motor, soil moisture resultant value view, temperature of the environment,
    and humidity of the environment. The state of the motor represents the current
    state of the pump in the agriculture field. 2 LITERATURE REVIEW A major survey
    has been done on the various layers such as identifying the objectives and working
    of the traditional systems, identifying the needs of the parameters of this problem,
    and identifying the preliminary steps in the generation of the proposed systems.
    The sensors to identify the level of moisture in the soil, the degree of temperature
    of the particular environment, and the sensors which exchange the information
    to the user interface are located at the root level of the crop. The algorithm
    is said to be designed to fix the threshold value of the moisture of the soil.
    The algorithm is appended in the microcontroller to monitor and manage the water
    quantity.6 An automatic model for irrigation to sense the values of the moisture
    in the soil was proposed to develop an irrigation model which automatically works
    for the water motor. It performs the ON/OFF operation based on the wetness of
    the soil of the crop field which is identified by the automatic model for irrigation.
    The limitation in this model was, it concentrated only on the identification of
    moisture level in the soil and transmitted to the user through any sensing devices.7
    The identified information about the parameters such as temperature, humidity,
    and moisture in the soil were transmitted to the famer of that particular agricultural
    field through SMS. Here for doing this operation the model utilizes wireless sensor
    network and observes the green environment of the agricultural field from the
    far away distance.8 For the purpose of plantation in an agricultural crop field
    remote irrigation depending upon the Arduino was proposed to generate the required
    water level by identifying the humidity of the environment from the remote. Here
    the humidity value is set to a point value, if the humidity value goes beyond
    the limit, then the irrigation system automatically provides water for the crops
    in that particular agricultural field.9 This model did not concentrate on the
    moisture present in the soil and temperature of the environment. It is also important
    to consider the power consumption for the motor usage of an agricultural crop
    field. One of the existing systems focused on the usage of power and water by
    developing a control system using GSM and Android. This existing system controls
    and manages the power and water of the particular environment.10 The optimal utilization
    of hardware was also important at that time due to minimization of the infrastructure
    in size. One of the existing system used low memory-utilizing microcontroller
    for controlling and managing the crops in the agricultural field.11 The traditional
    wireless drip irrigation automation was proposed to identify the moisture in the
    soil by using the sensors. Here also the model did not concentrate on the identification
    of temperature and humidity of the environment which helps in the yield of crops
    in the agricultural field.12 The latest microprocessor was used to improve the
    technologies used in the agriculture by updating the procedures in the working
    of the devices used in that environment. It also tried to provide better infrastructure
    by choosing the needed hardware in the building of its structure to establish
    the automation in irrigation.13 The data are stored in the database which is connected
    serially to a personal computer''s receiver board for the further purpose. The
    performance of the database has been improved by the usage of the neural network
    approach in its working procedure.14 The irrigation is done only in the places
    where the soil moisture value goes beyond the threshold value and other places
    of the crop field are not considered.15, 16 A novel resource clustering algorithm
    was proposed to enhance the effectiveness in the wireless personal environment.
    This particular work gave an idea of ways of approaching the personal network.17
    The agricultural growth depending on IoT will provide the highest priority to
    enhance the crop yield and for the improvement in the quality of yielded crops
    of the particular agricultural environment.18-20 An efficient performance evaluation
    model based on continuous Markov chain and Poisson process was proposed to show
    how the performance of the irrigation model can be evaluated.21 Many technologies
    had been deployed based on the convergence technology for the future agriculture
    which identifies the demand and supply of the crops early. It also manages the
    quality of the crop and current conditions for the crop growing which changes
    dynamically at certain time period.22 The relational analysis has been done by
    using the technology called text mining to ensure the analyses in correlations
    of the text based on agriculture, resident situations, inclusion, and removal
    of crops. This type of relational analysis is the initial step to be done for
    a technology to adopt the agriculture production system.23 The agricultural production
    model which depends upon IoT includes three components such as service offered
    by IoT, prediction based on statistics, and analysis done based on the relations.24
    Combining statistical models using modified spectral subtraction method for embedded
    system was proposed to produce an effective IoT environment related to agriculture
    in the future.25 These are the literatures undergone for the above-mentioned agricultural
    problem. Many of the existing systems considered anyone of the parameters, temperature,
    soil moisture, and humidity. The proposed IoT model will concentrate on all these
    three parameters for the efficient growth of the crops in the agricultural field.
    In addition to that the proposed model introduced a novel algorithm called DWA
    which automatically switch ON/OF the motor based on the set threshold value. The
    experimental results of the proposed system have been compared and evaluated with
    many of the above-said existing systems. In maximum cases the proposed algorithm
    performs well and produces the optimal growth for the crops in the agricultural
    field. 3 PROPOSED IRRIGATION SYSTEM USING IoT In the proposed IoT irrigation system
    many inexpensive sensors are used to monitor the temperature, humidity, and moisture
    in the soil of the environment. The proposed model observes the agricultural crop
    field 24/7 and transfers the details to the interface deployed using the cloud
    computing. The input information sensed by the sensor are managed in the cloud
    database. The procedure of the IoT model verifies and analyzes the received information
    with the set threshold value of the parameters such as humidity, moisture, and
    temperature of the environment. Based on these results the motor automation is
    performed by the procedure of the novel algorithm named Differential Workflow
    Algorithm (DFA) which is described through the pseudocode mentioned below. The
    conditions for the motor switch ON/OFF mentioned in the pseudocode of the proposed
    DFA. The structure of the proposed model is depicted by using the sections such
    as information investment, microcontroller component, section for transmission
    of wireless data, sections for storing the data in the database, processing the
    information and model of irrigation automation. The overall scenario of our work
    is shown in the Figure 1. FIGURE 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Flow diagram
    of the proposed working environment The flow diagram of the proposed working environment
    comprises three sections such as challenges in agriculture, solutions by the proposed
    system and benefits to the society. These three sections are dominated by the
    major objective “Innovations in Agriculture through IoT”. The first sections depict
    some of the major challenges in the agriculture such as wastage of fertilizer,
    shortage of water, difficulties in managing the costs, and difficulties in facing
    the increase in the needs. The section two deals with our initiatives to address
    the challenges in agriculture and gave solutions through the design of proposed
    systems. The proposed system is deployed using the latest technology IoT. This
    model identifies the level of moisture in the soil, temperature and humidity in
    the environment. By knowing these values, the proposed model switches the motor
    ON/OFF automatically. That is why the proposed model is mentioned as automated
    irrigation system. Section 3 concludes the flow diagram of the proposed working
    environment with the social benefits. The proposed system provided an optimal
    solution for growing the crops in the agricultural field. It increases the crop
    growth, enriches the economy of the society through optimal agricultural, optimal
    usage of water and fertilizer, and encourages the farmers in the cultivating the
    crops. 3.1 Pseudocode of the proposed DWA Input: Temperature value, Humidity Value,

    moisture The microcontroller belonging to Arduino is connected with the sensor
    and the procedures of the DFA are coded into the board for the operation. After
    the code deployed a cylinder structure material has been built to place the IoT
    model in it and located in the crop field. The sensor used to sense the moisture
    present in soil contains two electrodes and they are placed dipped in the soil.
    The electrodes are used to transfer electricity in to the soil. The soil which
    contains low level of moisture will pass more electricity in the soil and the
    soil which contains high level of moisture will transfer less electricity through
    in the soil. This will help in identifying the level of moisture in the soil.
    The objective function for humidity and soil moisture given is 3.3 Working of
    IoT Model in identification of level of humidity and temperature The next phase
    is to identify the humidity and temperature of the environment of the agricultural
    crop field. Humidity is defined as quantity of vapor of water in the atmosphere.
    The identification of comparative humidity is done based on the temperature change
    in the environment. The comparative humidity changes when there is a change in
    the environment''s temperature. The changes of the temperature and humidity of
    the environment occurs in both the cases as before irrigating the field and after
    irrigating the field. The quantity of water vapor level in the atmosphere is maximized
    after the completion of irrigation. Because of this particular scenario, temperature
    is minimized, at the same time the level of humidity is maximized in the environment
    of the agricultural crop field. The continuous notification is sent to the cloud
    interface where the farmer of that particular agricultural crop fields will have
    the knowledge of their environments from anywhere in the world. 3.4 Working of
    IoT model in identification of illumination power of the environment To identify
    the power of luminosity or illumination the luminosity sensor is used in the environment.
    Illumination strength plays a vital role in the growth of the agricultural crops
    and does the photosynthesis for that particular environment. Luminosity-based
    resistor has been utilized for the operation of the identification of illumination
    power of the environment. Here, when the flow of current is minimized indicates
    the maximum power of luminosity occurs in that particular agricultural crop field
    environment. The luminous power may change periodically at that time to identify
    the resistance the component called Ampere segregation switch is used. The level
    of ampere maximizes the power of luminosity when the ampere level is maximized.
    3.5 Procedure for information transmission using the wireless medium The information
    acquired from the sensors are transferred to the database server deployed in the
    cloud data center using the wireless medium. The wireless medium used here is
    MQE5K13. This particular medium is used for transmission of information between
    the agricultural crop field and the database server deployed in the cloud. 3.6GHZ
    transmitter and receiver have been used for this purpose. The microcontroller
    which is the heart of the proposed IoT model is connected to this transmitter
    and receiver to exchange the information. As the agricultural crop field acts
    as one of the end and named as back end and the web interface deployed using cloud
    acts as another end named as front end. The transmitter placed in the back end
    and the receiver is placed in the front end of the proposed model. Unique tokens
    are given to all the transmitter and receiver present in the proposed IoT model
    which is deployed in the agricultural crop fields. The source transmitter will
    have the knowledge of destination receiver''s token to pass the information to
    the particular receiver, because without knowing the receiver''s token the transmitter
    cannot pass the information to the receiver. As already said the receiver is tied
    with the interface of the farmer who can monitor and view the values of the temperature,
    humidity, and moisture level of the soil of the particular environment. The farmer
    as a user can access the interface at anytime and anywhere because the interface
    is deployed in cloud. 3.6 Information processing and concluding the values The
    information obtained from the agricultural crop field are transferred by the wireless
    medium MQE5K13 and loaded in the server present in the cloud datacenter with the
    help of connection-oriented network protocols. At regular intervals the IoT model
    receives the information and loads in the cloud database. The objective of information
    processing is to identify the information received from different sensors of the
    agricultural crop field and compares the information with the set threshold values.
    The set threshold value depends upon the variety of plants. Due to this the set
    threshold value will differ among the plants. Based on the working procedure of
    the DFA the motor will automatically switch ON/OFF according to the sensor values
    produced by the IoT model. 3.7 Smart irrigation model using proposed IoT approach
    The working of the proposed IoT approach start its operation of automation when
    it receives the information from the interface deployed on the cloud datacenter.
    The actuator sensors are used to transfer the managing messages from the interface
    to the input ports present in the physical layer of the IoT model. The actuator
    sensor works as a switch which is operated using the current. The mother board
    which has minimum load inputs is managed by using the actuator sensor. When the
    outside current is appended or flow on the corners of the actuator sensor then
    it enables ON/OFF of the motherboard depends upon the input value. To observe
    and identify the level of water in the well a special type of water sensor is
    used named OE5L928A. 3.8 Deployment of IoT in the proposed smart irrigation model
    The latest technology IoT has been deployed in the proposed model, where the IoT
    is major cause of dynamic technological behavior in today''s world. The main objective
    of the utilization of IoT in the proposed system is to exchange the information
    between the farmer and the proposed model. The data related to the soil is passed
    to the user interface deployed in cloud through many sensors which senses the
    soil parameters. Then the values of parameter such as level of moisture in the
    soil, temperature, and humidity are passed to the user interface in which the
    farmers can view and observe the information. All the information related to the
    crop is analyzed and sent to the user interface. As per the procedure of the proposed
    DWA, when the level of moisture of the soil is decreased, temperature and humidity
    of the environment increase and then the water will be spread to the field through
    the smart automated proposed IoT model which operates the switch ONN/OFF automatically
    based on the condition. When all the parameters such as soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity satisfies the set threshold value then the motor switches OFF automatically
    based on the condition of the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm DWA describes
    the water spreading to the field for all the cases which is depicted in the pseudocode
    of the DWA. 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS The proposed IoT model results are evaluated
    in a real crop agricultural field. The results are evaluated for the parameters
    moisture of the soil, humidity cum luminous power and temperature of the environment.
    The threshold limit is categorized into two ways such as upper control limit and
    lower control limit. Upper control limit represents the best category of threshold
    value limit and lower control limit represents the worst category of threshold
    value limit. The evaluation for these limits is shown by using the sigma calculation
    in the Figure 2. Some of the heterogeneous resources of both wired and wireless
    devices are used for this current research work. The simulation tool used for
    this research is AWS IoT model and a real IoT test bed environment fixed on the
    crop field. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Set threshold upper and
    lower limit The set threshold upper control limit and lower control limit is shown
    accurately using the proposed IoT model interface deployed in the cloud. This
    is shown in the Figure 3. As per this chart the temperature, humidity cum luminous
    power and moisture level of the soil is calculated. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Accurate view of the set threshold limit by proposed Internet of Things
    model Based on the threshold set value the luminous power of the environment in
    the agricultural crop field is calculated and shown in Figure 4. The luminous
    power is calculated in four categories as dark, dim, light, and bright. FIGURE

    been shown in Figure 5 soil moisture measurement based on threshold value. The
    first graph depicts the overall measurement of the level of moisture in the soil
    for the particular environment and second graph shows the deeper level of moisture
    present in the soil for the particular agricultural crop field. FIGURE 5 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Soil moisture measurement based on threshold value
    After the calculation of level of soil moisture in the agricultural crop field,
    the temperature of the environment is calculated on three categories as temperature
    in minus degrees or cold temperature environment, hot temperature environment,
    and moderate or flexible temperature environment. The calculated minus degree
    temperature is shown in Figure 6. Figures 6-10 contain two graphs, one graph is
    for overall calculation and another one is for accurate calculation. FIGURE 6

    Comparison of existing and proposed algorithms Based on the above calculation
    of humidity cum luminous power, soil moisture calculation, and temperature of
    the agricultural field the motor embedded using the proposed the IoT model automatically
    switches ON/OFF as per the procedure of the proposed DFA as shown in Figure 11.
    The proposed workflow algorithm produces 70% accuracy compared to that of existing
    approaches such as RTR and VTU approaches. The comparison graph is shown to justify
    the performance of the proposed system as shown in Figure 12. 5 CONCLUSION Agriculture
    plays a vital role in the growth of economy of any developing countries. Various
    crops what we had in the ancient days are not present now due to various issues
    in the current world. Agriculture faces various problems many due to the shortage
    and wastage of water. By keeping in this mind, our research work concentrated
    to address these problems and tried to provide solution. The paper proposed an
    IoT model containing a proposed algorithm called DFA. Our proposed IoT model calculates
    the parameters such as temperature, humidity, and level of moisture in the soil
    in most effective by using the set threshold value. The calculated value is given
    as input to the IoT model and the motor embedded with the IoT model switches ON/OFF
    based on the procedure of the algorithm mentioned above. The proposed approach
    DFA is compared with the some of the existing systems and their results are evaluated
    based on the threshold value. The proposed DFA performs well and produces the
    optimal solution to yield better crop percentage comparing to existing approaches.
    Further it is planned to propose an algorithm for the parameter value calculation
    by restricting the sensor and human interface by using the machine learning approach.

  description: The agricultural sector is witnessing a transformative shift with the
    integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, offering innovative solutions
    to enhance crop management practices. This research focuses on leveraging IoT
    for the effective management of diseases affecting onion plants in agriculture.
    By employing a network of sensors, data analytics, and automated control systems,
    this study aims to create a smart agricultural framework that monitors, detects,
    and manages onion plant diseases in real-time. The research begins with a thorough
    investigation into the common diseases affecting onion crops and their associated
    environmental factors. Subsequently, a robust IoT infrastructure is designed and
    implemented, comprising sensor nodes for monitoring soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and other relevant parameters. These sensor nodes communicate data to
    a central hub, where advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms analyze
    the information to detect early signs of diseases. In response to disease detection,
    the IoT system employs automated control mechanisms, including precision irrigation,
    targeted application of agrochemicals, and the deployment of environmental control
    measures. The study also explores the integration of remote monitoring through
    mobile applications, allowing farmers to receive real-time alerts and make informed
    decisions promptly. Through field trials and data analysis, the effectiveness
    of the IoT-based disease management system is evaluated, considering factors such
    as disease suppression, yield improvement, and resource efficiency. The research
    also addresses economic considerations and the scalability of the proposed IoT
    framework for widespread adoption in onion cultivation. The findings of this study
    contribute to the advancement of precision agriculture and sustainable farming
    practices, demonstrating the potential of IoT in revolutionizing onion plant disease
    management. As the global demand for agricultural productivity increases, integrating
    smart technologies into traditional farming practices becomes paramount, and this
    research provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the agriculture and technology
    sectors.

  description: The agricultural industry has been transformed by the Internet of Things
    (IoT) revolution, which has brought about cutting-edge solutions to problems relating
    to crop monitoring and management. This article provides a thorough analysis of
    a smart agricultural IoT system created for effective crop monitoring of crop
    moisture and temperature. The objective of this research is to create a comprehensive
    system that can continuously track temperature and moisture levels in agricultural
    fields, giving farmers useful information for smarter crop management decisions.
    To continually monitor and analyse important environmental parameters impacting
    crop growth, the created system incorporates several IoT components, such as wireless
    sensors, actuators, and cloud-based data analytics. Temperature and moisture are
    the two main factors that determine the health, yield, and general quality of
    the crop. Real-time temperature and moisture data are gathered from various points
    inside the agricultural field by the use of wireless sensors. The information
    is subsequently processed and interpreted by sophisticated data analytics algorithms
    on a cloud-based platform. According to the study, the IoT-based system effectively
    regulated environmental temperature, resulting in an average decrease to 26.2°C,
    while concurrently maintaining or improving soil moisture content, evidenced by
    an increase to 45%. Farmers with this guidance can therefore improve their decision-making
    processes and ultimately increase agricultural yield, sustainability, and economic
    consequences by utilising IoT capabilities. Further research and development in
    this area could revolutionized global agriculture and help ensure food security
    in the face of shifting climatic circumstances and rising population demands as
    IoT continues to develop.

  description: This paper addresses the concerns in irrigation mechanisms and employs
    a Sensors and cloud-based platform to monitor and control an irrigation system.
    In order to monitor the soil's moisture level in real time, moisture sensors are
    placed in the field. These sensors wirelessly provide data to the NodeMCU, which
    processes and relays the information. The NodeMCU gathers the sensor data and
    processes it, considering standard deviations and crop-specific parameters. Using
    this information, the system starts the water pump and opens the solenoid valves
    to begin the irrigation operation. The NodeMCU coordinates with these valve-opening
    devices via wireless communication. In addition, the system uses online weather
    prediction data to provide more precise watering schedule optimisation. The system
    dynamically modifies the irrigation schedule based on analysis of weather patterns,
    evapotranspiration rates, and crop water needs to save water during times of rain
    or high humidity. The solution makes use of cloud-based platforms to improve scalability
    and accessibility. The gathered sensor data and command instructions are safely
    transferred to the cloud server. This allows farmers to remotely check on and
    adjust the irrigation system by means of the web or mobile apps. In addition,
    data analytics methods may be used to infer information and provide suggestions
    for improved methods of water management and crop care. In conclusion, the Internet
    of Things (IoT) NodeMCU smart irrigation system provides an automated and intelligent
    approach to water management in agriculture. Water is saved, crop yields are boosted,
    and sustainability is enhanced thanks to the capacity to irrigate precisely based
    on real-time soil moisture data, weather predictions, and crop needs.

  description: — In Indonesia, the agriculture industry has been more reluctant than
    other sectors to adopt IoT, IT, and AI technology. Utilizing this technology will
    enable precision agriculture. This research aims to make and implement an IoT-Webserver-Android
    and Machine Learning-based soil PH factor monitoring tool system. The steps for
    making the tool system are divided into three subsystems. The first is a multiple
    sensors data acquisition subsystem, consisting of sensors for soil PH-Moisture,
    Temperature-Humidity, and Sunlight. The sensors are connected to the Arduino Uno
    microcontroller for serial communication with the ESP 8266 microcontroller for
    the Wi-Fi module. The second part is the monitoring subsystem with the local web
    application, which contains a MySQL database and a local web page. The third part
    is the monitoring subsystem with the Android application, which includes a real-time
    Firebase database and the application for real-time and mobile data display. The
    results have been implemented and display the expected outcomes. It is clear from
    the performance of the three subsystems. The outcomes of the tool system's data
    evaluation provide precise statistical values. Then, Machine Learning analysis
    generates accurate soil PH prediction models. It has been demonstrated that the
    monitoring system is applicable and has a favorable impact on data soil PH factor.
    The implication for the future is that this monitoring system should be added
    with Nitrogen-Phosphorus-Potassium sensors to measure soil nutrients. Also, the
    system added edge-analysis to be integrated in monitoring and analyzing soil nutrients.

    Information In Indonesia, the agriculture industry has been more reluctant than
    other sectors to adopt IoT, IT, and AI technology. Utilizing this technology will
    enable precision agriculture. This research aims to make and implement an IoT-Webserver-Android
    and Machine Learning-based soil PH factor monitoring tool system. The steps for

    is the monitoring subsystem with the Android application, which includes a real-time

  description: This study assessed the effects of rainfall on soil physico-chemical
    properties (pH, moisture, temperature, Nitrogen value, Phosphorus value and Potassium
    value) of MD2 pineapple cultivation on marginal soil, and also investigated correlation
    between rainfall and soil physico-chemical properties based on IoT-based monitoring.
    Agromon Smart Agriculture and NPK Sensors (Agromon) that is equipped with a Sigfox-based
    wireless transmitter was used to provide real-time marginal soil properties data
    from an experimental MD2 pineapple field plot in UiTM Sarawak. Rainfall data between
    March and July 2021 for Samarahan Rainfall Station were obtained from Department
    of Irrigation and Drainage, Sarawak (DID). Soil properties data were transmitted
    from field plot gateway to the nearest Sigfox base station in Santubong, and subsequently
    to SATU dashboard server in order to be accessible to all users. Agromon demonstrated
    the capability of IoT system in monitoring selected soil properties across favored
    and unfavored weather conditions. Pineapple farmers can make timely and cost-effective
    farm operation decision anywhere to optimize plant vigor and therefore, improve
    yield.

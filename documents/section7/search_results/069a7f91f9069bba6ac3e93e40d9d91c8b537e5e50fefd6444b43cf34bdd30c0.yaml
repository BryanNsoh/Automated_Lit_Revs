  description: To mitigate the unfavorable effects of excessive water resources consumption,
    mainly induced by poor performance of irrigation practices, efficient water resource
    management strategies are required. In response to this need, we have, in an innovative
    way, enhanced the water resources management (WRM) strategies by both considering
    the regional conditions with the graph model for a conflict resolution (GMCR)
    decision support system, and linking the irrigation concept and water resources
    allocation theory to develop a coupled WRM simulation–optimization model. Typically,
    implementation of the modified WRM strategies may cause local conflicts because
    of losing the original water rights. To improve the current irrigation water allocation
    system with the minimum objections, the hypergame theory was utilized to enhance
    the capabilities of traditional GMCR models by including the parties’ misunderstandings
    in the negotiation process and assessing the partial perceptions rather than crisp
    options. Moreover, by dynamic monitoring of available water resources and water
    consumption patterns, a WRM simulation model was developed, which is applicable
    in real agricultural conditions of multi-agricultural zones with multi-crop and
    intercropping systems and variable water supply sources. The genetic algorithm
    was utilized to allocate the water resources and determine optimal WRM strategies
    with the lowest irrigation water shortage. The efficiency of the proposed framework
    was assessed in conventional agricultural zones in Oman. The recommended strategies
    not only address local conflicts during the implementation of optimal WRM strategies,
    but also demonstrate significant potential to reduce the water shortage as a serious
    environmental concern.

    Efficient water resources management (WRM) strategies are essential to achieve
    sustainable agricultural production, especially in arid and semi-arid areas. The
    poor performance of conventional surface irrigation systems has led to increasing
    water scarcity and, thus highlights the need for more efficient WRM practices.
    In order to alleviate the environmental degradations, caused by over allocation
    of water resources for agricultural purposes, a wide variety of WRM strategies
    have been developed to mitigate the losses of valuable water resources (Klocke
    et al. 2006; Agarwal et al. 2019; Mohammadrezapour et al. 2019). The provided
    WRM strategies should be applicable considering both operational and regional
    limitations of the end users such as the farmers. Hence, it is crucial to develop
    optimal WRM strategies that can properly simulate real farm conditions and yield
    a straightforward irrigation scheduling. Moreover, the proposed strategies should
    consider the existing regional conditions to achieve a compromise resolution compatible
    with possible local conflicts caused by restricted irrigation water rights or
    forces on the farmers (as stakeholders) to change their irrigation systems. Simulation–optimization
    models have been extensively used in previous studies to determine WRM strategies
    (Fotakis, and Sidiropoulos 2014; Davijani et al. 2016; Lalehzari et al. 2016;
    Li et al. 2016; Habteyes, and Ward 2020; Yazdian et al. 2021). The majority of
    the developed models seek for the highest crop yields with the least possible
    destructive environmental effects (e.g., water consumption). However, when it
    comes to irrigation problems, the irrigation water is only determined in volume
    terms (e.g., Klocke et al. 2006; Lalehzari et al. 2016; Li et al., 2017, 2020)
    or assumed as predefined values (Dai and Li 2013), which is infeasible in real
    conditions and impractical from the farmers’ viewpoint. As a result, to achieve
    a practical outcome, more functional WRM strategies should be developed that determine
    irrigation duration and frequencies according to the type of irrigation system.
    The social aspect of adopting WRM strategies has been investigated by several
    studies using different approaches. Several studies have used conflict resolution
    models (e.g., game theory and agent-based model) to explore the conflicts related
    to the implementation of WRM strategies and provide sustainable management strategies
    (Gopalakrishnan et al. 2005; Hipel et al. 2008; He et al. 2014; Sedghamiz et al.
    2018; Pluchinotta et al. 2018; Yue et al. 2020; Mirzaei and Zibaei 2021; Villanueva
    and Glenk 2021; Dai et al. 2022; Okura et al. 2022). Among the proposed models,
    the graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR) has shown notable success in providing
    a stable strategy as a resolution to the arisen water allocation conflicts (e.g.,
    Kilgour and Eden 2010; Mehrparvar et al. 2020; Rêgo et al. 2021). Despite all
    the benefits, the original form of GMCR is barely capable of modeling complex
    situations such as managing limited resources or introducing reforms from above
    to the working class of society, which is surrounded by misperceived strategies
    and beliefs (Aljefri et al. 2017a, b, 2019; Hipel et al. 2020). In this respect,
    GMCR has been improved by Aljefri et al. (2017a) who implemented a hypergame approach
    to involve the stakeholders’ misperceptions (Hipel et al. 1988; Aljefri et al.
    2017a, 2018b). The enhanced GMCR results a more realistic resolution to the conflict,
    which ensures the viability of the obtained WRM strategies. In the present study,
    a WRM simulation–optimization model is developed to determine the WRM strategies
    including the optimal irrigation durations and frequencies for multi-crop and
    intercropping systems. The applicability of the developed strategies is assessed
    using an enhanced GMCR decision support system. In fact, the developed model attempted
    to fulfill the shortcoming of previous studies with the help of the following
    procedures: 1. Developing a water resources management (WRM) simulation model
    in the MATLAB® environment which is capable of (i) allocating water resources
    among several agricultural zones with selected irrigation methods (e.g., surface
    or pressurized irrigation systems) considering (ii) multi-crop and intercropping
    systems and (iii) variations in the capacity of available water resources over
    the crop growing period under (iii) different climatic conditions categorized
    as drought classes. 2. Determining the exact optimal values of irrigation durations
    and frequencies in the form of a WRM strategy which can be directly applied by
    the local farmers, coupling the genetic algorithm (GA) with the WRM simulation
    model. 3. Modeling the strategic decision-making process by identifying the possible
    options from all stakeholders’ perceptions and examining the conflicts that may
    arise in the time of implementing the proposed irrigation schedule, to determine
    the compromise WRM strategies using the GMCR-plus decision support system (Kinsara
    et al. 2015), improved by the hypergame theory. To summarize, the developed model
    attempts to combine the different options, which is well-suited for all stakeholders’
    interests, and propose a sustainable WRM strategy for mitigation of water shortage
    as an indicator of the model''s usefulness. The framework was tested in an ancient
    water supply system known as Al-Aswad falaj (elaborated in the case study section
    and the supplementary information (SI), section S.2) in Muscat, Oman, with three
    agricultural zones and multi-crop and intercropping systems. 2 Methodology The
    proposed methodology to obtain efficient WRM strategies is presented in Fig. 1.
    The implemented methodology is described in the following sections. Fig. 1 Flowchart
    of the proposed WRM simulation–optimization model which is enhanced by dynamic
    GMCR to determine compromise optimal WRM strategies with a focus on agricultural
    purposes Full size image 2.1 Collect Available Data and Information The following
    data was collected in the study area being required to investigate the regional
    availability of water supply and the irrigational water demands: 1. Number of
    existing farms and different crop types cultivated under the intercropping system,
    2. Cultivated area, number of perennial trees, and the fraction of different crops
    and trees in the intercropping system, 3. Historical data of climatic parameters
    obtained from the local weather station 4. Soil and crop characteristics in the
    area, such as field capacity (FC), permanent wilting point (PWP), soil bulk density,
    crops’ root depth, and maximum allowable depletion, for all farms, 5. The efficiencies
    of water conveyance and irrigation were measured to estimate the gross irrigation
    depth (FAO 1979), 6. And finally, the historical data of monthly water resource
    flow. A majority of the required data was taken through several field trips, land
    surveying, and discussions with local farmers and experts. A combination of geographic
    information system (GIS), Google Earth, and on-ground surveying was also used
    to determine the number of trees and other crops. Moreover, the soil characteristics
    were measured by extensive laboratory experiments, including the “Bulk Density
    Test”, “Hydrometer Test” for soil texture, and “Pressure Plate Test” (SI, Section
    S.5). 2.2 Determine the Required Parameters in WRM Simulation Model The developed
    simulation model determines the following parameters to measure the irrigation
    water shortage as a difference between available water resources and the water
    demand and provide appropriate irrigation scheduling. 1. Effective rainfall was
    one of the required parameters that plays a supplementary role in meeting the
    crops’ water requirements, especially in arid zones with limited surface/groundwater
    resources. In this study, the historical rainfall data were collected from the
    Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries, and Water Resources, Oman (responsible authority),
    and the amount of effective rainfall was derived from the average values calculated
    by three methods, namely dependable rain, empirical formula, and USDA soil conservation
    service (SI, section S.1). 2. As another decisive parameter, the flow from available
    water resources (the falaj system in this study, SI, section S.2) was included
    in the developed simulation model. The simulated flow was considered a monthly
    variable and compatible with the prevailing climate condition. Therefore, the
    standardized streamflow index (SSI) drought indicator was utilized to classify
    the historical data of water resource flow and determine the possible draught
    classes in the area based on eleven drought classes defined by the Hydroclimate
    Research Lab of the University of California, Irvine (UCI) (2018). The developed
    optimization model determined different WRM strategies for all possible draught
    classes, for which the ranges are shown in Table 1. 3. The water demand of agricultural
    zones was also determined according to the FAO Penman–Monteith method and crop
    coefficients (Allen et al. 1998; Zotarelli et al. 2010) (SI, section S.3). The
    effective irrigation water depth to meet the crops’ water requirements was limited
    by the irrigation net depth (dnet). The dnet (SI, Section S.4) was calculated
    according to the crop type and soil water contents (field capacity and permanent
    wilting point), which were measured by a proper number of field sampling considering
    the area of agricultural zones and extensive laboratory experiments including
    the pressure plate test (SI, Section S.5). Table 1 The drought classes and their
    related SSI range (adopted from the hydroclimate research lab of UCI, 2018) Full
    size table 2.3 Obtain Optimal Water Resources Management (WRM) Strategies The
    developed optimization model utilizes the genetic algorithm (GA) optimization
    engine to determine the required IS for WRM strategies by optimally allocating
    the irrigation water among different agricultural zones and minimizing the relative
    irrigation water shortage (Eq. 1). To achieve reliable WRM strategies, the annual
    water shortage was calculated considering varying monthly water supply and demand
    parameters, and also the differences of possible drought classes. Hence, the developed
    model provides different WRM strategies for specific drought classes. $$ \\min
    \\,DIF = \\sum\\limits_{m = 1}^{12} {\\left| {\\sum\\limits_{z = 1}^{{N_{z} }}
    {\\frac{{IrrA_{m}^{z} - IrrN_{m}^{z} }}{{IrrN_{m}^{z} }}} } \\right|} \\quad \\forall
    \\,\\,IrrA_{m}^{z} < \\,\\,IrrN_{m}^{z} $$ (1) As shown in Eq. (1), the relative
    irrigation water shortage was determined as a summation of the relative difference
    of the irrigation water applied to the zone z in mth month (\\(IrrA_{m}^{z}\\))
    and its corresponding water demand (\\(IrrN_{m}^{z}\\)) in millimeters, for total
    number of agricultural zones (\\(N_{z}\\)) over the 12 months of the year. The
    \\(IrrN_{m}^{z}\\) is calculated using Eq. (2). $$ IrrN_{m}^{\\,z} = \\,\\frac{{DEM_{Total}^{m,\\,z}
    \\times D_{m} }}{{A_{land}^{z} }} $$ (2) Here, the \\(IrrN_{m}^{z}\\) is calculated
    by multiplying the total water demand of zone z in mth month (\\(DEM_{total}^{m,z}\\),
    mm3/day) and the number of days in mth month (Dm, day) divided by the area of
    zone z (\\(Area_{\\,land}^{\\,z}\\), mm2). As explained in SI, section S.3, the
    \\(DEM_{total}^{m,z}\\) is calculated considering the monthly crop evapotranspiration
    for all the available crops. The crop evapotranspiration is a function of the
    reference evapotranspiration value in the area. The \\(IrrA_{m}^{z}\\) is also
    determined as shown in Eq. (3). $$ IrrA_{m}^{\\,z} = (AppW_{m}^{\\,z} \\times
    IrrF_{m} ) \\times IrrfC \\times IrrfA $$ (3) The \\(IrrA_{m}^{z}\\) is actually
    a function of irrigation water amount applied to the zone z in each irrigation
    duration in mth month (\\(AppW_{m}^{z}\\), mm), which is limited to the maximum
    value of irrigation net depth (dnet), the irrigation frequency in mth month (\\(IrrF_{m}\\)),
    and the conveyance efficiency (\\(IrrfC\\)) and irrigation application efficiency
    (\\(IrrfA\\)) factor. The \\(AppW_{m}^{z}\\) is considered equal to the actual
    amount irrigated water until reaching the value of corresponding irrigation net
    depth: $$ AppW_{m}^{z} = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {AppI_{m}^{z} \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,if\\,AppI_{m}^{z}
    \\le d_{net}^{z,\\,m} } \\\\ {d_{net}^{z} \\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,if\\,AppI_{m}^{z}
    > d_{net}^{z,\\,m} } \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right. $$ (4) where: \\(AppI_{m}^{z}\\):
    Irrigation water applied to zone z in each irrigation duration in mth month (mm).
    \\(d_{net}^{z,\\,m}\\): irrigation net depth of zone z in mth month (mm). In this
    study, the \\(AppI_{m}^{z}\\) of every month in each farming zone (Eq. 5) is calculated
    for each unit of the zone area (\\(Area_{land}^{z}\\)) by multiplying the Flow
    in mth month (, mm3/day) plus the amount of effective rainfall (\\(P_{eff,m}\\),
    mm/month) and the chosen irrigation duration of zone z in mth month (\\(IrrD_{m}^{z}\\),
    day). $$ AppI_{m}^{z} = \\frac{{Dis_{m} \\times IrrD_{m}^{z} }}{{Area_{land}^{z}
    }} + \\frac{{P_{eff,m} \\times IrrD_{m}^{z} }}{{D_{m} }} $$ (5) Finally, the irrigation
    frequencies are controlled to stay feasible using the following equation: $$ IrrIF_{m}
    \\le \\left[ {\\frac{{D_{m} }}{{\\sum\\limits_{z = 1}^{{N_{z} }} {IrrD_{m}^{z}
    } }}} \\right] $$ (6) Accordingly, given the irrigation method, the proposed WRM
    strategies provides an irrigation scheduling (IS) which consists of (an) irrigation
    duration(s) (\\({\\text{IrrD}}_{{\\text{m}}}^{{\\text{z}}}\\)) for each zone and
    two irrigation frequencies (IrrFm) for normal and peak growth periods, which are
    computed by the GA optimization model as the decision variables. The obtained
    parameters at different simulation stages were compared with the results obtained
    from available valid simulation engines. As an example, the crop water requirements
    determined by the developed model were compared with the results of the CROPWAT
    decision support tool (SI, section S.7). The developed model was then utilized
    to determine three different values of water shortages for related types of IS.
    First of all, current (traditional) IS was applied within the simulation model
    to analyze the existing water shortage. Next, an optimal IS was developed with
    the current surface irrigation system to assess its efficiency in reducing the
    water shortage. This IS consists of one irrigation duration and two irrigation
    frequencies, which differ among the possible drought classes, and can be easily
    applied by the local farmers. At the final stage, the model was adjusted by the
    characteristics of an improved flexible irrigation system (e.g., pressurized irrigation
    system), and the optimal IS compatible with the modified irrigation system was
    identified to assess its superiority over two former types of IS. 2.4 Develop
    the WRM Strategies and Assess The Possible Local Conflicts as a First-Level Hypergame
    in Graph Form As discussed in subSect. 2.3, the developed WRM strategies consist
    of relevant irrigation scheduling that should be implemented by a series of management
    strategies. Implementing the optimal WRM strategies may cause conflicts in any
    traditional-based agricultural community due to, for example, changes in the farmer’s
    original water rights and misunderstanding of the new WRM strategies, especially
    in developing countries with ill-educated farmers. To investigate the potential
    limitations of the proposed WRM model, a GMCR model was developed in which all
    stakeholders (e.g., farmers and water management organizations) in the study area
    were considered as decision-makers (DMs) whose preferences and actions were examined.
    In such cases, the farmers are thoroughly risk-averse and strive to maintain the
    current condition at any cost, which makes them careless about all the provided
    information. On the other hand, governments only stick to ineffective solutions
    and refuse to improve their approach how to implement management strategies. Hence,
    both farmers and government have a partial understanding of each other options,
    courses of actions, and priorities and the conflict becomes a hypergame (combination
    of different subjective games) considering the focal viewpoint of each DM. The
    existing conflict was simulated as described in the following: (i) Developing
    the stable states (WRM strategies). Assuming that the water management organization
    (WMO) fails to inform farmers, address the farmers misperceptions and considers
    its inefficient activities to be sufficient, a first-level hypergame in graph
    form was developed to model the relations between farmers and the WMO. GMCR-plus,
    a program based on the decision support system, was employed to determine a stable
    irrigation/water storage strategy. First, all DMs as well as their options (the
    universal set of options) and preferences, were modeled, which was determined
    by the analyst using the gathered information and the regional situation investigations.
    The options assumed by each DM depended on their perception level and were labeled
    as misperceived, unknown, or correct. Then, the feasible states, which consist
    of different selections of universal sets of options and the relative preferences
    from each DM point of view, were modeled in their subjective game based on their
    perception of the conflict. The stability of feasible states was assessed by four
    stability definitions, including Nash stability, sequential stability (SEQ), general
    metarationality (GMR), and symmetric metarationality (SMR) (Nash, 1951; Howard
    1971; Fraser and Hipel, 1984). Finally, the stable states of subjective games
    were combined to determine the states of the first-level hypergame. The Cartesian
    product of stable states in the decision-makers (DMs) subjective games was introduced
    as the stable states of the first-level hypergame. The equilibrium state can belong
    to any of equilibrium classes such as steady, unsteady or stealthy as defined
    by Aljefri et al. (2017a, b). These classes actually determine the influence level
    of misperceptions on the equilibrium states and the reaction of DMs after being
    informed about the real situation. (ii) Dynamic evolution of the conflict. The
    standard form of GMCR evaluates the conflict in a linear static form through which
    the modeled options and priorities lead to an outcome (Yang et al. 2021). However,
    in real-world situations, the conflict atmosphere may dynamically be influenced
    by external time-dependent factors or internal factors like primary conflict outcome
    (Shahbaznezhadfard et al. 2021; Shahbaznezhadfard et al. 2022). As explained above,
    the first-level hypergame may result in an equilibrium class that is not desirable
    to one or all the DMs (Aljefri et al. 2017a, b); hence, assessing the conflict
    attributes must be mandatory after each round of negotiation. The concept of dynamic
    GMCR was applied here as introduced by Shahbaznezhadfard et al. (2020). Through
    this concept, the outcome obtained from the primary resolution of the conflict
    was fed back as an internal factor to a recent model. In fact, the conflict evolves
    to a further stage which should be analyzed to determine the actual outcome (Fig.
    2). Fig. 2 Schematic representation of dynamic GMCR Full size image (iii) Sensitivity
    analysis of the stable states. The theorems defined and proved by Zhao et al.
    (2019) were utilized to analyze the sensitivity of the equilibrium states in the
    conflict towards alterations in preferences ranking. In the following, several
    explanations are given that are required to describe the stability definitions
    in a case of a conflict between two decision-makers: (a) Decision-makers: $$ DM_{i}
    \\,\\,\\forall \\,\\,i \\in \\left\\{ {1,\\,2} \\right\\} $$ : a conflict between
    two decision-makers (b) Feasible states: $$ S = \\left\\{ {S_{a} ,S_{b} ,\\, \\ldots
    ,S_{n} ,\\,\\, \\ldots ,S_{t} } \\right\\} $$ : the set of feasible states, Where
    “t” equals the total number of feasible states (c) Preference ranking: \\(S_{a}
    \\succ_{DMi} S_{b} \\,\\): DMi prefers Sa more than Sb. \\(S_{a} \\sim_{DMi} S_{b}
    \\,\\): DMi prefers Sa and Sb equally. (d) Payoff value of states: $$ P_{DMi}
    = \\left\\{ {P_{{S_{a} }} ,P_{{S_{b} }} ,\\, \\ldots ,P_{{S_{n} }} ,\\,\\, \\ldots
    ,P_{{S_{t} }} } \\right\\} $$ : the payoff value of the feasible states for DMi
    $$ \\begin{gathered} if\\,S_{a} \\succ_{DMi} S_{b} \\, \\succ_{DMi} \\cdots \\succ_{DMi}
    S_{n} \\succ_{DMi} \\cdots \\succ_{DMi} S_{t} \\hfill \\\\ :\\,P_{{S_{t} }} =
    1,\\,P_{{S_{a} }} = P_{{S_{b} }} + 1 \\hfill \\\\ \\end{gathered} $$ (e) Matrix
    of unilateral moves: $$ J_{DMi} = \\,\\left[ {\\begin{array}{*{20}c} {J_{aa} }

    of the developed WRM simulation–optimization model was assessed in the Al-Aswad
    falaj located in the wadi (catchment) Mayh, capital of Oman, Muscat (Fig. 3).
    It is located between 23°20′ N and 23°25′ N latitude and 58°30′ E and 58°35′ E
    longitude. Rainfall is highly localized and extremely irregular, with annual mean
    rainfall ranging from less than 100 mm along the coast to more than 200 mm in
    the mountains. This low and erratic rainfall, accompanied by a high potential
    evaporation of about 2,150 mm/yr, results in arid to semi-arid conditions. More
    information about Al-Aswad falaj is provided in SI, section S.2. Fig. 3 The Al-Aswad
    falaj and three main agricultural zones Full size image Traditionally, farmers’
    irrigation scheduling was determined based on the size of farmlands and their
    participation in the construction and maintenance of falaj systems (Al Marshudi,
    2007). In fact, the specified irrigation scheduling was not based on the required
    irrigation water, which has led to significant water overuse. According to this
    type of irrigation scheduling, regardless of the required irrigation demand and
    more importantly, the climatic conditions (e.g., dry, normal, and wet), the farmers
    are allowed to have the full flow of the falaj for irrigation of their farmlands
    during the time known as the irrigation duration. Once all farmlands receive their
    share of water, the process is repeated in a cyclic way, which is known as irrigation
    frequency. The irrigation duration and frequency are collectively known as irrigation
    scheduling (IS). It is clear that the currently applied IS is not optimal, and
    therefore, a significant amount of irrigation water is overused. The irrigation
    interval of the Al-Aswad falaj is 6 days, and the irrigation durations for zones
    1, 2, and 3 are 1, 1, and 4 days, respectively. Since socioeconomic factors play
    a key role in determining the irrigation scheduling of the zones, the importance
    rank of the zones follows the order: 3, 2, and 1, in which zone 3 is the most
    important part and claims more water in comparison to the other zones. The historical
    data of the falaj flow over 1991–2018 were collected to determine the available
    water and investigate the relative irrigation water shortage under the current
    IS. Taking advantage of the SSI drought indicator, the flow data were divided
    into eight drought classes (D2 to W3). The total water demand of the three agricultural
    zones was calculated considering the existing crops and climate conditions. The
    historical meteorological data between 2011 and 2018 were used to estimate the
    reference evapotranspiration (ET0) for the eight drought classes (SI, section
    S.6, Fig. S4). Based on the collected data and information obtained from the conducted
    field trips (Table 2), the annual water demand was calculated as the summation
    of water demand of all existing crops (Fig. 4). Crop coefficients of 0.96, 1.1,
    1.2, and 0.64 were determined for date palm trees, bananas, lemon, and corn silage,
    respectively (FAO, 1977; Allen et al. 1998). Table 2 Existing crops in the three
    agricultural zones Full size table Fig. 4 Annual water demand of the three agricultural
    zones supplied by the Al-Aswad falaj. Note: The water demand is a function of
    temperature conditions as well as cultivation patterns. For instance, in dry periods,
    with capacity reduction of water resources, secondary plants such as corn were
    eliminated and as a result, the water requirement was reduced Full size image
    Due to slight variations in the water demand (Fig. 4), the eight different drought
    classes were reduced to three, i.e., wet, normal and dry years. In wet and normal
    years, except for 2001, (Fig. 5a, b), the annual water demand was less than the
    available volume of irrigation water delivered by the Al-Aswad falaj (the only
    source of irrigation water). In these years, the excess water, which was wasted
    with the current IS, can be stored and used as supplementary irrigation water
    to compensate for the water shortage in the dry periods or developing purposes.
    On the other hand, the large shortage of water supply in dry years has compelled
    farmers to allocate the available irrigation water only for perennial crops, especially
    date palms, which reduces the annual water demand during these years; however,
    the water demand is still more than the available irrigation water (Fig. 5c).
    Fig. 5 The comparison of annual available irrigation water and total water demand
    of all three agricultural zones Full size image To determine the effective irrigation
    water depth, the actual volume of irrigation water in the agricultural zones was
    assessed using the irrigation net depth (dnet). Extensive laboratory tests were
    performed to determine the soil characteristics of the collected soil samples
    (SI, Fig. S2), which were used to calculate dnet (SI, Section S.5). Using the
    data provided in Table 3 and SI, section S.5, the dnet was calculated to be 80.9,
    83.0, and 90.7 mm for agricultural zones 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Moreover, the
    maximum allowable depletion (MAD) and the average root depth (RD) of 0.525% and
    2.5 m were respectively considered for all crops cultivated under the intercropping
    system in all agricultural zones (Allen et al. 1998). Table 3 Soil characteristics
    of agricultural zones 1, 2, and 3 Full size table Regarding the irrigation system
    in the agricultural zones, the respective values of water conveyance and irrigation
    application efficiencies were measured. The locally applied irrigation frequencies
    and durations for the current surface irrigation system in the study area have
    led to a considerable overuse of water and water shortage, respectively, in wet
    and dry years. Hence, the obtained information was utilized to develop the WRM
    simulation–optimization model and determine the optimal ISs, which can be used
    in the future for different drought classes according to the different irrigation
    methods. In this regard, the regional condition should be studied carefully to
    ascertain the applicability of the provided aflaj water management strategies.
    The WMO, as a conventional approach, decides to establish a water user association
    (WUA) center in this region with responsibilities to regulate the water allocation
    and provide public subsidies or investment options to facilitate the farmers’
    cooperation with the WMO. The WUA incur considerable fees as a penalty for high
    water consumption by farmers to put an end to the use of the traditional (current)
    IS. On the other hand, the farmers, who are mostly risk-averse individuals, only
    consider the cost and risks associated with improving the irrigation methods (e.g.,
    pressurized irrigation systems) and reject any changes. They actually misperceive
    the purpose of WMO and neglect all the provided data, information and issued warnings.
    The existing conflict was examined by adopting the first-level hypergame theory
    to study the unsuccessful policy of the WMO causing misperceptions among farmers.
    The GMCR-plus decision support system was utilized to model and analyze the conflict
    through the GMCR concept. As it can be seen from Table 4, two options can be selected
    by farmers: 1) keep the current IS or 2) follow the WMO optimal IS. Table 4 also
    shows the WMO-selected options and the related farmers’ level of perception. Table
    4 The WMO and farming zone options and their level of perception Full size table
    As shown in Table 4, the WMO considers two scenarios to achieve improvements:
    (i) providing subsidies based on the reduced amount of irrigation water consumption
    and (ii) encouraging investments in water-related plants and making water selling
    a great incentive for farmers to improve their irrigation. However, if farmers
    refuse the changes, (iii) they have to pay the prohibitive over-consumption fees
    which is determined by the WUA. Option (5) (Table 4) has been misperceived by
    farmers; they believe that the over-consumption fines are payable and not restrictive
    enough to make the irrigation system improvements worthy (option (6)). Such misperception
    about the WUA circumstances strongly affects the farmers’ priorities and the way
    they rank the states, accordingly. On the other hand, the WMO assumes that they
    have provided sufficient information and the farmers are well aware of the consequences
    and the prohibitive cost of consumption according to the current IS. Hence, two
    different games, labeled as \\(G_{FZ}\\) and \\(G_{WMO}\\) should be studied to
    involve both decision-makers'' points of view. First, the universal set of states
    is developed. The six options (Table 4) can be chosen or not; hence, 26 = 64 possible
    states exist in this conflict, some of which are infeasible. The “Current” and
    “Optimal” options for FZs and “Buy water”, “Subsidies”, “Prohibitive fee”, and
    “Payable fee” options for the WMO were mutually exclusive and should be selected
    individually. Thus, 16 and 33 states were respectively infeasible. Furthermore,
    each decision-maker would take one option and 7 states in which one decision-maker
    may choose no option became infeasible. At the final stage, considering the meaningless
    states (i.e., Simultaneity of “Optimal” and “Prohibitive fee” or “Payable fee”)
    two other states were infeasible, and therefore, 6 feasible states remained to
    model the conflict (Table 5). Table 5 The universal set of feasible states for
    the developed first-level hypergame (farming zones (FZ)-water management organization
    (WMO) conflict) Full size table It can be understood from the states (Table 5)
    that the WMO suggests providing subsidies or investments if farmers accept to
    reduce their water consumption by (i) changing ISs with the current irrigation
    system or (ii) improving their irrigation system. Clearly, the subsidy amount
    depends on the improvement level. Also, more excess water results in more profits
    through water selling. \\(G_{FZ}\\) was analyzed to determine the equilibrium
    states as perceived by farming zones. The feasible states 1 to 5 were considered
    by farming zones and ranked from the most to least preferred in their subjective
    game. The preference rankings are illustrated in Table 6. Table 6 States ranking
    in the WMO-farming zones conflict as perceived by farming zones (\\(G_{FZ}\\))
    Full size table Next, the \\(G_{WMO}\\) was investigated to obtain the equilibrium
    states of conflict as perceived by the WMO. The WMO assumes that the WUA activities
    have been efficient and the farmers are well aware of the consequences of continuing
    current IS and determined to improve their irrigation systems. The preference
    order of states for farming zones and the WMO, as perceived by the WMO, is shown
    in Table 7. Table 7 States ranking in the WMO-farming zones conflict as perceived
    by the WMO (\\(G_{WMO}^{{}}\\)) Full size table 4 Results and discussion The developed
    water resources management (WRM) simulation–optimization model was utilized to
    determine optimal WRM strategies, which result in an optimal IS with specified
    irrigation duration(s) and frequencies. In order to guarantee the applicability
    of the developed WRM strategies in the target region, the arisen conflict was
    studied to provide appropriate regional solutions. 4.1 Optimal WRM strategies
    Two scenarios of (i) enhancing the IS with the current irrigation system and (ii)
    improving of the irrigation system to achieve more flexible IS were considered
    to develop the WRM strategies. The developed simulation model was utilized to
    determine the annual relative irrigation water shortage for the aimed ISs. First,
    the traditional IS with the current surface irrigation system was applied to determine
    the actual water shortage. In this respect, the historical data of the falaj flow
    (Fig. 5) were employed which has been applied in the study area by the farmers
    since 1858. Then, WRM strategies were developed considering the implementation
    of the surface irrigation method, and the results were compared with the current
    condition (Fig. 6). The results reveal that the developed optimal surface IS reduces
    the annual relative irrigation water shortage from 23 to 19% in dry years and
    to more than 5% in normal years, as shown in Fig. 6. Even when the available irrigation
    water was more than the total water demand of agricultural zones in 1995 and 2007,
    the percentage of relative irrigation water shortage is considerable due to the
    limitations of the current surface irrigation system with common values of irrigation
    durations and intervals over the year. Fig. 6 Comparison of relative irrigation
    water shortage (RIWS) for current (traditional) and optimum (optimal surface)
    irrigation scheduling Full size image The WRM strategies for the surface irrigation
    system consist of an IS with one irrigation duration and two irrigation frequencies
    for normal and peak growth periods (as stated earlier, the implementation of monthly
    variable irrigation frequencies is impractical using the surface irrigation system).
    Figure 7 shows the optimal surface IS that was produced by the genetic algorithm
    in MATLAB® environment for a population size of 180 after reaching the specified
    maximum number (100) of generations. Fig. 7 The optimal irrigation scheduling
    with surface irrigation system Full size image Despite all the advantages of the
    developed optimal surface IS, the results (reduction of almost 5% of water shortage
    in dry years) are not significantly satisfying because the surface irrigation
    systems limit the application of the fully flexible optimal IS with monthly variable
    irrigation durations and frequencies. Such limitations necessitate the adoption
    of an efficient IS to achieve the lowest level of water shortage in the agricultural
    zones. In pressurized irrigation systems (e.g., a mix of bubblers for perennial
    crops and tapes for corn silage), the irrigation durations can be easily controlled.
    Hence, 12 different irrigation durations were proposed throughout the year. Moreover,
    two irrigation frequencies were determined over the normal and peak growing periods.
    The optimal pressurized IS was also produced by genetic algorithm in MATLAB® environment
    for a population size of 1,440 after reaching the specified maximum number of
    150 generations. As an example, the obtained IS for normal years is shown in Fig.
    8. The optimal pressurized ISs for wet and dry years are also presented in SI,
    section S.8, Fig. S7. Fig. 8 Optimal irrigation scheduling (IS) for pressurized
    irrigation system in normal years Full size image Finally, the developed ISs were
    compared to thoroughly assess the extent of the influence of modified ISs in reducing
    the irrigation water shortage, as depicted in Fig. 9. Figure 9 shows the superiority
    of the pressurized irrigation systems in reducing the annual water shortage up
    to 15% in the three agricultural zones, which can truly justify the required costs
    to set up and operate this system. Fig. 9 Annual relative irrigation water shortage
    (RIWS) of the current and optimal irrigation schedulings (ISs) for surface and
    pressurized irrigation systems in the three agricultural zones Full size image
    4.2 Developing compromise WRM strategies The results showed that traditional surface
    irrigation is required to be replaced with more efficient irrigation systems (e.g.,
    pressurized systems) to achieve the minimum water shortage for all agricultural
    zones. It is obvious that such changes (both in the irrigation scheduling and
    irrigation systems), especially in the early years, may cause some local conflicts
    between farmers and the water management organization (WMO). The developed GMCR
    model was utilized to determine the compromise WRM strategy in the studied region.
    4.2.1 Conflict resolution analysis As illustrated in Sect. 3, the conflict was
    modeled as a first-level hypergame which consists of two subjective games (\\(G_{FZ}\\)
    and \\(G_{WMO}\\)). \\(G_{FZ}\\) was analyzed to determine the subjective game
    equilibrium states regarding the standard GMCR solution concepts (Table 8). Table
    8 Stability analysis and equilibrium results of \\(G_{FZ}\\) Full size table The
    results shown in Table 8 reveal that state S5 was stable under all solution concepts
    in \\(G_{FZ}\\). The S5 consists of options selected by the farmers and WMO, and
    can be shown as: \\(g_{FZ}^{S5} = \\left( {NY} \\right)^{T}\\) and \\(g_{WMO}^{S5}
    = \\left( {NNNY} \\right)^{T}\\). In this regard, the farmers prefer to follow
    their traditional IS with the current irrigation system and accept the possible
    over-consumption fines in the future. The equilibrium states for \\(G_{WMO}\\)
    is also shown in Table 9. Table 9 Stability analysis and equilibrium results of
    \\(G_{WMO}\\) Full size table As shown in Table 9, states S3 and S6 are the stables
    state under all solution concepts for \\(G_{WMO}\\), which consists of the following
    strategies:\\(g_{FZ}^{S3} = \\left( {YN} \\right)^{T}\\), \\(g_{WMO}^{S3} = \\left(
    {NYNN} \\right)^{T}\\),\\(g_{FZ}^{S6} = \\left( {NY} \\right)^{T}\\) and \\(g_{WMO}^{S6}
    = \\left( {NNYN} \\right)^{T}\\). Finally, the equilibrium states of the first-level
    hypergame were determined to provide clear strategic insight into the conflict.
    The solution concepts are developed considering different stability definitions.
    Hence, the selected states were required to be stable under similar definitions.
    For instance, the equilibrium states were obtained as a Cartesian product of the
    Nash stable states of farming zones and the WMO in \\(G_{FZ}^{{}}\\) and \\(G_{WMO}^{{}}\\),
    respectively. The Cartesian product of \\(g_{FZ}^{S5} = \\left( {NY} \\right)^{T}\\),
    \\(g_{WMO}^{S3} = \\left( {NYNN} \\right)^{T}\\) and \\(g_{WMO}^{S6} = \\left(
    {NNYN} \\right)^{T}\\) are shown in Table 10. Table 10 The Cartesian product of
    the Nash stable states of farming zones and the water management organization
    Full size table The Cartesian product of the stable states under the other stability
    definitions can also be calculated with a similar result. As shown in Table 10,
    states S4 and S6 were equilibrium states of the developed first-level hypergame.
    4.2.2 Dynamic analysis of conflict evolution The equilibrium states obtained in
    the previous section, can be categorized into two stability classes, according
    to Aljefri et al. (2017a, b). State S4 is an unsteady hyper equilibrium; although
    the state has been recognized to be feasible in both subjective games, it was
    not selected as a Nash equilibrium in WMO subjective game. This situation promotes
    the WMO to lead the conflict to future rounds. State S6 is also classified as
    a stealthy hyper-equilibrium. In this case, it becomes clear that the farmers
    have misperceived and underestimated the regulation consequences. This certainly
    motivates the farmers to more delicately seek the provided information encouraging
    the WMO authorities to disclose further detailed data on the benefits of irrigation
    system improvements. This situation pushes the negotiation to a future round,
    as desired by both decision-makers. By eliminating the misunderstandings between
    farmers and the WMO, both of them desire to reach a more favorable level in their
    conflict. Hence, the dynamic investigation of the conflict is essential. The outcome
    of obtained equilibrium states is applied to the second GMCR model as internal
    factors (as shown in Fig. 2). In this stage, the farmers clearly perceive the
    consequences of following the current irrigation system and become attracted by
    the benefits of adopting the optimized system. Furthermore, the WMO understands
    that they have to act in a more effective way than just establishing a regulating
    center. The feasible and preference rankings of the second GMCR model are shown
    in Tables 11 and 12, respectively. Table 11 The feasible states of the farming
    zones (FZ)-water management organization (WMO) conflict Full size table Table
    12 States ranking in the WMO-farming zones conflict Full size table As shown in
    Table 13, states S9 and S11 become the stable states under all stability definitions.
    At this stage, farmers agree to improve their irrigation systems while the WMO
    undertakes to provide favorable opportunities for investment by private entities.

    Analysis A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the robustness of the
    equilibrium states obtained in the farming zones and WMO subjective games. The
    theories defined and proved by Zhao et al. (2019) were utilized in this study.
    Figure 10 shows the unilateral moves and unilateral improvements in \\(G_{FZ}\\).
    It should be noted that the unilateral improvements have a direct relation with
    the preferences rankings: \\(S5 \\succ \\,S2 \\succ S4 \\succ S1 \\succ S3\\)
    for FZ and \\(S3 \\succ S1 \\succ S5 \\succ S4 \\succ S2\\) for WMO. The payoff
    vectors can be accordingly defined as: \\(P_{FZ} = \\left\\{ {2,\\,4,\\,1,\\,3,\\,5}
    \\right\\}\\) and \\(P_{WMO} = \\left\\{ {4,\\,1,\\,5,\\,2,\\,3} \\right\\}\\).

    of state S5 for both decision-makers in \\(G_{FZ}\\), two reachable lists, \\(R_{FZ}
    \\left( {S5} \\right) = \\emptyset\\) and \\(R_{WMO} \\left( {S5} \\right) = \\left\\{
    {S2,\\,S4} \\right\\}\\), were made which contain the unilateral moves from state
    S5 for FZ and WMO, respectively. In a similar manner, the \\(R_{FZ}^{ + } \\left(
    {S5} \\right) = \\emptyset\\) and \\(R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right) = \\emptyset\\)
    were developed which respectively represent the list of unilateral improvements
    from state S5 for FZ and WMO. As proved by Zhao et al. (2019), preference alterations
    on one side of the stable state may not change equilibrium results considering
    the four stability conditions of Nash, GMR, SEQ and SMR. Hence, despite any changes
    in states ranking in the sets (\\(S_{FZ}^{L}\\), \\(S_{FZ}^{R}\\), \\(S_{WMO}^{L}\\)
    and \\(S_{WMO}^{R}\\)) by one or both of the decision-makers, the final resolution
    will remain unchanged. The sets can be expressed as \\(E_{FZ} :\\left\\langle
    {S_{FZ}^{L} :\\emptyset ,\\,S_{FZ}^{R} :\\left\\{ {S2,\\,S4,\\,S1,S3} \\right\\}}
    \\right\\rangle\\) and \\(E_{WMO} :\\left\\langle {S_{WMO}^{L} :\\left\\{ {S3,S1}
    \\right\\},\\,S_{WMO}^{R} :\\left\\{ {S4,S2} \\right\\}} \\right\\rangle\\), in
    which \\(E_{FZ}\\) and \\(E_{WMO}\\) replicate the states that exist in \\(G_{FZ}\\)
    being ordered by preference ranking on the left and right side of the selected
    stable state. The current condition reveals that if farmers mostly prefer to follow
    the current IS, their other prioritizations won’t change the stable state. On
    the other hand, the WMO preference rankings between accepting slight modifications
    by giving subsidies or encouraging investments won’t affect the stability of S5.
    A similar condition exists in relation to the changes in the superiority of two
    optimal scenarios by the WMO. To investigate the changes in stability by preference
    alterations across state S5, the theorems defined by Zhao et al. (2019) were utilized.
    State S5 is the most preferred state in \\(P_{FZ}\\) and, as a consequence, no
    alterations is possible across this state. To assess the stability of S5 by changes
    in preferences of WMO, two other set of states were determined: (i) \\(w\\left[
    {R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right)} \\right]\\) which represents the states
    that can be used by FZ to unilaterally sanction the unilateral improvements of
    WMO from state S5 to the states exist in \\(R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right)\\),
    and (ii) \\(u\\left[ {R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right)} \\right]\\) which specifies
    the unilateral improvements of FZ being utilized to prevent the unilateral improvement
    of WMO from state S5 to the states exist in \\(R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right)\\).
    Accordingly, \\(w\\left[ {R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right)} \\right]\\) and
    \\(u\\left[ {R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right)} \\right]\\) can be defied which
    denote the number of states available in these vectors. All the possible across
    alterations were assessed as described in the following, considering the Nash,
    GMR, SMR and SEQ stability conditions: (i) State S4 substitutes state S3 in \\(P_{WMO}\\):
    Updated \\(P_{WMO} = \\left\\{ {4,\\,1,\\,2,\\,5,\\,3} \\right\\}\\,\\, \\Rightarrow\\)
    updated \\(R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right) = \\left\\{ {S4} \\right\\}\\)
    $$ \\Rightarrow \\,w\\left( {S4} \\right) = \\left\\{ {S3} \\right\\}\\,\\,and\\,u\\left(
    {S4} \\right) = \\emptyset \\, $$ (a) Nash stability: \\(J_{WMO} \\left( {S5,\\,S4}
    \\right) = 1\\,\\, \\Rightarrow\\) Nash unstable. (b) GMR stability: $$ \\left|

    If the WMO prefers to ease the investments for subtle improvements in IS with
    current irrigation system rather than adopting an optimal system, state S5 becomes
    Nash and SEQ unstable. (ii) State S2 substitutes state S3 in \\(P_{WMO}\\): Updated
    \\(P_{WMO} = \\left\\{ {4,\\,5,\\,1,\\,2,\\,3} \\right\\}\\,\\, \\Rightarrow\\)
    updated \\(R_{WMO}^{ + } \\left( {S5} \\right) = \\left\\{ {S2} \\right\\}\\)
    $$ \\Rightarrow \\,w\\left( {S2} \\right) = \\left\\{ {S1} \\right\\}\\,\\,and\\,u\\left(

    If the WMO prefers the subtle improvements in IS with the current irrigation system
    rather than adopting an optimal system, state S5 becomes Nash and SEQ unstable.

    If the WMO prefers to provide subsidies for subtle improvements in IS with the
    current irrigation system rather than adopting an optimal system, state S5 becomes
    Nash and SEQ unstable. As the last step, it is required to assess the influence
    of altering the preference of other states with the stable state S5. Zhao et al.
    (2019) stated that state S5 remains stable even if switched with less or more
    favorable states. Alternatively stated, the unstable states won’t become stable
    even if being switched with the stable state. \\(G_{WMO}\\) was also investigated
    to check the sensitivity of the stable states S3 and S6 to the changes in preferences,
    as illustrated in SI, section S.8. The results reveal that if farmers prefer the
    current irrigation system rather an optimal one, state S3 becomes Nash unstable,
    which is impossible from the WMO viewpoint. Also, state S6 becomes Nash unstable
    only if the WMO prefers the current irrigation system rather than an optimal one.
    Considering the performed sensitivity analysis, it can be concluded that the obtained
    stable states are reliable. The actual resolution of this conflict is the states
    obtained from the investigation of the first-level hypergame rather than individual
    subjective games. It should be noted that the equilibrium states of the developed
    first-level hypergame were the Cartesian product of the equilibrium states of
    individual subjective games; hence, both resulting equilibrium states of the first-level
    hypergame are reliable. 5 Conclusion This study proposes a water resources management
    (WRM) simulation–optimization model to develop an optimal irrigation scheduling
    (IS) that minimizes the relative irrigation water shortage, which is a key issue
    in arid zones with stressed and limited water resources. The developed WRM simulation–optimization
    model determined the optimal irrigation duration(s) and frequencies simultaneously
    for several agricultural zones with multi-crop and intercropping systems. The
    model was developed in MATLAB® and has several functions to compute the reference
    evapotranspiration (ET0), irrigation net depth (dnet), effective rainfall, and
    water demand for different agricultural zones using meteorological, soil, and
    crop characteristic data. Based on the results of the simulation model, the Genetic
    Algorithm (GA) optimization model yielded an optimal IS, without any limitations,
    related to the number of agricultural zones and irrigation methods. Finally, the
    strategies that can be utilized by the government to improve irrigation systems
    were examined with the help of a graph model for conflict resolution (GMCR). The
    conflict between the government and farmers was modeled as a first-level hypergame
    to achieve more reliable solutions. According to the results, farmers would be
    convinced to follow advanced irrigation systems only if the government understands
    their pessimistic attitude toward irrigation system improvements and adopts an
    efficient approach to inform and attract their attention. Only if it comes up
    the government can ensure attaining its goals by offering incentives such as providing
    subsidies or attracting investors. In this study, relative irrigation water shortage
    (RIWS) has been selected as an indicator of the developed simulation–optimization
    model efficiency and the results show that, with a 15% reduction in RIWS, the
    pressurized irrigation system has shown a significant advantage and worth the
    investments. In addition to being one of the first studies to apply a graph-based
    hypergame model for agricultural water allocation, the results may attract wide
    interest from various researchers who work on procedures to improve the management
    of agricultural water resources with minimum local conflicts. The results obtained
    by the proposed model are highly sensitive to the amounts of irrigation water
    demand and supply. Applying stochastic models, including uncertainty analysis
    (e.g., climate conditions), can improve the model''s accuracy. Moreover, the interactions
    between stakeholders can bring about decisive effects on the compatibility of
    the proposed optimal WRM strategies, which can be further investigated through
    agent-based models (ABMs) in future studies. Availability of Data and Material

    and elastic-net regressionsMicroirrigation 1. Introduction The increasing frequency
    of water scarcity periods due to climatic change has led to the use of more effective
    irrigation techniques, like microirrigation [1], whose worldwide area has increased
    by 5 Mha between 2012 and 2021 [2]. Moreover, microirrigation allows a safe use
    of reclaimed effluents or other marginal water sources, whose use help alleviating
    freshwater scarcity [3], [4], [5]. However, to ensure proper water application
    uniformity and efficiency for keeping agricultural productivity [6], a filtration
    treatment is needed due to prevent emitter clogging, which is the main constraint
    to microirrigation spreading. The most common filter types are screen, media,
    disc and cyclonic [7], but when using low-quality irrigation waters, the most
    efficient are the pressurized media filters [8], [9]. Simultaneous and different
    filtration mechanisms like hydrodynamic action, interception, straining, sedimentation,
    inertia and diffusion, can act across the whole depth of filter media allowing
    the retention of particles of different sizes and, therefore, increasing filtration
    efficiency [10]. Recent researches have been focused in improving media filter
    hydrodynamics [11], [12], [13], [14], but the impact of various designs and operation
    conditions on the quality of filtered water has been few studied [15], [16]. Precision
    irrigation models achieve high water use efficiencies by optimizing irrigation
    scheduling and selecting proper emitters and operation conditions [17], [18].
    However, the effect of microirrigation filters has not been included in these
    models yet. At this regard, the prediction of media filter performance parameters
    such as filtered volume, head loss and filtered water quality are required. The
    use of advanced techniques like neural networks [19], [20], support vector machines
    [21], gradient boosted regression trees and hybrid algorithms [22], [23], gene
    expression programming [24] and Gaussian process regression [25], [26] allowed
    reasonable prediction accuracy of pressure loss, filtered volume, and outlet dissolved
    oxygen and turbidity for media filters. However, alternative approaches with may
    yield improved prediction accuracy need to be explored. In this study, the outlet
    turbidity and filtered volume for several kinds of filters in microirrigation
    systems have been accurately foretold using a unique regressive model relied on
    the Random Forest Regression (RFR) approach [27], [28], [29]. This method, the
    RFR approximation [27], [30], [31], [32], [33] in conjunction with Differential
    Evolution (DE) [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39] for tuning the parameters of
    the main method, could be an attractive methodology to tackle this kind of high-nonlinear
    problems since, to the authors’ knowledge, it has not been covered in earlier
    research. The same experimental dataset was also adjusted for the Elastic-net,
    Lasso and Ridge regression models for comparison’s sake to foretell the outlet
    turbidity and filtered volume and contrast the outcomes obtained [29], [40], [41],
    [42], [43]. To cope with nonlinearities, including interactions between variables,
    the RFR approach is a statistical learning procedure that was developed conforming
    to statistics and mathematical analysis [44], [45]. It is a development of linear
    models that uses complex relationships and nonlinearities between the parameters
    to model them. Comparing RFR approach to traditional and metaheuristic regression
    approaches, several advantages are apparent [27], [30], [31], [32], [33], [46],
    [47]: (1) it is one of the most precise learning algorithms obtainable. Indeed,
    for a large enough dataset, it produces a very accurate regressor; (2) it can
    operate effectively on huge databases; (3) it is capable of handling hundreds
    of input variables without excluding any; (4) it provides estimates of the key
    variables in regression; and (5) it makes possible to model nonlinear interactions
    between the input operational variables of the process. Also, prior studies have
    shown that RFR is a highly useful technique for practical applications, such as
    determining the temperature of the near-surface air in glacier zones [48], the
    mechanical properties of TiAl alloys [49], erodibility of treated unsaturated
    lateritic soil [50], neighborhood environment’s impact on peer-to-peer accommodation
    [51], etc. However, it has never been previously used in microirrigation media
    filters. The organization of this paper starts with the experimental design, then
    it describes the parameters of in this work, and the DE/RFR, Elastic-net, Lasso
    and Ridge regression techniques are all presented in Section 2; by compiling the
    DE/RFR outcomes with the experimental values and the relevance order of the input
    parameters, Section 3 offers the insights gained with this reliable technique,
    and Section 4 finishes this study by presenting a summary of the investigation’s
    key findings. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Experimental setup The test were carried
    out in a filtration platform located in the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP)
    of Celrà (Girona, Spain, 42°02’25.3”N 2°52’19.8”E). Three media filters that contained
    different designs for the underdrain were tested: porous media (designed by Bové
    et al. [52]), domes (model FA-F2-188, Regaber, Parets del Vallès, Spain) and arm
    collector (model FA1M, Lama, Gelves, Spain). In Fig. 1, the experimental setup
    can be seen. The reclaimed effluent was pumped from the WWTP outlet chamber using
    a centrifugal pump (model CR-15-4, Grundfos, Bjerringbro, Denmark), which was
    governed by a frequency variator (model FRN-4, Fuji Electric, Cerdanyola del Vallès,
    Spain). The filter inlet flow was measured with an electromagnetic flowmeter (model
    Isomag MS2500, ISOIL Industria, Cinisello Balsamo, Italy). Two pressure transducers
    (model TM-01/C, STEP Logística Control, Barcelona, Spain) allowed measuring the
    pressure at the each filter inlet and outlet. Once filtered, the effluent was
    conveyed to drip irrigation laterals. Since the filtrated flow was higher than
    what was needed for the driplines, a proportional electrohydraulic actuator (model
    SKD32, Siemens, Munich, Germany) operated a three-way valve (model VXG41, Siemens,
    Munich, Germany) and the excess flow was carried to a 3 m3 water storage tank,
    which was used for filter backwashing. Chlorine was continuously injected using
    a membrane pump (model DosTec AC1/2, ITC, Santa Perpètua de la Mogoda, Spain)
    from a 0.2 m3 chlorine deposit to achieve a concentration of 2 mg/l in the effluent
    after being filtered, and 4 mg/l in the water used for backwashing the filters.
    The effluent electrical conductivity, pH and temperature were measured at the
    filter inlet using sensors (models CLS21-C1E4 A and CPS11D–7BA21, respectively,
    Endress+Hauser, Gerlingen, Germany), while turbidity and dissolved oxygen were
    determined at both the filter inlet and outlet with other specific sensors (models
    CUS31-A2E and COS 61-A1F0, Endress+Hauser, Gerlingen, Germany). Since the experimental
    facility had only one set of sensors for measuring effluent quality, each filter
    operated individually. A supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system
    previously developed [53] allowed the irrigation system operation and recorded
    data of pressure, filter inlet flow, filtration cycle duration, and quality parameters
    every minute. The SCADA system was programmed to stop irrigation when inlet turbidity
    was above 50 FTU, avoiding operation with high particle loads (see Appendix).
    The experiments were carried out using two media materials: CA-07MS silica sand
    (Silbeco Minerales, Bilbao, Spain) and NW2 crushed recycled glass (Nature Works
    Tecnologías, L Alfàs del Pi, Spain). The recycled glass has been investigated
    as a possible replacement for silica sand due to its similar physical characteristics
    [10]. The silica sand had a diameter (diameter where the sample’s 10% weight was
    finer) of 0.48 mm, a diameter (diameter where the sample’s 60% weight was finer)
    of 0.83 mm, a uniformity coefficient ( ) of 1.73, and a porosity (ratio of the
    media’s total volume occupied to the volume of voids) of 0.39. The crushed recycled
    glass had a of 0.44 mm, of 0.70 mm, and porosity of 0.54 and uniformity coefficient
    of 1.59. Download : Download high-res image (439KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Experimental filtration platform setup. Two media bed heights (20
    and 30 cm) and two different filtration velocities (30 and 60 m/h), and were tested
    during 250 h, working in two 4 h daily sessions, for each combination of media
    material and filter design. All the filters were automatically backwashed by 3
    min when the total pressure drop across them reached 50 kPa. 2.2. Variables in
    the model and materials This study’s primary objective was to evaluate the relationship
    between various experimentally measured parameters and the inputs needed by the
    DE/RFR model that could be used to calculate the filtrated volume and outlet turbidity.
    The outlet turbidity, which measures the quality of the filtered effluent and
    is directly related to the likelihood of physical clogging of emitters, serves
    as the output variable for microirrigation systems. The following are the operation
    input variables (see Table 1): • Media: each one of the two-filtering media (recycled
    glass and silica sand) described in Section 2.1. • Filter: the three types of
    filter—dome, porous and arm collector—are explained in Section 2.1. This is a
    categorical variable; • Height of the filter bed (cm): This is an operational
    variable for sand filters. For each filter, 20 cm and 30 cm of different filter
    bed heights were tested; • Filtration velocity (m/h): It affects how filters work.
    Each filter was tested at two different velocities of filtration (30 and 60 m/h),
    which fall within the typical range of velocities advised by the manufacturers;
    • Duration of filtration cycle (s): it is the time the filter is working at the
    filtration mode, which is equivalent to the time between two consecutive backwashings;
    • Electrical conductivity ( S/cm): it related to salinity, which is an indicator
    of the quality of the water and a barrier to the use of microirrigation [5]; •
    Dissolved oxygen (mg/l): It affects how well water can support life and it is
    a typical control parameter in wastewater treatment facilities; • pH: it is an
    indicator of the water alkalinity or acidity; • Water temperature (°C): at the
    filter inlet; • Input turbidity (formazin nephelometric units, FNU): it is a crucial
    sign of the quality of the water at the filter’s entry. It gauges water clarity
    and is influenced by the number of suspended solids. The operation output variables
    of this study are: Table 1. The operational variables of physical nature with

    filter outlet. It is very important to measure the potential clogging of the water
    used in the microirrigation system. 2.3. Mathematical modeling techniques 2.3.1.
    Random forest regression (RFR) A method for lowering an estimated prediction function’s
    variance is bootstrap aggregation or bagging  [27], [29], [30], [32]. In particular,
    trees and other high-variance, low-bias techniques seem to benefit from bagging.
    Several iterations of the same regression tree are fitted using bootstrap-sampled
    versions of the training data, and the outcomes are averaged. Bagging has been
    significantly modified by random forests [27], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [46],
    [47], [54], [55], which averages a sizable collection of de-correlated trees after
    aggregating them. The training phase of the random forests (RF) ensemble learning
    technique, which can be used for regression, classification, and other tasks,
    entails the construction of numerous decision trees. The average estimation of
    each individual tree is provided when focusing on the regression issue. Random
    forests perform better overall than decision trees because they compensate for
    decision trees’ propensity to overfit their training dataset. In fact, the fundamental
    concept behind the prior technique known as bagging is to lessen variance through
    the average of many noisy but roughly unbiased models. Because, when developed
    deeply enough, they have relatively little bias and can catch complicated interaction
    between the data, trees are excellent candidates for bagging. Trees gain a lot
    from the averaging because they are known to be noisy. The expectation of any
    tree is the same as the expectation of an average of B for such trees because
    each tree formed during bagging is identically distributed (i.d.). Therefore,
    the bias of the individual trees is the same as that of the bagged trees, and
    it can only get better the variation. Variance is the variance of B independent
    random variables with identical distributions (i.i.d.), each one of them has a
    variance . The average variance is [27], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [46], [47],
    [54], [55]: (1) if the variables are simply i.d. (that is, identically distributed,
    but that does not mean that they are necessarily independent) and with a positive
    pairwise correlation . Then, the advantages of averaging are constrained by the
    correlation size between bagged trees pairs since when B rises, while the first
    term stays, the second one vanishes. By lowering the correlation between the trees,
    random forests (see algorithm below) aim to enhance bagging variance reduction
    without substantially raising variance. This is achieved by randomly choosing
    the input variables during the tree-growing process. In particular, randomly select
    input variables as candidates for splitting when building a tree on a bootstrapped
    dataset. In most cases, m values are or even 1. The following is the random forest
    regression predictor after B trees have grown [27], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33],
    [46], [47], [54], [55]: (2) where describes cut points at each node, the split
    variables and terminal-node values of the bth tree of the random forest. It makes
    sense that decreasing m would decrease the correlation between any two ensemble
    trees and, as a result, the variance of the average as calculated using Eq. (1)
    also decreases. The algorithm that corresponds to the RFR is therefore shown below
    [27], [29], [30], [31], [32], [33], [46], [47], [54], [55]: Algorithm of Random
    Forest for regression (RFR) 1. For : (a) Take a bootstrap sample of size N from
    the training data. (b) Recursively repeat the next few steps for each terminal
    node in the tree until it is reached the minimal node size . Extend a random forest
    tree to the bootstrapped data after that. i. Pick m random variables between the
    p input variables. ii. Select the best point for splitting for the variables from
    the list of m variables. iii. Get two child nodes from the node. 2. Result of
    the set of trees . In the case of regression, we will utilize Eq. (2) to obtain
    a foretelling at a point x: 2.3.2. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
    (Lasso) regression (LR) and Ridge regression (RR) The third technique used in
    this paper for and Turb prediction is the Ridge regression (RR) [29], [40], [41].
    Typically, we have n samples that form the training data , each one with p features
    (or input variables) and only one output. If is the output, call , to the th sample
    covariate vector. A regression technique, least squared, is based on minimize
    a cost function or residual sum of squares (RSS) given by [29], [40], [41]: (3)
    and are the coefficients that must be calculated in order to minimize Eq. (3).
    There is a way to improve the classical linear regression, the regularized linear
    regression, by including a regularization term in Eq. (3), constituted by squares
    of the coefficients to compute (excluding the intercept). Then, we choose to minimize
    [29]: (4) here stands for the complexity parameter or regularization parameter
    (tuning parameter), that address the overfitting, keeping all the features, but
    reducing the magnitude/values of parameters . In fact, Eq. (4), known as Ridge
    regression (RR), balances two different approaches. The first tries to fit a function
    that is as closest to the data as possible and it minimizes RSS, while the term,
    , called the shrinkage penalty, aims to get small , and makes the coefficients
    as small as possible The parameter controls the importance of the two terms in
    the solution. If , the second term vanishes and, as , the shrinkage increases.
    Therefore, the final solution is dependent on this parameter and different coefficients
    , will result for different values of . The value of the intercept cannot be included
    in this shrinkage of coefficients because it is the estimated average value when
    . If we transform linearly the data with , we say that the data is scaled and
    the average value for all the independent variables is zero. The main benefit
    of using Ridge regression instead of traditional linear regression is that it
    allows for more flexible manipulation of the variance and bias of the regression
    because as decreases, the variance increases but the bias decreases. This regression
    controls the overfitting, reducing the magnitude of large coefficients but the
    interpretation of the model is not improved. Ridge regression has the obvious
    disadvantage that does not drop any predictor in the final model. Unless , the
    term in Eq. (4) will cause the coefficients to contract but not to zero. This
    model can be effective from a predictive standpoint, but it may be challenging
    to interpret in situations where there are a lot of input variables. To address
    this issue, the Lasso Regression (LR) method was developed. In effect, the loss
    function in the Lasso regression is [29], [40], [41]: (5) Ridge regression and
    Lasso regression are quite similar, as can be seen by comparing Eqs. (4), (5),
    with the exception that the second term in the Ridge regression is different (see
    Eq. (4)) and has been modified to in Lasso regression (see Eq. (5)). It could
    be said that the penalty term in Lasso regression uses while Ridge regression
    uses , because the norm of a vector is: (6) Lasso regression also causes the regression
    function’s coefficients to decrease towards zero, but when the penalty is applied,
    some of the coefficients are made to disappear. Lasso can thus perform variable
    selection by dropping variables. As a result, the model becomes simpler to understand.
    Lasso is said to produce sparse models, or models with a small number of variables.
    2.3.3. Elastic-net regression (ENR) Elastic-net regression (ENR) combines the
    two most widely used Ridge and Lasso linear regression models. Lasso uses an penalty,
    while Ridge employs an penalty. Elastic-net uses both the and the penalties, so
    there is no need to select between these two models. Combining the two penalties
    now yields the elastic-net loss function [29], [42], [43]: (7) We now employ two
    regularization parameters, one for each penalty, as opposed to regularization
    parameter . The penalty is managed by , and the penalty is managed by . Now, Elastic-net
    can be used in the same manner as Ridge or Lasso. If , then we have ridge regression.
    If , it is Lasso regression. The -ratio parameter, which establishes the proportion
    of our penalty with respect to , can also be used in place of the two parameters.
    In this case, our penalty will be multiplied by 0.5 if -ratio 0.5 and our penalty
    by . This value, -ratio 0.5, is employed here in the calculations because it is
    the most frequently used in most computational codes. Hence, the final equation
    is as follows [29], [42], [43]: (8) 2.3.4. Differential evolution (DE) optimizer
    A problem can be optimized using differential evolution (DE), a metaheuristic
    method in evolutionary computation, by repeatedly attempting to raise the quality
    of a potential solution. The optimized function does not have to be differentiable
    so that the DE optimizer can be employed for multidimensional real-valued data
    with success. Moreover, DE optimizer can also be used for problems that change
    over time, are noisy or are not continuous. By using a population of potential
    solutions, and combining existing ones using a simple formulae, DE optimizes a
    problem by keeping the a solution that is the fittest for the given problem of
    optimization [34]. The algorithm represents the optimization problem variables
    as a vector of real numbers. The population is made up of NP vectors (actual population),
    and these vectors length is the number of parameters in the optimization problem.
    If is the index of a vector within the population and the generation is , we define
    the vector as  . The components of this vector are the variables of the problem  ,
    where corresponds to the index of the variable within the individual . The variables
    are contained in intervals limited by the values  and  , respectively, at the
    minimum and maximum. The DE algorithm has four steps [34], [35], [37], [38]: •
    Initialization; • Mutation; • Recombination; and • Selection. The search starts
    after initialization. When a stopping criterion (number of generations, length
    of time, level of solution attained, etc.) is met, the mutation-recombination-selection
    steps finish. Initialization When initializing the population (first generation)
    at random, each variable’s minimum and maximum values are taken into account [37],
    [38]: (9) so that represents a random number in . Mutation Three randomly selected
    individuals, known as the target vectors , and , are used to create the NP new
    vectors that make up the mutation. The following is how the new vectors  are created
    [37], [38]: (10) with , , and , that are different. The parameter , which is in
    the interval , regulates the mutation rate. Recombination Following the creation
    of the NP new vectors, the trial vectors  are created by performing a random recombination
    and comparing the results to the initial vectors  [37], [38]: (11) The recombination
    rate is controlled by the parameter GR. The test vector will contain both the
    original vectors and the updated vectors because the comparison is done variable
    by variable. Selection In order to choose the vector of the following generation,
    which will have the best value given by the fitness function, the test vectors
    are simply compared to the original vectors [37], [38]: (12) 2.4. Goodness–of–fit
    For the building of the DE/RFR model, ten input variables were used. The dependent
    estimated variables are the filtered volume ( ) and outlet turbidity (Turb ).
    The model that approaches best the experimental data in order to predict both
    of the two operation variables from the other ten input operation parameters is
    searched. In this sense, the coefficient of determination  [56], [57] was the
    criterion taken into consideration to assess the goodness-of-fit. Each value of
    the dataset , has a corresponding value estimated by the model . The first are
    known as the observed values, whereas the second are frequently called the predicted
    values. The following sums of squares are used to measure the dataset variability
    [57], [58]: • : it is called the total sum of squares and it is proportional to
    the sample variance; • : known as the regression sum of squares, also termed the
    explained sum of squares; • : it is the residual sum of squares. Note that, is
    the average of the n data in the experimental set: (13) The coefficient of determination
    can be defined [58]: (14) If the coefficient of determination is 1.0 the fitting
    is perfect and without error. The RFR hyperparameters are [27], [29], [30], [31],
    [32], [33]: • Node size (node_size): Minimum size of terminal nodes. Smaller trees
    grow when this parameter is increased. • Number of regression trees (ntree): amount
    of trees to be grown. Model construction will cost more to compute the larger
    the tree. The 500 trees setting is the default value. • Number of permutations
    (n_perm): Number of times that the out of bag (OOB). To determine the relevance
    of each variable, data are permuted per tree. • Number of input variables per
    node (mtry): it deals with the amount of variables we should choose randomly during
    a node split. One-third of the full set of input variables, , is taken as the
    default value. To prevent overfitting, we must always make an effort to avoid
    using small values of mtry. Currently, model has been built (particularly in this
    work, the innovative DE/RFR- model) using the filtered volume ( ) and outlet turbidity
    (Turb ) as dependent variables, taking from the other ten input variables in granular
    filters [59], [60], investigating their influence to successfully improve its
    computation with the examination of the coefficient of determination . It is crucial
    to keep in mind that the RFR method heavily depends on finding the two aforementioned
    optimal hyperparameters: number of regression trees (ntree); node size (n_size);
    number of permutations (n_perm) and number of input variables per node (mtry).
    Parameter sweep or grid search, which is just an exhaustive search through a subset
    of values in the hyperparameter space, has been the common way of tuning the hyperparameters
    until now in previous investigations. The Differential Evolution (DE) method was
    applied in this study to perform a more economic search due to its effectiveness
    in resolving related optimization issues [38] here with success to find these
    optimal parameters. The DE optimizer is a technique used in evolutionary computation
    to solve optimization problems by repeatedly attempting to raise the quality of
    a candidate solution. These techniques are referred to as metaheuristics because
    they can search very large spaces of potential solutions and make little to no
    assumptions about the objective function [61], [62]. Hence, the filtered volumen
    and output turbidity (output variables) have therefore been successfully predicted
    using this novel hybrid DE/RFR–based method by evaluating the influence of 10
    operation input variables and successfully optimizing the computation using the
    coefficient of determination 2. The flowchart for the DE/RFR–relied model created
    in this study is in Fig. 2. The cross-validation methodology also utilized the
    optimum coefficient of determination ( ) [63]. The best hyperparameters for the
    DE/RFR model can be chosen using ten-fold cross-validation [28]. The dataset is
    randomly divided into ten subsets of comparable size, and then a set of parameters
    is chosen. A model is built using nine subsets and then tested with the final
    one to determine its goodness-of-fit [64]. Ten times this procedure is performed
    and a different subset is used each time as the testing set. The final value for
    the chosen set of parameters is the average of the goodness-of-fit. Download :

    operation variables were used as input variables in the newly created predictive
    model. In Table 1, they were all previously presented. We used data from 1,014
    filtration cycles. The samples with missing data have been removed from the total
    1,016 samples that were measured experimentally. To tackle this study, the dataset
    was split into two sets: a set that contains 80% of the data for training set
    and a testing set with the remainder data. With the help of the training data,
    a model was built, optimized, and then put to the test using the test data set.
    The proposed DE/RFR-based model uses the outlet turbidity and filtered volume
    as output dependent variables. As previously mentioned, the prediction made using
    the independent variables [59] was successful. The objective function value and
    choice of RFR hyperparameters (node size, number of permutations, number of regression
    trees and number of input variables per node) affect the DE/RFR technique. Table
    3 displays the RFR hyperparameters that were obtained after the RFR was tuned
    using the metaheuristic DE optimizer. For comparison purposes, the Elastic-net,
    Lasso and Ridge regression were used in this work. Their accuracy depends on the
    parameter  [29], [40], [41], [42], [43]. In this way, the optimal value of parameter
    for the Elastic-net, Lasso and Ridge regression models determined using the DE
    optimizer is indicated in Table 4. Using the testing set with the optimized model,
    the R2 value was calculated. The final DE/RFR models were built using R project
    [65] jointly with R package DEoptim (DE module) [66]. Table 3. Optimized parameters

    of the variables Additionally, as a result of these calculations, Table 7 and
    Fig. 5 display the relevance rankings for the independent variables used to predict
    the filtered volume (dependent variable) in this study. Thus, the cycle duration,
    followed by filtration velocity, is the most important factor in the RFR model’s
    filtered volume prediction, followed by water temperature, electrical conductivity,
    type of medium, pH, inlet dissolved oxygen, filter, inlet turbidity, and media
    bed height. The filtered volume was higher with longer filtration cycles and greater
    filtration velocities since more water was filtered. The filtered volume in media
    filter is a complex variable since depends on the double interactions between
    filtration velocity, filter design and media bed height [15], as well as media
    material and filter type [16]. In our case, filtration velocity and, to a lesser
    extent, media material have more relevance than filter design and media bed height.
    The filtered volumes observed using reclaimed effluents are usually highly variable
    [15] due to effluent changing composition with time. The temperature, which may
    affect biological growth, and electrical conductivity, related to dissolved solids,
    are the two effluent characteristics that have more effect on the filtered volume.
    Since both temperature and EC are easy and inexpensive to measure, our results
    suggest that both parameters should be monitored for assessing media filter performance.

    with respect to the variable with the maximum weight. Similar to this, Table 8
    and Fig. 6 illustrate the relative significance of the independent variables in
    the DE/RFR model for the prediction of outlet turbidity (Tub ). In this instance,
    the inlet turbidity (Turb ) is determined by the RFR model to be the most important
    factor in outlet turbidity prediction, followed by the electrical conductivity,
    cycle duration, water temperature, media height (height of the filter bed), dissolved
    oxygen, pH, filter, type of medium, and filtration velocity. The fact that the
    inlet turbidity appears to be the most relevant variable for explaining the outlet
    turbidity was expected since the turbidity removal achieved by media filters are
    highly dependent on turbidity inlet values [15]. During the filtration cycles,
    reduced turbidity results from the retention of particles throughout the media
    bed. Those variables that allow higher residence time of the reclaimed effluent
    in the filter contribute to improve filtered water quality [7]. This explains
    why filtration cycle duration and media bed height show relevance in explaining
    the outlet turbidity. On the other hand, reclaimed effluent have several compounds
    and organisms that interact between them with chemical reactions and biological
    processes, which affect water quality parameters. According to our results, both
    electrical conductivity and temperature play a role on turbidity, but their acting
    mechanism needs to be further explored. Table 8. Relative importance of the variables

    the most efficient solution to this regression problem, a RFR model with a DE
    optimizer is therefore required. Download : Download high-res image (667KB) Download

    variables do not add significantly to the accuracy of the model and even, from

    model ( ); and (d) RFR model ( ). On the other hand, in the estimation of the
    outlet turbidity (see Table 10), even though there is a very important variable,
    the inlet turbidity, it is not able to explain enough the outlet turbidity and
    the model improves steadily as we add the other variables from a coefficient of
    determination of 0.6902 to 0.812 for the full model. Table 9. Test set coefficient

    4. Conclusions The main conclusions of this study can be summed up as follows
    after accounting for the experimental and numerical results: • Firstly, the creation
    of alternative diagnostic techniques is crucial because currently there are not
    analytical equations that can accurately estimate the filtered volume ( ) and
    outlet turbidity (Turb ) based solely on experimental values. In this regard,
    choosing to evaluate the filtered volume ( ) and outlet turbidity (Turb ) in microirrigation
    systems with media filters using the new DE/RFR-based method is a good choice;
    • Secondly, it was confirmed that this DE/RFR model in granular filters can model
    the outlet turbidity (Turb ) and filtered volume ( ) diagnosis; • Thirdly, when
    this RFR model was used with the dataset that contains the variables outlet turbidity
    (Turb ) and the filtered volume ( ) respectively, reasonable coefficients of determination,
    0.9331 and 0.8712 are found. • Fourthly, to estimate the outlet turbidity (Turb
    ) and filtered volume ( ) in media filters, the ranking in importance of the input
    variables used in this process was established. In particular, input variable
    cycle duration (tc) may be considered as the parameter that has the greatest influence
    on the estimation of the filtered volume ( ), and after it, filtration velocity
    (v), water temperature ( ), electrical conductivity (EC ), type of medium, pH,
    dissolved oxygen (DO ), filter, inlet turbidity (Turb ), and media height (filter
    bed height) (H). Also, the variable inlet turbidity (Turb ) might have the greatest
    bearing on the estimation of the outlet turbidity (Turb ) before the electrical
    conductivity (EC ), cycle duration (tc), water temperature ( ), media height (filter
    bed height) (H), dissolved oxygen (DO ), pH, filter, type of medium and filtration
    velocity (v); • Finally, it was established how the RFR approach’s hyperparameter
    settings affected the output turbidity (Turb ) and filtered volume ( ) regression
    performances. In conclusion, this method could be successfully applied to different
    filtration mechanism involving the same or different types of filter media, but
    it must be taken into account the unique properties of the different filters and
    experiments. As a result, a good solution to the issue of determining the filtered
    volume ( ) and outlet turbidity (Turb ) in media filters widely used in microirrigation
    systems is a DE/RFR-based model. CRediT authorship contribution statement P.J.

  description: Water scarcity leads to conflicts over water allocation. Laja Lake
    in Chile is a natural lake, which was formed by a volcanic barrier. Outflow from
    the lake is created by seepage through the barrier and via a controllable artificial
    outlet, which adds reservoir characteristics to the lake. Hydroelectric power
    stations have been built at both outlets. Downstream, water is diverted into irrigation
    canals, and the Laja River forms the Laja Falls, a popular tourist attraction.
    The previous operating policy preferred the most upstream water user and was found
    to be inadequate because the lake level decreased over long term. The current
    reservoir operation policy was established through stakeholder negotiations. This
    study investigated whether optimization (using Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm
    II) can further improve the operation of Laja Lake while maintaining a fair balance
    between stakeholder groups. The results were compared with the stakeholder agreement
    and the previous policy. The main difference is in the spring, when Laja Lake
    fills up before the irrigation season starts. The optimization strategy prioritizes
    hydropower generation during this period, resulting in reduced storage. Ultimately,
    optimization proves to be a valuable tool for identifying trade-offs and exploring
    different scenarios in water management.

    allocation. Laja Lake in Chile is a natural lake, which was formed by a volcanic
    barrier. Outflow from the lake is created by seepage through the barrier and via
    a controllable artificial outlet, which adds reservoir characteristics to the
    lake. Hydroelectric power stations have been built at both outlets. Downstream,
    water is diverted into irrigation canals, and the Laja River forms the Laja Falls,
    a popular tourist attraction. The previous operating policy preferred the most
    upstream water user and was found to be inadequate because the lake level decreased
    over long term. The current reservoir operation policy was established through
    stakeholder negotiations. This study investigated whether optimization (using
    Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II) can further improve the operation
    of Laja Lake while maintaining a fair balance between stakeholder groups. The
    results were compared with the stakeholder agreement and the previous policy.
    The main difference is in the spring, when Laja Lake fills up before the irrigation
    season starts. The optimization strategy prioritizes hydropower generation during
    this period, resulting in reduced storage. Ultimately, optimization proves to
    be a valuable tool for identifying trade-offs and exploring different scenarios
    in water management. HIGHLIGHTS Listen The standard operational policy is not
    able to find long-term equitable solutions for the multi-purpose reservoir. Systems
    analytic methods can find balanced strategies for conflicting water demands. Trade-offs
    and alliances between stakeholders were identified using optimization and simulation
    followed by a ranking procedure. Different scenarios from the set of Pareto optimal
    solutions can be easily explored. hydropower, irrigation, NSGA-II, reservoir operation,
    stakeholder negotiation, water–energy–food nexus INTRODUCTION Listen Water management
    is increasingly a matter of managing conflicts over water allocation. This is
    due to overexploitation of the resource as a result of population growth, urbanization,
    and changes in the agricultural and industrial sectors (Zhang et al. 2018). Climate
    change with the intensification of hydrological extremes further exacerbates these
    problems (Ficklin et al. 2022). Conflicts over water distribution are emerging
    on both temporal and quantitative scales. According to Cai et al. (2004), there
    are distinctive characteristics of these conflicts. They are multidisciplinary
    complexity (interdependent impacts), domain-dependent knowledge (a global view
    is needed to find acceptable solutions), social value orientation (water management
    as a public issue), institutional constraints of rules and regulations, and cultural
    dimensions in which the stakeholders operate. The interaction of these characteristics
    makes it an extremely difficult task for water managers to find equitable solutions.
    When openly articulated disagreements arise between different stakeholder groups,
    they can lead either to negotiations between stakeholders, to top-down regulation
    by (local) authorities or to (armed) conflict. Broadly accepted solutions can
    be achieved through stakeholder participation and integrated water resources management.
    Both approaches have received considerable attention worldwide. The management
    of water storage, particularly the operation of multi-purpose reservoirs, is a
    potential area of conflict. Two sectors that are often in conflict are agriculture
    and hydropower. Accordingly, trade-offs between hydropower generation and the
    agricultural sector have already been studied. The water–energy–food nexus is
    one approach that addresses this relationship (Zhang et al. 2018). As shown by
    Chang & Chang (2009), Moeini & Nasiri (2021), and others, optimization can be
    used to generate equitable and sustainable solutions to multi-purpose reservoir
    operation problems. However, the technique has not been widely applied to real-time
    operations and management. According to Labadie (2004), the main reason for this
    is scepticism about the models, which may be due to the complexity of the optimization
    algorithms. In addition, the limitations of incorporating risk and uncertainty
    into the optimization, as well as the fact that many are only able to produce
    optimal results for the period of record, result in few applications. In most
    cases, it is also necessary to develop a customized programme for the given problem,
    which requires expert knowledge of optimization. This study compares the system
    performance of a combined optimization and ranking approach with those of a previous
    stakeholder negotiation and the standard operational policy (SOP, Men et al. 2019)
    as an approximation of the operation before the negotiations. The objectives of
    the study are (i) to investigate the stakeholder agreement, (ii) to perform multi-objective
    optimization of the system, and (iii) to compare the results of the agreement
    with those obtained from the optimization study. Studies have already been carried
    out on Laja Lake using a multi-scale trade-off analysis to investigate the interdependencies
    between the hydropower and agricultural sectors by Gonzalez et al. (2020). This
    study aims to further investigate the region. Here, it is possible to compare
    the results of the optimization with an agreement between the stakeholders, which
    allows us to focus on investigating the added value of the optimization strategies.
    CASE STUDY: LAJA LAKE Listen The Laja River Basin is located in south-central
    Chile (Figure 1). It is approximately 4,668 km2 in size. It is bounded by the
    Andes to the east and the Nevados de Chillán stratovolcanoes to the west. The
    Laja River Basin has a snow-dominated hydrological regime (Muñoz et al. 2019).
    Figure 1 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Map of the study are in Chile (left) and the
    Laja River Basin (right). The river flows from east to west. Its source is Laja
    Lake, which is formed by a natural volcanic barrier. Seepage through this barrier
    is possible and leads to the Hydroelectric Plant (HP) Abanico. An artificial tunnel
    also connects the lake to HP El Toro. The flow through the tunnel can be controlled,
    while the seepage depends on the level of the lake. One of the peculiarities of
    the Lake Laja system is that the two HPs are interdependent, although there is
    no direct hydrological connection. The more water HP El Toro extracts from the
    lake, the less water seeps through the barrier and reaches HP Abanico, and vice
    versa. The water from the two HPs later forms the Laja River, which crosses the
    valley before reaching the BíoBío River. Downstream from Laja Lake, four other
    HPs operate and water is diverted for irrigation of agricultural land, as shown
    in Figure 1. At the confluence of the Laja and BíoBío Rivers are the Laja Falls,
    a major tourist attraction in Chile. An overview of the area is shown in Figure
    1. Climate and data Listen Rainfall in the area is mainly frontal, resulting in
    an average annual precipitation of between 1,100 mm at the basin outlet and 2,300
    mm at the headwaters. During the winter months (June to August), snowfall is concentrated,
    accounting for about 47% of the annual precipitation (Muñoz et al. 2019). Filling
    of Laja Lake occurs in the spring (September to November) when the snow melts.
    The inflow data into the lake are taken from the government website (Coordinador
    Eléctrico Nacional 2022). Water allocation in Chile is based on a private market
    for tradable water rights. Non-consumptive users must obtain water rights (e.g.,
    HPs). The amount of water that can be used by a sector may not correspond to the
    actual water demand. However, since it is in the interest of the operators to
    make the best use of their acquired water rights, the measured flow data in the
    diversion canals are used as demand data in this study. In the present work, the
    five main irrigation canals in the basin are considered. They are (from east to
    west): Collao, Zañatru, Mirrihue, Laja, and Laja-Diguillín, as shown in Figure
    1. The streamflow data of the canals used in this study were retrieved from the
    governmental website of the General Directorate of Water (Dirección General de
    Aguas 2023). The canals are operated by an irrigation canal association that represents
    the farmers who have water rights on the canal. Since the agricultural sector
    is considered as a single water user in the study, the values for each canal are
    combined to calculate the demand. The study extends over a period of 5 years from
    2016 to 2020, where comparable data for all system elements are available and
    the new agreement had been implemented. The study period took place during a drought
    period in Chile (see Section 2.2). The agreement on the operation of Laja Lake
    Listen The operation of the lake is crucial for various sectors in the area, as
    it mainly controls the water available in the basin. This, in turn, leads to conflicts
    between different stakeholders over the allocation of water and the operation
    of Laja Lake. Furthermore, starting in 2010, Chile experienced a series of water
    shortages, also known as the mega-drought (Garreaud et al. 2019). When the drought
    hit the region, the lake was already vulnerable due to overuse in previous years,
    leading to severe water shortages downstream. Eventually, the Laja Falls, a national
    tourist attraction, dried up. The sight of the dry Laja Falls raised public awareness
    of water management issues, and increasing public pressure forced a change in
    the lake''s management. One point of conflict was that the lake management only
    considered stakeholders with water rights, creating a power imbalance between
    water users with and without water rights. In the negotiations that followed,
    an unprecedented step was taken: the tourism sector without water rights was included
    in the negotiations. Representatives of national and local governments also sat
    on the committee that negotiated the new operating rules. From touristic motivation,
    an ‘environmental flow’ was considered important. Transparency was critical to
    building trust. To support this, the Ministry of Public Works now distributes
    monthly streamflow and lake-level data to all stakeholders. In addition, water
    rights and other hydrological data are made available online. This way, everyone
    can monitor whether the agreement is being honoured. After 3 years of negotiations,
    a new agreement for the regulation of Laja Lake, called the New Laja Lake Irrigation
    Agreement (Ministerio de Obras Públicas 2018), was implemented in 2017 (Arumí
    et al. 2024). It grants the water use of the lake for the following year according
    to its level at the end of the filling season on December 1. In this agreement,
    the reservoir is divided into four volume segments. Each segment allows each party
    to release a certain amount of water, while leaving some in the lake as a reserve.
    Irrigation water can be used from December to April according to seasonal needs,
    while water for hydroelectric power generation can be released throughout the
    year. From now on, the reservoir operation policy used to manage Laja Lake will
    be referred to as the ‘Real Policy’ in this study. METHODS Scenarios of reservoir
    operation Listen The agreement was initially negotiated among stakeholders without
    the use of quantitative tools. In this study, the resulting operating policy is
    implemented as ‘Real Policy’ scenario. The SOP is used as a reference scenario
    to mimic the policy prior to the negotiations. The SOP is to always release as
    much water as possible to meet demand. Since the tunnel of HP El Toro is the only
    controllable outlet of the lake, the SOP only solves a single-objective problem.
    No water is stored for future shortages. The advantage is usually good demand
    coverage, here for HP El Toro, at the cost of high and long-term water shortages.
    Based on these two scenarios, the improvement in system performance due to the
    negotiation of the new agreement can be shown. Simulation and optimization are
    then used to investigate further improvements in reservoir control under multiple
    objectives with different weighting schemes, as might be expressed during stakeholder
    negotiations. The model combines complex mathematical multi-objective optimization
    with a transparent, easy-to-understand ranking method. Hydrological simulation
    model Listen The simulation model is a lumped model, which is based on the mass
    balance of the available water in the river basin. It runs on monthly time steps
    during the study period. The mass balance is given in Equation (1). (1) where
    is the storage at the next time step and is the current storage. is the net inflow
    to Laja Lake. There are no direct measurements of hydrological inflow, precipitation,
    and evaporation. is calculated as the remaining element of the water balance,
    implicitly including all other hydrologic fluxes. The reservoir has two outflows:
    is the release through the tunnel to be optimized and is the outflow from the
    lake via seepage. When the reservoir exceeds its maximum capacity, water is released
    as spill ⁠. The storage volume S of Laja Lake is constrained by its dead storage
    and its maximum storage capacity (in million cubic meters (MCM)) as shown in the
    following Equation (2). At the beginning, is set to the value of the 2015-12-31:
    ⁠. (2) The seepage from Laja Lake is defined by Equation (3), also called the
    ‘Laja Lake Seepage Law’ (Ministerio de Obras Públicas 2007), where is the water
    level of Laja Lake in m.a.s.l. The calculation of in Equation (4) is defined according
    to the volume-elevation curve of Laja Lake. (3) (4) Optimization model NSGA-II
    model Listen In the present study, a lumped simulation model is optimized using
    the Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II). This algorithm was first
    developed by Deb et al. (2002). In each iteration, a population is composed of
    multiple chromosomes, which, in turn, are composed of genes. The method provides
    four basic operators: generating an initial gene pool, calculating the fitness
    of each chromosome, selecting chromosomes, and performing crossover and mutation
    (Tayfur 2017). The main features of NSGA-II are the elicitation principle, the
    diversity maintenance mechanisms, and the emphasis on non-dominated solutions.
    This algorithm was chosen because it is a well-tested optimization algorithm.
    For example, it was successfully used by Yang et al. (2016) to generate adaptive
    multi-objective reservoir rules under changing climate. Three objective functions
    are formulated as minimization problems for the study. The two HPs, El Toro and
    Abanico, have an independent objective function and to emphasize their conflicting
    nature. The installed HP capacity (⁠⁠) should be guaranteed at each time step
    t as can be seen in Equations (5) and (6), where is the produced hydropower in
    MW at time step t for the considered hydropower plant. (5) (6) The produced hydropower
    mainly depends on the potential energy height h, the efficiency of the installed
    turbines ⁠, and the water flowing through the turbines ⁠. The relationship can
    be seen in Equations (7) and (8). Here, is the density of water (⁠⁠) and g is
    the gravitational acceleration (⁠⁠). The two hydroelectric stations have fixed
    heads (⁠ for HP El Toro and for HP Abanico). (7) (8) The water demand for all
    irrigation canals is aggregated and put into an objective function ⁠, where the
    available water for irrigation is calculated over the demand of the agricultural
    sector, as shown in Equation (9). (9) considers the water available for the agricultural
    sector in the basin at time step t. Therefore, consists of the outflow and the
    seepage flow as well as water coming from other tributaries (Polcura and Rucue
    rivers). The environmental flow condition is substracted for each time step t
    because it has a single demand profile and should always be considered. It comes
    from the tourism sector, which requires a minimum flow of to maintain the Laja
    Falls. represents the agricultural demand and is the maximum water demand of the
    agricultural sector during the study period (⁠⁠). When the environmental flow
    condition is not met, a penalty value is added to the objective function value
    f for each objective i for time step t. The penalty value depends on the amount
    of water overuse. In Equation (10), is the discharge of the Laja River at the
    outlet of the study area. (10) TOPSIS ranking Listen The result of the optimization
    is a set of Pareto optimal solutions. Further processing is required to find the
    preferred solution. In this study, this is done using the technique of preference
    order by similarity to ideal solution (Technique Of Preference order by Similarity
    to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Hwang & Yoon 1981). TOPSIS was chosen because it is
    a fast and easy-to-use decision-making tool for solving multi-criteria problems.
    To find the preferred solution, all solutions are ranked according to their closeness
    to the ideal solution and simultaneously their distance from the anti-ideal solution.
    In this study, the ideal solution is the minimum value of the objective function
    and the anti-ideal is the maximum value. Different ranking schemes are used to
    explore the different scenarios. For this, the weight vector w is used. The components
    of the weight vector are: (1) the agricultural sector, (2) HP Abanico, and (3)
    HP El Toro. Two scenarios are chosen: in the first scenario, a weight of 50% is
    assigned to the two HPs together and 50% to the agricultural sector (w = (0.5,
    0.25, 0.25)). In the second scenario, HP El Toro is given more influence, and
    HP Abanico and the agricultural sector are weighted the same (w = (0.15, 0.15,
    0.7)). Evaluation indices Listen For the qualitative analysis of the system performance,
    three indices are chosen according to Hashimoto et al. (1982). They focus on the
    reliability, resilience, and vulnerability of the system. Reliability: (11) The
    reliability refers to the volumetric reliability of the system in meeting the
    demand with the available water for user i at time step t in the study period
    T. Resilience: (12) The resilience index represents the number of failure periods
    which are followed by a non-failure period over the number of failure periods
    Vulnerability: (13) The vulnerability of the system is assessed by the index ⁠,
    which calculates the maximum shortage during the th failure period over the number
    of failure series with a subsequent successful period ⁠. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
    Listen The SOP releases the most water of all the strategies, starting with the
    filling of Laja Lake in the spring (September to November, Figure 2). This empties
    the reservoir and results in long periods where no releases are possible. The
    downstream users, here, in particular, HP Abanico and agriculture, only receive
    flow from the seepage and the downstream part of the catchment. Figure 2 VIEW
    LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Release curves of El Toro for different weighing scenarios
    compared to the SOP strategy and real policy. In general, Figure 2 shows that
    for all scenarios, most water is released during the summer months (December to
    February) to meet agricultural water demand and the minimum flow condition (Laja
    Falls). HPs can also use that released water for energy production, since their
    water use is not consumptive. However, the biggest difference between the optimized
    results and the Real Policy is in the spring. Since more water is available then,
    the optimization already releases water for the hydropower plants to meet their
    demand. This, in turn, means that less water is left for the summer months. If
    more weight is given to HP El Toro (w = (0.15, 0.15, 0.7)), even more water is
    released in the spring. For HP Abanico, it is better to store water in Laja Lake,
    which raises the level of the lake and eventually leads to more seepage. The Real
    Policy does not allow large amounts of water to be released in the spring, leaving
    more water in the reservoir. Looking at the storage volume of Laja Lake in Figure
    3, the SOP results in the lowest storage volume compared to the other scenarios.
    The optimized scenario where the agricultural sector is weighted with 50% (w =
    (0.5, 0.25, 0.25)) has the second highest storage and the scenario with the weighting
    w = (0.15, 0.15, 0.7) has the second lowest storage of the four scenarios. This
    confirms the conclusions from the release curves that a higher weighting of HP
    Abanico leads to more storage in the long term. However, the restrictions of the
    Real Policy on the amount and timing of release maximize storage. Nevertheless,
    full storage comes at the cost of less reliability of HP El Toro. These results
    are consistent with other studies on the New Laja Lake Irrigation Agreement (Real
    Policy), such as Matus et al. (2019) and Muñoz et al. (2019). Since the inflow
    is very low in the year 2016, as shown in Figure 3, all four scenarios produce
    very low storage until the late 2017 filling season with high inflow rates. Figure
    3 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Storage volume of Laja Lake according to different
    scenarios. It may be beneficial in future work to include a storage-related objective
    function to optimize reservoir filling. This would align the storage results of
    the optimization with those of the actual policy. Since seepage depends on the
    lake level, the curves shown in Figure 4 look very similar to the storage curves
    in Figure 3. The SOP strategy always releases water during the filling season
    of Laja Lake, which is too early for the agricultural sector, as shown in Figure
    4. The scenario with more emphasis on the agricultural demand w = (0.5, 0.25,
    0.25) is better in satisfying the demand in terms of time and quantity, compared
    to the other weighting scenario and the SOP. Figure 4 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE
    Seepage (left) and available water for the agricultural sector (right) according
    to different scenarios. Figure 5 shows the hydroelectric power generated by the
    two HPs studied according to the different operating strategies. As indicated
    before, the Real Policy, leaving more water in the lake, can generate more power
    at HP Abanico and less at HP El Toro. Especially in the winter months, when there
    is no release through the tunnel, there is no power generation at HP El Toro with
    the stakeholder agreement in place. It is the other way around when looking at
    the SOP, and the optimization results are somewhere in between. Figure 5 VIEW
    LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Generated power for the hydroelectric stations Abanico (left)
    and El Toro (right) according to different scenarios. Installed capacity at the
    HP Abanico 136 MW and at the HP El Toro 450 MW. The Real Policy provides a clear
    benefit to the reliability of HP Abanico (Figure 6). In contrast to these results,
    the consequences of implementing the SOP strategy for HP Abanico are that reliability
    and resilience are the lowest of all the scenarios, and vulnerability is very
    high. Even though the SOP produces good results for HP El Toro, the other strategies
    tend to perform better for the agricultural sector. This is probably the result
    of the high release rates in the spring with the SOP, leaving less water for the
    summer months, when the agricultural sector actually needs it. This proves that
    the SOP strategy is not suitable for finding equitable operating rule curves for
    the reservoir studied. Figure 6 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Performance evaluation
    for different stakeholders and operating scenarios. Besides the good results for
    HP Abanico, the Real Policy produces good results for the reliability but not
    the vulnerability and resilience of the agricultural sector. For the other indices
    and stakeholders, the optimization results outperform the other policies. Nevertheless,
    HP El Toro is by far the most vulnerable in all the scenarios except SOP. This
    is due to the very high installed capacity of 400 MW, which is not met in most
    time steps. This applies especially to the Real Policy. It performs better in
    the optimization scenario where more weight is put on it (w = (0.15, 0.15, 0.7)).
    The local characteristics of Laja Lake and its stakeholders, the national water
    law in Chile, and the stakeholder negotiation that took place are very specific
    and site-related frameworks for this case study. Nevertheless, the results show
    a clear added value when comparing the results of optimization with those of stakeholder
    negotiation. Optimization can clearly identify conflicts within a stakeholder
    group and reveal new alliances between stakeholders. Finding points of common
    interest can help in negotiations to understand each other better and to foster
    good and trusting relationships in the long term. However, the results show that
    the exploration of the set of Pareto optimal solutions can lead to very different
    results. Deciding on one best solution is therefore a rather difficult task. Accordingly,
    the optimization and its results should be used to inform or guide, not to replace,
    negotiations. CONCLUSION Listen This study was conducted to investigate whether
    optimization strategies can help to find fair and feasible solutions for reservoir
    operation under conflicting water demands. A combined approach was used to generate
    operational rules for Laja Lake in Chile. The results showed that finding equitable
    operating rule curves for multi-purpose reservoirs remains a challenging task
    for water managers. The SOP cannot fulfil it. On the other hand, the stakeholder
    negotiations have led to a good agreement. It helps to fill the Laja Lake reservoir
    and at the same time provides sufficient water for the agricultural sector. The
    high level of the lake, in turn, leads to good results for HP Abanico. Optimization
    has produced even better results in terms of system resilience and the reliability
    of HP El Toro. At the same time, the performance evaluation indices for the other
    objectives studied are close to those of the Real Policy. A higher reliability
    of HP El Toro comes at the cost of a lower lake level. Finally, the release policy
    resulting from the optimization is not yet a general solution, since only 5 years
    of data were available for the study. In addition to water allocation, another
    important factor in the negotiations was transparency through data sharing. Ultimately,
    this also led to increased trust between the stakeholders. The optimization strategy
    presented here can support transparency already during the negotiation process.
    It can be used to show and explore different scenarios, highlighting the advantages
    and disadvantages for one group or the other. The process can be improved by adding
    new users and objectives, such as lake replenishment. Given the changing climate,
    it appears that adaptive management rules for Laja Lake seem inevitable. The last
    negotiation process took 3 years. To speed up future negotiations, it is recommended
    to use an optimization-simulation model, as presented in this study. A more complex
    hydrological model is required for applying the tool for future periods with simulated
    hydro-meteorological inputs. Examining different scenarios from the Pareto optimal
    front also increases transparency, as it allows the immediate exploration of the
    advantages and disadvantages of different strategies for all parties involved.

  description: There is a mismatch between crop water demand, the spatial and temporal
    distribution of natural rainfall, surface water sources, and arable land resources
    in the North China Plain. This has been compensated for by massive groundwater
    exploitation, and as a result, ground water levels have continuously declined
    and groundwater landing funnels have formed in some areas. Consequently, there
    is an urgent need for the rational allocation of soil and water resources. In
    this study, regional soil types and the corresponding crops in Guangping County,
    Hebei Province, China, alongside the regional annual average total water consumption
    were used to determine reasonable allocations for crop planting structures, with
    an aim of maximizing the water utilization efficiency and economic benefits while

    data from 1973 to 2021, including precipitation, temperature, sunshine hours,
    wind speed, and humidity, as well as crop data, including irrigation systems and
    crop growth status, were collected. Water consumption models for eight soil types
    and seven typical crops forming 56 calculation partitions were established to
    obtain annual average water consumption values for the different crops. The maximum
    economic benefit and water-use efficiency were then used as the objective functions
    and total water consumption as the control condition for the non-dominated sorted
    genetic algorithm-Ⅱ (NSGA-II), to optimize the allocation of soil and water resources
    in the region; the adjusted quantities for the different crops cultivated under
    different soil types in the study area were obtained. The areas growing sweet
    potato and vegetable-fruits were found to increase by 0.5255 km2 and 4.4452 km2,
    respectively, when compared to the pre-optimization period, whereas the areas
    with winter wheat-summer maize, millet, peanut, cotton, and summer maize decreased

    The economic benefit increased from 810.37 to 853.64 million yuan, while the water-use
    efficiency increased from 1.5426 kg/m3 to 1.5859 kg/m3. The results provide a
    basis for soil and water resource management in the region and a technical reference
    for similar areas to improve agricultural water-use efficiency and economic benefits.

    There is a mismatch between crop water demand, the spatial and temporal distribution
    of natural rainfall, surface water sources, and arable land resources in the North
    China Plain. This has been compensated for by massive groundwater exploitation,
    and as a result, ground water levels have continuously declined and groundwater
    landing funnels have formed in some areas. Consequently, there is an urgent need
    for the rational allocation of soil and water resources. In this study, regional
    soil types and the corresponding crops in Guangping County, Hebei Province, China,
    alongside the regional annual average total water consumption were used to determine
    reasonable allocations for crop planting structures, with an aim of maximizing
    the water utilization efficiency and economic benefits while also achieving a
    regional groundwater dynamic equilibrium. Daily meteorological data from 1973
    to 2021, including precipitation, temperature, sunshine hours, wind speed, and
    humidity, as well as crop data, including irrigation systems and crop growth status,
    were collected. Water consumption models for eight soil types and seven typical
    crops forming 56 calculation partitions were established to obtain annual average
    water consumption values for the different crops. The maximum economic benefit
    and water-use efficiency were then used as the objective functions and total water
    consumption as the control condition for the non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm-Ⅱ
    (NSGA-II), to optimize the allocation of soil and water resources in the region;
    the adjusted quantities for the different crops cultivated under different soil
    types in the study area were obtained. The areas growing sweet potato and vegetable-fruits
    were found to increase by 0.5255 km2 and 4.4452 km2, respectively, when compared
    to the pre-optimization period, whereas the areas with winter wheat-summer maize,
    millet, peanut, cotton, and summer maize decreased by 1.3481 km2, 0.1812 km2,
    0.7316 km2, 2.0896 km2, and 0.62 km2, respectively. The economic benefit increased
    from 810.37 to 853.64 million yuan, while the water-use efficiency increased from
    1.5426 kg/m3 to 1.5859 kg/m3. The results provide a basis for soil and water resource
    management in the region and a technical reference for similar areas to improve

    consumptionWater-use efficiencyCrop planting structures 1. Introduction The optimal
    allocation of soil and water resources refers to the joint and sustainable management
    of water and agricultural land, using both scientific and technical means to alleviate
    water resource shortages and the deterioration of the ecological environment (Tan
    et al., 2017). Traditional research into the optimal allocation of agricultural
    soil and water resources is divided into two categories: the improvement of agricultural
    water-use efficiency and the adjustment of agricultural planting structures. Of
    these, the former is considered from the perspective of water use, and while it
    helps to reduce the excessive use of agricultural water sources, it requires a
    large financial input to build supporting facilities, as otherwise, crops are
    not adequately irrigated (Li et al., 2020a, Li et al., 2020b, Seyed Hoshiyar et
    al., 2021, Shangguan et al., 2002, Sharifi et al., 2021, Tork et al., 2021). In
    contrast, the latter is generally from the perspective of the planting layout,
    as the planting of crops considered to be water-saving can help to achieve water
    saving aims, but most of these studies have focused on the total amount of various
    types of crops, without consideration of other factors such as the soil (Chen
    and Liu, 2022, Li et al., 2020a, Li et al., 2020b, Luo et al., 2022, Sedighkia
    et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2021). The above results only have achieved certain results
    in the single allocation of water resources or land resources. However, soil and
    water resources were interrelated and mutually restricted (Li et al., 2022a, Li
    et al., 2022b). Changing one factor will lead to changes in other factors, and
    they cannot be simply optimized according to their order. To reflect the holistic
    nature of soil and water resource allocation, many scholars proposed a joint allocation
    method and optimized the allocation schemes in their corresponding study areas
    (Chen et al., 2023, Guo et al., 2022, Wang et al., 2023, Wang et al., 2022a, Wang
    et al., 2022b). Based on joint allocation, Li (2022), Zhang (2019), and Zhang
    et al., (2023) added a simulation study of future scenarios and proposed corresponding
    allocation schemes. In some regions, owing to insufficient precipitation, groundwater
    extraction is required to meet the actual regional irrigation demands. For example,
    Yue et al. (2011) optimized the allocation of Yellow River water and groundwater
    in 2020 and 2030 by coupling groundwater and surface water models, while Fu et
    al. (2014) used interval two stage stochastic planning to establish a joint surface
    water and groundwater dispatch model that realistically reflects the actual optimal
    allocation of water resources. The above research can provide decision-making
    guidance for soil and water resource management to a certain extent, but it does
    not consider the coupling degree and water consumption characteristics between
    the soils and crops. In terms of research scope, most studies have focused on
    medium and macro areas, such as watersheds (Banadkooki et al., 2022, Han et al.,
    2018a, Han et al., 2018b, Sun et al., 2019, Tingsanchali and Singh, 1996) and
    irrigation districts (Das et al., 2015, Martínez-Tunarroza et al., 2022, Sun et
    al., 2017). However, there is also research at the micro-scale (Tian and Jia,
    2007), albeit with lower precision. In addition, 3S technologies have also been
    utilized in water and land resource allocation research, and this has significantly
    enhanced the visualization and information processing abilities available for
    optimal water resource allocation. For example, Khanday and Javed (2016) used
    remote sensing to successfully prioritize river sub-basins in central India, and
    Lense et al. (2023) used a model combining GIS and RS to identify the most serious
    erosion phenomena in Brazilian crop areas. Although these studies have achieved
    results, the accuracy of the remote sensing images was 1000 m and 250 m, which
    was too rough for the study of water and soil resource allocation at the county
    scale, and thus higher precision remote sensing images are required to facilitate
    the needs of this research. For model creation, multi-objective programming has
    been widely used in the study of water and soil resource allocation. Li et al.
    (2022) constructed a multi-objective planting structure optimization model with
    the objectives of economic, ecological, and water-saving benefits, while Wu et
    al. (2022), under the framework of society, economy, and ecology, established
    multi-objective nonlinear planning to study the planting structure and irrigation
    water allocation scheme. Chang et al. (2023) constructed a multi-objective water
    resource optimal allocation model with social and economic benefits, while Habibi
    Davijani et al. (2016) applied a particle swarm algorithm to allocate water resources
    in Iranian regions, and Liu et al. (2017) optimized the allocation of soil and
    water resources in Jilin Province directly using multi-objective planning. As
    research progresses, scholars have found some data to be uncertain, such as incoming
    water and precipitation, in the optimal allocation of multi-objective soil and
    water resources, and these uncertainties greatly affect the actual crop water
    consumption (ETa) To attenuate for the error caused by these uncertainties, the
    potential water consumption (ET0) has been introduced for unification. For example,
    Kong (2022) calculated the daily ET0 from 1990 to 2019 and adjusted the cropping
    structure based on the reference evapotranspiration, while Han et al. (2018) optimized
    the cropping structure in the Heihe River Basin using remotely sensed evapotranspiration
    data and then analyzed the impacts of the results on water-use efficiency. Owing
    to the complexity of the environment, the ET0 and ETa were found to have considerable
    differences in different regions. Yang (2016) stated that in arid and semiarid
    overland areas, the potential evaporation and actual evaporation satisfy a symmetrical
    and complementary relationship, and the value of the ETa/ETp ranges from 0.16
    to 0.30. While several studies have investigated the optimal allocation of soil
    and water resources based on potential evapotranspiration, the optimal allocation
    of soil and water resources based on actual farmland water consumption averaged
    over many years has rarely been reported. In terms of water constraints, the optimal
    allocation of agricultural water and soil resources was mostly studied with the
    total amount of irrigation water as the control target. Lv (2022), based on the
    minimum water consumption of crops, predicted the water demand of agricultural
    cultivation and established a model for the adjustment of the agricultural cultivation
    structure. While Li (2022) used Penman’s formula to predict crop water demand
    and analyzed the contradiction between the supply and demand of irrigation water
    resources to optimize the planting structure. Taking the total amount of irrigation
    water in Beijing as a constraint, Zeng (2018) applied the multi-objective planning
    method to propose a direction for optimizing the structure of Beijing’s plantation
    industry. Furthermore, Yang et al. (2019), Zhang et al. (2023) also optimized
    planting structures by targeting the total amount of irrigation. With the expansion
    of the irrigation area and improvement of the irrigation water use efficiency,
    the groundwater overexploitation situation has not yet been significantly improved.
    It was recognized that water saving in the traditional sense cannot reflect the
    actual amount of water resources saved. To explore the actual saving situation,
    Pei et al. (2007) suggested the phrase “water consumption and water saving” and
    compared it with “water intake and water saving.” The water consumption and water
    saving potential of Ningxia was found to be far less than that of the water intake
    and water saving potential. Qin et al. (2008) then systematically studied the
    basic theory and quantitative calculation method for the regional target ET, and
    proposed that the total water consumption refers to the maximum allowable consumption
    of regional water resources for sustainable utilization, and constructed a set
    of regional target ET calculation methods. Liu (2014) put forward a technical
    framework for controlling real water saving in the region by the total amount
    of regional water consumption (i.e., regional target ET), and extended the water
    saving focus on water intake to the water saving of real water consumption. The
    above studies found that only by reducing invalid water consumption can real water
    savings be realized, and the method of controlling the invalid water consumption
    was called agricultural ET management. However, few optimization models consider
    the joint allocation of soil and water resources and the agricultural target ET.
    Guangping County of Hebei Province is predominantly an agricultural planting area.
    Their over-exploitation of the available groundwater resources has enabled high
    and stable agricultural yields, but has also caused continuous declines in the
    groundwater level, and this represents the main water resource problem faced by
    the entire North China Plain area. On December 24, 2021, the Water Saving Regulations
    of Hebei Province (2021) was promulgated, and it clearly states that ''agricultural
    water saving should improve irrigation efficiency by adjusting the structure of
    soil and water resources''. This study was centered in Guangping County and uses
    3S technology to assess the adaptability of soil and crops and coordinate the
    allocation of their annual average ETa. The NSGA-II genetic algorithm was used
    as the core mothod, with water use efficiency and economic benefits as the objective
    functions, and the agricultural target ET as the boundary conditions to construct
    a multi-objective optimization model for agricultural soil and water resources,
    to provide an effective decision support for agricultural development and water-saving
    irrigation. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Study area The study area was Guangping
    County, Handan, China, which is situated in the south of Hebei Province, between
    longitude 114°84′ and 115°19′ east and latitude 36°37′ and 36°62′ north, the area
    is 31.4 km long, 27.0 km wide, and 320 km2 (Fig. 1). The average annual precipitation
    is 514.9 mm, and the average annual water surface evaporation is 1038.6 mm. The
    terrain of the county is relatively gentle, with a gradual decrease from southwest
    to northeast. The altitude ranges from 40.0 to 53.9 m, with a maximum height difference
    of 13.9 m. The area is mainly used to grow food crops (predominantly winter wheat
    and summer maize), cash crops (predominantly cotton and vegetables), oil crops
    (predominantly peanuts and rapeseed), and small miscellaneous grains (predominantly
    millet, soybeans, and mung beans). The summer harvest consists mainly of winter
    wheat, and the remaining grains are harvested in the autumn. Download : Download

    Soil Database (HWSD) soil data, meteorological data (precipitation, temperature,
    sunshine hours, wind speed, and humidity), land use data, sentinel-2 remote sensing
    image data, and field experiment data (Wang et al., 2022a, Wang et al., 2022b),
    water resources data and water using data, etc. Field experiment data were collected
    at 12 monitoring points, including soil moisture content, leaf area index (LAI),
    crop height (CH) and root depth (RD). CH and RD were measured with a tape measure;
    LAI was measured by ACCUPAR-LP80 canopy leaf area analyzer. Soil water content
    was measured by soil moisture monitor. It was measured every 5–7 days from the
    beginning of crop emergence, and was measured again after 10 h of precipitation
    and 24 h of irrigation, until the crop was harvested. The measurement depth is
    0–10 cm, 10–30 cm, 30–60 cm, 60–200 cm, half for calibration, and the other half
    for verification. In this paper, the spatial resolution of all raster data was
    resampled to 10 m × 10 m for subsequent research. Details of the data are shown
    in Table 1, the soil mechanical composition is shown in Table 2, and the crop
    growth data are shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3. Table 1. Data content and sources used

    point collection Field sample point collection was carried out from August 1,
    2021 to August 15, 2021. The survey was conducted using sub-meter-level ICE980
    RTK handheld GPS. The instrument measurement coordinates were defined as the WGS-84
    coordinate system, and the measured values were geographical coordinates. When
    collecting sample points, it was necessary to ask local farmers about the planting
    of winter wheat in the first half of 2021. The distribution of field sample points
    is shown in Fig. 4. Download : Download high-res image (393KB) Download : Download

    2.4. Methods 2.4.1. Extraction of the crop planting structure In this study, seven
    typical crops were selected for planting structure identification: winter wheat-summer
    maize, summer maize, cotton, sweet potatoes, millet, peanuts, and vegetable-fruits.
    As a result of the short growth cycle of vegetable-fruits, the variety of planted
    species, and the serious fragmentation of the planted area, the extraction of
    sample points was inconvenient. This study thus provides a unified generalization
    of the vegetable-fruits, and the remaining six crops were extracted using the
    random forest algorithm. When using this algorithm to extract data, the 32 remote
    sensing images were pre-processed, and their Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) was calculated (Sun et al., 2021). The formula used was as follows:
    (1) where represents the reflectance in the near-infrared band, and represents
    the reflectance in the red band. The NDVI of general crops ranges from 0 to 1,
    and the magnitude of this value is related to the degree of lush crop growth,
    i.e., the closer the value is to 1, the more luxuriant the crop growth. According
    to the phenological characteristics for the crops in Guangping, six NDVI images
    from February 1, April 17, June 6, July 31, September 29, and December 18 were
    selected as representatives to analyze phenological characteristic consistency.
    In the experimental area of Guangping County, 20 artificial sample points were
    then selected for each crop. The NDVI values of the artificial sample points for
    each crop were fitted with Lorenz curves, which were divided into six types as
    follows: winter wheat-summer maize, summer maize, cotton, sweet potatoes, millets,
    and peanuts. As the random forests require a higher number of sample points, the
    artificial samples were expanded according to the fitted curve and 70 % were used
    for classification and 30 % for verification. The sample points were input into
    the random forest for classification, and the accuracy was then assessed using
    the confusion matrix. We set 90 % accuracy as a required criterion. If the simulation
    results failed to satisfy the accuracy requirement, they were expanded by adding
    500 sample points each time until the accuracy reached the required level. The
    formulas used were as follows: (2) (3) (4) where K is the number of trees in the
    random forest, x is the category is the weight of the crop type, is the overall
    classification accuracy is the total number of correctly classified image elements
    in n classes of features, is the number of true sample image elements in n classes
    of features is the number of image elements in the sample classified as n classes
    of features, n is the total number of categories in the classification results,
    and N is the number of image elements in the sample. The Kappa coefficient ranged
    from 0 to 1, with <0.6 indicating a poor classification effect, 0.6–0.8 indicating
    a good level of accuracy, and >0.8, indicating a high degree of consistency between
    the classification results and the real features. 2.4.2. Regional water consumption
    For regional water consumption calculations, the region was first divided into
    several sub-regions (referred to as calculation zones) according to factors, including
    those for the soil and crops. The attributes of each point in the sub-region were
    the same, and water consumption for each sub-region can be expressed by the point
    water consumption multiplied by its area. The point water consumption was obtained
    using the crop water consumption model and the survey method. Finally, the water
    consumption of the whole region was obtained by classifying and summarizing the
    water consumption of the sub-region. Guangping County has a small area with little
    change in meteorological scale, and consequently, the sowing, irrigation and harvest
    times for crops have been unified and generalized. Overall, only 8 soil types
    and 7 crop types were used for calculation zones, which were divided into 7 ×
    8 = 56 calculation zones. Each calculation zone contains only one soil type element
    and one crop type element. As the vegetable-fruits did not meet the input conditions
    for the SWAP model, the soil water consumption of 48 calculation areas without
    vegetable-fruits was obtained using the SWAP model, while the remaining 8 calculation
    areas with vegetable-fruits were obtained by investigation. The investigation
    method used involved multiplying the data of the multiple cropping index of the
    vegetable-fruits surveyed in the local area with the water consumption of the
    vegetable-fruits estimated by the Water Demand and Water Consumption Management
    of Major Crops in Northern China (Kang et al., 2018). When using the SWAP model
    to simulate the water consumption of 48 calculation zones, the crop parameters
    of 6 crops on the same soil were calibrated using field experiment data from Guangping
    Experimental Station, and then the calibrated crop parameters were used to simulate
    water consumption for 8 different soils. The SWAP model calculates the water consumption
    rate of a crop using the Penman-Monteith equation, which uses accurate weather
    data to estimate the potential water consumption rate. The equation used was as
    follows: (5) where is the potential water consumption rate, (mm/d); is the slope
    of the water vapor pressure curve, (kPa/℃); is the latent heat of vaporization,
    (J/kg); is the net radiation flux at the canopy surface, (J/[m2·d]); G is the
    soil heat flux, (J/[ m2·d]); is the unit conversion factor with a value of 86
    400, (s/d); is the air density, (kg/m−3); is the heat capacity of moist air, (J/[kg·℃]);
    is the saturation vapor pressure, (kPa); is the actual vapor pressure, (kPa);
    is the psychormetric consrant, (kPa/℃); is the crop resistance, (s/m); and is
    the aerodynamic resistance, (s/m). Four parts are required to input the SWAP model,
    including borders, meteorology, soil, and crops. The upper boundary is the crop
    canopy, and the lower boundary is the bottom zero flux. The meteorological part
    is the actual measured meteorological data for Guangping station, including daily
    data, such as average temperature, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, relative
    humidity, wind speed, sunshine hours, and rainfall. For the soil part, the existing
    soil layer needs to be manually stratified according to the SWAP User Manual (Kroes
    et al., 2017). In this study, the 2-m soil layer is divided into 4 layers and
    40 cells. The first, second, and fourth layers each contain 10 cells, and the
    thickness of each cell is 1, 2, and 14 cm. The third layer contains 5 cells, and
    the thickness of each cell is 6 cm. For the crops, a simple module for static
    crop growth was selected that requires the leaf area index, plant height, and
    root depth for typical crops. The initial crop canopy resistance for each crop
    was selected as 65 s/m, as suggested by VanDam, and each critical pressure head
    for calculating the water-stress discount factor was selected, as suggested by
    Wesseling et al. The maximum root depth was set at 200 cm, as suggested by Doorenbos,
    and the root length density distribution was assumed to be a straight line descending
    along the soil plumb. When the SWAP model was verified, because the crop water
    consumption was difficult to measure directly, it was indirectly characterized
    by the change in soil water content. When the simulation accuracy of the soil
    water content meets the requirements, it can be said that the model was applicable
    to the study area. The crop parameters of six crops were calibrated using 1028
    observed data, from soil moisture monitors in the experimental plots of the study
    area from 2020 to 2021, and the R2, mean relative error (MRE) and root mean square
    error (RMSE) indexes were used for judgment. R2 is the index for judging the fitting
    degree between the measured value and the simulated value. The MRE compares the
    deviation of the simulated values from the measured values, while the RMSE reflects
    the error between the simulated and observed values and is generally controlled
    within 0.2. The formulas used were as follows: (6) (7) (8) where is the simulated
    value of the ith observation; is the ith observation; is the average of observation
    values; and n is the number of observations. 2.4.3. Farmland target ET The farmland
    target ET is the regional target ET minus the residential, industrial, environmental,
    and other targets, as follows: (9) where is the agricultural target ET, is the
    regional target ET, is the residential target ET, is the industrial target ET,
    is the environmental target ET, and denotes water target ET for other water users.
    In the regional water balance, the sum of the precipitation and regional inflows
    minus the regional outflows equals the target ET. As there are no natural streams
    in Guangping County, the regional target ET is equal to the sum of the multi-year
    average precipitation and water transfers from outside the basins: (10) where
    is the average precipitation over the years (m3) and is the external water supply
    (m3). Each target ET was obtained by multiplying the amount of water used by each
    sector by the evapotranspiration coefficient. (11) where denotes the water consumption
    of the residential water use; denotes the water consumption of industrial production;
    denotes the water consumption of environmental water use; denotes the water consumption
    of water use by other water users; and denotes the coefficient of evapotranspiration,
    0.6–0.8, in this study. As we seek the minimum target ET of the farmland, we take
    η = 0.8, and denotes the area. 2.4.4. Multi-optimal allocation model for soil
    and water resources To investigate the optimal allocation of agricultural soil
    and water resources under the control of the regional multi-year average total
    water consumption, this study has established a multi-objective optimal allocation
    model for water and soil resources with NSGA-II as the core algorithm, which sets
    two objective functions and four constraints. 2.4.4.1. Objective functions In
    this study, the objective function is constructed from the two key aspects, economic
    benefits and water-use efficiency. ① The economic benefits were expressed by the
    maximum net income of regional crops, as follows: (12) where, is the price of
    the jth crop (yuan/kg), is the costs of the jth crop (yuan/kg) is the yield of
    the jth crop (kg/km2), is the area of the jth crop, and n is the number of crop
    types. ② Water-use efficiency was expressed by the maximum capacity of unit water
    consumption under the multi-year average, as follows: (13) where, is the area
    planted of the jth crop type of the ith soil type, is the multi-year average water
    consumption of the jth crop type of the ith soil type, and m is the number of
    soil type. 2.4.4.2. Constraint The four constraint sets were the adjusted area,
    water quantity, sown area, and non-negative variables considering the soil type
    and crop requirements, cultivated area, and total water resources in the study
    area. ① For the adjustment area constraint, the minimum and maximum values were
    obtained by multiplying the current area by the reduction and increase factors,
    respectively, as follows: (14) where is the area planted for the jth crop type
    of the ith soil type, is the current area planted for the jth crop type of the
    ith soil type (km2), is the decrease factor for the jth crop type of the ith soil
    type, and is the increase factor for the jth crop type of the ith soil type. ②
    For the water quantity constraint, the total water consumption of the farmland
    after setting the adjustment is ≤ to the target ET of the farmland: (15) where
    is the target ET of the farmland (m3). ③ For the sown area constraint, the total
    area of the farmland for each soil type after optimization of the cropping structure
    was equal to the current area, as follows: (16) where is the current total area
    of ith soil type (km2). ④ For the non-negative variables constraint, the decision
    variable is 0 (17) 2.4.4.3. Process for solving the NSGA-II algorithm The NSGA-II
    algorithm was used to solve the multi-objective optimization model (Deb et al.,
    2000). The model was programmed in MATLAB with the following parameters: population
    size of 100 and the number of iterations was 600. The flow of the algorithm is
    as follows (Fig. 5): Download : Download high-res image (300KB) Download : Download

    Results 3.1. Crop planting structure 3.1.1. Spatial distribution of the data representing
    the NDVI The NDVI spatial distribution map (Fig. 6) shows that the highest NDVI
    values for most areas occur in mid-April and at the end of July, as the main crops
    in Guangping County are winter wheat and summer maize. The NDVI values on February
    1 ranged from 0.2 to 0.4, and this was because the period coincided with the green-returning
    period when winter wheat grows more vigorously. The NDVI values on April 17 and
    July 31 ranged from 0.7 to 0.9, as the end of April was in the heading stage when
    winter wheat grew extremely vigorously, and the end of July was in the filling
    stage when the summer maize grew most vigorously. Most of the NDVI values on June
    6 and September 29 were relatively low and ranged from 0.2 to 0.3. This was because
    early June was when winter wheat was being harvested, and summer maize or other
    crops were being sown, and late September was the end of autumn when most of the
    crops were being harvested, with only cotton and other late-autumn crops remaining.
    The NDVI value was higher than 0.4 in most areas on December 18, which was because
    the areas planted with winter wheat had just emerged. The spatial distribution
    and change rules were consistent with the actual planting situation, indicating
    that the data can be used for planting structure identification and extraction.

    3.1.2. Selection of sample point The Lorentz fitting curves for typical crops
    are shown in Fig. 7, and the results were similar to the actual phenological characteristics,
    indicating that the curves accurately describe the crop NDVI time series and can
    be used to exploit these differences for planting structure extraction. According
    to the Lorenz curve results, a total of 39,864 sample points satisfying 6 fitting
    curves were randomly selected from the pre-processed time-series NDVI images using
    a visual interpretation method, of which 70 % were used as training data and 30
    % as verification data (Fig. 8). Download : Download high-res image (359KB) Download

    structures The distribution of six typical crops in Guangping County extracted
    from the remote sensing data is shown in Fig. 9, and an evaluation of the accuracy
    of the classification results is presented in Table 3. The overall accuracy of
    the classification results was 97.72 %, and the Kappa coefficient was 0.9662.
    Both the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient were >0.9, which indicates that
    the overall quality of the classification was accurate. The mapping accuracies
    for the winter wheat-summer maize, summer maize, sweet potato, and millet were
    all >95 % and that of the winter wheat-summer maize was as high as 98.77 %, indicating
    that the misclassification of these crops was extremely low, and the classification
    results were basically correct. For cotton and peanut, which have slightly lower
    mapping accuracies because of their smaller planting areas and lower total number
    of validation samples, the misclassification of one point will interfere greatly
    with the mapping accuracy. However, the overall user accuracy was >85 %, indicating
    that the chance of mutual misclassification between categories was extremely low,
    and the classification results were accurate. Download : Download high-res image

    200.8745 As can be seen from the spatial distribution structures, the areas sown
    with winter wheat-summer maize rotations, and summer maize monocultures were the
    largest, accounting for approximately 70 % of the total study area, with a higher
    proportion of cultivation in the Nanyangbao, Shilipu, and Nanhan towns. Cotton
    had a larger range in the south-central part of Guangping County and was mainly
    distributed in southern Pinggudian, western Shilipu, and southern Shengying. The
    remaining crops were sporadically distributed. 3.2. Regional water consumption
    3.2.1. Calibration and validation results for SWAP models The calibration and

    results showed that the calibration and validation measured values were fitted
    well with the modeled values, with the RMSE < 0.040 cm3/cm3, MRE < 10 %, and R2
    > 0.8, and the model was also shown to have a high simulation accuracy for soil
    water content and could be used to analyze crop water consumption in Guangping
    County. The calibrated model parameters are listed in Table 6. Table 5. Calibration

    zones Due to the variety of vegetable-fruits and the complexity of the crop rotations,
    this study uniformly generalized the water consumption of vegetable-fruits. According
    to an actual investigation, the replanting index of vegetable-fruits in Guangping
    County is 3, the average water consumption is 500 mm, and it is impossible to
    subdivide the water consumption of the different soils. The total water consumption
    of the vegetable-fruits in all soils was thus set as 1500 mm. The annual average
    water consumption for the 56 calculation zones is presented in Table 8. Table

    water resource optimal allocation based on ET The allocation of soil and water
    resources is primarily based on visible water resources such as surface water
    and groundwater resources; the optimal allocation of soil and water resources
    via the control of invisible water consumption such as the regional agricultural
    target ET is a new strategy. For the water-saving irrigation in agriculture in
    Guangping, more attention was paid to the matching of irrigation and drainage
    channels and canal buildings, as well as the construction of engineering facilities
    such as channel seepage control and adoption of advanced irrigation technology,
    which was in turn used to improve the utilization rate of irrigation water and
    enhance the productivity capacity to increase drought-resistant yields. However,
    these water-saving irrigation efforts have several limitations. First, attention
    was paid to improving the utilization rate of water in the irrigation area, and
    the carrying capacity of water resources was disregarded, leading to the over-exploitation
    of water resources, disruption of the ecological balance, and unsustainable development
    of regional water resources. Second, water saving utilizing engineering methods
    was emphasized, whereas insufficient attention was paid to the water-saving role
    of agricultural measures, leading to an oversight of the substantive issues of
    water-saving irrigation (Zhang, 2009). This is because water saving via engineering
    measures focuses on reducing the loss and seepage of irrigation water, whereas
    water saving using agricultural techniques focuses in reducing the amount of water
    released from the farmland (Zheng, 2007). Considering water resource development
    and utilization holistically, the effects of the two ways of saving water are
    very different (Liu, 2007). Third, via the current management of agricultural
    water-saving irrigation, a set of effective management methods to change the status
    quo of irrigation management has not been established because of the long-term
    influence of the operation mechanism. The above results show that the traditional
    concept of water conservation was more about water-using conservation than water
    resource conservation. For example, traditional irrigation water conservation
    was measured by determining the increase in the effective utilization rate of
    irrigation water, and the effectiveness of water conservation was evaluated based
    on the expansion of water-saving irrigated areas (Wang and Li, 2008). The use
    of the saved water to enhance reproduction failed to meet the new demand. Developing
    water-saving irrigation according to this philosophy will only increase, not decrease,
    water consumption (Yin et al., 2009). ET is the amount of water evaporation and
    transpiration, which is the amount of invisible and intangible water lost into
    the air. The control and management of ET is achieved via the control and management
    of controllable water consumption indicators. To make ET management feasible,
    the relationship between regional ET indicators and controllable water use indicators
    (such as irrigation quota, irrigation water use, surface water diversion, groundwater
    extraction, etc.) needs to be established, and the ET needs to be controlled and
    managed by regulating water use indicators. The optimal allocation model of agricultural
    water and soil resources proposed in this study considers the total water consumption
    of farmlands, the suitability of crops to soil, economic benefits, and water use
    efficiency. In particular, it considers the overall water consumption level of
    regional farmlands and focuses on crop growth and distribution. On this basis,
    the relationship between the regional farmland target ET and land resource utilization
    mode is established, facilitating our proposal of the optimization scheme of water
    and soil resources that is relatively consistent with the sustainable development
    of resources. 4.2. Rationality of model simulation The optimal allocation of soil
    and water resources is not merely a single adjustment or the construction of a
    complex model of joint allocation but also considers the nature of different soils
    to ensure that “water” is included in the “soil” and then adjusted for the planting
    structure. Thus, the purpose of the general configuration was achieved, and the
    complexity of the joint configuration was considerably simplified. When constructing
    the model, Liu (2014) referred to real water consumption, and consequently, the
    target ET for farmland was used as the control total, which extended water conservation
    and focused on irrigation water to real water consumption to determine real water-saving.
    When constructing the objective function, the average water consumption of crops
    over 48 years was introduced, which not only successfully completes the configuration
    in the multi-year situation but also simplifies the originally complex objective
    function and greatly improves computational efficiency. When selecting the algorithm,
    we compared NSGA-II and NSGA with hyper volume index, and the calculated results
    were 0.0164 and 0.0089, respectively. Because the larger the index, the more optimized
    the performance of the algorithm, NSGA-2 was chosen as the optimization algorithm
    in this study. In the optimization configuration, the population sizes of 50,
    100, 200 and 500 were selected for simulation verification, and the simulation
    iteration time of 600 times was 76.93 s, 165.17 s, 534.18 s, and 3075.36 s, respectively.
    The larger the population, the longer the running time. The running time of 500
    populations is approximately 39.97 times that of 50 populations. When the population
    size is 50, 100, 200, and 500, the number of iterations is 230, 180, 120 and 95
    times, respectively. The larger the population, the smaller the number of iterations
    during convergence. We further analyzed the simulation results of the model. Soil
    and water resource allocation in Guangping County have been studied extensively;
    however, studies of joint soil and water resource allocation are few, and most
    of them are related to the adjustment of the planting structure. For example,
    Kong (2022) included our study area in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei configuration.
    The results of their research reduced the area of peanut and cotton in Guangping
    County by 188.87 hm2 and 225.80 hm2, respectively, which is similar to the optimization
    results from this study, as the areas for peanut and cotton were reduced by 73.16
    hm2 and 208.96 hm2, respectively. This indicates that the adjustment results for
    these two categories are reasonable. However, distinct differences were observed
    in the specific values. This may be because of the randomness of NSGA-II genetic
    algorithm during iteration. Zhang et al. (2022) proposed that the planting area
    for wheat and maize be reduced and that of potatoes and vegetables increased to
    optimize planting structures in Hebei. Cui et al. (2023) adjusted the planting
    structure of crops in Handan from the perspective of water resources and concluded
    that the sown areas for wheat and maize could be reduced by 77,000 hm2 and 189,400
    hm2, respectively. The above article does not show specific elevations or reductions
    in Guangping County; however, the general conclusions, i.e., reducing the sown
    area of winter wheat-summer maize and summer maize while increasing the area for
    potatoes and vegetables, were consistent with those of the present study. 4.3.
    Limitations and prospects of this study When using remote sensing to extract planting
    structures, the Sentinel-2 data reported by Liu (2022) and the random forest algorithm
    reported by Li and Xiong (2021) were predominantly used in the present study to
    identify the major crops at a county scale for the planted area statistics. This
    reduced the impact of the original manual statistics on the planted area of crops
    and led to an increase in the degree of refinement. The extraction results were
    basically consistent with the planting area in the statistical yearbook (Zhang,
    2012–2021), indicating that the extraction of the planting structure was successful.
    However, as the planting area for crops is relatively broken, the remote sensing
    image with 10-m spatial resolution in this study had a greater error when identifying
    crops with a planting area of <100 m2, resulting in poor accuracy of classification
    results in these mixed and broken areas. In the future, higher resolution remote
    sensing images such as Gaofen-2 will be used to improve the accuracy of classification
    results for these complex areas to obtain more accurate planting structure distribution
    maps. Crop water consumption was primarily determined using the SWAP model and
    investigation. Zhang et al. (2011) concluded that the water consumption of summer
    maize ranged from 375.7 to 396.2 mm, whereas that of winter wheat-summer maize
    ranged from 777.1 to 854.8 mm, which was consistent with the results obtained
    in the present study and numerous previous studies (Li et al., 2007, Liu et al.,
    2002). Considering the effects of soil type on water consumption, the values for
    the maximum water consumption minus minimum water consumption were, in descending
    order, as follows: sweet potato, peanut, summer maize, winter wheat-summer maize,
    millet, and cotton. The differences between the maximum and minimum water consumption
    value for cotton was 4.3 mm, which indicates that the soil type has relatively
    little influence on cotton. The difference in water consumption for sweet potato
    was 82.5 mm, indicating that the soil type has relatively considerable influence.
    As crop growth data are difficult to obtain, the SWAP model was used in the present
    study to simulate crop growth, using a simple crop module that requires relatively
    few data. However, certain limitations were observed in the simple crop module
    and detailed crop module. In future research, detailed crop modules or coupling
    with other crop models should be considered for simulating the water consumption
    characteristics that were more in line with the actual crop growth. The multi-objective
    optimization model is used to allocate soil and water resources because the optimal
    allocation of water and soil resources is a very complex process, involving natural,
    social, and other factors. Because of limitations of data and research time, this
    study only considered the influence of crop and soil factors when determining
    the influencing factors of water use. The difference in water quality factors
    in different regions, the loss of canal systems in the irrigation process, and
    the leakage of the canal system were not considered. When the model was constructed,
    the price fluctuation of crops did not consider the choice of farmers'' crops
    and planting scale in the second year and the estimation of crop yield under different
    water consumption conditions. In response to these problems, in subsequent research,
    more data will be collected when constructing the model, and additional models
    will be applied to improve the accuracy of the optimal configuration. 5. Conclusions
    In this study, the collected basic meteorological and field trial data was combined
    with GIS, the SWAP model, and the multi-objective optimization model based on
    the regional soil types and corresponding suitable cultivation crops. The optimal
    allocation of the soil and water resources were then determined by controlling
    the regional annual average total water consumption and maximizing the economic
    benefits and water-use efficiency as the objective functions. After optimization,
    the economic benefit and water use efficiency were 853.64 billion yuan and 1.5859
    kg/m3, respectively; the economic benefit and water use efficiency increased by
    0.4327 billion yuan and 0.0433 kg kg/m3, respectively. The results show that multi-objective
    soil and water resource allocation are feasible when based on economic benefits
    and water-use efficiency. The research model and method were determined using
    the total annual average water consumption of Guangping County and the planting
    structure adjustments for different crops in different soils and will thus, enable
    the development of highly credible adjustment programs and methods in the future.

  description: Energy demand, energy cost and water scarcity are three of the main
    problems in the new Irrigation districts (ID) where the irrigation distribution
    networks are pressurized and frequently organized on-demand (water is continuously
    available to farmers). This on-demand irrigation generates a huge degree of uncertainty
    for IDs managers when it comes to managing both water and energy use and therefore
    its cost. Knowledge of the irrigation water demand several days in advance would
    facilitate the management of the system and would help to optimize water use and
    energy costs. The use of artificial intelligence (AI) and especially deep learning,
    developing forecasting model with capacity to learn autonomously from real information
    from each ID, is a key element to achieve water-energy optimization. Previous
    works have successfully forecast irrigation water demand at IDs for several days
    ahead. However, all these previous works were based on human memory which is fallible
    and not easily pass on from operator to the next. In this work, a new model combined
    a modified version of Transformer Neural Networks (TNNs), fuzzy logic and Genetic
    Algorithms (GAs) for the middle-term time resolution forecast (one-week ahead)
    of irrigation water demand at the ID scale it has been developed and tested in
    a working ID. This model improves the representativeness and accuracy of the best
    previously developed model by 6.1 % and 89.8 %, respectively. In addition, only
    with 9 attention heads and with 1.75 million of parameters (only 16.7 % denser
    than previous works) the developed IWD forecasting model was able to forecast
    the 99.9 % of the scenarios with an average standard error prediction of 2.10
    %.

    learning 1. Introduction Pressurized irrigation systems are one of the best options
    to increase water use efficiency (Daccache et al., 2014a, Daccache et al., 2014b)
    in irrigated agriculture which uses up much of the world’s fresh water sources.
    However, the modernization process of hydraulic infrastructures carried out in
    last decades has led to increase the flexibility in the irrigation operation by
    farmers. The new water distribution networks for irrigation which are managed
    by irrigation districts (ID) make water continuously available to farmers 24 h
    a day. Thus, farmers can decide every day its irrigation scheduling (how and when
    to irrigate) (Playán and Mateos, 2006, Rodríguez-Díaz et al., 2011, Tarjuelo et
    al., 2015). However, this increase in the availability of water by farmers makes
    the integrated management of the ID a complex task (the hydraulic systems must
    work under a wide range of hydraulic operation conditions). Managers of these
    IDs do not know when their users (farmers) are going to irrigate and at what time,
    making it difficult to optimize all the system (pumping stations, failures, repairs,
    energy purchases, etc.). Thus, the uncertainty associated with irrigation water
    demands in water distribution networks which are operated on demand (Plusquellec,
    2009) and the uncertainty of the electricity market (In Spain, last deep change
    on 1st June 2021) are generating challenges in the daily management of irrigation
    districts, mainly in arid and semiarid regions such as Spain. In addition, an
    accurate prediction of water demand would allow for optimal network management
    measures to reduce energy demand. Nowadays, in the new age of digitalization,
    ICTs (Information and Communication Technologies) and intelligent algorithms based
    on Artificial intelligence (AI) are essential to increase and improve the precision
    agriculture management, particularly in the control of the water-energy management
    in pressurized irrigation systems (Kamilaris and Prenafeta-Boldú, 2018, Wolfert
    et al., 2017). Traditional strategies to save water and energy in ID such as critical
    point management, sectorization, etc. (Derardja et al., 2019, Fernández García
    et al., 2016, González Perea et al., 2016, Rodríguez Díaz et al., 2012) frequently
    reduce farmers’ water management flexibility, diminishing the positive aspects
    of the irrigation modernization process (on-demand irrigation where water is continuously
    available to farmers). Thus, new water and energy optimization strategies in ID
    are necessary, but without reducing the decision-making power of farmers, based
    on intelligent models which forecasts this farmer behavior. The exploitation of
    AI has modified the technological environment of current irrigated agriculture.
    Based on machine learning from data, these technologies offer new possibilities
    for water-energy nexus management in IDs, leading to increased use efficiencies
    of these resources, making the IDs more sustainable, in environmental, social
    and economic aspects. Based on deep and machine learning, water demand forecasting
    will allow the entire water distribution network (from pumping station to hydrant)
    to be adapted to operate as efficiently as possible, reducing the uncertainty
    caused by on-demand irrigation, optimizing all its resources. Thus, water demand
    forecasting could be one of the main tools to improve IDs operation and help managers
    in the daily decision-making processes but without reducing farmers’ degree of
    freedom. AI, ICTs and bigdata have been applied to solve some forecasting issues
    (mainly of a time series nature) in precision irrigation, IDs and pressurized
    irrigation networks. Since it was first published in its full version in the early
    2000s (Graves and Schmidhuber, 2005), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network
    is the most widely used type of artificial neural network for solving time series
    forecasting problems. At ID scale, ground water level estimations and irrigation
    demand forecasting are two of the main topics addressed for water-energy optimization
    based on AI and bigdata (Sheikh Khozani et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2018). The
    are not many works that tried to address the water demand forecasting in IDs.
    This issue can be approached at different spatial and temporal scales. At spatial
    scale, farm and irrigation district scale can be distinguished. On the other hand,
    at temporal scale, short (one day), middle (around a week), and long (several
    weeks) term scales can be recognised. At present, there are not long-term forecasting
    models either at farm or water user association level because of its complexity
    and dynamism. However, some forecasting models have been developed for the rest
    of the spatial and temporal scales. At short-term time scales, some forecasting
    models have been developed at ID (González Perea et al., 2019a, González Perea
    et al., 2015, Pulido-Calvo and Gutiérrez-Estrada, 2009) and farm scales (González
    Perea et al., 2021, González Perea et al., 2019b, González Perea et al., 2018).
    However, although the accuracy of short-term forecasting models for different
    spatial scales is good, managers require longer term forecasting models since
    they would be much more practical in the decision making and adopt the best management
    strategies in advance. Longer term forecasting models would be much more useful
    for managers to know in advance how much water will be required and be more efficient
    in the use of water and energy resources and perform a cost-effective purchase
    of the electric energy. At middle-term time scales, Forouhar et al. (2022) developed
    a hybrid framework by incorporating existing physical knowledge (conceptual model
    based on observation data to understand the crop water requirements factors) of
    the system into a data-driven model to predict the irrigation water demand up
    to 7 days ahead for an irrigation district in Victoria, Australia. However, although
    results showed that the integration of physical system understanding into data-driven
    models can improve the performance of the predictions, the accuracy is not enough
    for an integrated management of water and energy resources in IDs. González Perea
    et al. (2023) developed a hybrid model based on memory with a size of 1.5 million
    of parameters for one-week forecasting of irrigation water demand at ID scale.
    Although, the global representativeness and accuracy of this model was 95 % and
    20 %, respectively, the accuracy for each of the seven forecasted days were 16.42
    %, 19.01 %, 20.74 %, 21.08 %, 21.89 %, 22.09 % and 22.31 %, respectively and its
    representativeness ranged from 97.06 % to 85.49 %. While, this forecasting model
    is the most accurate and has the highest temporal resolution (middle-term time
    scale) to date, the model showed memory leakage effects as the forecast time increases,
    making the model inaccurate from the third forecasted day. This problem is common
    in forecasting models based on memory such as LSTM and all its modifications González
    Perea et al. (2023). All these problems make them difficult to integrate in the
    day-to-day of IDs. In 2018 a new approach was developed for time series forecasting
    that is not based on memory but on attention mechanisms (Vaswani et al., 2017).
    These attentional mechanisms, working under a new artificial neural network architecture
    called Transformer, have revolutionised the field of natural language processing
    (NLP), which is a particular case of time series forecasting, leading to developments
    such as the models known as GPT-X (Generative Pre-trained Transformers, OpenAI),
    BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, Google), PALM (Pathways
    Language Model, Google), LaMDA (Language Model for Dialogue Applications, Google),
    etc. Transformer model and its attention mechanism has not only been applied to
    NLP issues, but to other times series forecasting issues. For example, (Karthik
    et al., 2020) developed an attention embedded residual CNN (Convolutional Neural
    Network) model for disease detection in tomato leave. Abed et al. (2023) applied
    transformer-based deep learning architecture for evaporation prediction in four
    different Malaysian regions. However, no previous works have been published in
    irrigation water management or forecasting. Thus, in this work, a new hybrid model
    combined a modified version of Transformer Neural Networks (TNNs), fuzzy logic
    and Genetic Algorithms (GAs) for the middle-term time resolution forecast (one-week
    ahead) of irrigation water demand at ID scale has been developed. The developed
    model has been tested in a real ID. 2. Methodology 2.1. Study area and data source
    Canal del Zújar Irrigation District (CZID) (Fig. 1) was selected as real ID to
    validate and test the forecast model developed in this study. The model was trained
    and tested with daily data from the 2015 to 2022 irrigation seasons. This WUA,
    located in Southwest Spain (Extremadura region), is made up of 10 independent
    hydraulic sectors covering a total area of 21141 ha. The closest weather station
    is “Don Benito-EFA” (UTM coordinates (x, y, zone): 252468, 431917, 30). The average
    temperature in the area ranges from 7.1 °C in January to 25 °C in July, and the
    average maximum temperature ranges from 13.2 °C to 35.1 °C. Average annual rainfall
    is 390 mm. Maximum evapotranspiration occurs in July, with a daily average of
    7 mm. Average annual evapotranspiration is 1296 mm. Sector II has selected for
    this work, which covers an irrigated area of 2691 ha and is composed of 191 hydrants.
    The main crops are tomato, maize and rice (90 % of the total irrigated area).
    Drip irrigation is used for tomato and maize crops, while rice is flood irrigated.
    Each hydrant has a flowmeter which automatically records the hourly volume of
    water applied. The complete cleaned dataset of the daily irrigation water demand
    contained a total of 1849 measures corresponding to all the irrigation seasons
    studied in this work. This dataset was randomly divided into two subsets: training
    dataset (80 % of the total measures of the original dataset) and test dataset
    (20 % of the total measures of the original dataset). The selection of the train/test
    subsets is done over a moving window with an amplitude equal to the spacing of
    the input and output variables. Thus, each record of these subsets consists of
    t-7…to t input and target data. Download : Download high-res image (333KB) Download

    Irrigation District (CZID). 2.2. Problem approach The middle-term (one-week ahead)
    irrigation water demand forecasting model at irrigation district scale without
    memory mechanisms to improve the model accuracy model has been formulated as multi-step
    time series forecasting problem. Frequently, like in some NLP tasks such as speech
    recognition or Q&A (question and answer systems), the length of the input and
    the output of the time series is not the same. In these scenarios, a specific
    structure of artificial neural networks must be applied to solve these multi-step
    time series forecasting problems. This structure is known as sequence-to-sequence
    (seq2seq) architecture in NLP tasks or encoder-decoder architecture for multi-step
    time series forecasting problems. Encoder-decoder model whose elemental architecture
    is shown in Fig. 2a consist of training models in which a time series from one
    domain is transformed into a time series from another domain. Thus, the encoder
    part transforms the input time series into a single fixed length vector known
    as the context vector. This context vector keeps all the information that the
    encoder can extract from the input time series, including relationships between
    different time steps and within network layers. The decoder part is responsible
    for transforming the context vector into the output time series. Download : Download

    Encoder-Decoder architecture; (b) Modified Transformer neural network (TNN) architecture;

    layers. In this work, the decoder model has also its own input time series to
    improve the training process which is detailed in the transformer neural network
    description. Thus, this encoder-decoder architecture has been applied by a new
    model based on transformer neural networks whose architecture is described as
    follows. This new model has been developed in Python programming language (v3.10)
    (Van et al., 2009). 2.3. Transformer neural network architecture The TNN architecture
    follows a recursive encoder-decoder structure (fig, 2b) with multi-head attention
    mechanisms, using teacher forcing for training. At the core, the TNN contains
    a stack of encoder and decoder layers. Thus, the number of stacked encoder layers
    and decoder layers have been denoted as Nenc and Ndec, respectively. All the encoder
    layers are identical to one another and similarly all the decoders are also identical.
    Fig. 2c shows the general architecture for a transformer model with a Necn and
    Ndec value of 2 and 3 respectively. In this model, both Nenc and Ndec will be
    considered as hyperparameters, and will be optimized by the GA described in the
    next section. The Encoder layer is made up by self-Attention Encoder (Fig. 2b)
    sublayer and feed forward sublayer while Decoder layer is made up by self-Attention
    Decoder sublayer, an Encoder-Decoder attention sublayer and a feed forward sublayer.
    Each encoder and decoder layer has its own set of weights and all the sublayers
    in each encoder and decoder layers is followed by a sublayer labelled as Add&Norm
    (Fig. 2b). Add&Norm sublayer are in fact two separate sublayers (Fig. 3). The
    add sublayer is a residual connection layer where the sum together of the result
    of the previous sublayer F(x) and the input x is performed. The norm sublayer
    is a normalization layer (Ba et al., 2016) where the normalization statistics
    of a layer l (mean, μl and deviation, σl) from the summed input to the neuros
    within a hidden layer is directly estimated as follows: (1) (2) where H is the
    number of hidden units in a layer and is the input of the hidden units i at the
    layer l. (3) where is normalized summed input to the i hidden unit in the l layer
    and g is a gain parameter scaling the normalized activation before the non-linear
    activation function. Download : Download high-res image (175KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 3. Unfolding the sublayer Add&Norm. Feed forward sublayer
    (FFN) is a dense or perceptron neural network (Rumelhart et al., 1986) which acts
    as the hidden layers in a classical neural network. The first layer takes ReLU
    (Rectified linear unit) as the activation function and the second takes Linear
    activation functions, computing the output of this sublayer as shown in Eq. (4).
    (4) where W1, b1, W2 and b2 are the weights and bias parameters of the two hidden
    layers of this sublayer, respectively. ReLU activation functions is described
    in Eq. (5), as follows: (5) where x is the input to a neuron and f(x) is the output
    of the neuron. In this work, both Encoder and Decoder layers have a new version
    of the traditional positional encoding adapted to the water forecasting problem
    which is described in the next section. Once the information is passed through
    the stacked encoder and decoder layers, there is an output layer to generate the
    final output. This output layer is a feedforward layer, with one hidden layer.
    2.3.1. Positional encoding for water demand time series forecasting Contrary to
    models based on recurrent neural networks where information is sequentially passed
    through the network, models based on transformers does not use this recurrence
    loop. Consequently, these models compute all information parallelly and so no
    positional information for each input variable can be found. This is the major
    advantage over the RNN architecture and its ‘Alzheimer effect’, but it means that
    position is lost, and must be added back in separately. In addition, in multistep
    time series forecasting problems an additional time position must also be introduced
    at the beginning of the model. Hence, in this work, two new terms wereencoded
    to pass positional information to the developed model. The first term adds information
    about the position within the input vector to the forecasting model (e.g., the
    daily average temperature of 4 days before is located at position 11 of the input
    vector). The second term adds information about the real day of each input variable
    (e.g., time series variables corresponding to 30 April and 1 May should be closer
    than those belonging to 14 May and 20 June). All these information must be encoded
    and added to the model together with the input time series. This positional encoding
    (PE) (Fig. 2b) is computed independently of the input time series according to
    Eqs. (5), (6). These are fixed values that depends only on the length of the input/output
    time series and the day of the year (doi) of each variable of the time series.
    (6) (7) where doi is the day of the year of each variable of the input and target
    time series; pos indicates the position of each value in the time series; dmodel
    is the length of the encoding vector for input and target in encoder and decoder
    sublayers and i is the index value into this encoding vector. Therefore, positional
    encoding is a stack of sines and cosines that vibrate at different frequencies
    depending on their location along the depth of the encoding vector, the position
    in the vector and the day of the year. Thus, positional encoding interleaves a
    sine and a cosine curve, with sine values for all even indexes and cos values
    for all odd indexes. Fig. 4 shows an example for an input time series consisting
    of two variables (temperature and reference evapotranspiration, ET0) in two previous
    days (t-1 and t-2) and a dmodel value of 5. Download : Download high-res image

    matrix for 4 variables and a dmodel value of 5. 2.3.2. Attention mechanisms The
    key to the transformer’s ground-breaking performance is its use of Attention.
    In contrast to RNN based models where each variable of the time series is processed
    sequentially, attention enables the model to focus on other variables in the input/target
    time series while a specific variable is processed. While RNN processes recurrently
    each variable of input time series, transformer architecture uses self-attention
    by relating every input/target variable in the input/target time series to every
    other variable (Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image (144KB) Download :
    Download full-size image Fig. 5. (a) Recurrent connexions in RNN; (b) Attention
    mechanisms in TNN. Attention mechanisms are used in TNNs in three places (Fig.
    2b): self-attention Encoder where the encoder pays attention itself (to the input
    time series); self-attention Decoder where the decoder pays attention itself (to
    the target time series) and Encoder-Decoder attention where the decoder layer
    pays attention to the input time series. The three attention blocks (self-attention
    Encoder, self-attention Decoder and Encoder-Decoder attention) takes its input
    in the form of three parameters, known as Query (Q), Key (K) and Value (V). In
    the blocks self-attention Encoder and self-attention Decoder, the Encoder and
    Decoder layers’s input/target are passed to all three parameters, Q, K and V.
    However, in the Encoder-Decoder attention, the output of the final Encoder layer
    is passed to the V and K parameters. The output of the self-attention Decoder
    (and Add&Norm) is passed to the Q parameter. TNN denominates each attention processor
    an Attention head and repeat it several times in parallel in a process known as
    Multi-Head attention. The Multi-Head attention mechanism gives TNN power of discrimination,
    by combining several similar attention calculations (Attention heads). The three
    attention blocks in transformer (self-Attention Encoder, self-Attention Decoder
    and Encoder-Decoder Attention) incorporate a multi-head attention mechanism. Fig.
    6 shows the computational graph of how multi-head attention process is performed.
    Each V, K, and Q parameters are passed through separate Linear Layers (Feed Forward
    layer), each with their own weights which are adjusted during training process.
    Then, the results of these operations are combined to produce the attention score
    (Scaled Dot-product attention (Fig. 6)), according to Eq. (8). (8) where dK is
    the dimension of the K parameter and softmax function is describe in equation
    (9): (9) Download : Download high-res image (278KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Self-attention block and scaled Dot-Product Attention in TNN. This
    attention score is performed by every variable in the time series against the
    other variables of the input/target time series. This leads to having a score
    value for each variable of the times series relative to each other. For example,
    if the variable x2 (e.g. temperature of two previous days) is not relevant for
    the variable x1 (e.g. ET0 of the two previous days), then the attention score
    gives low probability score. In the end, every input/target variable in the input/target
    time series obtains a new value for itself. Multi-head attention score is then
    performed according to equation (10): (10) where nheads is the number of heads
    of the developed model; W0 is the set of weights of the hidden layer of the linear
    layer (last linear layer shown in Fig. 6) and headi is computed as follows: (11)
    where , and are the set of weights belonging to the hidden layer of the linear
    layers associated to Q, K and V parameters, respectively and the attention head
    i. The model proposed in this work based on TNNs was entirely developed with TensorFlow
    v2.10.0 (Abadi et al., 2015) and Keras v2.10.0 (Chollet, 2015). Adaptative momentum
    algorithm (Adam) (Kingma and Ba, 2015) was used for the training process of the
    forecasting model with β1, β2 and ε values of 0.9, 0.98 and 10−9, respectively.
    The function shown in Eq. (12) was used as dynamic learning rate in Adam algorithm:
    (12) where nepochs is the total number of epochs during the training process and
    epoch is each step of the training process. Glorot uniform initialized algorithm
    (Glorot and Bengio, 2010) was used to initialize all synaptic weights because
    of its high performance (faster convergence) when Adams training function is used.
    The loss function used during the training process was the mean square error (mse).
    Additionally, early stopping technique was used to improve the developed model''s
    ability to perform well on unseen data by stopping the training process at an
    optimal point. Thus, this technique is widely used in training artificial neural
    networks to prevent overfitting by monitoring the model''s performance on a validation
    set during training and stopping the process when the performance starts to worsen.
    By halting training before the model overfits to the training data too much, early
    stopping helps strike a balance between fitting the data well and generalizing
    to new, unseen data, ensuring the model captures essential patterns without getting
    too specialized. 2.4. Optimization of the water demand forecasting model Synaptic
    weights (W) and attention parameters (Q, K, V) are automatically optimized during
    the training process by the training algorithm Adam, since TNN as other artificial
    neural networks are machine learning models with the ability to learn autonomously
    from data. However, there is another set of parameters, the hyperparameters of
    the forecasting model, which have to be adjusted before the training process.
    The ability to learn, generalize and therefore to forecast the water demand in
    an irrigation district is determined by its hyperparameters. In this work, the
    hyperparameters of the developed model have been optimized by NSGA-II genetic
    algorithm. Fig. 7 shows the flowchart of the optimization process of the developed
    model based on TNN. The optimization process starts by randomly generating a set
    of potential solutions. This set of initial solutions constitutes the initial
    population which is made up of a set of individuals or chromosomes (each solution
    represents one individual or chromosome). Consequently, each individual or chromosome
    is a water demand forecasting model whose architecture (set of hyperparameters)
    is defined by the individual. The initial population has a size of npop individuals
    or chromosomes. Each of these individuals or chromosomes (potential solutions)
    is made up of a set of genes or decision variables (ngenes). In this work, each
    gene represents one hyperparameters of the forecasting model to be optimized.

    Fig. 7. Flow chart of the optimization process of the developed water demand forecasting
    model. The hyperparameters to be optimized and the decision variables of the optimization
    process were: the number of stacked Encoder and Decoder layers (Nenc, Ndec); the
    length of the encoding vector for input and target in encoder and decoder layers
    (dmodel), i.e. the density of the transformation space of the input and target
    vectors; the number of attention heads (nheads) and the number of neurons of the
    hidden layers of the feed forward neural networks sublayers (ndff). Table 1 shows
    the value range and the data type for each of these genes in the optimization
    process. Thus, the first genes represent the hyperparameter Nenc (and Ndec) which
    ranged from 1 to 6, the second genes belonged to dmodel with a potential range
    of 1–260, and the two last genes or decision variables were nheads (range values
    from 1 to 13) and ndff (range values from 10 to 800), respectively. All the ranges
    were integer values with step change of 1. Table 1. Decision variables to be optimized
    during the optimization process of the hybrid model. Gen Position Hyperparameter
    Range values Type value Description Gen1 Nenc,dec 1–6 Integer Number of stacked
    Encoder and Decoder layers. Gen2 dmodel 1–260 Integer Length of the encoding vector.
    Gen3 nheads 1–13 Integer Number of attention heads. Gen4 ndff 10–800 Integer Number
    of neurons of the hidden layers of the feed forward neural networks sublayers.
    Once the initial population is initialized, each individual (i.e. each potential
    water demand forecasting model defined by individual Indi) is built, trained and
    tested. Then, each individual obtained their associated objectives functions (OF1
    and OF2) in order to measure the fitness of each forecasting model. In this work,
    the optimization process maximized de OF1 which defines the average of the determination
    coefficient, R2, of the forecasting model outputs (output time series of irrigation
    water demand 7 days ahead) and minimized OF2 which defines the average of the
    standard error prediction, SEP (Ventura et al., 1995), i.e., the model accuracy.
    After computing the objective functions for all individuals in the initial population,
    the initial population was sorted according to the fitness of each individual
    (defined by the values of the objective functions). The best npop/2 individuals
    were then selected and become the parents of the next generation. Then, a new
    generation of npop individuals was created by crossover and mutations of the parent
    individuals. Finally, the set of npop optimal individuals (optimal forecasting
    models) defined by the Pareto Front was obtained in the last generation (generation
    nGEN). 2.5. Identification of the water demand forecasting model inputs Previously
    to generate and optimize the hybrid model a dimension reduction of the input space
    is essential. This dimension reduction must identify the significant inputs from
    the set of possible inputs (potential inputs) for the forecasting hybrid model.
    There are many techniques to achieve this input space reduction. Principal component
    analysis or partial least square cardinal components are two widely used techniques.
    However, when the significant input variables resulting from these techniques
    are used in nonlinear models, very poor results are usually obtained (Lin et al.,
    1996a). The methodology proposed in this work automatically analyzes and identifies
    the most representative input variables for the predictive model to be developed.
    Therefore, an adaptation of this methodology for a multivariate time series problems
    has been used in this work to identify the significant inputs in an automatic
    way using fuzzy curves and fuzzy surfaces. The potential inputs analysed were
    structured in temporal frame which ranged from 2 (t-1, t-2) to 10 days (t-1, t-2,
    …, t-10). Thus, this methodology can considered the autocorrelation and cross-correlation
    between variables. For a potential input variable v, PotIv, a fuzzy curve beam,
    cbv, is created (Eq. (13). Each curve determined the relationship between v and
    the output variable of the forecasting model (target variable), which here was
    the daily irrigation water demand (IWD) of the ID. (13) where µv, k is the fuzzy
    membership function of point k in the space v- IWD, which relates the potential
    input variable v and the daily irrigation water demand of the entire IDand is
    defined by Eq. (14); M is the total number of points in the space PotIv- IWD and
    IWDk is the daily irrigation water demand of the entire ID in point k of the space
    PotIv-IWD. (14) where PotIv,k is the value of PotIv at point k in the space PIv-IWD
    and b takes a value close to two (Lin et al., 1996b). Hereafter, the mean square
    error values, MSE, of each cbv curve were computed and sorted in ascending order
    according to Eq. (15). If there is a fully random relationship between the input
    variable v and the IWD, the fuzzy curves are flat, and the MSEcbv is large. Otherwise,
    MSEcbv takes small values when the relationship in the space PotIv-IWD is more
    significant. (15) According to Lin et al., 1996a, Lin et al., 1996b, a fuzzy surface
    is a space with a two-dimensional fuzzy curve. This fuzzy surface, fsiv,ij, is
    defined in equation (16). (16) where PotIv and PotIij are two potential input
    variables. Then, like Eq. (13), the MSE was computed for each fuzzy surface, .
    Thus, fuzzy curves were initially used to rank all the potential input variables
    in ascending order. The PotI variable with the smallest MSEcbv was the most important
    input variable. Fuzzy surfaces were then used to find the independent input variables
    and to eliminate the related input in each step (20 % eliminated according to
    Lin et al., 1996a, Lin et al., 1996b). Therefore, in each step, new fuzzy surfaces
    were computed, and 20 % of the potential input variable with the largest was eliminated.
    Once the most important inputs have been automatically identified as previously
    detailed, the final dataset (original data) composed of input variables- target
    was determined. Finally, the original data set must be split into three subsets
    (training set, validation set and testing set) to achieve a good generalization
    of the hybrid model. This division of the original dataset was computed by a Monte
    Carlo algorithm maintaining the same mean and standard deviation in the three
    subsets as the original dataset (Ballesteros et al., 2016). 3. Results and discussion
    The irrigation water demand forecasting model was applied to the CZID. To ensure
    the reliability and transparency of results, all performance or statistic metrics
    shown in this section were obtained over the test dataset. In addition, stopping
    early technique was added during model training to avoid reaching the remembering
    phase. The methodology previously described to identify the most important inputs
    for the water demand forecasting model assessed a total of 18 potential inputs
    in a temporal frame which ranged from 2 (t-1, t-2) to 10 days (t-1, t-2, …, t-10).
    Only four ease-to-take variables were finally selected in a temporal frame of
    7 days (from t-1 to t-7) as inputs for the irrigation demand forecasting model.
    Thus, from t-1 to t-7, the variables selected were the previous IWD measures (in
    mm), the average air temperature (Tave, °C), solar radiation (Rad, MJ m−2) and
    reference evapotranspiration (ETo, mm), making a total of 28 inputs to the forecasting
    model and 7 outputs (IWD from t + 1 to t + 7). The Irrigation water demand forecasting
    model was specifically designed to forecast Individual farmers’ behaviours within
    the ID rather than aggregating the irrigation needs of crops. The primary distinction
    lies in how much irrigation water each farmer uses. Generally, farmers who schedule
    irrigation more effectively tend to have a smaller difference between the water
    they apply and the actual crop needs. However, various factors—like socio-cultural
    practices, individual farmer perceptions based on experience, or unique aspects
    of the irrigation system—result in some farmers deviating significantly from optimal
    irrigation practices. Previous works concluded that the wind chill temperature
    (mainly determined by temperature, wind speed and relative humidity) is essential
    to obtain a good estimation of the daily irrigation water demand in an ID. This
    effect of the wind chill of each farmer seems to be blurred when aggregated to
    a larger spatial scale such as the entire ID (González Perea et al., 2023, González
    Perea et al., 2015). However, including average air temperature, radiation, and
    reference evapotranspiration is enough to consider this wind chill effect. The
    methodology developed in this work for input variables identification can consider
    this blurred effect of the wind chill at larger scale selecting these four input
    variables. 3.1. Optimization the IWD forecasting model architecture The depth
    or density of the forecasting model defined by Nenc, Ndec, dmodel, nheads and
    ndff were optimized by the NSGA-II. The size of the initial population (npop)
    was set to 50 individuals, i.e., 50 potential IWD forecasting models, randomly
    generated. This initial population evolved over 200 generations (NGEN) before
    its objective functions (OF1 and OF2) were stabilised. The probabilities for crossover
    and mutation were set to 90 % and 10 %, respectively. After optimization process,
    the 50 individuals of the last generations determined the Pareto front. Fig. 8
    shows the objective functions values for both the initial population and the Pareto
    front. The aim of the optimization process carried out by the NSGA-II was the
    maximization and the minimization of the OF1 and OF2, respectively. As the two
    objective functions correspond to the representativeness (R2) of the forecasting
    model and its accuracy (SEP), OF1 and OF2 are opposites, i.e., the improvement
    of OF1 leads to a detriment of OF2 and contrarywise. In this kind of the optimization
    issues where the two objective functions are opposed, it is usual to find a Pareto
    front located in the lower right corner region of the OF1-OF2 space (Fig. 8).
    Unlike other forecasting models for time series problems such as memory-based
    models, the architecture of the forecasting model and hence its density determines
    its forecasting aptitude. Thus, the forecasting aptitude of each model of the
    initial population which is characterized by is objective functions ranged from
    3.2 % to 97.1 % and from 18.8 % and 88.7 % for OF1 and OF2, respectively. For
    example, in González Perea et al. (2023) where a memory-based forecasting model
    was developed to forecast the IWD to 7 days ahead, the value the range of OF1
    and OF2 in the initial population was much smaller (4.97 % and 6.23 % variation
    between the minimum and maximum values for the two objective functions, respectively)
    than in this work. Consequently, the right optimization of the hyperparameters
    of the IWD forecasting model is key to achieve an adequate predictive capacity
    of the model. The OF1 value (R2) of all the individuals from to the Pareto front
    which are in the lower right corner of the Fig. 8 was higher than 99.9 % whereas
    the OF2 values ranged from 1.1 % to 7.2 %. Download : Download high-res image
    (290KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Values of OF1 and OF2 for
    the initial population and the Pareto Front after optimization process for the
    test dataset. After optimization process, OF2 improved much more (from a range
    of 18.8–88.7 % to 1.1–7.2 %) than OF1 (from 3.2 % to 97.1 %), although the amplitude
    of OF1 range was considerably reduced. When the input variables of a forecasting
    model are temporally correlated (as in this work where even the variable to be
    forecasted also appears as input variable of the hybrid model), its R2 value is
    usually high,. Consequently, the maximum OF1 value in the initial population is
    not much worse than the maximum OF1 value of the Pareto front. However, its accuracy
    is improved considerably. The difference in the values of both objective functions
    was very narrow for all individuals of the Pareto front (particularly in the range
    of 1–3 % for OF2). Consequently, the absolute density of the forecasting model
    (number of total forecasting model parameters) was also considered as a selection
    criterion in this work. Thus, Fig. 8 shows the selected forecasting model as optimal
    IWD forecasting model. Fig. 9 shows the histogram of the values of the decision
    variables (Nenc, Ndec, dmodel, nheads and ndff) for the initial population (Fig.
    9a) and the Pareto front (Fig. 9b). The number of encoder and decoder layers in
    the forecasting model was controlled by the first gen (gen1) of the individual
    (or chromosome), whose values ranged from 1 to 6 (Table 1). The random generation
    of the initial population based on a uniform distribution for each of its genes
    led to the same occurrence probability for all values of each decision space.
    Thus, the frequency of the number of Nenc and Ndec were similar (Fig. 9a). After
    optimization process, two encoder and decoder layers were enough for most of the
    individual at the Pareto front (45 over 50 individuals) to achieve optimal values
    in their objective functions. Similarly, dmodel, nheads and ndff reach uniform
    occurrence frequency in the initial population but they evolved differently during
    the optimization process. dmodel, controlled by gen2, which defines the length
    of the transformation space of the input values to the encoder and the decoder
    (Fig. 7) tended to obtain average values according to its potential range (from
    1 to 260). Thus, most individuals (42 over 50 individuals) of the Pareto from
    took a dmodel which ranged from 90 to 94 and only 4 individuals had a dmodel values
    between 110 and 117. Therefore, the forecasting model did not need to have a very
    dense input transformation space to be able to interpret such input data. Similarly,
    most individuals of the Pareto front (43 over 50 individuals) took a value of
    the number of heads (nheads) of the attention mechanisms, defined by gen3, of
    7 heads (values could range from 1 to 13). Four forecasting models of the Pareto
    front needed 8 attention heads and 3 needed 9 attention heads to optimize their
    objective functions. However, the behaviour of the ndff values which is defined
    by the gen4 was different. The ndff value in 35 over 50 individuals of the Pareto
    front ranged from 725 to 770. This gene controls the density (number of neurons)
    of the feedforward network (FFN) both encoder and decoder layers. So, the output
    interpretation space of the encoder and decoder layers need to be much denser
    than the corresponding input space. Although these values are very close to the
    upper limit stablished for this gene (upper limit of 800) (Table 1), no individual
    reached this limit. If a considerable number of individuals in the Pareto front
    had reached this upper limit, it would have indicated that the potential range
    of this gene was not rightly stablished Hence, a tuning of this range and a new
    optimization process would have been required. Download : Download high-res image

    by the decision variables in the initial population (a) and the Pareto front (b)
    of the optimization process. According to results shown in Fig. 9, the optimal
    model has to forecast a time series of IWD at real ID spatial scale and middle
    term temporal scale (7 days ahead). This is a complex task, considering the uncertainty
    associated with the decisions that each farmer makes every day on his farm and
    the aggregation of all farmers’ behaviour at ID level. Consequently, all the optimal
    forecasting models of the Pareto front were rather dense with more than one million
    of parameters in each of them. This fact gives an idea of the complexity of the
    problem to be solved, especially in comparison with the models shown in the introduction
    which only several thousands of parameters. 3.2. Optimal IWD forecasting model
    The election of the optimal forecasting model from a Pareto front (Fig. 8) when
    its objective functions are opposite usually does not have a single and direct
    solution. Typically, a deep discussion between those models that obtain better
    OF1 and OF2 values are necessary. In these scenarios, a balance between representativeness
    and accuracy must be discussed (high accuracy at the cost of covering fewer scenarios,
    i.e., less representativeness or vice versa). However, the Pareto front of the
    Fig. 8 shows a very narrow amplitude for both objective functions. At equal forecasting
    capacity, a less dense forecasting model is also less able to learn new events,
    but it is more robust and less sensitive to failures (and more stable, computationally
    fast, …). All forecasting models of the Pareto front shown high adaptability and
    generalization. Consequently, the absolute density of the model was used as a
    third and differentiating criterion of selecting the optimal model. Thus, the
    selected optimal irrigation water demand forecasting model (highlighted in Fig.
    8) showed a total number of parameters of 1.75 million when the mean number of
    parameters in the Pareto front was 2.03 million parameters with a standard deviation
    of 0.422 million parameters. The optimal model selected in this work was only
    16.7 % denser than the one developed in González Perea et al. (2023), but its
    representativeness is a 6.1 % higher with an improvement in forecasting accuracy
    of 89.8 %. The number of encoder layers and decoder layers of the selected optimal
    model was 2 with a density of the transformation space of the input data of 118
    (Table 2). The optimal model needed 9 attention heads and a ndff value of 335.
    This forecasting model architecture had 670,394 parameters in the encoder layer,
    1,078,255 parameters in the decoder layer and 117 parameters in the last dense
    layer. Thus, the total number of parameters for this forecasting model was 1748768.
    The average values for OF1 and OF2, i.e., R2 and SEP were 99.9 % and 2.10 %, respectively
    (Table 2). With these average values of representativeness and accuracy, Fig.
    10 shows the relationship between the observed irrigation water demand (actual
    irrigation water demand) and the forecasted irrigation water demand for each of
    the forecasting days (from t − 1 to t + 7) provided by the selected optimal forecasting
    water demand model. In this figure, the SEP values for each forecast day and the
    density distribution of the test dataset is also shown. The density distribution
    of the test dataset shows how the highest concentration of the daily water irrigation
    records occurred at low irrigation water volumesThus, the forecasting model performed
    better for these low values, due to the greater availability of irrigation water
    demand information. A second peak in the density distribution was found for values
    around 105 m3. This region generally corresponds to the months of highest irrigation
    water demand of the irrigation distribution network. Daily irrigation wate values
    around 1.5·105 m3 are very rare, but important enough to be learned be the forecasting
    model. These values are not outliers (outliers were initially pre-processed) but
    less frequent values that correspond to short periods of high daily water demand
    (high temperatures or high wind chill, higher concentration of many crops, etc.).
    To highlight the performance of the forecasting model under running conditions
    (not in its training mode), Fig. 11 shows the daily water demand forecasting (from
    t + 1 to t + 7) at four different randomly selected days of the test dataset (2016-03-19;
    2020-07-07; 2021-09-15 and 2022-05-28). This figure also shows the whole daily

    The main feature of TNN based forecasting models is their attention mechanisms
    where all the inputs to the forecasting model are processed in parallel creating
    attention structures that focus on finding different relationships between the
    model inputs (Self-Attention encoder), between model outputs (Self-Attention Decoder)
    and between input–output model (Encoder-Decoder Attention). These multi-attention
    mechanisms in TNNs-based forecasting models and their parallel processing make
    them highly accurate in time series forecasting problems, like how humans process
    information. These attention mechanisms created during the training phase are
    used by these forecasting models to make inference, in this work, the forecasting
    of the daily irrigation water demand seven days ahead. Consequently, attention
    mechanisms provide very valuable knowledge to understand the real behaviour of
    any ID (in this case the CZID) in different periods of the irrigation season.
    Thus, the internal analysis of the forecasting model (focused on the multi-head
    attention region) and the discussion on the care mechanisms created and how they
    are activated depending on the period of the irrigation season are essential to
    extract useful information on the real behaviour of the CZID. For this reason,
    Fig. 12, Fig. 13, Fig. 14, Fig. 15 show the representation of the nine attention
    heads that made up the attention mechanisms of the optimal forecasting model during
    inference for the four randomly selected periods of the irrigation season, 2016-03-19,
    2020-07-07, 2021-09-15 and 2022-05-28, respectively. As the four figures show,
    the attention that the forecasting model pays to each input variable (IWD, Tave,
    Rad and ETo from t-1 to t-7) with respect to the 7-days IWD forecasting (from
    t + 1 to t + 7) changes throughout the irrigation season (e.g. the attention at
    the beginning of the irrigation season in March (Fig. 12) is not the same as for
    the month of May (Fig. 15)). Each of the nine attention heads in the IWD forecasting
    model paid attention to different areas of the input–output space. Heads number
    1, 3, 4 and 6 tended to focus their attention on the Rad (almost all the time
    series) variable and some previous days of IWD and ETo. This attention was kept
    for all the inference days, and was constant for the whole time series of the
    daily irrigation water demand. Download : Download high-res image (370KB) Download

    8 and 9 tended to focus their attention on the more distant records of IWD, on
    the Tave and part of the ETo. In these heads, ETo variable had more weight (more
    attention) in all inference days mainly on days with low attention to IWD variable
    (Fig. 12). That is, here again the combination of farmer’s wind chill (with ETo
    variable and Tave) with his or her ‘habit’ in terms of irrigation application
    (IWD records) can be observed as González Perea et al., 2023, González Perea et
    al., 2015 concluded. Heads 2 and 5 are responsible for paying attention to more
    specific areas of the input time series depending on the forecasted day (t + x).
    At the end of the irrigation season (Fig. 14), these two heads focused on the
    t-2 day on IWD, Tave and ETo for inference the term t + 3, t + 4 of irrigation
    water demand while for larger terms such as t + 5, t + 6 and t + 7 the model focused
    on Rad variable and some records of IWD and t-3 and t-6 of ETo. In this period
    of the irrigation season, probably because of fewer water-demanding crops, the
    attention heads are more specific depending on the day to be forecasted (t + x).
    On the contrary, in the period of the maximum irrigation needs in the CZID (Fig.
    13, Fig. 15) all attention heads focused their attention mostly on previous IWD
    records and again large-scale (ID average) wind chill. Here, an overall temporal
    trend prevails over the individual behaviour of each farmer. That is, the effect
    of the ‘habit’ of each farmer is diluted (because of the large number of simultaneous
    farmers applying irrigation water) in a general ID behaviour. In mathematical
    terms, it could be said that the mean predominates over the variance. 4. Conclusions
    The development of new tools that, without restricting the freedom of farmer in
    terms of irrigation scheduling, make it possible to know in advance the ID’s behaviour
    for its subsequent optimization is essential even more under water scarcity and
    energy dependency scenarios. AI and more specifically deep learning with ability
    to develop forecasting models that learn from real information from each ID can
    be powerful tool to know the behaviour of the ID in advance. Thus, in this work,
    a novel methodology to develop a forecasting model to know in advance (7 days
    ahead) the irrigation water demanded by a real ID has been proposed. The developed
    forecasting model was tested in a real ID (CZID). The new developed model based
    on TNNs and optimized by NSGA-II improves the representativeness and accuracy
    of the best previously developed model by 6.1 % and 89.8 %, respectively. The
    right hyperparameters optimization of the IWD forecasting model (carried out by
    the NSGA-II) was key to achieve an adequate generalization of the forecasting
    model. In addition, the analysis of the initial population of the optimization
    process and the Pareto front showed that when input (previous IWD, Tave, Rad and
    ETo) and output (IWD) variables are temporally correlated, the accuracy of the
    forecasting model depended even more on the right choice of the model architecture.
    Thus, with 1.75 million of parameters (only a 16.7 % denser than previous works)
    the developed IWD forecasting model was able to forecast the 99.9 % of the scenarios
    with an average accuracy of 2.10 %. Finally, the number of heads of the developed
    forecasting model was 9. The multi-head attention mechanism provides useful information
    on the actual irrigation behaviour of the ID. The attention that the forecasting
    model pays to each input variable respect to the 7-days IWD forecast changes and
    it is automatically adapted throughout the irrigation season. Thus, this model
    can be very useful for managers since it offers accurate forecasting of daily
    irrigation water demand for 7 days ahead, which plays an essential role for water
    management and energy contracting in irrigation districts considering current
    and expected scenarios of water scarcity and high energy prices. CRediT authorship

    GA Genetic Algorithm LES Large Eddy Simulation 1. Introduction The main fire suppression
    mechanism of sprinklers is to cool the fuel surface to reduce the pyrolysis rate
    [1]. To deliver the water to the fuel surface, the fire sprinklers form a spray
    with low supply pressure. The deflector is used to obtain the proper size of droplets
    with low supply pressure. The water flows out through the orifice and it impinges
    on the deflector. The liquid film is formed in both vertical and horizontal directions
    after impingement on the deflector [2]. This liquid film is atomized into ligaments
    and droplets [3]. Due to this process, the liquid droplets are difficult to be
    fed directly into the area just below the conventional pendent-type sprinkler
    heads. Also, the large droplets penetrate farther than small droplets because
    the large momentum is advantageous in overcoming drag. For this reason, generally,
    the large droplets are supplied to the region farther from the sprinkler head
    and the small droplets are supplied to the region close to the sprinkler head.
    This is one of the reasons for the uneven distribution of droplet size and water
    flux on the floor. The uneven water flux on the floor affects the burning rate
    of solid combustibles, depending on the relative location between the sprinkler
    head and the solid combustibles. Also, the uneven droplet size affects the ability
    of water droplets to feed solid combustibles because the actual water-supplying
    performance is determined by the relative magnitude of the droplet''s inertial
    force and the fire plume''s buoyancy force. For this reason, the distribution
    of water flux and droplet size should be investigated to design an improved sprinkler
    head. To investigate water distribution, water distribution measurement experiments
    using water collection devices are commonly performed. Link et al. [4] investigated
    the effects of measuring grid size on experimental errors. The resolution error
    decreased as the collection resolution decreased, however, the repeatability error
    increased. It was concluded that the collection bin length smaller than 0.04 times
    the spray reach is appropriate to resolve the water flux variations. Lundberg
    [5] compared the water fluxes measured by a laser-based shadow imaging technique
    with the data obtained from experiments using a patternator. The total water flow
    rate calculated from the patternator experiment showed more similar results to
    supplied water flow rate than the shadow imaging results. Therefore, the patternator
    experiment is very simple yet a good evaluation tool for investigating the water
    distribution at the floor level. For this reason, it is used as validation data
    when developing new computational models. For example, the Reduced Order Model
    which is developed by Valencia et al. [6] and improved by Valencia and Marshall
    [7] was validated using the patternator experimental data. Uneven distribution
    of droplet size and water flux has been studied experimentally. Ren et al. [8]
    investigated the effects of the deflector on the radial distribution of droplet
    size and water flux. Droplet size was measured by Malvern Instruments Spraytec
    Particle Analyzer, and water flux was measured using a patternator in tine and
    slot directions. When the deflector with tines and slots was used, the water flux
    near the center increased compared to the sprinkler head with the disk. However,
    the droplet size was not affected by an orifice or deflector type and increased
    with increasing radial distance. Zhou et al. [9] analyzed the distribution of
    water flux and droplet size in both radial and azimuthal directions. Both water
    flux and droplet size were strongly affected by the azimuthal angle. Meanwhile,
    in their study, the water flux and droplet size increased with increasing radial
    distance from the sprinkler head. A trend inconsistent with the water flux measured
    by Ren et al. may be due to the sprinkler head geometry. However, detailed sprinkler
    geometry was not described in the study of Zhou et al., making it difficult to
    analyze the cause of this inconsistency. Despite these previous studies, the general
    relationship between the parameters of sprinkler head geometry, such as the location
    of tines and slots, in commercial sprinkler head geometry, and the water droplet
    distribution has not yet been identified. In addition to the basic research on
    sprinkler head design, there was an attempt to optimize the sprinkler geometry
    for foam fire suppression systems. Andrei and Alexey [10] optimized the sprinkler
    head design for foam fire suppression systems to increase the foam expansion rate.
    Various designs of the frame arm and the deflector were manufactured with Fused
    Deposition Modeling technology of 3D printing. By applying the experimental results
    to the full factorial experiment method, a model was developed to predict the
    foam expansion rate value depending on the sprinkler geometry parameters, and
    optimal sprinkler geometry was derived from this model. The optimization process
    can be automated by simulation integrated with optimization algorithms and it
    has been applied to spray-related optimization problems, such as injection direction
    [11] and spraying strategies [12]. Also, it is widely used in engineering fields
    to find the optimal control strategy [13] and the hardware geometry [14,15] because
    the Genetic Algorithm (GA) has good applicability in various fields. The evaluation
    of sprinkler spray under fire is essential because of fire-spray interaction.
    Harish and Venkatasubbaiah [16] investigated the interaction between water spray
    and fire plume in dual chambers connected to a tall shaft. The water spray reduced
    the ceiling vent discharge rate because the momentum direction of water droplets
    was opposed to the direction of the smoke buoyancy force. Lee [17] observed the
    fire displacement by using numerical analysis, which is the same phenomenon as
    the experiment conducted by Xiao et al. [18]. Lee and Moon [19] carried out a
    numerical analysis to investigate the effect of horizontal distance between a
    water mist nozzle and the fire and it was found that the fire suppression time
    is a power function of the normalized distance between the water mist nozzle and
    the fire. In this study, the boss and deflector design was optimized to improve
    the uniformity of droplet size and water flux at the floor level in a radial direction
    over the region the spray reaches using a micro-Genetic Algorithm (μGA). The data
    obtained during the optimization process were correlated with optimization targets
    and the effects of the design on optimization targets were investigated. The optimization
    process consists of two steps. Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) and OpenFOAM were
    utilized for each step. The first step optimizes the injection pattern at a distance
    of 5 cm from the center and the second step elicits the design that produces the
    injection pattern derived from the first step. The optimized results in this study
    were derived at a fixed flow rate and non-fire conditions. Therefore, caution
    is needed when applying the results to conditions other than those of this study.
    Additionally, it is desirable to gain intuition about designing sprinkler head,
    rather than directly applying the results of this study. 2. Methodology and simulation
    conditions In this section, the numerical methods and simulation settings used
    in this study are described. The first section describes the overall structure
    of this study and optimization methods such as constraints and objective function.
    Numerical models such as the Lagrangian spray model, combustion model, and Volume
    of Fluid (VoF) model are discussed in the second section. The third section describes
    the computational settings such as initial and boundary conditions, mesh, and
    domain size. For automated optimization, all results were obtained through the
    simulation rather than experiment. 2.1. Optimization method The μGA was adopted
    for the optimization process. The Genetic Algorithm (GA) is useful when the optimization
    problem contains many variables and is complex. The μGA can be used with a small
    number of populations (a subset of solutions in each generation) [20]. For this
    reason, it is useful for the optimization problems that should be solved with
    Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations with large computational costs,
    compared to GA which utilizes more populations than μGA. A detailed explanation
    of μGA is provided in a previous study [20]. There are two ways to analyze sprays
    using CFD: Eulerian approach and Lagrangian approach. The Eulerian approach analyzes
    the liquid phase distribution by solving the transport equation for the volume
    fraction of the phase together with the continuity and momentum equations. This
    approach can reflect the influence of sprinkler geometry on spray formation. However,
    it requires a relatively small mesh size. The Largrangian approach utilizes the
    concept of parcels and can be used with a coarser grid compared to the Eulerian
    approach. However, this approach can''t reflect the effects of the sprinkler head
    geometry on spray. For these reason, an optimized deflector design was derived
    by two-step optimization. The overall optimization and analysis process of this
    study is shown in Fig. 1. The first step is to optimize the injection pattern
    at a radial distance of 5 cm from the center of the sprinkler head by evaluating
    the uniformity of droplet size and water flux on the floor. The first optimization
    step was performed with FDS (Lagrangian approach) because it is widely used in
    fire simulations. An optimized injection pattern derived from the first optimization
    step was used as a target for the second optimization step. In the second step,
    the deflector and boss design that produces the optimized injection pattern was
    derived. The second optimization step was conducted with OpenFOAM (Eulerian approach)
    because FDS can''t predict two-phase flows in the Eulerian approach. This two-step
    approach allows the effects of sprinkler head geometry changes to be calculated
    within a feasible computational time. Download : Download high-res image (767KB)

    2.1.1. The first optimization step In this study, the conventional pendent sprinkler
    head was considered. To simplify the problem, the effect of the frame arm on the
    injection pattern was neglected. The frame arm affects the water flux distribution
    of the sprinkler sprays by deteriorating the uniformity. However, basically the
    droplet formation and water flux distribution are caused by the boss and deflector
    designs. Therefore, this study was conducted as a primary step in a sprinkler
    head design, and the frame arm was neglected. There have been attempts to resolve
    the initial spray, which is an input condition for a sprinkler''s spray analysis,
    by reflecting the actual distributions of droplet size and droplet velocity [[21],
    [22], [23]]. Additionally, there was an attempt to reproduce the experimentally
    obtained water flux distribution using a Lagrangian approach, and the experimentally
    obtained water flux distribution was successfully reproduced [24]. However, these
    methods are complex to be adopted in the optimization process in which a variety
    of injection patterns should be considered. Also, the initial injection pattern
    is difficult to be determined because it changes depending on the sprinkler geometry
    and the spray conditions [25]. However, in previous study [26], it was found that
    the vertical water film was formed at the slot stream and the horizontal water
    film was formed at the tine stream near the sprinkler head. So, the injection
    pattern was assumed to be in the form of an appositive part of a sine function
    with droplet size and velocity uniformly distributed within the injecting area.
    The injected parcels were distributed in the region between the two sine functions.
    The region where parcels were supplied is illustrated in Fig. 2. The sine function
    at the top is denoted by fmax and that at the bottom is denoted by fmin. These
    two functions are expressed as follows: (1) (2) (3) (4) Download : Download high-res

    along the circumferential direction of the deflector, is the amplitude of the

    Their meanings are shown in Fig. 2. The range and steps for each optimization
    parameter are summarized in Table 1. The maximum and minimum values of optimization
    parameters are chosen by considering the feasibility of the sprinkler head design
    and the previous test results. For example, the minimum value of the optimization
    parameter is set to four because it is unfeasible when the deflector consisted
    of 3 or fewer tines. Also, the maximum value of the optimization parameter N is
    set to 36 because it is too fine to be manufactured. While changing the injection
    pattern, spray properties such as droplet diameter and velocity were kept constant.

    information such as droplet size, droplet velocity, and the number of droplets
    was calculated on a sphere with a radius of 0.05 m in the same approach as the
    PDPA experiment. The data acquisition locations were set at 0.1 m above the floor
    at 0.1 m intervals over the entire domain. From these data acquisition, the region
    reaching the sprinkler spray was divided in a radial direction. The average droplet
    size and water flux for each radial section are calculated as follows, based on
    the average droplet diameter calculated in each local data acquisition volume:
    (5) (6) Here, is the average droplet diameter calculated in the local data acquisition
    volume, is the number of droplets, is the density of water, is the average droplet
    velocity in the vertical direction calculated at the local data acquisition volume,
    is the number of data acquisition locations in each radial section, is the volume
    of data acquisition probe, and subscript means the value for each radial section
    . The average droplet size and water flux of the average value of radial distribution
    are simply calculated as the arithmetic mean of the values in each radial section.
    (7) (8) Here, is the number of radial sections, and in this study, 20 was selected.
    Standard deviations can be calculated using equations (5), (6), (7), (8) and used
    for the objective function. (9) Here, is the spread area of the spray, and are
    the standard deviations of droplet size and water flux for each radial section,
    and are the standard deviations of droplet size and water flux calculated by sampling
    the average value of each radial section. Every value has a different range, so
    it was compared against each reference value. The direction of the optimization
    is determined by the objective function. In the first optimization step, optimization
    was conducted to maximize the objective function. The droplet size and water flux
    calculated by sampling the average value of the radial section must have a low
    standard deviation to increase uniformity, whereas those calculated for each radial
    section must have a higher standard deviation to ensure that the various droplet
    sizes and water fluxes exist in each radial section. The objective function was
    constructed by considering these conditions. The meaning of each component in
    the objective function is summarized in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image

    function for the first optimization step. Ten populations were used in optimization:
    two random generator seeds were used and eight populations were generated by the
    GA algorithm during the optimization. Two random generator seeds were used for
    each generation to avoid falling into local optimizations. The initial population
    consisted of one reference injection pattern calculated from a commercial sprinkler
    head and nine randomly generated populations. When the maximum objective function
    value was maintained for 100 generations, the optimization process was stopped
    and judged to be the optimal solution. 2.1.2. The second optimization step The
    second optimization step finds the sprinkler head design that generates an optimized
    injection pattern derived in the first optimization step. To simplify the problem,
    the effects of the frame arm were neglected as in the first optimization step.
    Also, the sector of the sprinkler head was analyzed to reduce computational costs.
    Fig. 4 shows the shape of the sprinkler head viewed on top and the optimization
    parameters in the second optimization step. The sprinkler head consists of tines,
    slots, and a boss. The radius of the boss at the bottom was fixed and that at
    the top (rboss) was chosen as an optimization parameter. The distance between
    the sprinkler head center and center of a circle consisting of slot (A), the radius
    of a circle consisting of slot (B), the distance between the ends of the circle
    making up the tine and slot (C), and the angle of the circular part of the slot
    (θ1) are chosen to be optimization parameters. By reducing the angle θ1 within
    the feasible geometries, the deflector will have a shallow slot design. By increasing
    the angle θ1 up to 90° within the feasible geometries, the deflector can have
    shallow or deep slots depending on the length of C. The maximum and minimum values
    of optimization parameters and their steps are summarized in Table 2. The other
    factors consisting of sprinkler geometry can be derived with optimization parameters

    sector angle (2θ2) were fixed to 0.001 m, 0.007 m, and 2π/N which is derived from
    the first optimization step. To avoid evaluating the unfeasible design, four constraints
    were adopted. For brevity, detailed derivations of the equations were omitted.
    It can be derived through geometry. The first and second constraints prevent the
    distance between the slot and the boss not to close and are calculated as follows:
    (12) (13) The coordinate of the point where the circular part of the tine meets
    line C should be within the sector boundary. From this, the third constraint was
    formulated as follows: (14) The deflector size must be much less than the injection
    pattern data acquisition location (r = 5 cm). To satisfy this, the fourth constraint
    was formulated as follows: (15) The amount of consistency with the optimized injection
    pattern should be evaluated for optimization. By neglecting the region where the
    water volume fraction is less than 0.01, the objective function for the second
    optimization step is calculated as follows: (16) (17) Here, is Euclidean norm,
    is Hadamar product, is the average of elements, and returns the vector consisting
    of greater and lower elements of the vector for each, is a vector consisting of
    one, is a vector consisting of time-averaged water volume fraction for 0.02s,
    the vector consists of components and it means the normalized minimum distance
    between the data acquisition point and optimized injection pattern. The size of
    all the vectors is equal to the number of points in the data acquisition plane.
    The lower the objective function value, the more the injection pattern produced
    by the sprinkler head design is consistent with the optimized injection pattern.
    The first Euclidean norm calculates a smaller value when the water is distributed
    near the optimized injection pattern. In preliminary testing, the objective function
    consisting of only the first Euclidean norm showed zero when no water is delivered
    to the data acquisition plane and determined a wrong optimization solution. To
    avoid this problem, the average volume fraction of the water was added to the
    denominator. Also, there was a problem where water was delivered to only a portion
    of the optimized injection pattern. To avoid this, the objective function includes
    the second Euclidean norm that represents a smaller value when the water is dispersed.
    Ten populations with two random generator seeds were used for the second optimization
    step as same as the first optimization step. The other eight populations were
    generated by the GA algorithm during the optimization. The initial population
    consists of one reference sprinkler shape which is calculated from a commercial
    sprinkler head and nine randomly generated shapes. When the minimum objective
    function value is maintained for 50 generations, the optimization process was
    stopped because it took a lot of computational costs. 2.2. Numerical models In
    this study, the first optimization step was conducted with Lagrangian spray modeling,
    and the second optimization step was conducted with Eulerian spray modeling. The
    numerical models used in each step are described in this section. 2.2.1. Numerical
    models for the first optimization step The first optimization step utilizes FDS
    version 6.7.5. In FDS, Deardorff''s [27] Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model is
    used with Van Driest damping [28] for turbulence modeling. Lagrangian spray modeling
    requires the interaction between Lagrangian particles (droplets) and Eulerian
    fluid flow (air). The drag force acting on spray particles reduces the maximum
    distance that droplets travel. Also, the penetrating of droplets through air induces
    the flow. The momentum transferred from particles to gas is calculated as follows:
    (18) Here, is the cell volume, is the gas density, is the drag coefficient, is
    the cross-sectional area of the droplet, is the droplet velocity vector, is the
    gas velocity vector, and is the mass of droplet. The second term means the momentum
    transfer by the evaporation of the droplet. Droplet velocity is also affected
    by the drag force and is determined by the following equation: (19) Here, is the
    gravitational acceleration vector. The drag coefficient for a spherical droplet
    is expressed by the droplet Reynolds number. (20) 2.2.2. Numerical models for
    the second optimization step The second optimization step was performed by OpenFOAM-v2006.
    When the initial spray is analyzed with VoF model, the VoF model is generally
    integrated with LES turbulence model [26,29,30]. This is to properly capture the
    atomization process caused by unstable wave growth at the liquid-gas interface.
    However, in this simulation, the time-averaged injection pattern was focused,
    therefore Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) based model was used for turbulence
    modeling. The SST k-ω switches from the k-ε model to the k-ω model depending on
    the distance from the wall [31]. It is appropriate to analyze both the water on
    the deflector and the spray formed by the sprinkler head. For this reason, it
    was adopted in this study. To analyze the liquid (water) and gas (air) phases,
    the VoF model should be used. It solves the additional liquid volume fraction
    transport equation: (21) Here, is the volume fraction of water, is the velocity
    in direction. The fluid properties, such as the density and the viscosity of fluid
    cell is defined by (22) (23) Here, and are the density and the viscosity of computational
    cell, and are the densities of water and air, and are the viscosities of water
    and the air. In this study, the densities of water and air were set to 998.3 kg/m3
    and 1.277 kg/m3, respectively, and the viscosities of water and air were set to
    1.00149 × 10−3 Pa∙s and 1.71105 × 10−5 Pa∙s, respectively. When the water volume
    fraction of the cell is between 0 and 1, surface tension force should be considered
    for that cell. The surface tension force was modeled by the continuum surface
    force (CSF) model [32]. The surface tension force is calculated by (24) (25) (26)
    Here, is surface tension, and is the curvature of the water-air interface. In
    this study, 0.07288 N/m was used for the surface tension of water. To suppress
    the diffusion of water volume fraction, the IsoAdvector method [33] was used in
    this study. 2.3. Computational set-up This chapter is divided into two sections.
    As in section 2.2, the first section describes the computational set-up for the
    first optimization step and the second section describes that for the second optimization
    step. 2.3.1. Computational set-up for the first optimization step A computational
    domain with a height of 3 m was used. To include all supplied sprinkler sprays,
    the distance from the sprinkler head to the domain boundary was set to 7.5 m.
    The symmetric boundary condition was used to reduce the computational costs. The
    floor was set to a wall and the side and ceiling were set to open boundary conditions.
    The computational domain and boundary conditions are shown in Fig. 5. The domain
    was divided by mesh sizes of 0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 m to investigate the mesh size
    dependency. This size of mesh generated 21.6 million, 2.7 million, and 337,500
    cells. Download : Download high-res image (687KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 5. Computational domain for the first optimization step: (a) domain
    dimension and (b) the example parcel image from the simulation for reference injection
    pattern. The sprinkler head considered in this study has an orifice diameter of
    0.0103 m and a K factor of 80 lpm/bar0.5. The initial injection pattern was set
    at 0.05 m from the center of the sprinkler head. A volume median diameter (Dv50)
    of 0.001 m was used as the initial condition for sprinkler spray [34,35]. A size
    distribution under Dv50 has a lognormal distribution and a size distribution above
    Dv50 has a rosin-rammler distribution. All the coefficients describing the droplet
    size distribution were set as the default values of FDS [36]. The initial droplet
    velocity was derived from Bernoulli''s equation, assuming the supplying pressure
    of 0.1 MPa corresponding to the minimum required pressure in South Korea [37].
    Although the optimization was performed at a fixed supply pressure, the optimized
    design will still be valid even if the supply pressure changes, as the overall
    water flux distribution pattern is known to be maintained even when the supply
    pressure changes [24]. However, when the K-factor changes, the nozzle diameter
    changes and the relative position between the nozzle and the boss-deflector assembly
    changes. For this reason, the optimized design will only be valid for a K-factor
    of 80 LPM/(0.1 MPa)0.5, which is the value used in this study. Injection patterns
    generated with the optimization parameters were discretized at 2° intervals. The
    flow rate flowing through the tines and slots is not evenly distributed and depends
    on the sprinkler head design. However, to the best of the author''s knowledge,
    there is no known relationship between the flow rate ratio distributed across
    the tines and slots and the injection pattern (or the sprinkler head design).
    For this reason, the flow rate was assumed to be evenly distributed along the
    azimuth. The effect of the number of parcels introduced in seconds was investigated
    and it was set to 2500, 5000, 10,000, and 20,000 parcels per second. The simulation
    time was 1 min and the result data was averaged over the last 30 s. A normalized
    radial coordinate was used for analysis. The maximum droplet reaches without drag
    was introduced by Prahl and Wendt [38] and calculated by (27) Here, is the initial
    radial velocity, is the initial vertical velocity, is the vertical distance between
    the sprinkler head and data acquisition location, and is the gravitational acceleration.
    The radial distance was divided by the maximum droplet reach for normalizing (
    ) when the spray data was analyzed. 2.3.2. Computational set-up for the second
    optimization step The sector mesh was used to reduce the computational time. The
    sector angle was derived from the first optimization step. Fig. 6 shows the computational
    domain for the second optimization step. The radial size of the domain was set
    to 0.075 m because the data acquisition surface is located at a radial distance
    of 0.05 m. The atomization is known to occur in the region corresponding to a
    radius of 0.1–0.4 m from the sprinkler head [39]. However, the atomization process
    is beyond the scope of this study, and a domain size of 0.075 m is sufficient
    to investigate the time-averaged water flow near the sprinkler head. The orifice
    dimension and the vertical location of the deflector were calculated from the
    commercial sprinkler. A mesh size of 0.0005 m was used near the deflector and
    that of 0.001 m was used far from the deflector. The total number of cells depends
    on the deflector and boss designs as the meshes are automatically generated during
    the optimization to evaluate the deflector and boss designs. The number of cells
    for the reference case was 600,000 cells. For the analysis after optimization,
    the same simulation was conducted with half the mesh size used in optimization.
    The inlet pressure was increased to 0.1 MPa for 0.01 s for numerical stability
    and then set to constant pressure. The top surface was set to a wall, bottom and
    outer surfaces were set to constant total pressure boundary conditions. The side
    surfaces were set to periodic boundary conditions. The mesh was generated automatically
    during the optimization process with the settings described above. The simulation
    was performed for 0.03 s, which was sufficient time to see the steady flow. The
    water volume fraction at the data acquisition surface was averaged for 0.02 s.
    The data acquisition points on the data acquisition surface were set at intervals
    of 1° in the azimuth direction and 1 mm in the vertical direction. Download :

    domain for the second optimization step. 3. Results and discussion This section
    is divided into four parts. The results from the first optimization step and its
    evaluation are described in the first to third parts and the results of the second
    optimization step are described in the last part. The determination of simulation
    settings is discussed in the first part. Using the simulation settings discussed
    in the first part, the injection pattern was optimized in non-fire conditions,
    which is discussed in the second part. Finally, the third part deals with the
    difference between the reference and optimized deflector designs. 3.1. Determination
    of simulation settings Before the optimization process, the effects of mesh size
    and the number of parcels introduced into the domain per second on results were
    studied. Fig. 7 shows the average and standard deviation values of droplet diameter
    and particle flux and spread area depending on the mesh size and the number of
    parcels. Looking at the results based on the number of parcels introduced into
    the domain, in the case of 2500 parcels per second, the results showed noticeably
    different results at a mesh size of 0.025 m. However, there was no significant
    difference depending on the mesh size considered in this simulation except for
    the case mentioned above. Also, it was found that the effect of the number of
    parcels per second was not sensitive to the fire suppression characteristics [17].
    Therefore, a mesh size of 0.1 m with 5000 parcels per second was adopted to reduce
    the computational time for optimization. The results for this setting are compared
    with the results from the case in which the mesh size is 0.025 m and the number
    of parcels per second is 10,000. This is because this condition has the highest
    resolution among the tested cases and the errors with the neighboring conditions
    (condition 1: mesh size—0.05 m (changed), number of parcels per second—10,000
    (maintained) and condition 2: mesh size—0.025 m (maintained), number of parcels
    per second—5000 (changed)) for average droplet size, average water flux, and spread
    area were kept under 2 %. The highest error was 11.8 % for the standard deviation
    of droplet size. It was determined to be an acceptable error for optimization.

    Fig. 7. Spray characteristics for various mesh sizes and the number of parcels:
    (a) average droplet diameter, (b) average water flux, and (c) spread area. Using
    the determined simulation settings, droplet diameters depending on the radial
    location were compared with previous experimental data by Ren et al. [8] (Fig.
    8). In their study, the sprinkler of which orifice diameter of 19.5 mm and K factor
    of 25.9 lpm/bar0.5 was used with injection pressure between 0.69 and 2.76 bar.
    This operating condition and the orifice dimension differ from this study, however,
    it is suggested that the drop size over normalized radial distance is independent
    of nozzle size and the injection pressure [8]. For this reason, the drop size
    calculated in this study was compared with the experimental data by Ren et al.
    [8]. Although it was calculated for different shapes of sprinkler heads, droplet
    size depending on the normalized radial location predicted by simulation showed
    similar results to the experiment. After the normalized radial distance of 0.6,
    the simulation showed a much larger droplet size than the experiment. In the study
    of Ren et al. [8], the tendency for drop size to increase with increasing normalized
    radial distance was not continued after the normalized radial distance of 0.6
    because Dv50 greater than 0.8 mm couldn''t be measured with their Malvern instrument.
    This could be one of the possible reasons for the large differences in the region
    with normalized radial distances greater than 0.6. From the dependency study of
    mesh size and the number of parcels, and the comparison with experimentally measured
    droplet radii for the normalized radial location, the mesh size was determined
    to be 0.1 m, and the number of parcels introduced into the domain per second was
    set to 10,000. Considering the size of the mesh, variables required to calculate
    the objective function (droplet diameter, droplet velocity, number density of
    droplets) was obtained at a height of 0.1 m from the floor and at intervals of
    0.1 m in the horizontal plane. Download : Download high-res image (276KB) Download

    conditions Fig. 9 shows the history of the maximum objective function value and
    components consisting of the objective function. The optimized injection pattern
    was generated at the 130th generation. During the optimization, the sum of the
    standard deviation for droplet size (ΣσD30,i) increased dramatically. This means
    that the diversity of the droplet size in each radial section increased. Also,
    the standard deviation of average droplet size in the radial direction (σD30,r)
    decreased significantly. This is important because a variety of droplet sizes
    in each radial section with similar average droplet sizes in each radial section
    means that the droplets with various sizes are distributed evenly in the radial
    direction, and similar fire suppression performance could be achieved in the radial
    direction. The other components consisting of the objective function such as the
    sum of the standard deviation for water flux in each radial section, the standard
    deviation of average water flux in the radial direction, and the spread area improved
    compared to the reference design. However, the degree of improvement was less
    than that of the standard deviations for droplet size. Download : Download high-res

    From the database achieved during optimization, the Spearman correlation coefficient
    for optimization parameters and targets (components consisting of the objective
    function) was calculated in Table 3. The Spearman correlation coefficient describes
    the correlation between two variables, especially when the relationship is monotonic
    [40]. All data calculated during the optimization process were used to derive
    the Spearman correlation coefficient. The higher the Spearman correlation coefficient,
    the greater the influence of the optimization parameter on the target. The most
    significant optimization parameters were and . These parameters mean the vertical
    amplitude of the injection pattern. These affect the standard deviations related
    to water flux and spread area significantly. The effects of on targets are shown
    in Fig. 10. The sum of standard deviations for droplet size in each radial section
    ( ) was not significantly affected by . Only a slight decrease was observed. The
    standard deviation of average droplet size in a radial direction ( ) also increased
    with increasing for small values of and no significant change was observed after
    of 0.04 m. The standard deviations related to water flux ( , ) were related to
    with an exponent of two or greater. Large means that the spray angle calculated
    from the horizontal plane increases. Therefore, a large number of large droplets
    reached the field under the sprinkler head. This caused an increase in the standard
    deviations related to water flux. Table 3. Spearman correlation coefficient for

    direction, (d) standard deviations of average water flux in the radial direction,
    and (e) spread area. The reference and optimized injection patterns are depicted
    in Fig. 11. The sector angle increased from 20° to 30° and the vertical amplitude
    of the spray increased. It is shown that the slope of the injection patterns between
    the reference and optimized case is similar to each other because the amplitude
    of the injection pattern increased with the increasing sector angle. The gap between
    the upper and lower limits at the slot (the angular location of 0° and 30°) was
    thicker than that at the tine (the angular location of 15°) in the optimized injection
    pattern. This could help the wide distribution of droplets in the radial direction.
    A thin injection pattern at tine was generated at a higher location in the optimized
    case. It could increase the spread area by increasing the radial reach. Therefore,
    thinning the tine stream and thickening the slot stream by directing the flow
    from the tines to the slots is beneficial for increasing uniformity. Download

    Reference and optimized injection patterns. The droplet diameter, the vertical
    velocity of the droplet, the number of droplets, and the water flux on the floor
    are shown in Fig. 12. The farther the location, the larger the droplet diameter
    was calculated because the larger droplet has the higher inertia. When the droplet
    size is large, gravity dominates over drag. Therefore, the droplet vertical velocity
    was higher in the far region from the sprinkler head. A large number of droplets
    was observed at the center of the floor. It is because the smaller droplets with
    low inertia are guided into the central region by air entrainment. The water flux
    is calculated by a combination of the droplet size, the droplet vertical velocity,
    and the number of droplets. It was distributed from the middle to the end in the
    radial direction. The water flux at the center was very low despite many droplets
    because only small droplets exist in the center region. Compared to the water
    flux of the reference case, the optimized case showed a wide distribution of water
    flux. Optimization improved the radial distribution of the particle flux, however,
    reduced azimuth uniformity (especially at the extreme limits of sprinkler spray).

    flux of (g) reference and (h) optimized design. The average droplet size and water
    flux at each radial section are depicted in Fig. 13. Although the initial injection
    pattern was assumed to be a shape of the sine function with uniform droplet size
    and velocity, the overall trend in radial distributions of droplet radius and
    water flux was observed to be similar to the previous experimental data [41].
    The droplet diameter increased with radial distance, and the water flux increased
    up to a certain radial distance from the sprinkler head and then decreased to
    the spray boundary. The average droplet size in the middle of the radial direction
    increased after optimization. There was no significant difference in other locations.
    An increase in droplet size in the middle of the radial direction increased the
    water flux in the same region. The water flux for the optimized injection pattern
    showed a more uniform distribution. The peak value decreased and water flux has
    a wide distribution in the middle. The larger vertical amplitude of the injection
    pattern produced the water flux in the middle zone resulting in a more uniform
    distribution of droplet size and water flux. The droplet size and the water flux
    distribution didn''t change significantly because the spray formation mechanism,
    in which the water impinges on the boss and deflector to form a sinusoidal injection
    pattern, was maintained in this study. Download : Download high-res image (415KB)

    design The optimized sprinkler head design was derived from the second optimization
    step. Fig. 14 shows the history of the minimum value of the objective function.
    The lower the value, the more similar the injection pattern design is achieved.
    The final design was generated in the 44th generation. Finding a sprinkler head
    design that produced the same injection pattern derived in the first optimization
    step was difficult because it assumed a sine function with some error from the
    actual injection pattern generated by the sprinkler head. Download : Download

    due to increased sector angle. It is shown that there were vertical and horizontal
    sheets made at the slot and tine stream and a region that connected these two
    sheets. Although the water volume fraction contour produced by the optimized sprinkler
    head design has some difference from the target volume fraction contour, it is
    an acceptable level considering the error between the actual injection pattern
    and the assumed injection pattern. The discrepancy between the target injection
    pattern and the optimized injection patterns was caused by the mismatch between
    the actual injection pattern and the assumption of a sinusoid injection pattern.

    of the injection pattern. The final optimized sprinkler head design means that
    the boss design of the commercial sprinkler heads can be kept in future development,

    design for improved uniformity was derived by two-step optimization. The first
    step optimized the injection pattern at 0.05 m from the center of the sprinkler
    head and the second step derived the optimized sprinkler head design. The flow
    rate was fixed at 80 LPM and optimization was performed for non-fire conditions,
    so caution is required when applying conditions different from those used in this
    study. The main results of this study are summarized as follows: (1) The vertical
    amplitude of the injection pattern was the most important factor for the uniform
    distributions of droplet size and water flux. The standard deviations related
    to water flux increased with the vertical amplitude of the injection pattern,
    the standard deviation related to the droplet size showed a weak relationship
    with the vertical amplitude of the injection pattern, and the spread area decreased
    as the vertical amplitude of the injection pattern increases. (2) The optimized
    injection pattern had a thin thickness in the tine stream targeting high directions.
    Also, it exhibited a large section angle and a large vertical amplitude. This
    pattern resulted in a larger droplet size in the middle of the radial direction,
    resulting in a wider distribution of water flux. (3) Spray characteristics under
    non-fire conditions were valid under fire conditions. The optimized injection
    pattern showed a wider fire-extinguished area and lower standard deviations of
    droplet size and water flux in most cases of heat flux. (4) The optimized sprinkler
    head design had the same boss dimension and scaled-up deflector design. The slot
    was more concave to produce a large vertical amplitude of the injection pattern,
    and the tine was more protruding to produce a thinner injection pattern targeting
    higher. CRediT author contribution statement Taehoon Kim: Conceptualization, Methodology,

    近年来，我国农业在迅猛发展的同时，也面临着水资源供需不平衡、劳动力不足等问题[1]。管道输水作为一种代替明渠的节水技术，具有节约水资源，提高水利用系数和便于管理控制等特点[2]，进行推广可以促进智慧农业的发展。但管道输水灌溉工程高昂的建设和能耗成本不利于其推广，降低灌溉费用成为亟待解决的问题[3]。随着物联网技术的发展和系统控制成本的降低，管道灌溉和智慧农业表现出了天然的结合性。将传统管灌系统升级为智慧灌溉系统，不仅可以极大的提高了灌溉系统的运维管理功能，而且通过智能设备实现了对出水装置流量的精准控制[4]，对降低灌溉费用具有重要的意义。
    设计流速作为灌溉系统的重要约束之一，传统的优化方法通常以经济流速作为约束条件，即根据管径选择对应的流速[5]，但随着科技的发展，这种流速约束已经被逐渐弱化。在管道灌溉系统中，研究人员通常采用2.0m/s作为设计流速[6,
    7]，但随着材料及加工技术的发展，此约束已经对新型复合材料的耐冲刷优势产生了限制，造成了材料的极大浪费[8, 9]。众多学者已经将流速上限进行了调整。王永涛[10]将3
    m/s作为流速上限进行管网优化，极大的降低了灌溉成本。李斌[4]通过水力性能分析，提出4 m/s的流速可作为山地灌溉的流速标准。高路[8]通过耐磨性能实验证明了5
    m/s远没达到非金属管材的设计流速。因此，研究设计流速对管道灌溉系统年费用的影响，可为研究人员在选择流速约束时提供理论支撑。 本文在已有研究的基础上，以设计流速作为研究对象，建立基于灌溉年费用的管网优化模型，并使用群体寻优算法对其进行求解，旨在得出设计流速对灌溉年费用的影响，为管灌系统设计的流速约束提供借鉴和参考。
    1 树状灌溉管网优化模型设计 1.1 目标函数 机压管灌年费用主要包括管网折旧维修费用（管网费用）和泵站运行能耗费用[11]。其中，管网费用与建设成本相关，运行费用则由泵站耗能决定。为了方便数学描述，本文以轮灌组为研究单位，轮灌组的分流结构示意图如图1所示，干管由M个管段组成，支管I、J分别由I、J个管段组成，支管每个管段均有一个出水口，并以干管分流点为参照由远及近进行编号。
    图1 轮灌组管网分流结构示意图 Fig.1 Schematic diagram of diversion structure of the irrigation
    sector network Full size|PPT slide 管网费用可利用建设成本进行计算[6]，即先计算灌溉管网各个管段成本的累加值，其中，管段成本与所选用管道的材料、直径与长度等因素相关，然后使用折旧率和维修率进行折算[12]。能耗费用则根据水泵的运行工况和运行时长进行计算。因此，建立灌溉年费用的数学模型如下：
    m i n  F c = r 1 + r y 1 + r y - 1 + β  ∑ m = 1 M C m L m + ∑ i = 1 I C I , i  L
    I , i + ∑ j = 1 J C J , j  L J , j + E T H   ∑ i = 1 I q I ,  i + ∑ j = 1 J q
    J ,  j 367.2  η p  η m （1） 式中：Fc为灌溉年费用，元/a；y为折旧年限，a；r为年利率，%； β 为年平均维修率，%；Cm、CI
    , i、CJ , j 分别为干管管段m、支管管段I, i、支管管段J,j的管道单价，元/m；Lm、LI , i、LJ , j 分别为干管管段m、支管管段(I,
    i)、支管管段(J, j)的管道长度，m；E为电价，元/kWh；T为水泵运行时长，h；H为水泵扬程，m；qI , i、qJ , j 分别为出水口(I, i)、(J,
    j)的流量，m3/h；ηp 为水泵效率，%；ηm 为电机效率，%。 1.2 约束条件 1.2.1 水头损失约束 水泵的性能参数不是孤立静止的，而是相互联系制约的，通常使用水泵性能曲线表示性能参数之间的关系[13]。为了提高计算机的求解连续性和减少求解变量的个数，本文在模型求解时使用流量表示水泵的扬程和效率，水泵性能曲线如下：
    H = ∑ a = 1 3  A a  ∑ i = 1 I  q I ,  i + ∑ j = 1 J  q J ,  j a - 1 （2） η p =
    ∑ b = 1 3 B b  ∑ i = 1 I  q I ,  i + ∑ j = 1 J  q J ,  j b - 1 （3） 式中：Aa 为Q~H的多项式回归系数；Bb
    为Q~ η p 的多项式回归系数。 管网进口压力是水泵扬程与水泵高度、进水管水头损失之和的差值。因此，管网进口压力计算如下： H g = H - Z 0 -
    H f （4） 式中：Hg 为管网进口压力，m；Z 0为水泵与水源水位的高差，m；Hf 为水泵进水管的水头损失，m。 支管的管道水头损失是支管和干管各管段的水头损失之和。本文使用水头损失公式计算管道的压力降[14]，使用的参数包括管道的流量、直径和长度。如图1所示，支管管段的流量是流经该管段的所有出水口的流量之和，干管流量为支管I和支管J所有出水口的流量之和。建立支管I水头损失模型为：

    i = 1 I q I ,  i + ∑ j = 1 J q J , j m D m b  L m + H t （5） 式中： μ 为考虑局部水头损失修正系数；f,
    m, b为与UPVC管材相关的摩阻系数、流量指数和管径指数，分别为94 800、1.77和4.77[6]；Dm 、dI , i 分别为干管管段m和支管管段I,i的管道直径，mm；
    H t 为支管的坡度，m。同理，支管J的水头损失的计算模型与支管I相似，此处不再赘述。 为满足轮灌组所有出水口的水头要求，轮灌组的最大水头损失应由轮灌组内水头损失最大的支管决定[6]，并且其值必须小于管网进水水头，因此，建立轮灌组水头损失约束为：
    m a x  H s I ,  H s J ≤ H g （6） 1.2.2 灌溉时长约束 增加灌溉时长可减少管道流量，从而降低管道阻力和水泵的运行能耗。但灌溉时间并不能无限增加，必须根据当地试验数据确定，即在规定的灌溉时间内完成相应的灌溉定额。因此，灌溉持续时长约束如下：
    T t = ∑ k = 1 K T k ≤ T s （7） 式中： T t 为灌区灌溉总时长，h；K为轮灌组个数； T s 为灌区规定的总时长，h。 1.2.3
    管径约束 根据工程建设要求，管径应沿水流方向逐渐减小，同时管径必须是标准尺寸。另外，为了便于施工和减少变径过大引起的应力集中[15]，相邻管道的直径应该具用连续性，即不可跨越一个标准值进行连接。因此，支管I的管径约束为：
    0 ≤ d I ,  i + 1 - d I ,  i < d m a x （8） 式中： d m a x 为最大管径差，mm。同理，支管J的管径约束与支管I相同。
    1.2.4 流速约束 当流速过小时，会造成杂质淤积和肥料溶解不完全等情况；而当流速过大时，会引起振动、水锤等流体力学与结构力学耦合的物理现象[16, 17]，对管道造成损坏。建立支管I的流速约束如下：
    0.6 ≤ v I , i < v m a x （9） 式中：0.6 m/s为管网具有施肥或施药的任务的最小流速[6]； v m a x 为设计流速，m/s。同理，支管J的流速约束与支管I相似。其中，设计流速作为研究对象，并不是一个常数，本文中其取值区间为2.0~5.0
    m/s，取值步长为0.1 m/s。 1.3 适应度函数 在遗传算法中，适应度函数被用于衡量个体在种群中的表现，目的是为了对个体进行评估和排序，以便能够选择和进化出更好的个体[18]。为了将目标函数和约束条件相结合，适应度函数需要引入惩罚因子，从而将有约束的优化问题转化为无约束的函数。本文管网优化模型包含4个约束条件，因此适应度函数可表示为：
    F f i t = F c + λ 1  m a x  H m a x - H g , 0 + λ 2  m a x  T t - T s , 0 + λ
    3  ( D I + D J ) + λ 4  V d D I = m a x  d I ,  x - d I ,  x + 1 , 0 + m a x  d

    - v m a x , 0 + m a x  v J ,  z - v m a x , 0                              ∀ y
    ∈ 0 , I ;  ∀ z ∈ 0 , J （10） 式中： F f i t 为个体的适应度值； λ 为惩罚因子；DI 、DJ 分别为支管I，J的管径惩罚值；Vd
    为轮灌组内所有支管的流速惩罚值。 2 算法结构设计 遗传算法是一种模拟自然进化过程搜索最优解的方法，具有很强的并行能力和自适应力，在管网优化设计中应用广泛[18-20]。由于本文在使用经典遗传算法对模型进行求解时[11]，通过修改算法参数、增加种群多样性和调整求解空间，均无法得到良好的收敛效果。因此，本文在对选择算子进行优化时，将选择算子修改为双选择结构，即在锦标赛选择的同时进行最优个体保留，避免最优个体在随机选择过程中被淘汰。另一方面，由于舍弃了交叉算子，本文在对变异算子优化时，将初始变异概率提高至40%，并使用退火算法逐渐降低变异概率[11]。另外，由于管径变异会破坏原始的约束条件，产生大量不合理解，造成算力的浪费，本文对变异的管径进行邻域判断和修改，保证变异后管径数组保持单调递增。
    3 计算实例 本研究基于江苏某机压管灌管网为例进行优化验证[14]。如图2所示，灌溉系统由泵站、管网系统和给水装置等构成。其中，管网系统为机压管灌中常用的树状结构，该结构相对于环状管网和混合管网具有更低的建设和维护成本。该项目区管网由4个干管管段和10个支管组成，并以干管分流点相同为依据，划分为5个轮灌组。为了提高灌溉均匀性，本研究基于灌溉面积确定每个出水口的流量。以支管1为例，出水口的灌溉面积分别为：0.26、0.27、0.29、0.30、0.31和0.33
    hm2，对应的配水百分比为：14.8%、15.3%、16.5%、17.0%、17.6%和18.8%。另外，本文优化模型采用承压能力0.6 MPa的UPVC管材进行计算，管径集合为：160、200、250、315
    mm，对应的管材单价分别为37、56、90和142 元/m。 图2 实验田的管网布置及灌溉面积示意图 Fig.2 Schematic diagram of

    slide 4 结果与分析 4.1 算法分析 遗传算法的控制参数较多，其中群体规模和遗传代数对求解准确性影响较大。本文以群体规模2 000、最大遗传代数100为基本遗传参数，将交叉概率和初始变异概率分别设置为50%和40%进行模型求解。另外，由于轮灌组水头损失和管径约束是保证灌溉基本需求的强制性约束，因此对其设置的惩罚系数为105，以快速消除无效解。而灌溉时长和流速约束具有一定的容忍性，本文对其设置的惩罚系数较前者低一个数量级。
    以轮灌组1为例，改进遗传算法的最小适应度和平均适应度的迭代过程如图3所示。本文对选择算子进行了改造，设计为锦标赛选择和最优个体保留的双选择结构。如最小适应度收敛曲线所示，在前10次迭代过程中，最小适应度明显下降，这体现了锦标赛选择的优点；同时，收敛曲线单调递减，体现了最优个体保留的特点。

    4.2 灌溉年费用分析 本文以2和5 m/s作为设计流速的上下限，在此区间内对机压管灌系统进行管径和配水优化，得到了不同设计流速下的最小灌溉年费用。如图4所示，在2.0~2.7
    m/s的区间内，灌溉年费用随着设计流速的增加逐渐降低。当流速提高到2.7 m/s时，灌溉年费用由2.0 m/s的26 732元降低至24 812元，费用节约率为7.17%。另外值得注意的是，当流速大于2.7
    m/s时，进一步提高设计流速并不会降低灌溉年费用。由此可得，在合理的流区间内，提高设计流速可以降低灌溉年成本；但进一步提高流速约束，并不会影响灌溉年费用，这是因为管道水头损失会随着流速的增加而上升，进而增加了能耗费用，导致灌溉年成本的增加[21]。

    different maximum design velocity Full size|PPT slide 4.3 管网费用分析 由灌溉年费用分析结果可知，在2.0~2.7
    m/s的区间内灌溉年费用是逐渐下降的，但这个结果并不能直接反映出管网费用与设计流速之间的关系。为了分析设计流速对管网费用的影响，本文以轮灌组1内的支管2进行表征（图2）。结果如表1所示，在2.0~2.4
    m/s的流速区间内，最优的管径方案并未发生变化；当设计流速提高至2.5 m/s时，管段3、管段5均取得了比原始方案更小的管径值；但进一步将流速逐步提高至5.0
    m/s，管网设计方案均为发生变化。结果表明提高设计流速可以降低管网费用，但同时值得注意的是灌溉管网并不会随着流速的增加而持续获得更小的管径值。 表1 支管2在不同设计流速下的管径

    160 160 160 200 200 250 315 4.4 运行能耗分析 同样以支管2为例分析设计流速对运行能耗的影响。如表1所示，管径在设计流速为2.5
    m/s时发生改变。因此，以管径相同为前提，如图5所示，在2.0~2.4 m/s流速区间，随着设计流速的增加，运行能耗由1 254 元/a降低至1 102 元/a；同样在2.5~2.7
    m/s流速区间，运行能耗也表现出相同的趋势，这说明提高设计流速可以在相同管网布置的条件下降低运行能耗。同时结果还表明，当管径变小时，即设计流速由2.4 m/s提高至2.5
    m/s，管道阻力的增加会引起运行费用的显著提高。 图5 不同设计流速下的运行费用 Fig.5 Operating costs at different maximum

    （2）本文在设计流速2.0~5.0 m/s的区间内，以步长为0.1进行灌溉年费用优化。通过对江苏某管灌工程进行实例优化分析，在2.0~2.7 m/s的区间内，灌溉年费用随着设计流速的增加逐渐降低，最大费用节约率为7.17%。而当流速大于2.7
    m/s时，进一步提高设计流速并不会降低灌溉年费用。 （3）由于传统遗传算法在求解本文模型时收敛效果并不理想，本研究对遗传算子进行了结构性调整，舍弃了交叉算子，并设计了双选择和并行变异算子，实现了模型的精准求解。

    model is developed. • The study proposed an improved objective function to estimate
    model’s parameters. • Soil-column lysimeter experiment is conducted to calibrate
    model’s parameters. • The compensated root water uptake reduces with increasing
    salinity in root zone. Abstract It is important to delineate the root water uptake
    (RWU) response to salt and water stress for assessing future water availability
    under extreme climatic conditions. The process of RWU in salt-affected soils is
    highly complex and not well understood. The present study proposed a matric flux
    potential based non-linear RWU model capable of calculating reduced RWU in water
    and salt stressed conditions. The study incorporates a sensitivity analysis of
    the model''s parameters. For the inverse estimation of these parameters, an objective
    function has been formulated, utilizing data derived from the highly sensitive
    model''s response. The proposed objective function provides unique estimates for
    these parameters. Using this objective function in an optimization process, the
    model is calibrated with observed data obtained from a soil column lysimeter experiment
    conducted on berseem crop (Trifolium alexandrium). The parameters are optimized
    through the coupling of the model with a genetic algorithm-based optimizer tool.
    Simulated data for soil moisture, electrical conductivity, and percolation are
    then compared to observed data. The simulated model''s responses are found to
    be closely aligns with the experimentally observed values. The RWU under four

    modelingRichards equation 1. Introduction To address water scarcity in irrigation,
    new developments explore non-conventional sources, often facing challenges such
    as saline or brackish water, negatively affecting soil and crop health (Flowers
    and Yeo, 1989, Kumar et al., 2021, Rahneshan et al., 2018, Wang et al., 2023).
    Due to limited water availability, root water uptake (RWU) is reduced, resulting
    in lower evapotranspiration. The presence of high salt content further exacerbates
    this reduction. Therefore, an accurate assessment of RWU under soil moisture and
    salinity stress conditions is essential for simulating crop yield, irrigation
    scheduling, water use efficiency, and other related factors. Numerically, RWU
    is simulated by incorporating a sink term to Richards equation. The sink term
    is generally modeled using a macroscopic approach that represents micro-level
    uptake through individual roots with an average uptake. The maximum uptake which
    is equals to transpiration distributed throughout the root depth following the
    concept of extraction function, denoted as ‘S’ (Molz and Remson, 1970). The value
    of S depends on factors such as root depth, time, soil moisture availability,
    and climatic conditions (Feddes et al., 1976; Li et al., 1999, Molz, 1981, Prasad,
    1988). It is ensured that the sum of the maximum S over the root zone is equal
    to the total potential transpiration demand of a plant (Ojha et al., 2009, Shankar
    et al., 2012). Several models have been developed to quantify the distribution
    of S across the entire root zone (Lier et al. 2008; Nguyen et al., 2020, Shankar
    et al., 2013). These models calculate the maximum RWU corresponding to potential
    transpiration, which is then modified to actual RWU under water-limiting and salt
    presence conditions. One prominent approach to address water stress by using Feddes
    et al. (1976) model, which considers the reduction in RWU to be linear within
    certain limits based on pressure head values. A piecewise linear function (with
    values ranging from 0 to 1) is multiplied by potential RWU to obtain actual RWU.
    This model''s simplicity has led to its wide acceptance in modeling RWU processes.
    However, recent studies have highlighted its limitations: a) It assumes a linear
    relationship with suction head values without considering matrix flux potential,
    which actually describes water flow through the soil-root system (de Melo and
    de Jong van Lier, 2021, dos Santos et al., 2017, Nguyen et al., 2020). (b) calibration
    of the model’s parameters (de Jong van Lier et al., 2015). The piecewise linear
    model has been further modified by the S-shaped function proposed by Van Genuchten,
    (1987). Skaggs et al. (2006) emphasize that this function offers a more effective
    description of crop yield response to water and salt stress when compared to other
    functions, such as the yield functions proposed by Maas and Hoffman (1977). However,
    these models do not explicitly include the compensation mechanism in RWU. On the
    other hand, matric flux potential-based RWU models implicitly address the compensation
    mechanism (de Jong van Lier et al., 2008b). Moreover, soil water availability
    is better predicted when the RWU process is combined with soil hydraulic properties
    (de Jong van Lier et al., 2013, Iden et al., 2015, Šimůnek et al., 1998). Such
    models calculate the composite soil hydraulic function by integrating hydraulic
    conductivity over a range of pressure head values. The linear relationship between
    this function and stress reduction factor is physically more rational and has
    been well-validated with experimental results (Casaroli et al., 2010; Santos et
    al. 2017). Thus, the complex process of soil moisture dynamics in root zone can
    be modeled using these advanced empirical models, provided accurate parameterization
    is achieved. Parameter uncertainty remains a concern, particularly when dealing
    with a large number of parameters. These uncertainties may arise from field conditions
    (Martin del Campo et al., 2021, Ngo et al., 2013), soil type (Hupet et al., 2003),
    and the choice of data used in inverse modeling (Kelleners et al., 2005, Sonkar
    et al., 2022). Numerous inverse modeling studies for estimating soil hydraulic
    parameters using infiltration experiment data are available (Baroni et al., 2010,
    Graham et al., 2018, Kotlar et al., 2019). The inverse approach has also been
    extended to estimate RWU (dos Santos et al., 2017, Schelle et al., 2013, Sonkar
    et al., 2019, Vrugt et al., 2001) and solute parameters (Šimůnek and Hopmans,
    2009, Skaggs et al., 2014) along with soil hydraulic parameters. However, simultaneous
    estimation of soil and crop parameters may raise issues related to non-uniqueness
    and identifiability (Sonkar et al., 2018). These challenges often stem from the
    use of insufficient or inappropriate observed data in the objective function during
    optimization. The problem can be scrutinized through sensitivity analysis, aiding
    in the identification of crucial model responses that affect the parameters. Most
    sensitivity studies highlight the lower ranking of crop parameters, especially
    water and salt stress parameters (Li and Ren, 2019, Zeng et al., 2018). The purpose
    of the study is concerned with the simulation of water and salt dynamics in the
    root zone. Additionally, the study aims to evaluate the sensitivity of RWU model
    parameters when simulating seasonal irrigation of berseem (Trifolium alexandrium)
    with saline water. The model parameters considered for evaluation include RWU
    distribution, critical water stress, and critical osmotic stress. The sensitivity
    of these parameters is assessed with respect to three model outputs: soil moisture,
    electrical conductivity (representing salinity), and bottom flux. Furthermore,
    these parameters are estimated for berseem grown in a soil-column lysimeter under
    saline condition. The study intended to contribute and promote research and development
    of crop-yield model that can be used in extreme water and salt stress conditions.
    2. Methodology 2.1. Root zone soil moisture and salinity dynamics The soil moisture
    movement in the unsaturated zone can be numerically simulated using Richards’
    equation (Richard 1931). In the present study, a mixed form of Richards’ equation
    is solved to avoid mass conservation error (Clement et al. 1994). The equation
    representing one-dimensional vertically unsaturated moisture flow with RWU as
    a sink is (1) where, θ is the volumetric soil moisture content [-], K is the unsaturated
    hydraulic conductivity [LT−1], h is the pressure head [L], t is time [T], z is
    vertical coordinate is taken positive towards upward [L] and S is sink term describing
    RWU at given z and t[T−1]. To solve the above non-linear equation, the constitutive
    relations (non-hysteretic) θ-h and K-h of van Genuchten (1980) and Mualem (1976),
    respectively, are used. These relations describe the soil properties given as
    (2) and, (3) where, θs and θr are volumetric saturated and residual soil moisture
    content [m3m−3], αv is inverse of air-entry value [L-1], nv index depends on soil
    pore-size [-], mv is the empirical parameter defined as 1-(1/nv) [-], Θ is the
    effective soil moisture defined as (θ-θr)/(θs –θr) [-], Ks is saturated hydraulic
    conductivity [LT−1]. The sink term in Equation (1) is calculated using proposed
    macroscopic approach based RWU model (explained in section 2.3). In saline soil,
    the migration of salt occurs through the process of adsorpstion-desorption-dissolution
    and advective–dispersive transport. Considering non-adsorptive salt movement in
    loamy sand (Morris et al., 2008, Ramos et al., 2023), the salt concentration is
    simulated using the information of θ and flux q obtained by solving Equation (1).
    The salt flux considering only advection–dispersion is given as (4) where c is
    the total liquid phase solute concentration [ML-3], Df is dispersion coefficient
    in liquid phase [L2T−1] given by , DL is longitudinal dispersivity [L], Dm is
    molecular diffusion coefficient in free water [L2T−1], and τ is tortuosity in
    liquid phase [-]. 2.2. Initial and boundary conditions The h values corresponding
    to observed θ at the time of sowing of the crop is taken as the initial boundary
    condition. The top surface of the soil layer is treated as a Neumann-type boundary
    through which evaporation and precipitation occur which is given by (5) where
    qtop is flux due to addition (precipitation/irrigation) and loss of water (soil
    evaporation) at the top boundary, is the length of the root zone [L]. In the case
    of continuous rainfall of longer duration, the top soil surface may accumulate
    a ponding depth Dp (=0.05 m for the study) in such condition the top boundary
    is modified to head-specific boundary given as (6) where tp is duration of ponding.
    At the bottom, the water table is considered sufficiently deep to treat the bottom
    boundary as a free-drainage boundary (Equation (6). At the bottom boundary, (7)
    As the known concentration of salt in irrigation water is applied, the upper boundary
    condition is taken as prescribed concertation, ctop (Equation (9). While the lower
    boundary condition is considered as prescribed concentration flux given as (8)
    where, qbottom and cbottom are the observed flux and concentration at the lower
    boundary. (9) 2.3. Root water uptake model The proposed model utilizes the concept
    of (a) non-linearity in root length density (dos Santos et al., 2017), and (b)
    RWU distribution as a function of matrix flux potential (de Jong van Lier et al.,
    2008a). The root length density (RLD) gives the information of RWU distribution.
    In fact, the maximum water extraction is found to be proportional to RLD. Considering
    non-linearity in spatial distribution of RLD at any depth z within maximum root
    depth zrmax [L], it can be described by (10) where RLD0 = RLD at the soil surface
    [LL-3], n = distribution parameter [-]. The value of RLD0 is expressed in the
    average root length density RLDavg as the value of RLDavg is reported in several
    literature (Gao et al., 2010, Osborne et al., 2020, White et al., 2015, Yamaguchi
    and Tanaka, 1990). The RLD0 in terms RLDavg is generally expressed as (11) Solving
    for RLD0 from Equation (11) and substituting in Equation (10) gives (12) Using
    the concept of weighted stress index defined by dos Santos et al. (2017), the
    weighted index λ for matric flux potential based non-linear RWU is defined as
    (13) where M(h) is matrix flux potential [L2T−1] defined by (de Jong van Lier
    et al., 2008b), hw is pressure head at wilting point. The potential transpiration
    Tpot can be distributed over the root zone according to root length density and
    soil water availability as (14) The distribution of RWU ensures that the is equals
    to Tpot. The Tpot in the model is calculated by partitioning soil evaporation
    from crop evapotranspiration (Belmans et al., 1983). The crop evapotranspiration
    is obtained by multiplying crop coefficient of berseem with reference evapotranspiration.
    Using reported climate data from automatic weather station installed in experimental
    field, the daily reference evapotranspiration is calculated using Penman- Montieth
    equation (Allen et al., 1998). 2.4. Water and salinity stress To address water-limiting
    condition, the developed RWU model uses the reduction factor as a function of
    matric flux potential. Under water limiting condition, the potential RWU, Smax
    reduced to Sact (Equation (16). The reduction factor αm, which varies between
    0 and 1, multiplied with Smax to obtain actual RWU. The water stress condition
    occurs when M is less than critical matric flux potential Mc where αm reduces
    from 1 and decreases linearly with M to 0 (at M = 0) (Fig. 1a). The αm is expressed
    as (15a) Download : Download high-res image (124KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. (a) Matric, and (b) osmotic head reduction functions. Similarly,
    RWU reduction in the presence of salinity can be addressed with another reduction
    function as osmotic head at which RWU reduced by 50 %, π50. The present model
    incorporates S-shaped reduction model of van Genuchten (1987), which describes
    non-linear RWU reduction as a function of salinity or electrical conductivity,
    as illustrated in Fig. 1b. The osmotic head reduction function is given as (15b)
    Under salt presence and water limiting conditions, the actual RWU can be given
    as (16) where, Sact and actual transpiration (Tact) are linked through the principal
    of mass conservation for water flow in the root zone as . Knowing the Tpot and
    Tact, the relative transpiration Tr is calculated as ratio of Tpot to Tact. The
    RWU reduction is directly reflected in transpiration reduction, when the value
    of Tr is less than 1(Feddes et al., 1974). 2.5. Design experiment and model development
    The study aims to calibrate RWU model parameters for berseem. For this, the crop
    growth experiment is conducted (Fig. 2) in Soil-Water-Plant laboratory of Indian
    Institute of Technology Ropar, India (30.968 N, 76.473 E; altitude 262 m above
    msl). The experiment was carried out from October 4, 2021 to March 5, 2022. For
    the experiment, a part of designed column-lysimeter is used. Fig. 2 displays the
    detailed column-lysimeter setup. The setup includes an acrylic glass cylinder
    of diameter 40 cm and length 80 cm, a storage tank to collect percolated water,
    and a sump tank for controlled saline irrigation through flowmeter. The storage
    tank is covered with black polythene to prevent evaporation losses. At the bottom
    of the lysimeter, coarse grain sand filter is designed to have a provision of
    drainage. The lysimeter is filled with locally available loamy-sand soil in four
    layers up to 75 cm from the bottom, with a 5 cm provision for ponding to simulate
    actual field conditions. The column-lysimeter is equipped with 4 sensors (model
    TDR-305H, Acclima, Inc., USA) to monitor soil moisture and soil electrical conductivity.
    The observation of soil moisture, electrical conductivity and percolated depth
    of water were taken on daily basis maintaining a time interval of 24 hrs. These
    sensors are placed at 10, 25, 45, and 65 cm depth from the soil surface. The laboratory
    is also equipped with Automatic Weather Station that records maximum and minimum
    temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, humidity, and rainfall that are required
    for the PET calculation in the model. To avoid destructive sampling of root length,
    the author used the root depth data from earlier conducted field grown berseem
    experiment (Sonkar et al., 2022). For monitoring Leaf Area Index (LAI), canopy
    leaf area is calculated using Easy Leaf Area software, Dept. of Plant Sciences,
    University of California. Fig. 3 shows the weekly measured maximum root length,
    zrmax and LAI. From the weekly measurement, daily zrmax and LAI are linearly interpolated
    which is given as input to the model. From the data, it has been observed that
    the constant maximum root length of 42.3 cm is achieved after 88th day after sowing
    (DAS). Thereby assuming no further root growth, the maximum root length is till
    153rd day is taken 42.3 cm. As berseem is a fodder crop, it is typically harvested
    3–4 times during the growth period. In the present experiment, berseem was harvested
    4 times, leading to a reduction in LAI to nearly 0 on days 66, 97, 124, and 153.
    The lysimeter-filled soil is tested for soil hydraulic parameters required for
    modeling. Table 1 presents the measured and fitted soil hydraulic parameters.
    The Ksat is measured in-situ using a permeameter (falling head). The samples are
    tested for soil moisture (θ) using oven dry method and suction head (h) using
    pressure plate apparatus. The soil water retention curve corresponding to measured
    θ and h is then fitted using RETC model (van Genucthten, 1980) to obtain θr, θs,
    αv, and nv. The saline irrigation of 5 dSm−1 is applied at different day of irrigation
    period with some of the deficit irrigation to bring the crop intentionally under
    water stress condition. Download : Download high-res image (440KB) Download :

    potential-based RWU model (Equation (14) is added to the existing numerical code
    of Richard’s equation (Sonkar et. al. 2019) as a sink term. Further, a subroutine
    of solute transport is developed by solving Equation (7) using finite difference
    approach. The subroutine is also added to the existing code since the flux appearing
    in Equation (7) has to be simulated first by the unsaturated flow Equation (1).
    The solution proceeds in three main steps. In the first step, Equation (1) is
    solved to simulate pressure head and the q is calculated using Darcy’s law. In
    the second step, with the known q, Equation (7) is solved to get solute concentration.
    The solute concentration, expressed in terms of electrical conductivity (EC),
    is converted into equivalent osmotic head (π) in meters using relationship suggested
    by U.S. Salinity Laboratory Staff (1954), as follows: (17) In the final step,
    with the known the pressure head and osmotic head, the actual RWU is simulated
    using Equation (16). Whole root zone domain is equally discretised into 151 grid
    points of Δz equals to 0.5 cm. The model simulates the pressure head and salt
    concentration at every time step Δt of 15 min. 2.6. Inverse problem The study
    addressed the identification of the RWU model parameters n, Mc, and π50. These
    parameters are optimized by minimizing an objective function (Equation (18). The
    objective function is defined as sum of squares of normalized differences between
    the observed and model simulated root zone salt-water dynamics responses. The
    responses include selected soil moisture, salt concentration (measured as electrical
    conductivity, EC) at different depths, and bottom flux, which reflect high sensitivity.
    The parameters are optimized using Genetic Algorithm tool. This approach ensures
    a derivative-free global optimal solution, as discussed by (Cimorelli et al.,
    (2018). The procedure for the estimation of n, Mc, and π50 from linked simulation
    optimization model is shown in Fig. 4. The objective function including data set
    of these responses is given as (18) where, θ*(z,t) and θ’(z,t) are vectors of
    observed and model simulated soil moisture, I is number of soil moisture data
    [ ], EC*(z,t) and (z,t) are vectors of measured and model simulated electrical
    conductivity, J is number of selective EC data [ ], DP*(z,t) and D (z,t) are vectors
    of measured and model bottom flux, M is number of crop growth days [T]. The terms
    wθ, wEC, and wD in Equation (18) are weights associated with soil moisture, electrical
    conductivity, and percolation measurements, respectively. Download : Download

    normalized root mean square error (NRMSE), coefficient of determination (r2),
    and Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient (NS) are used. These statistical parameters are
    given as (19) (20) (21) (22) where, n is number of data points of response, Rʹ
    and R* are observed and simulated responses, respectively and Rʹm and Rʹm are
    mean of observed and simulated response, respectively. 2.7. Parameter sensitivity
    analysis In order to determine the crucial temporal and spatial regions of model’s
    response, a sensitivity analysis of model response to the RWU model parameters
    was carried out. A local sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the change in
    salt-water dynamics for the individual parameter. The sensitivity is determined
    by changing the parameter’s value with the perturbation factor pf of 5 % to ensure
    numerical stable simulations (Pue et al., 2019). Since the analysis involves comparison
    between different parameters towards different responses, a Central Total Relative
    Sensitivity (CTRS) index is used (Saltelli et. al., 2008), given in Equation (23).
    The index is preferred when the parameters and the response have different orders
    of magnitude. The CTRS index is defined as normalized form of dynamic sensitivity
    function. The index value close to 0 denotes weak effect of a parameter and a
    positive effect is expressed by a positive value while negative by negative value
    (Rezaei et al., 2016). (23) where y(t) and x are model response, and parameter,
    respectively, and is perturbation factor 3. Result and discussion 3.1. Parameter
    sensitivity analysis in the RWU model To analyze the sensitivity of RWU model
    parameters to model response, a numerical experiment of berseem grown in experimental
    field under saline irrigation quantity has been performed. Within the typical
    growth period of 50 days of development stage, three irrigations flux of 120 mm/day,
    60 mm/day, and 40 mm/day are applied on 1st, 15th, and 30th day, respectively.
    These fluxes correspond to required irrigation depth to achieve saturation, field
    capacity, and 33 % deficit irrigation treatment in the soil-column experiment.
    During this period the PET, LAI, and root depth were assumed as 5 mm day−1, 5
    m2m−2, and 0.5 m, respectively. Fig. 5 presents the CTRS of (a) soil moisture,
    (b) pressure head, and (c) salinity responses to Mc. With reference to soil moisture
    response, the sensitivity of Mc is highest during the dry period and have the
    higher CTRS values in the upper region of soil domain (Fig. 5 a). This is because
    the stress parameter of crop model activates during water stress period. In addition,
    the maximum influence of reduced RWU will occur in the top part of the root zone
    that have maximum RLD and lesser water availability. Similar obvious trend can
    be noticed for pressure head response. However, the sensitivity of Mc to pressure
    head is greater than sensitivity to soil moisture. Thus, suction head information
    is more efficient than soil moisture in estimating Mc. Fig. 5c shows that the
    effect of Mc on saline concentration is negligible throughout the root zone in
    first irrigation interval (sufficient irrigation). But salinity concentration
    is affected by Mc during deficit irrigation applications. During these periods,
    the negative correlation between Mc and saline concentration exists in the root
    zone. While below the root zone, positive correlation exists between them. The
    negative correlation indicates that on decreasing Mc, the RWU capability of plant
    increases, which result in accumulation of salt in the root zone thereby increasing
    saline concentration. As a consequence, less water is available to flow as gravity
    drainage, which lowers the salt flux below the root zone resulting in lower saline
    concentration. Fig. 6 shows that all the RWU model parameters are exhibit the
    higher sensitivity to daily bottom flux data. This signifies that observed bottom
    flux needs to be incorporated for the improved estimation of these parameters
    along with soil moisture and pressure head data. Download : Download high-res

    analysis of bottom flux (percolation) to Mc, π50, and n. The results of dynamic
    sensitivity of soil moisture and pressure head responses to π50 shows that these
    responses are affected in the root zone during first irrigation interval (Fig.
    7a and 7b). In contrast, during deficit irrigation periods, the sensitivities
    of soil moisture and pressure head are very low to the variation of π50. This
    is due to the fact of less salt presence as a result of lower saline irrigation
    application. The low saline concentration does not affect the RWU rate, resulting
    in negligible variation in soil moisture depletion. Fig. 7c shows that π50 effect
    on salinity follows similar trend as Mc. The negative correlation in the root
    zone can be explained as increased RWU because of reduced π50. The increased uptake
    leads to more accumulation of salts. Hence, on decreasing π50 the saline concentration
    increases in the root zone. Download : Download high-res image (120KB) Download

    response to RWU distribution parameter n has been performed for the same scenarios.
    The plots of timely CTRS of these responses are shown in Fig. 8. The sensitivity
    of soil moisture and pressure head is highest in the upper region of the root
    zone. Since the RLD is concentrated in this region, the effect of n is predominantly
    reflected. However, the sensitivity of soil moisture is low as compared to pressure
    head. Thus, pressure head data can be preferred over soil moisture to inversely
    estimate n. In case of non-availability of pressure head observation, the bottom
    flux data with soil moisture can be incorporated in the objective function while
    optimizing n. Interestingly, the effect of n variation on saline concentration
    is found to be more than soil moisture and pressure head (Fig. 8c). This effect
    is noticed more during deficit irrigation application. Download : Download high-res

    Parameters evaluation and estimation For the inverse estimation of the RWU model
    parameters n, Mc, and π50, the objective function (Equation (18) is formulated
    based on sensitivity analysis. The objective function includes the selected response
    of soil moisture, electrical conductivity, and bottom flux which shows high sensitivity
    to these parameters. The soil moisture data set included in the objective function
    consist of upper root-zone soil moisture information on dry days. The salinity
    concentration dataset includes the electrical conductivity values during last
    two subsequent irrigation intervals. Additionally, the daily depth of percolated
    water is used in a bottom flux dataset. Since the electrical conductivity shows
    relatively high sensitivity to π50, the weight associated with electrical conductivity
    measurement is set higher than the other weights. The objective function is tested
    for uniqueness by increasing the value of wEC. At wEC around 4, the objective
    function yields a global minimum within the parametric space. Thus, for the analysis,
    values of wθ, wEC, and wD in Equation (18) are set to 1, 4, and 1, respectively.
    Prior to the model calibration with field observed data, the parameters identifiability
    study is conducted to check for uniqueness in the solution. The uniqueness of
    the optimization is checked for the cases (a) estimation of Mc, and π50, and (b)
    estimation of Mc, π50, and n, using Equation (18). For the analysis, the arbitrary
    values of n, Mc, and π50 are taken as 2, 7.2 cm2d-1, and −20 m, respectively in
    the forward simulation. The model is run for 50 days incorporating these RWU parameters
    value (say true value) and the remaining parameters, initial, and boundary conditions
    are same as taken in the numerical experiment for sensitivity analysis. From the
    synthetically generated salt-water dynamics responses, the selective sets of θ*,
    EC*, and D* are formulated which is used in Equation (18) to estimate n, Mc, and
    π50. Fig. 9 shows the contour plot of objective function for the case (a). The
    objective function is plotted in the parametric spaces of Mc ranging from 0.005
    to 20 cm2day−1, and π50 ranging from 0 to −50 m. Within the parametric space,
    the objective function is convex with its global minimum at the true values i.e.
    Mc = 7.2 cm2d-1, and π50 = -20 m. This shows that using Equation (18), incorporating
    selected responses that have high sensitivity to Mc, and π50, the parameters associated
    with water and salt stress can be estimated uniquely. Similarly, using Equation
    (18) the parameters Mc, π50, and n are estimated in case (b). The objective function
    is plotted in the parametric space of Mc, π50, and n (Fig. 10). The range of parametric
    space for n is 1 to 5, while the ranges of Mc, and π50 are same as in case (a).
    Fig. 10 shows that the objective function is convex with its global minimum at
    the true values of Mc = 7.2 cm2d-1, π50 = -20 m, and n = 2. This signifies that
    the formulated objective function is capable of simultaneously estimating the
    RWU distribution, water, and salt stress parameters. Download : Download high-res

    conventional objective functions that includes all the responses may not ensure
    a unique solution (Hupet et al., 2005, Ngo et al., 2013, Schelle et al., 2012,
    Sonkar et al., 2019). This is because the conventional objective functions include
    responses of stress as well as non-stressed periods. Since the stress period of
    typical crop growth scenarios is small, the corresponding response is less as
    compared to non-stressed dataset. The limited stress period response is overshadowed
    by non-stresses response in these objective functions. Thus, it is not capable
    of capturing the dynamic change under water and salt stresses condition and may
    lead to non-unique solutions. 3.3. Model calibration The calibration of the RWU
    model parameters, namely RWU distribution n, critical matric flux potential Mc,
    and osmotic head at which RWU reduced to 50 % π50 are calibrated using field crop
    (berseem) growth experiment data. The RWU model is integrated with GA- based optimizer
    tool to optimize these parameters using observed and measured responses that are
    required in the objective function (Equation (18). The soil moisture recorded
    at 10, 25, 45, and 65 cm depths were used as observed data sets. The observed
    data include soil moisture measurements taken at depths of 10, 25, 45, and 65
    cm. The observed soil moisture dataset, denoted as θ*(z,t), contains data from
    dry periods, typically recorded 7 days after irrigation. Daily electrical conductivity
    data, also collected at the same depths, are incorporated into the EC*(z,t) dataset.
    Additionally, daily measurements of percolation contribute to the D*(t) dataset.
    Corresponding to these data sets, the simulated data set of soil moisture, EC,
    and bottom flux were selected to represent θ’(z,t), EC’(z,t), and D’(t) in Equation
    (18). For the model simulation, essential soil hydraulic parameters include the
    fitted values of θs, θr, αv, and nv, alongside measured Ks values for the soil
    column (see Table 1). Daily measurements of LAI and root depth serve as input
    parameters for the crop model. To establish initial conditions, the pressure head
    corresponding to the observed soil moisture on the starting day is introduced
    into the model. The top surface boundary condition is set to reflect the daily
    atmospheric conditions observed during the experiment, while the lower boundary
    is treated as a gravity drainage condition. The optimization process employs GA
    parameters given in Table 2. To verify uniqueness, parameters are estimated using
    three different seed values (refer to Table 3). The optimized parameter sets for
    these seeds are nearly identical, confirming the uniqueness of parameters within
    the given objective function (Equation (18). The value of n exceeds 1, indicating
    non-linear RWU behavior in berseem. The optimized Mc value is approximately 0.66
    cm2d-1, consistent with the findings of dos Santos et al. (2017) for potential
    transpiration rates of 1 to 5 mm/day in loamy soil. Interestingly, under salinity
    conditions, berseem demonstrates considerable tolerance, with π50 ranging around
    −71.5 m when grown in loamy sand soil. Table 2. Selected genetic algorithm parameter

    3.4. Comparison of simulated and observed model response The calibrated parameters
    are used to simulate model responses, including daily variations in soil moisture
    and electrical conductivity at different depths, as well as percolation. The simulated
    responses are then compared with the experimentally observed data. Fig. 11, Fig.
    12, Fig. 13 show the comparisons between observed and simulated soil moisture,
    electrical conductivity, and percolation. Notably, the simulated soil moisture
    at depths of 10 cm, 45 cm, and 65 cm closely aligns with the observed data. However,
    at a depth of 25 cm, the simulated data do not exhibit a strong agreement with
    the observed data. This discrepancy can be attributed to slight variations in
    soil hydraulic properties resulting in different dynamics in soil–water-salt interactions.
    The observed soil moisture dynamics represents the formation of relatively low
    conductance layer where moisture is retained for a longer time. One of the main
    reasons for enhance in soil moisture retention is root growth. The root development
    causes binding and local compression of soil particles which reduces Ks (Lu et
    al., 2020, Nishiwaki et al., 2023, Shi et al., 2021). This reduction is observed
    more in fully intact young plant roots grown in sandy loam (Barley, 1954), which
    is similar to the present case of newly grown berseem in a lysimeter. Additionally,
    these variations may have arisen from over compaction during the soil-filling
    process. The rate of moisture depletion in the top layer is higher compared to
    bottom layers, and this rate decreases with depth. This is because the top layer
    is exposed to evaporation flux and experiences maximum RWU. Download : Download

    During periods of irrigation, the model tends to overestimate soil moisture. This
    is primarily due to the model’s simplification of the top boundary, assuming an
    average irrigation flux that differs from the actual flux. Additionally, this
    deviation may be slightly influenced by the model''s assumption of not accounting
    for drying and wetting hysteresis in the soil–water retention curve, making it
    less capable of representing the retention curve during wetting. Moreover, a few
    macropores were observed between the soil and the acrylic glass during the experiment,
    which were formed due to soil shrinkage. These macropores allow applied irrigation
    to move directly to the lower part of the column without being absorbed into the
    soil. However, throughout the rest of the observation period, the simulated values
    exhibit a strong correlation with the observed data. In the case of EC, except
    for the initial days of the growth period, the simulated EC values closely align
    with the observed EC levels. During the initial stage, EC levels are underestimated
    at depths of 25 cm and 45 cm. This underestimation is attributed to salt being
    directly introduced into the soil through irrigation flux in the lower layers,
    a result of the development of side macropores. As root growth is not yet well
    established during this early stage, the underestimation has a relatively minimal
    impact on RWU. Using these datasets, the model''s performance is assessed by comparing
    observed and simulated responses with various statistical measures of model performance.
    These performance indices for different model responses are presented in Table
    4. In the context of soil moisture dynamics, the RMSE values are 0.02, 0.06, 0.02,
    and 0.02 (m3m−3) at depths of 10, 25, 45, and 65 cm, respectively. These values
    indicate a good fit for the dataset, except at 25 cm. As discussed above, the
    variation at 25 cm is subjected to change in soil hydraulic properties, which
    is mainly due to root growth. The RMSE values fall well within the range of 0.01–0.02
    (m3m−3). The NS and r2 values at a depth of 10 cm are both 0.92 suggesting nearly
    a perfect alignment with observed soil moisture. While these values decline at
    greater depths (45 and 65 cm), they still remain within the acceptable range.
    The r2 values at 25 and 45 cm are lower due to lower variance between simulated
    and observed data in comparison to the variance within the simulated values. At
    25 cm, the NS is close to 0, indicating that model predictions are near the mean
    of the observed data. Table 4. Performance indices describing the correspondence
    between measured and simulated model response. Response Depth (cm) RMSE (m3m−3)

    0.505 0.911 0.950 In the case of EC, the model predictions are acceptable as RMSE
    ranging from 0.6 to 1.3 dSm−1 and r2 values falling within the range of 0.5–0.9
    for all depths. Within the top root zone during initial period, the variability
    of simulated EC due to saline irrigation application is higher as compared to
    observed EC. Consequently, the r2 values are relatively lower than the values
    for bottom root zone. Fig. 12c, shows that the observed EC values at lower depths,
    tend to reach the steady-state level of EC, which is well predicted by the model.
    Regarding percolation under gravity drainage, the model exhibits a good agreement
    with the observed data (as shown in Fig. 13). Overall, the model effectively captures
    daily percolation, with performance statistics such as r2 = 0.94, RMSE = 1.393
    mm, NRMSE = 0.504, and NS = 0.902. However, notable differences in percolation
    prediction are observed during peak periods, where the model tends to overestimate
    DP values by 10–15 %. These differences may be attributed to anomalies in soil–water
    dynamics at the 25 cm depth. 3.5. Root water uptake pattern Using the calibrated
    model, the RWU pattern is simulated for four irrigation scenarios, each with distinct
    levels of salinity: 0.25 dSm−1 (S1), 2.5 dSm−1 (S2), 5 dSm−1 (S3), 7 dSm−1 (S4).
    For reference, the model was run for one of the drying-out periods (69–93 days
    after sowing) of the berseem growth season, with the initial and boundary conditions
    same as those of observed. Fig. 14 shows how the simulated daily depth-wise RWU
    and Tr are related to soil hydraulic condition under different salinity level.
    In the case of S1 treatment, characterized as low salinity or non-salinity level,
    the influence of osmotic stress is negligible, as evidenced by Tr that remains
    consistently at 1 up to the point of water limitation. During the drier period
    (87–93 days after sowing), a noticeable reduction in RWU is observed in the upper
    layer, which is offset by increased uptake from the lower layer. In comparison
    to the S1 treatment, there is a slight reduction in RWU during the initial days
    of the S2 treatment, primarily attributed to osmotic stress. However, as the salt
    concentration diminishes, the reduced Tr gradually approaches a value closer to
    1. Throughout the drier period, the Tr values remain relatively lower than those
    observed in the case of S1. Interestingly, the compensated RWU is also negatively
    impacted by the presence of salts, leading to a reduction in total RWU. Download

    Daily depth-wise root water uptake and relative transpiration pattern under different
    levels of salinity. In the case of the S3 treatment, RWU is marginally impacted,
    with Tr value closer to 0.65 during the initial days when salt concentration is
    at its peak across the entire root depth. In the mid-period, the actual RWU is
    reduced by 18 % when compared to its potential. Furthermore, during the drier
    period, this actual RWU diminishes even further to 30 %, primarily due to the
    combined effect of water and osmotic stresses. The extent of the RWU front becomes
    shallower, thus resulting in less water extraction from deeper layers, even as
    the soil becomes drier closer to the surface. This implies that in the presence
    of high osmotic stress, the RWU compensation increased the total RWU only to a
    small extent. As the saline irrigation level increases to S4, the total RWU is
    substantially reduced to 60 % during the initial days, even though the soil is
    wet. This reduction in transpiration is due to the high presence of salt under
    non-limiting soil hydraulic conditions. The reduced Tr recovers to 70 % as the
    salt concentration decreases. The RWU front shrinks towards the surface as the
    water depleted from the upper layer. This shows the RWU compensation is negligible
    as the osmotic stress is dominates over water stress. 4. Conclusion Results for
    a hypothetical berseem growth case shows that the soil moisture during deficit
    irrigation period is most sensitive to water stress parameter Mc. In addition,
    it is least sensitive during the normal irrigation period. Unlikely, the soil
    moisture shows least sensitive to osmotic stress parameter π50 during deficit
    irrigation period and is found to be highly sensitive during the normal irrigation
    period. The variation of root water uptake (RWU) distribution parameter n has
    a large effect on soil moisture and pressure head in the upper half of root zone
    where root density is high. Similar pattern has been observed in the case of the
    pressure head response. However, the pressure head data shows a relative higher
    CTRS value than the values corresponding to soil moisture. Thereby, pressure head
    data is preferable over soil moisture for inverse estimation of these parameters.
    The CTRS results of bottom flux/percolation shows better sensitivity to all three
    parameters. Thus, in case of non-availability of pressure head data, the soil
    moisture data with percolation data can be used to inversely estimate Mc and n.
    For electrical conductivity, the deficit irrigation period dynamics of the whole
    root zone are the most valuable input for Mc, as it shows a higher CTRS value.
    To estimate π50 with the other two parameters, the electrical conductivity of
    top root zone can be incorporated into the objective function with relatively
    higher weightage. The plots of proposed objective function show that it is possible
    to estimate these three parameters simultaneously using high CTRS responses in
    the objective function. The present study also involves the estimation of RWU
    model parameters for berseem grown in a column-lysimeter. Using the proposed objective
    function, Mc, π50 and n are uniquely estimated. With the calibrated parameters,
    the model-simulated responses are further compared and evaluated with the observed
    data. The comparison results show good agreement between the simulated and observed
    data sets. The RWU rate and relative transpiration under four irrigation scenarios
    subjected to different salinity levels are evaluated. The simulation results reveal
    that under high salinity treatment RWU compensation diminishes, resulting in substantial
    reduction in RWU even for much-tolerant berseem as osmotic stress dominates over
    water stress. CRediT authorship contribution statement Amit Kumar: Data curation,

  description: The optimal allocation of agricultural water and land resources is
    of great significance in ensuring sustainable food production and economic benefits
    of farmers. However, agriculture, as an important carbon cycle ecosystem, has
    paid limited attention to carbon sequestration in the optimal allocation of water
    and land resources. Therefore, this study developed a new water-carbon-economy
    coupling model (WCECM) for optimal allocation of agricultural water and land resources.
    In this model, the minimum water scarcity, maximum carbon sequestration and maximum
    economic benefits are taken as the optimization objectives. In addition, surface
    water volume and groundwater volume and planting area etc. were defined as constraints,
    respectively. Then, the model was solved using the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic
    Algorithm III (NSGA-III) and the Entropy-weighted-TOPSIS evaluation method. The
    developed model was demonstrated in the largest Farm, Youyi Farm, which is one
    of commercial grain production base in China to analyze the optimization of water
    and land resources from 2010 to 2019. We found that the new WCECM, based on the
    simulation of a complex coupled water-carbon-economy system, can realize the optimal
    allocation of agricultural water and land resources to protect regional water
    resources, increase carbon sequestration and adjust the agricultural planting
    structure. In detail, through the multi-objective optimization model, the planting
    structure and the allocation ratio of surface water and groundwater irrigation
    water consumption are more suitable for this study area. After the optimization,
    the area planted with Rice was significantly reduced, the area planted with Maize
    was increased, and the area planted with Soybean did not change significantly
    compared with the first two crops. The planting structure has changed from focusing
    on paddy cultivation to dryland cultivation, with the ratio of Rice area, Maize
    area and Soybean area being 3:6:1. The water consumption is constrained within
    manageable limits, with an average annual irrigation water consumption of 2.01
    × 108 m3. The amount of carbon sequestered has increased significantly, with an
    average annual increase of 7.8 × 108 kg. Meanwhile, the optimized economic benefits
    increased slightly, with a value of ¥2.35 billion. In short, optimization of water
    and land resources is beneficial for improving farmers' incomes, increasing carbon
    sequestration in agriculture, and conserving water resources.

    allocationCarbon sequestrationNSGAIII 1. Introduction In agricultural production,
    water and land resources are essential elements for ensuring sustainable food
    production (Mo, 2020, Zhou et al., 2020). This complex interaction between water
    and land resources forms the bedrock upon which the edifice of food security and
    agricultural sustainability is built. Agricultural water consumption dominates
    global water withdrawal, accounting for 70% of total water consumption (Wada et
    al., 2012). As the world''s population continues to grow, there will be a significant
    increase in demand for food (Uniyal and Dietrich, 2021). However, meeting the
    demand for irrigated agricultural production often leads to a series of ecological
    and environmental problems. These challenges encompass issues such as over-exploitation
    of groundwater and the disruption of river flows. Therefore, ensuring a stable
    increase in food production is crucial, and it requires optimizing the allocation
    of water and land resources under the rigid constraints of water resources. Water
    resources and land resources are closely linked in agricultural production, and
    the quantity and efficiency of available water resources can be reflected in crop
    growth (Kang et al., 2017). Agricultural water and land allocation has implications
    for crop restructuring due to the interaction between water and land resources
    (Li et al., 2022). An appropriate planting structure can increase crop yields,
    promote food security, and support the development of the agricultural economy.
    Due to the intricate relationship of water and land resources, when establishing
    the agricultural water and land resource optimization allocation model, it is
    necessary to consider multiple indicators and complex constraints. In previous
    studies on the optimal allocation of agricultural water and land resources, researchers
    often focused on optimizing, objectives or constraints, such as minimizing water
    shortage rates and maximizing economic benefits. Pitts, Obreza (1995) achieved
    the effect of adjusting the crop planting structure and rationally allocating
    irrigation water by setting economic objectives. With the strengthening of environmental
    awareness, the ecological and environmental benefits are gradually considered
    in the optimal allocation of water and land resources. Latinopoulos (2005) proposed
    a multi-objective optimization model with a coupled economic-social-environmental
    approach to effectively allocate local water and land resources. Guo et al. (2022)
    developed a distributed multi-objective uncertain optimization model based on
    the unequal water allocation in irrigation areas and the multifaceted issues related
    to society, economy, and ecology. According to the IPCC report, the emission of
    large quantities of greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, etc.) will lead to an increase
    in the average temperature of the Earth by 1.5 °C or 2 °C by 2100, which will
    trigger a series of unpredictable ecological disasters (IPCC, 2021). In order
    to promote the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the Chinese government has
    formulated \"carbon peak\" and \"carbon neutrality\" policies (Liu et al., 2015).
    As an important carbon source and sink ecosystem, agriculture has a carbon footprint
    in all aspects of agricultural production (MacBean and Peylin, 2014). In the past
    decades, agriculture has contributed to 25% of greenhouse gas emissions, raising
    concerns about its environmental impacts (Sinha et al., 2020). This emission level
    has more than doubled in the past few decades (Tubiello et al., 2022). However,
    there are few studies on the optimal allocation of water and land resources in
    agriculture that consider the carbon footprint (Xie et al., 2023). The Youyi Farm,
    located in the Sanjiang Plain, is a commercial grain production base in China.
    It has a large proportion of arable land and generates its primary economic income
    through crop production. However, this region faces several challenges, including
    low efficiency in utilizing surface water and excessive exploitation of groundwater
    resources (Pan et al., 2019). Furthermore, the high level of mechanization at
    the Youyi Farm (Luo et al., 2023), along with practices such as fertilizer usage,
    groundwater irrigation, and crop straw handling, leads to significant carbon emissions,
    posing a threat to the local environment. At present, the government adopts practices
    such as enhancing agricultural subsidies to change the planting structure (Zheng
    et al., 2013); straw is turned over and returned (Ruan et al., 2023) to the field
    instead of straw burning to control carbon emissions. Previous research primarily
    focused on the water resources and economics of the Youyi Farm (Li, 2011, Liu
    et al., 2019). However, there is a lack of systematic research on multi-objective
    optimization of water and land resources in agriculture, including water, carbon,
    and the economy. The goal of this study was to develop a new optimal allocation
    model for agricultural water and land resources and apply it. Firstly, the study
    developed WCECM for optimal allocation of agricultural water and land resources.
    Secondly, the model was applied to the Youyi Farm and its validity was verified.
    Ultimately, the water allocation pattern and planting structure of Youyi Farm
    were optimized to address the issue of excessive groundwater exploitation in the
    region. 2. Methodology 2.1. Framework of the WCECM This paper introduces the idea
    of water-carbon-economy coupling relationship in the previous multi-objective
    optimal allocation of agricultural water and land resources, and establishes WCECM
    for agricultural water and land resources under the known utilization of agricultural
    water and land resources to provide solutions to the existing problems. Combined
    with the evaluation model solution, the final solution of the optimal allocation
    is obtained. This model mainly includes three modules, namely water resource module,
    carbon footprint module, and economic benefits module. The basic idea of model
    building is shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (540KB) Download

    The model consists of an objective function consisting of three aspects: water
    resources, carbon sequestration and the economy benefits, and a set of constraints.
    The objective is to achieve a balanced supply and demand of regional agricultural
    water and land resources, while taking into account the overall optimization of
    maximizing economic benefits, Minimum water shortage and maximum carbon sequestration.
    Ultimately, the goal of balanced and optimal allocation of regional agricultural
    water and land resources will be achieved. Unimportant formulas are placed in
    Appendix 1. The definitions of symbols used in the model is provided in the Appendix
    2. 1) Minimum water shortage: (1) 2) Maximum carbon sequestration The agricultural
    system plays a role in sequestering carbon, as crop growth involves carbon absorption,
    and returning crop residues to the soil can fix carbon dioxide to some extent
    (Feng et al., 2023b). At the same time, agricultural carbon emissions refer to
    the carbon emissions generated during agricultural production, including both
    direct and indirect emissions. Therefore, considering the recent agricultural
    development status, the sources of carbon emissions in the region are mainly considered
    from the following three aspects. First, direct carbon emissions are considered,
    followed by indirect carbon emissions resulting from CH4 emissions, and finally,
    indirect carbon emissions resulting from N2O emissions (Singh et al., 2023). Uniform
    conversion to CO2 equivalent calculations for subsequent comparison and analysis.
    (2) (3) (4) (5) The first tier of carbon emissions refers to carbon emissions
    from agricultural production (including: fertilizers, pesticides and mulch, etc.)
    from inputs of agricultural production materials, direct carbon emissions from
    agricultural production, carbon emissions from crops themselves, CO2 emissions
    from straw burning until 2013 (Wu et al., 2021) and carbon emissions from energy
    consumption for groundwater withdrawals (Dhillon et al., 2019, Siyal et al., 2021).
    From 2013, straw is calculated according to the treatment of all turning and returning
    to the field (Lili et al., 2018), with the following carbon footprint formula:
    (6) (7) (8) The second tier of carbon emissions refers to methane (CH4) emissions
    from Rice fields and is given by the following equation: (9) The third tier of
    carbon emissions refers to N2O emissions from straw burning before 2013, and from
    straw tillage and fertilizer application after 2013, calculated as: (10) (11)
    (12) 3) Maximum economic benefits (13) (14) (15) (16) 2.1.2. Constraint conditions
    These objective functions are subject to the following constraints. 1) Surface
    water volume constraint (17) Where, is the surface water consumption of crop ;
    is the total surface water consumption. 2) Groundwater volume constraint (18)
    Where, is the groundwater consumption of crop ; is the total groundwater consumption.
    3) Total water resource constraint (19) 4) Total planting area constraint (20)
    5) Non-negative constraint (21) (22) (23) 2.1.3. Optimization algorithms for model
    solving The third generation of non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-III (NSGA-III)
    (Deb and Jain, 2014) used in this paper. NSGA-III is a reference point-based non-dominated
    genetic algorithm with approximately the same framework as the NSGA-II algorithm,
    with the difference being that the mechanism for selecting individuals in the
    offspring is different: the NSGAII algorithm is based on The NSGAII algorithm
    selects individuals of the same non-dominated rank based on crowding distance
    calculation, while the NSGAIII algorithm uses a reference point-based approach
    to select offspring (Gu and Wang, 2020). This improvement in selection can solve
    the problem of insufficient convergence and diversity of the algorithm when facing
    multi-objective optimization problems with three or more objectives, making it
    easier for the algorithm to find the global optimal solution. 2.2. Entropy-weighted-TOPSIS
    evaluation model By using NSGA-III, the Pareto optimal solution set of the WCECM
    can be obtained. Further, an agricultural resource''s optimal allocation scheme
    needs to be acquired through a multi-objective decision-making model. The TOPSIS
    method ranks optimization methods according to their proximity to the ideal solution,
    which has the advantage of being objective and reliable, but suffers from the
    problem that the weight values are subjectively influenced by the decision maker
    (Xu et al., 2021). The entropy-TOPSIS method introduces information entropy into
    the TOPSIS method and uses information entropy to calculate the weight values
    of TOPSIS, reducing the bias caused by subjective weight assignment (Yuan and
    Song, 2022). The solutions are ranked in descending order of relative closeness,
    and the solution with the greatest relative closeness is the best solution. The
    indicators in the model is shown at Table 1. Table 1. The indicators in the model.

    and data Youyi Farm is located in the hinterland of the Sanjiang Plain in China,
    between 131°27′50″∼132°15′38″E and 46°28′14″∼46°59′38″N (Luo et al., 2023). The
    total area of Youyi Farm is 18.88 × 104ha. It is one of the important commodity
    grain production bases and also the largest farm in China. The study area features
    a continental monsoon climate of the middle temperate zone (Liu et al., 2019).
    The area is mainly planted with Rice, Maize and Soybean with irrigation water
    requirements of 326.1 mm, 30.1 mm and 25.1 mm, respectively. The total grain production
    is 95.1 × 104 t, and the economic benefit of agriculture is 23.1 × 108 CNY. Starting
    from 2013, all crop residues have been entirely used for returning to the field
    instead of being burned (Ruan et al., 2023), and the current comprehensive utilization
    rate of crop residues has reached 96%. The average annual surface water availability
    is 1.01 × 108 m3, and the annual average groundwater availability is 1.85 × 108
    m3 (Liu et al., 2016). The biggest problem of Youyi Farm is the unbalanced use
    of irrigation water, the inefficient use of surface water and the serious exploitation
    of groundwater ( Fig. 2). Download : Download high-res image (611KB) Download

    Farm. The Youyi Farm has been excessively exploiting groundwater year-round or
    diverting water from other water-rich regions for local agricultural irrigation,
    ignoring the water waste caused by diversion and neglecting the impact of excessive
    exploitation on the sustainable development and utilization of water resources.
    This practice does not align with the principle of sustainable development of
    resources in China. Therefore, the rigid premise of this study is to consider
    the local groundwater exploitable amount and surface water availability as the
    sole sources of available water in the area. Within the scope of available water
    resources, the study also takes into account minimizing the sacrifice of farmers''
    economic benefits. The total planting area should not be excessively reduced to
    ensure food production and food security. Additionally, the level of mechanization
    in agricultural production is relatively high, with comprehensive mechanization
    reaching 99.9% in farmland cultivation (Luo et al., 2023). The farm possesses
    a total of 43,000 agricultural machinery units with a combined power of 52 × 104
    kW from the Youyi Farm Yearbook. It is also essential to ensure that the carbon
    sequestration of crops remains within a reasonable range in order to reduce the
    negative environmental impact of carbon emissions (Tables 2 and 3). Table 2. Multi-year

    used in this paper include: (1) meteorological data (2010–2019) from the National
    Meteorological Science Data Centre (https://data.cma.cn/), (2) statistical data
    including crop acreage and production, weight of straw, population, fertilizer
    and agricultural machinery use mainly from the Youyi Farm Yearbook (2010–2019),
    and information related to surface water and groundwater availability data from
    local Hydrological stations. The surface water and groundwater water usage data
    (2010–2019) were obtained from the Water Resources Bulletin (http://slt.hlj.gov.cn).
    The water requirement of Rice, Maize and Soybean was shown in the Appendix 3.
    4. Results 4.1. Optimization results of water resources The total available water
    resource at Youyi Farm is maintained between 1.6 × 108 m3 to 3.2 × 108 m3, but
    the actual water consumption consistently exceeds the available water capacity
    (Fig. 3a). In the accessible water supply, groundwater accounts for a relatively
    high proportion, while surface water represents approximately 30% of the total
    water availability (Fig. 3b). In the actual water usage, the proportion of surface
    water consumption is around 7% of the total water consumption. However, the annual
    average surface water availability is much higher than the surface water consumption,
    with surface water consumption accounting for only 17.8% of the available surface
    water. This indicates a low efficiency in surface water utilization. Furthermore,
    the actual annual average groundwater consumption exceeds the available groundwater
    resources by approximately 1.2 × 108 m3, indicating a severe overexploitation
    of groundwater. After optimization, there has been a significant change in the
    surface water usage, with the annual average surface water consumption now at
    0.30 × 108 m3. Among the ten-year period, the highest surface water consumption
    occurred in 2015, reaching 0.87 × 108 m3 (Fig. 4a). With the improvement in surface
    water utilization efficiency, efforts have been made to use as much groundwater
    as possible for irrigation within controllable limits. The annual average groundwater
    consumption has been adjusted to 1.71 × 108 m3. Except for the year 2019, the
    groundwater usage in all other years remains below 2 × 108 m3, and the changes
    are stable and controlled (Fig. 4b). In addition, Rice water requirement is seven
    times higher than that of Maize and nearly nine times higher than that of Soybean,
    and the water requirement of paddy fields is much higher than that of dry fields.
    In 2012, there was a significant reduction in groundwater usage, and the contrast
    before and after the water consumption adjustment was most pronounced. This suggests
    that the cropping structure must have been drastically adjusted in that year while
    the crop''s need for irrigation remained unchanged. The adjusted water use for
    both Maize and Soybean in that year was the highest and most variable over the
    decade (Figs. 4e and 4f). Further suggests that the optimized year saw a large
    reduction in Rice acreage and a significant increase in Maize and Soybean acreage.
    Overall, adjusted water use for paddy is still much higher than water use for
    Maize and Soybeans. However, water use for Rice was significantly reduced due
    to available water constraints, and adjusted Rice water consumption in 2011 was
    the lowest in a decade, ultimately resulting in the lowest water consumption result
    in a decade for that year (Fig. 4d). In 2019, the available groundwater quantity
    was sufficient to meet the irrigation demands before optimization, and there was
    even a surplus. The water quantity constraints aimed to maximize the utilization
    of available water resources. As a result, after optimization, the water consumption
    increased while still ensuring a substantial portion of the available water was
    utilized. Download : Download high-res image (262KB) Download : Download full-size

    Maize (f) Soybean. 4.2. Optimization results of planting structure The original
    planting structure at Youyi Farm resulted in an annual water consumption that
    exceeds the available water resources. Due to the high irrigation demand of Rice,
    in order to maintain the total planting area unchanged and control water usage
    within a reasonable range, it is necessary to reduce the area of Rice cultivation
    and correspondingly increase the proportion of dry fields. Before the optimization,
    the average annual planting area ratio of Rice, Maize and Soybean was 6:3:1, and
    the ratio was adjusted to 3:6:1 after optimization. Except for the year 2019,
    where the available water was sufficient to meet the original irrigation requirements,
    resulting in a slight increase in Rice planting area, the Rice acreage decreased
    to varying degrees in all other years (Fig. 5a). Under the premise of limited
    available water, most years'' surface water availability and groundwater extraction
    cannot meet the original irrigation demand. As a result, the reduction in paddy
    field cultivation area after optimization is inevitable. Only in a few years when
    there is sufficient groundwater available for extraction, the optimized planting
    area for Rice will not undergo significant changes. During drought years, the
    reduction in Rice cultivation area is substantial. In 2011, the optimized Rice
    planting area was the smallest in the decade, and the most significant change
    occurred in 2012, with a decrease of approximately 70% compared to the original
    planting area. The inter-annual trend of Rice cultivation area does not completely
    mirror the trend of water availability, mainly because Rice cultivation is also
    affected by irrigation water requirement. Exactly, in 2018, despite being a year
    of abundant water, several meteorological factors led to higher irrigation water
    requirements for Rice. The result is that there is still a large amount of water
    used for rice, and the current water availability is not sufficient to meet the
    water needs of rice. This situation continued to limit Rice cultivation. As a
    consequence, the optimized Rice area decreased significantly according to the
    actual situation. Download : Download high-res image (392KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Comparison of crop planting structure pre and post optimization:
    (a) Area under Rice cultivation (b) Area under Maize cultivation (c) Area under
    Soybean cultivation. Conversely, the optimized Maize cultivation area exhibits
    varying degrees of growth each year. During dry years, the Maize planting area
    significantly increases, while during abundant water years, the change in Maize
    area is relatively small but still shows an upward trend. Among them, the year
    2017 had the largest increase in Maize planting area, with a growth rate of approximately
    1.7 times the original area. In 2019, the increase in Maize area was relatively
    small, at only 18.5%. Overall, the optimized Maize planting area showed a significant
    increase, which can be attributed to the combined effects of multiple factors.
    Maize has a better carbon sequestration effect and requires less irrigation water
    compared to paddy fields (Fig. 5b). Furthermore, the average annual planted area
    of Soybean was 0.89 × 104ha before optimization, and was adjusted to 0.83 × 104ha
    after optimization. In 2012, the optimized Soybean planted area was 13.7 × 104ha,
    which was the highest in the ten years of the Soybean optimization results, while
    in 2013, the optimized Soybean planted area was 0.52 × 104ha, which was the smallest
    planted area in the ten years of the optimization results. Overall, there was
    not a significant change in the Soybean planting area before and after optimization
    (Fig. 5c). Based on the collected data on planting structure, it was found that
    before the optimization of agricultural land and water resources in Youyi Farm,
    Rice had been the predominant crop type planted at the farm. Indeed, although
    Rice has shown favorable economic benefits, the extensive cultivation of Rice
    has led to a long-term imbalance between water supply and demand, posing a significant
    threat to the sustainable development of water resources and disrupting the local
    water and land balance. The optimization results of the increase in the area of
    Maize planting, to ease the pressure on water resources and food security can
    be fully guaranteed. 4.3. Optimization results of carbon sequestration Enhancing
    the carbon sequestration capacity of agricultural ecosystems is a necessary step
    to achieve carbon neutrality and is also of significant importance for maintaining
    the ecological health of farmlands. Before the optimization, carbon absorption
    by crops at Youyi Farm exhibited relatively stable interannual variations and
    showed a gradual overall increase. However, after the optimization, there was
    increased fluctuation in carbon sequestration levels, and the carbon sequestration
    values in each year were higher than before (Fig. 6c). Under conditions of reduced
    available water, there was significant change in the planting structure in the
    region, with an increase in the area planted with Maize. Research shows that Maize
    has a better carbon sequestration effect per unit area compared to Rice and Soybean.
    As a result, the carbon sequestration increased after optimization despite the
    reduction in available water. Before optimization, Rice accounted for the majority
    of the carbon absorption with a ten-year average carbon absorption of 58.5% (Fig.
    6a). After adjusting the planting area, Maize had the highest proportion of carbon
    absorption, accounting for 65.5% (Fig. 6d). Regarding carbon emissions, agricultural
    production materials (pre-optimization: 17.9%, post- optimization: 24.7%) were
    the second-largest contributor after Rice (pre-optimization: 73%, post- optimization:
    55.7%) (Figs. 6b and 6e). Because all straw at Youyi Farm was turned over and
    returned to the field for treatment after 2013, the share of carbon emissions
    from Maize is not high (pre-optimization: 7.8%, post-optimization: 18.2%). When
    groundwater is extracted and utilized through pumping stations, the process of
    lifting the water involves the conversion of electrical energy into the energy
    required to raise the water. This lifting process can also result in carbon emissions
    that should not be overlooked (pre-optimization: 0.4%, post-optimization: 0.3%).

    4.4. Optimization results of economic benefits Before optimization, the annual
    fluctuation of economic benefits was ¥2.31 billion. After optimization, the overall
    economic benefits increased slightly to ¥2.35 billion (Fig. 7). Specifically,
    the annual average economic benefit of Rice decreased by ¥0.56 billion after optimization,
    while the economic benefit of Maize increased by ¥0.61 billion. The main reason
    for this result is that the study prioritized the available water resources in
    the local area. The economic benefits per unit area were highest for Rice, followed
    by Maize and Soybean. Although Rice cultivation brings higher profits compared
    to Maize and Soybean, it also requires the largest amount of water among these
    three crops. Therefore, in order to ensure an adequate water supply for irrigation
    purposes, it was necessary to convert a portion of paddy fields to dry fields,
    which resulted in a reduction in Rice income. When considering the simultaneous
    optimization of multiple objectives, trade-offs are inevitable to achieve the
    best optimization results. Among the years analyzed, the year 2019 yielded the
    best optimization results with an economic benefit of ¥2.64 billion. On the other
    hand, in 2012, the economic performance was the poorest after optimization, with
    an economic benefit of only ¥1.81 billion. The year 2012 had the largest difference
    in economic benefits pre and post optimization, with a gap of ¥0.44 billion. In
    that year, the available groundwater resources were insufficient to support the
    original main cropping structure of paddy fields, leading to an increase in dry
    field area. Download : Download high-res image (132KB) Download : Download full-size

    In contrast to previous studies (Feng et al., 2023, Feng et al., 2023; Sun et
    al., 2018; Zhu et al., 2023), the WCECM proposed in this study considers water
    deficit, carbon sequestration and economic benefits. In particular, it focuses
    on the consideration of carbon sinks from carbon sources in agriculture and puts
    the focus on the impacts of agricultural activities, crop growth and greenhouse
    gas emissions on the carbon cycle, which allows us to propose a water and land
    resource allocation scheme that is more satisfying to the sustainable development
    of each resource. At the same time, the NSGA-III optimization algorithm is used
    to manage the overall distribution of solutions (Gu and Wang, 2020). It achieves
    this by establishing reference points that help decrease the solution density
    (Deb and Jain, 2014). This ensures the diversity of the resultant population and
    makes it easier to converge. While the scope of application is expanded, its convergence
    effect is better than that of NSGA-II (Ishibuchi et al., 2016). In addition, the
    NSGA-III optimization algorithm can consider multiple conflicting objectives at
    the same time, so it is suitable for complex optimization problems in the case
    of limited resources. Currently, this method has been used many times in multi-objective
    problems (Li et al., 2023, Li et al., 2023, Zhang et al., 2023), and all of them
    have obtained the desired results. From the adjusted results, we find that the
    cropping structure changes with the amount of water available, which is consistent
    with the experimental results of other studies (de Fraiture, 2007, Wu et al.,
    2022, Zhang et al., 2022). The water availability could not satisfy the original
    planting structure. Meanwhile, under the total planting area limitation, scaling
    down the area of high economic return Rice planting to increase the area of dryland
    will inevitably cause a decline in economic income, which is inconsistent with
    the results of (Talukdar et al., 2022). Due to the different perspectives of considering
    the problem, the pursuit of economic efficiency and yield may neglect the impacts
    on the environment and ecosystems. Protecting water resources and maintaining
    ecological balance and ecological health are equally important in agricultural
    development. Over-abstraction of groundwater may lead to environmental problems
    such as lowering of the water table and salinization of the soil (Pulido-Bosch
    et al., 2018), affecting the sustainable development of farmland. When water resources
    are scarce, adjusting the appropriate cropping structure is more suitable than
    reducing irrigation quotas (Chellattan Veettil et al., 2011). In addition, crops
    absorb carbon dioxide through photosynthesis, which not only promotes their own
    growth, but also plays a certain role as a carbon sink in the ecosystem. At the
    same time, crop residue burning, as well as agricultural means of production generate
    greenhouse gas emissions (Xu et al., 2013). The results of this study demonstrate
    that increasing the cultivation area of Maize contributes to an overall enhancement
    of carbon sequestration effects. Rice is a wetland crop, and during its growth,
    its root system and underground parts grow in water, which can lead to some degree
    of CH4 emissions (Laanbroek, 2010). The greenhouse effect of methane is tens of
    times higher than that of carbon dioxide (Hayes, 2004), further illustrating the
    importance of carbon sequestration. Reducing Rice cultivation significantly contributes
    to lowering total carbon emissions, underscoring that rice serves as a substantial
    carbon source (Chivenge et al., 2020). As WCECM can only constrain and allocate
    resources according to given conditions, there should be variations in practical
    problems due to technological constraints, cost limitations, and so on. Promote
    continuous upgrading and innovation of agricultural technologies (Wang et al.,
    2023), such as developing more efficient irrigation technologies, improving water
    use efficiency, and replacing appropriate fertilization techniques and cultivation
    methods to reduce carbon emissions. Optimization models should consider the economic
    costs of crop cultivation, water use and carbon reduction. Ensure that the scenarios
    proposed by the model are feasible in terms of cost and that the model results
    can be realized in practice by, for example, increasing the price of the crop
    or increasing the subsidy for planting (Chandio et al., 2022). Increase farmers''
    awareness and acceptance of new technologies and sustainable agricultural development
    through farmer training and technical support to make the optimization model''s
    recommendations easier to implement (Li et al., 2023, Li et al., 2023). The government
    can introduce policies to encourage farmers to switch to low-carbon farming practices,
    thus facilitating the practical implementation of the model. The implementation
    of the optimization model requires the collaboration of many parties, including
    the government, farmers, research institutes and the community (Bhattacharya and
    Fayezi, 2021). By collaborating with multiple stakeholders, the full potential
    of each participant can be harnessed to collectively promote the practical feasibility
    of the model. Considering the complexity and long-term nature of agriculture,
    the implementation of WCECM requires long-term planning to ensure sustainability
    and continuous improvement. By integrating technical, economic, policy and social
    factors, WCECM can be made more relevant and practically feasible, and will have
    a greater positive impact in practice. The following points represent the limitations
    of this study. Firstly, this study used the entire irrigation area as the analytical
    unit and did not consider variations in actual economic benefits and well-being
    among different farmers or individual fields (Harik et al., 2023). Variations
    in land ownership, agricultural technology levels, and economic conditions among
    individual farmers were not accounted for. Secondly, the study did not take into
    account the contributions of farmland to ecosystems, such as water purification
    and biodiversity conservation (Li et al., 2021). Finally, while various carbon
    sources and sinks were mentioned, the study''s analysis of carbon footprints could
    be expanded and refined (Zhang et al., 2021). A more detailed and comprehensive
    examination of carbon footprints, including their sources and impacts, would provide
    a more thorough understanding of the environmental implications of resource allocation
    decisions. In subsequent study, we will refine the above points. 6. Conclusions
    This study develops WCECM for optimal allocation of agricultural water and land
    resources. The model was applied to the Youyi Farm in the Sanjiang Plain, a commercial
    grain production base in China to address the issues of inappropriate planting
    structure, excessive exploitation of groundwater resources, and insufficient carrying
    capacity of agricultural water and land resources. Based on the findings from
    the study, the following conclusions can be drawn: (1) The optimal allocation
    model for agricultural water and land based on water-carbon-economy coupling proposed
    in this study not only considers the concept of sustainable development with water
    resources as a rigid constraint, but also considers the economic benefits and
    carbon sequestration after adjusting the planting structure. By addressing the
    issue of inappropriate crop structure, the optimization not only ensures basic
    food production and food security but also increases carbon sequestration and
    economic benefits. Therefore, the research results also provide recommendations
    for agricultural development and ecological conservation in the Northeast region
    of China. (2) Before optimization, the annual available groundwater volume was
    1.91 × 108 m3, and the annual available surface water volume was 0.9 × 108 m3.
    The annual groundwater usage was 3.10 × 108 m3, while the annual surface water
    usage was 0.16 × 108 m3. Before optimization, groundwater is over-exploited while
    surface water use is inefficient. After optimization, the annual groundwater usage
    reduced to 1.70 × 108 m3, and the annual surface water usage increased to 0.30 × 108
    m3. (3) Compared to before optimization, effectively controlling water resources
    within a reasonable range and transitioning from a predominant paddy field planting
    pattern to a predominant dry field pattern in the Youyi Farm (Rice: Maize: Soybean=3:6:1
    after optimization). After the adjustments, carbon sequestration has increased
    by about 7.8 × 108 kg on average, Maize''s carbon absorption surpasses that of
    Rice, while Rice consistently maintains the highest proportion of carbon emissions.
    And the optimized economic benefits increased slightly, with a value of ¥2.35
    billion. CRediT authorship contribution statement J.X.S. and P.Q. conceived the

  description: 'Sustainable rice farming practices are urgently needed to meet increasing
    food demand, cope with water scarcity, and mitigate climate change. Traditional
    farming methods that prioritize a single objective, such as increasing crop yield,
    reducing irrigation water consumption, or minimizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
    have proven to be insufficient. Simultaneously optimizing multiple competing rice
    farming objectives remains less explored. The present study aimed to increase
    current rice yield, reduce irrigation water consumption, and tackle the dilemma
    to reduce GHG (CH4 and N2O) emissions at once. Using a heuristic and holistic
    method, we optimized farm management, focusing on irrigation regimes, sowing window,
    fertilization rate, tillage depth, and their interactions. We calibrated and validated
    the process-based DeNitrification–DeComposition (DNDC) model with 5 years of eddy
    covariance observations in a rice paddy site. The DNDC model was integrated with
    a Pareto-based non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III) to solve the
    multi-objective optimization problem. Results show that current farm management
    practices have failed to achieve the potential yield and imposed high environmental
    costs in the form of water use (604–810 mm/yr) and GHG emissions (CH4: 186–220
    kg C/ha/yr; N2O: 0.3–1.6 kg C/ha/yr). By contrast, our new approach suggested
    that the optimized management could maintain or even increase current crop yield
    to its potential (∼10 t/ha), while reducing irrigation demand and GHG emissions
    by >50 %. Our results suggest that earlier sowing, combined with improved irrigation
    practices, may play a crucial role in maximizing crop yield and potentially providing
    environmental benefits. We found that the optimal proportion of non-flooded days
    was around 54 % of the growing season length, and the optimal stage for non-flooding
    days was the vegetative stage. Our approach could further be applied to evaluate
    the environmental sustainability of farming systems under various climate and
    local conditions, and to guide policymaking and farming practices.'

    Highlights • Multi-objective optimization of rice production via Pareto fronts
    computed with NSGA-III. • Coupled with process model DNDC to calculate yield,
    water use, CH4 and N2O emissions. • Increased rice yield is achievable with reduced
    irrigation and greenhouse gas emissions. Abstract Sustainable rice farming practices
    are urgently needed to meet increasing food demand, cope with water scarcity,
    and mitigate climate change. Traditional farming methods that prioritize a single
    objective, such as increasing crop yield, reducing irrigation water consumption,
    or minimizing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, have proven to be insufficient.
    Simultaneously optimizing multiple competing rice farming objectives remains less
    explored. The present study aimed to increase current rice yield, reduce irrigation
    water consumption, and tackle the dilemma to reduce GHG (CH4 and N2O) emissions
    at once. Using a heuristic and holistic method, we optimized farm management,
    focusing on irrigation regimes, sowing window, fertilization rate, tillage depth,
    and their interactions. We calibrated and validated the process-based DeNitrification–DeComposition
    (DNDC) model with 5 years of eddy covariance observations in a rice paddy site.
    The DNDC model was integrated with a Pareto-based non-dominated sorting genetic
    algorithm (NSGA-III) to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. Results
    show that current farm management practices have failed to achieve the potential
    yield and imposed high environmental costs in the form of water use (604–810 mm/yr)
    and GHG emissions (CH4: 186–220 kg C/ha/yr; N2O: 0.3–1.6 kg C/ha/yr). By contrast,
    our new approach suggested that the optimized management could maintain or even
    increase current crop yield to its potential (∼10 t/ha), while reducing irrigation
    demand and GHG emissions by >50 %. Our results suggest that earlier sowing, combined
    with improved irrigation practices, may play a crucial role in maximizing crop
    yield and potentially providing environmental benefits. We found that the optimal
    proportion of non-flooded days was around 54 % of the growing season length, and
    the optimal stage for non-flooding days was the vegetative stage. Our approach
    could further be applied to evaluate the environmental sustainability of farming
    systems under various climate and local conditions, and to guide policymaking
    and farming practices. Graphical abstract Download : Download high-res image (236KB)

    1. Introduction By around 2050, the global population will reach 10 billion, and
    food production will have to be doubled (Ray et al., 2013; Tilman et al., 2011)
    while also achieving carbon neutrality (Flagg, 2015). Rice (Oryza sativa) is a
    vital cereal crop that feeds more than 50 % of the world''s population, and over
    90 % of all rice is cultivated in Asia (Bouman and Tuong, 2001; Dong and Xiao,
    2016). Rice, domesticated from wild grass as a semiaquatic crop in Yangtze Valley,
    China (Fuller et al., 2009; Gross and Zhao, 2014; Li et al., 2006b), has been
    cultivated globally for ∼4000 years in flooded paddies, which recreate the original
    subtropical growing environment, suppress weeds, and maintain yield (Gutaker et
    al., 2020; Zong et al., 2007). However, with traditional anaerobic management,
    rice production consumes ∼40 % of global irrigation water (Lampayan et al., 2015)
    and is responsible for ∼10 % of global anthropogenic methane (Saunois et al.,
    2020). Unfortunately, 4 billion people and many Asian countries that cultivate
    rice already face severe water scarcity (Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2016). To slow
    climate warming, numerous countries have committed to achieving carbon neutrality
    within the next few decades. As the largest water consumer in the agricultural
    sector and dominant anthropogenic methane emitter, flooded rice farming is no
    longer sustainable in the face of water scarcity (Gosling and Arnell, 2016), carbon-neutral
    pledges (Flagg, 2015), and global warming (Naylor et al., 2007; Qu et al., 2018;
    Zhao et al., 2017). We urgently need new paradigms for cultivating rice sustainably.
    Considerable research has been conducted on strategies to decrease water consumption
    and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions while maintaining grain yield. Altering soil
    redox conditions through drainage management has received significant attention
    (Bo et al., 2022; Kudo et al., 2014; LaHue et al., 2016; Li et al., 2006a; Meijide
    et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2006). A global meta-analysis revealed that non-continuous
    flooding can mitigate CH4 budgets by 53 %, but also substantially increased N2O
    emissions by 105 % and decreased crop yield by 3.6 % (Jiang et al., 2019a). By
    periodically draining paddies, a farming technique known as alternate wetting
    and drying (AWD) can potentially reduce irrigation water requirements by up to
    38 % without negatively impacting crop yields. (Lampayan et al., 2015). Similarly,
    midseason drainage can significantly reduce CH4 emissions (50–53 %) and global
    warming potential (GWP) (46–50 %), but could increase N2O emissions (20–37 %)
    (Haque et al., 2016). Early season drainage also can effectively reduce GWP while
    maintaining crop yield and constraining N2O emissions in a growth chamber experiment
    (Islam et al., 2018). Thus, careful planning of the duration and timing of drainage
    events is crucial to achieve sustainability in rice farming. Mechanistic models
    and field experiments are the main methods used to investigate the effects of
    various water-saving regimes (Chen et al., 2016; Fumoto et al., 2010; Liang et
    al., 2016; Linquist et al., 2015; Minamikawa et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2021).
    AWD is recognized as the most promising water management approach and has been
    adopted in many regions (Ishfaq et al., 2020). Nevertheless, emissions of long-lived
    N2O could also surge (30–45 times) in association with non-continuous flooding
    management (Kritee et al., 2018). Anaerobic decomposition (Neue, 1993) and aerobic
    nitrification processes (Bouwman, 1998) present a challenge to reducing CH4 and
    N2O emissions simultaneously (Li et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2019). In the context
    of rice production systems, while bi-objective optimization problems have been
    thoroughly investigated, few studies have aimed to optimize three or more objectives
    at once. Ensuring sustainability in agriculture requires the management of multiple
    factors (Shang et al., 2021). These farming practices impact sustainability and
    call for a new paradigm that manages them in an integrated manner, including but
    not limited to irrigation events (Jiang et al., 2019a), the type and rate of fertilization
    (Pandey et al., 2021; Zhong et al., 2016), straw addition (Jiang et al., 2019b),
    and tillage depth (Zhao et al., 2020). Adopting a holistic approach could help
    manage the trade-off between conserving water resources and maximizing grain yield,
    as well as reduce CH4 and N2O emissions. Current methods (e.g., AWD) are valuable
    to mitigate negative environmental impacts and achieve socioeconomic benefits
    (Chen et al., 2016; Fumoto et al., 2010; Liang et al., 2016; Linquist et al.,
    2015; Minamikawa et al., 2016; Tian et al., 2021), but relying solely on these
    methods is unlikely to achieve carbon neutrality in the mid of 21st century. Few
    studies have considered the interactions among water regimes, fertilization and
    other farm management options through field experiments or scenario modeling (Kim
    et al., 2014; Towprayoon et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2020). The upper limits of
    irrigated rice farming systems in terms of crop yield, GHG emissions, and water
    consumption remain unclear if integrated management is fully explored. Furthermore,
    determining the optimal solution through field experiments or biogeochemical models
    (e.g., DNDC) while relying on a limited number of numerical experiments becomes
    particularly challenging when faced with the need to balance multiple competing
    objectives. Coupling a process-based model with a Pareto-dominance-based optimization
    algorithm is a promising solution to efficiently resolve multi-objective problems
    (Coleman et al., 2017; Groot et al., 2012; Kropp et al., 2019). In the 19th century,
    the economists Francis Edgeworth and Vilfredo Pareto introduced multi-objective
    optimization (MOO) algorithms (de Weck, 2004). Among the available MOO methods,
    evolutionary algorithms are a state-of-the-art option to approximate the Pareto
    efficiency/front inspired by natural evolution (selection, recombination, and
    mutation) (Emmerich and Deutz, 2018). In general, for process models with widely
    varying combinations of inputs (e.g., farm management variables), the optimization
    algorithm evaluates the model outputs and arrives at a set of solutions that possess
    the optimal values with respect to the target objectives (e.g., crop yield) (Prina
    et al., 2018). The optimal solutions jointly comprise the Pareto front, and none
    of the objectives can be further improved without negatively affecting the others.
    This represents an efficient and powerful method to balance the trade-offs in
    decision-making and planning without the need for sophisticated mathematical equations.
    The present study introduces an interdisciplinary and heuristic approach for designing
    an environmentally sustainable rice farming system. We estimated Pareto fronts
    in the context of CH4 budgets, N2O emissions, irrigation water consumption, and
    crop yield. After extensively validating a wide range of DNDC outputs to examine
    the robustness of the model, we integrated the process-based DNDC model with the
    non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-III). By simultaneously managing
    flooding events, fertilization, and other pivotal farm management regimes, our
    new method can help optimize irrigated rice farming systems in terms of food security,
    GHG emissions, and water resources. Finally, we attempted to answer the following
    key questions: I. Can DNDC-NSGA-III optimization increase rice yield with a lower
    irrigation water requirement? II. Can DNDC-NSGA-III optimization reduce CH4 and
    N2O emissions simultaneously? 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Overall design and
    study site Fig. 1 illustrates the comprehensive study design and the proposed
    multi-objective optimization framework. The approach employed in this study encompasses
    eight steps, leading to the attainment of stable Pareto fronts (Fig. 1). 1. DNDC
    calibration: The first step involves calibrating the DNDC model using rice biomass
    and phenology data. 2. Execution with auxiliary information: Weather records and
    additional data such as soil properties are utilized in the execution of the model.
    Supplementary Table. 1 provides detailed parameter values for running the DNDC
    model. 3. Validation: The model''s performance is validated against measurements
    of gross primary productivity (GPP), evapotranspiration (ET), ecosystem respiration
    (Reco), CH4, crop yield, soil moisture, and soil temperature data. 4. Design constraints
    and random initialization: Variation in farm management is constrained, and random
    parental populations are used as the initial DNDC model inputs. 5. Objective function:
    The DNDC model is executed, and objective function values are obtained. 6. Fitness
    evaluation: Fitness refers to a measure of the performance of a solution and is
    primarily evaluated based on the non-dominated sorting rank. 7. Offspring generation
    and iteration: Based on the ranking of fitness, new offspring are generated through
    selection, crossover, and mutation. These new offspring are subsequently used
    for a new round of DNDC execution. 8. Iteration: The process from step 5 to step
    7 is iterated for ten generations to achieve the Pareto fronts. Download : Download

    and the integrated multi-objective optimization framework. This study was conducted
    using data collected at a rice paddy site (38.2013°N, 127.2505°E), in Cherwon,
    South Korea, which is part of both the Korean Flux Network (KoFlux) and AsiaFlux.
    During the study period (2016–2020), the farmer adopted a single cropping system
    and midseason drainage practice for the early ripening japonica variety “Odae”.
    The site has a temperate monsoon climate. In the last three decades, the annual
    mean air temperature and precipitation were 10.2 °C and 1390 mm, respectively
    (Huang et al., 2018). The growing season typically starts in late April and ends
    in early September. 2.2. DNDC model To assess the impacts of farm management on
    rice yield, GHG emissions, and irrigation requirements, we applied the process-based
    DNDC (version 9.5). The DNDC model is a carbon and nitrogen biogeochemistry model
    developed for agroecosystems that comprises the following core interacting sub-modules:
    thermal-hydraulic, decomposition, denitrification, fermentation, and plant growth
    (Gilhespy et al., 2014; Giltrap et al., 2010; Li et al., 1992). The DNDC can accurately
    predict the emissions of several GHGs (CO2, CH4, and N2O), GPP, Reco, ET, as well
    as crop growth and soil environments, under a wide range of climate conditions
    and farming practices (Chen et al., 2016; Jiang et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2019;
    Zhao et al., 2020). To properly run the DNDC model, we first calibrated and provided
    soil physicochemical and crop parameters including soil texture (silt clay loam),
    soil organic carbon, bulk density, growing degree days, maximum biomass production,
    and biomass fraction, using data from our previous studies (Huang et al., 2018;
    Hwang et al., 2020). After thoroughly validating DNDC simulations using daily
    and annual field observations (crop yield, CH4, GPP, Reco, ET, Soil moisture,
    Soil temperature), we integrated the model with a MOO algorithm (Section 2.5).
    For a detailed explanation of the DNDC model structure, see Gilhespy et al. (2014).
    2.3. In situ data The in situ data utilized in this study builds upon and complements
    the findings from our prior research (Huang et al., 2018; Hwang et al., 2020;
    Kim et al., 2019). CO2 and CH4 fluxes, latent heat flux, and meteorological data
    including air temperature, precipitation, wind speed, net radiation and humidity
    were recorded at 30-min intervals using an eddy covariance system mounted at a
    10-meter-high tower. The majority of the observed flux originated from the three
    paddy field plots, with only a minor contribution coming from the surrounding
    plots (Hwang et al., 2020). The eddy covariance system comprises the following
    instruments: a three-dimensional sonic anemometer (CSAT3; Campbell Scientific,
    Inc.), a closed path infrared gas analyzer (LI-7200; LI-COR Inc.), an open-path
    CH4 analyzer based on wavelength modulation spectroscopy (LI-7700; LI-COR, Inc.)
    (Hwang et al., 2020). A nighttime method was used to partition CO2 fluxes into
    GPP and Reco. To fill the missing CO2 and CH4 fluxes, we employed the marginal
    distribution sampling method (Reichstein et al., 2005). This approach computes
    the median of CO2 [CH4] flux under comparable meteorological conditions over a
    14-day period and fills in any missing values with this calculated median. The
    30-min GPP (μmol CO2 m−2 s−1) data were aggregated into daily GPP (g C m−2 d−1)
    and annual GPP (kg C ha−1 yr−1) to align with the format used in DNDC model outputs.
    The same method was also applied to Reco, ET, and CH4 fluxes at either daily or
    annual scales. For detailed descriptions of the flux measurement and data processing,
    see Hwang et al. (2020). Soil volumetric water content and temperature were measured
    at 30-min intervals at depths of 0–0.1 m and 0.1–0.2 m, respectively, using four
    soil moisture and temperature sensors (CS655; Campbell Scientific, Inc.). Other
    data, including crop yield, rice phenology, irrigation schedule, and fertilization
    (12.02 g N m−2, with an N/P/K ratio of 18:7:9), were obtained from farming records
    and field measurements (Huang et al., 2018; Hwang et al., 2020; Kim et al., 2019).
    We used a grain carbon content of 0.42 and grain moisture content of 8.35 %, as
    measured by our previous study (Huang et al., 2018), to convert the dry crop yield
    (kg C ha−1) from DNDC to fresh weight format (t ha−1) for comparison with field
    observations. For detailed descriptions of the field study and data processing,
    see Huang et al. (2018). The in-situ records were later used to validate the DNDC
    simulation results at the daily and annual scale. To validate the annual DNDC
    simulation results, we utilized data that had undergone quality control and gap-filling
    using the marginal distribution sampling method, following the KoFlux protocol
    (Hong et al., 2009; Kang et al., 2018). The uncertainty of the annual sum of flux
    was determined by taking into account both random errors and data gaps (Kang et
    al., 2023; Richardson and Hollinger, 2007). To validate the daily DNDC simulation
    results for GPP, Reco, CH4 emissions and ET, we utilized gap-filled data and applied
    a threshold to the observed percentile, set at > 50–55 %. Due to the unclosed
    energy balance issue that commonly affects eddy covariance measurements, we corrected
    the measured ET as follows: ETcorrected = (Rn - G)/(Huncorrected + ETuncorrected)
    × ETuncorrected, where Rn is the net radiation, H is the sensible heat flux, and
    G is the soil heat flux (Jung et al., 2010; Twine et al., 2000). 2.4. Multi-objective
    optimization (MOO) algorithm Scalarization approaches and the Edgeworth-Pareto
    principle are important to solve MOO problems efficiently (Emmerich and Deutz,
    2018; Gunantara, 2018; de Weck, 2004). Scalarization methods, such as the linear
    weighting, Chebyshev distance and ε-constraint methods, are deductive reasoning
    approaches that decompose a multi-objective problem into a single objective by
    assembling objective functions or reconstructing them as constraints. Prior knowledge
    is needed to design the constraints and parameters of the scalarization function.
    In contrast, the Edgeworth-Pareto principle uses inductive reasoning to identify
    the Pareto front/set that contains a series of optimal solutions (so-called Pareto-nondominated
    solutions). In the present study, to allow the algorithm enumerating potential
    optimal solutions on the Pareto front, we adopted the Pareto-based algorithm NSGA-III
    to solve multi-objective (> 3) optimization problems (Deb and Jain, 2014). We
    implemented the NSGA-III algorithm with the Distributed Evolutionary Algorithms
    in Python (DEAP) library (Rainville et al., 2012). Overall, NSGA-III uses a combination
    of non-dominated sorting and reference point-based search to efficiently and effectively
    approach the Pareto front (Deb and Jain, 2014; Jain and Deb, 2014). The overall
    procedures for solving a multi-objective optimization problem with NSGA-III are
    as follows: I. Initialization: NSGA-III starts by creating an initial population
    of candidate solutions. Each solution is represented as a vector of decision variables
    that define the problem. II. Non-dominated sorting: The population is sorted into
    different levels of non-dominated solutions, where the first level contains the
    best non-dominated solutions, the second level contains the next best solutions,
    and so on. This is done by comparing the objective values of each solution to
    the others in the population. III. Reference points: NSGA-III uses reference points
    to guide the search process towards a diverse set of non-dominated solutions.
    As a result, it leads to a uniform distribution of solutions on the Pareto front
    in the objective space. These reference points are vectors of ideal objective
    values that represent desirable solutions for the problem being solved, and they
    are typically obtained by analyzing the objective values of the non-dominated
    solutions found in previous iterations of the algorithm. IV. Selection: NSGA-III
    selects the solutions that will be used to create the next generation of candidate
    solutions. This is done by first selecting the best non-dominated solutions from
    each level and then using the reference points to choose the remaining solutions.
    V. Crossover and mutation: The selected solutions are combined through crossover
    and mutation to create the next generation of candidate solutions. VI. Iteration:
    Steps II to V are repeated until a stopping criterion is met, such as a maximum
    number of generations or a desired level of convergence. VII. Output: The final
    output of NSGA-III is the set of non-dominated solutions found in the last generation
    of candidate solutions. These solutions represent the Pareto front of the optimization
    problem and can be used to make decisions about the trade-offs between the different
    objectives (Deb and Jain, 2014; Jain and Deb, 2014). 2.5. DNDC-NSGA-III integration
    and optimization The DNDC model was used to compute objective functions (Eq. (1)),
    which were then coupled with the NSGA-III optimization algorithm. The optimization
    framework was partly based on previous work (Prina et al., 2018). The scripts
    that implement the DNDC-NSGA-III integration and optimization are available at
    [https://github.com/Heeheedaa/DNDC-NSGA-III]. Because the source code of the DNDC
    model was not available, we used the Python library ‘pyautogui’ to automate interactions
    between the DNDC model and NSGA-III algorithm. We addressed the following four
    objective functions derived from the DNDC model: (1) Where denotes the collection
    of objective functions, denotes the objective that needs to be maximized (e.g.,
    crop yield simulated from the DNDC model), and denotes the objective that needs
    to be minimized. The DNDC model does not directly compute irrigation water consumption.
    Thus, we used the water balance method to retrieve annual irrigation demand, as
    follows: (2) The objective functions were subject to the following constraints:
    (3) In addition, the objective functions were also subject to the following irrigation
    schedules. To maintain simplicity and practicality, we scheduled 10 flooding events
    with a duration of about 0–15 days, which randomly started half-monthly and ended
    in the middle or end of each month. Each flooding event received the same amount
    of water, which is indicated as continuous flooding (10 cm) in the DNDC model.
    The optimization framework was partly based on previous work (Prina et al., 2018)
    and comprised the following processes. First, we set up the NSGA-III algorithm,
    constraints, and objective functions and initialized a parental population with
    random solutions; 4500 individuals were generated, corresponding to 4500 random
    farm management practices (sowing, fertilization, tillage, and irrigation). Second,
    we computed the values of the objective functions by executing the DNDC model
    with each solution; we used the averaged climate data (2016–2020) and assumed
    that the soil properties remained stable during the study period. Third, we evaluated
    the performance of each individual by ranking the fitness of its objective functions.
    Fitness is a measure of how well a solution performs was and is calculated based
    on the non-dominated sorting rank. Then, we generated a new generation through
    selection, crossover, and mutation, based on fitness. Finally, Pareto fronts were
    generated after all 10 pre-defined generations had been evaluated. By testing
    the NSGA-III with various population sizes and generations, we found that the
    configuration of 4500 individuals and 10 generations could obtain stable Pareto
    fronts. For different farming management combinations, a smaller population or
    fewer generations would either omit potential non-dominated solutions/sets (none
    of the objectives can be improved without detriment of the others) or result in
    a biased Pareto front. Conversely, we found that larger populations or more generations
    were considerably more time-consuming but did not further improve the Pareto fronts
    in this study. 3. Results 3.1. DNDC model validation The performance of the DNDC
    model was evaluated through in situ observations at both the annual scales (Fig.
    2) and daily (Fig. 3, Fig. 4) scales regarding a series of key outputs, including
    crop yield, ET, GPP, Reco, CH4, soil moisture, and soil temperature. At the annual
    scale, we found that DNDC reasonably captured the mean annual sum values and interannual
    variation in four key objectives, including crop yield, CH4 emissions, GPP dynamics,
    and ET budgets (Fig. 2a–d). Download : Download high-res image (421KB) Download

    area represents the growing season. At the daily scale, DNDC simulated CH4 flux
    well under the current midseason drainage practice, throughout the study period
    (R2 = 0.56, RMSE = 0.06 g C/m2 d−1; Fig. 3a). However, DNDC greatly overestimated
    GPP during the early growing season, with a sudden increase from 0 to ∼80 kg C/ha
    occurring following sowing (Fig. 3b). In contrast, GPP simulations matched observations
    from around the middle of the growing seasons to the rest of the study period
    (R2 = 0.68, RMSE = 2.9 g C/m2 d−1). DNDC captured Reco reasonably well during
    the growing seasons (R2 = 0.75, RMSE = 1.4 g C/m2 d−1), but also underestimated
    the flux by ∼1–2 (g C m−2 d−1) during the non-growing seasons. Importantly, we
    observed minor effects of early season GPP mismatch on annual crop yield estimations,
    as depicted in Fig. 2a. Daily-scale ET simulations showed a moderate agreement
    with the observations (R2 = 0.31, RMSE = 1.73 mm/d; Fig. 4). During growing seasons,
    the DNDC model tracked effectively the dynamics of soil moisture (R2 = 0.49, RMSE
    = 0.1 m3/ m3, Fig. 4b) and soil temperature (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 4.5 °C, Fig. 4c)
    under the current midseason drainage practice. 3.2. DNDC-NSGA-III inferred Pareto
    fronts To illustrate the process of approaching Pareto fronts through DNDC-NSGA-III
    optimization, we present a comparison of dominated solutions (Fig. 5, gray dots)
    and non-dominated sets (Fig. 5, colored dots). To see how the solutions are distributed
    along the front, we also present Pareto fronts in the form of probability density
    distributions of each pair of objectives (Fig. 5). This approach can help us identify
    clusters of solutions that have similar trade-offs between objectives, and also
    identify the regions with the highest density of solutions. By comparing current
    farming outcomes (Fig. 5a and b), we found that a crop yield of approximately
    8.6 t/ha could be achieved with only ∼25 % CH4 emissions, ∼29 % water consumption,
    and similar N2O emissions. Furthermore, the optimization framework suggests a
    higher crop yield of around 10 t/ha could be obtained while reducing irrigation
    demand and GHG emissions by over 50 %. Download : Download high-res image (1MB)

    farming outcomes based on current management (2016–2020). To highlight the areas
    for improvement, we present gaps between current farming outcomes (Fig. 5, black
    triangles) and optimized objectives (Fig. 5, colored dots). Current rice yields
    remained relatively high, but at great environmental cost in terms of both CH4
    emissions (Fig. 5a, black triangles) and water consumption (Fig. 5b, black triangles).
    Current farming practices exhibit significant discrepancies when compared to the
    optimized objectives suggested by the model (Fig. 5a–f, black triangles to Pareto
    fronts), particularly with regards to CH4 emissions and irrigation water consumption
    (Fig. 5c). In addition, based on simulations conducted with current practices,
    the majority of the pairs of objectives (between crop yield and N2O emissions)
    were located in the non-dominated sets (Fig. 5d, colored region); however, there
    were considerable gaps of current farming outcomes to the Pareto front (Fig. 5d).
    The 2-D Pareto fronts are informative regarding results for two objectives, but
    they might be misleading if an additional objective is considered. Therefore,
    we also plotted 3-D Pareto fronts in order to determine the outcome for each triplet
    state (Fig. 6). We found that the current farming practices led to a mean crop
    yield that reached 87% of its potential level (∼10 t/ha). However, most of the
    pairs of objectives (blue triangles) fell out of the optimal sets (colorized planform,
    Fig. 6). Compared to the current farming systems, optimized management would almost
    achieve the full potential rice yield while reducing CH4 emissions (Figs. 5a &
    6b) and water consumption (Figs. 5e and 6b) by more than 50 %, and maintaining
    similar N2O emissions (Figs. 5d and 6a). Download : Download high-res image (700KB)

    To demonstrate how Pareto fronts were achieved (Figs. 5 and 6), we show the associated
    farm management density distributions (Fig. 7). The distributions were shown in
    the same color palettes as Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, and therefore, indicate the optimization
    process to approach Pareto fronts, rather than the “optimal management practices”
    per se. We found that modeled irrigation schedules converged to form several narrow
    time windows in each month (Fig. 7a–e). This convergence, depicted in the upper
    right corner of Fig. 7b and c, was associated with an increased likelihood of
    late initiation of irrigation in the early to middle growing season. In contrast,
    an early irrigation schedule increased the probability of initiation in the peak
    to late growing season (Fig. 7d and e). Download : Download high-res image (2MB)

    rate; (e) sowing day and tillage depth; (f) tillage depth and fertilization rate.
    The red-blue color bar indicates the probability density. Non-dominated sowing
    occurred only in April. In addition, the optimal modelled sowing window clustered
    around early April (Fig. 7f and g). A fertilization rate of ∼60–120 kg/ha occurred
    more frequently with early sowing and a shallow tillage depth (Fig. 7f and h).
    Finally, the probability density distribution of the interaction between early
    sowing and shallow tillage depth was considerably greater (Fig. 7g). The distribution
    of the optimized farm management regime depicted in Fig. 7 was also presented
    in different combinations in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2, and in three dimensions
    in Supplementary Fig. 3. Overall, we found identical interactions in each pair
    of triplet states for management practices. The effects of integrated farm management
    on CH4 and N2O emissions are also shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9, and Fig. 10. Our scenario-modeling
    findings indicate that a shallow tillage depth led to a higher probability of
    lower emissions of CH4 and N2O (Fig. 8a and d). Additionally, we found no clear
    association between fertilization rate and CH4 emissions (Fig. 8b), whereas fertilization
    rate was positively related to N2O emissions as expected (Fig. 8e). We also observed
    that earlier sowing days were associated with a higher probability of lower CH4
    and N2O emissions. In addition, later initiation of the irrigation schedule throughout
    the growing season resulted in lower CH4 emissions, as expected (Fig. 9). However,
    the effects of later irrigation on N2O reduction were consistent only in the middle
    of the growing season (Fig. 10). Download : Download high-res image (874KB) Download

    farming practices and the potential crop yield with optimal management Multiple
    optimal management regimes exist for various Pareto fronts, making decision-making
    challenging. However, we believe that higher crop yield is paramount to farmers.
    To address this, we applied a crop yield threshold of >10 t/ha and subset farming
    practices from the non-dominated solutions. As a result, Fig. 11 displays the
    best combination of farming practices inferred from DNDC-NSGA-III framework, with
    the goal of achieving potential crop yield. The optimal management regimes all
    include sowing dates around 10–30 days earlier than current practices (Fig. 11a).
    However, the impact of tillage depth on crop yields was marginal (Fig. 11b). We
    found that the current fertilization rate was within the optimal range (Fig. 11c).
    We also present optimized irrigation schedules according to the dynamics of the
    water table (Fig. 11d), which represents the upper surface of the zone of saturation
    in the soil, and soil moisture (Fig. 11e). The optimized irrigation schedules
    were all associated with transitory flooding events in the early to middle growing
    seasons. By contrast, under current management practices, irrigation is suspended
    only in the middle of the growing season. Download : Download high-res image (833KB)

    optimized regimes are also shown (f–i). 4. Discussion Using a new heuristic and
    holistic method, the present study proposes improved rice farming irrigation regimes
    (Bo et al., 2022; Lampayan et al., 2015; Tian et al., 2021), and explored the
    influence of the sowing window, fertilization rate, and tillage depth, and their
    interactions. We validated and coupled the DNDC model with the NSGA-III algorithm
    to maximize crop yield, and minimize water consumption and N2O and CH4 emissions.
    We quantified the gap between current farming practices at the study site and
    optimal practices. Our results indicate that optimized farm management could maintain
    or increase current crop yield, while also reducing irrigation demand and GHG
    emissions by > 50 % (Fig. 11f–i). Furthermore, our method addresses the problem
    of reducing CH4 and N2O emissions simultaneously. 4.1. Could DNDC-NSGA-III optimization
    increase current rice yield with lower irrigation water requirements? Our findings
    suggest that considering improvements in the sowing window and flooding time could
    be crucial for maximizing crop yield (∼10 t/ha); other aspects of farming practice
    are already close to being optimized (Fig. 11). An early sowing date can improve
    crop biomass and grain yield due to an increased leaf area index and assimilation
    rate at vegetative stages, and by exploiting the benefits of lower temperature
    for starch accumulation at the late grain-filling stage (Huang et al., 2020; Li
    et al., 2021; Wenting et al., 2021). These physiological mechanisms support our
    finding that all non-dominated sowing dates were in early April (Fig. 7f and g),
    roughly 10–40 days before current sowing dates (Fig. 11). Early planting also
    reduces the risk of extreme heat events and serves as a cost-effective strategy
    for adaptation to climate warming (Acharjee et al., 2019; Ding et al., 2020).
    However, the early sowing suggested in this study may not be appropriate in other
    regions, since the optimal sowing window is highly dependent on both local climate
    conditions and cultivar characteristics (Deng et al., 2022; Tu et al., 2020).
    Showcasing the temperature data from Supplementary Fig. 4, it is evident that
    the improved sowing dates (early April, DOY∼91 to DOY 100, as depicted in Fig.
    11a) consistently maintained temperatures above 10 °C. This temperature range
    represents a crucial minimum threshold for seed germination and leaf initiation
    in japonica rice, as substantiated by prior research (Sánchez et al., 2014), and
    further supports our recommendation for early sowing dates. However, it is important
    to be mindful of the potential risk of cold or frost damage when advancing the
    sowing date. It is advisable to exercise caution if considering a significant
    advancement in the sowing date. Besides, the real-world adoption of such practices
    may be influenced by various factors, including traditional practices, economic
    considerations, access to information, and infrastructure limitations. Regarding
    the sowing date in South Korea, the timing of harvesting to coincide with the
    traditional holiday ‘Chuseok’ significantly influences farmers’ decisions to begin
    the season, as the price of fresh rice is highest during that time. Therefore,
    economic factors play a crucial role in this context. Regarding the irrigation
    schedule, in all of the optimized solutions the current japonica variety (‘Odae’)
    at the study site requires nearly saturated water content during the grain-filling
    stage (∼DOY 190–240) to avoid yield penalty (Fig. 11e), which is a well-known
    drought-sensitive growth period (Lilley and Fukai, 1994; Saini and Westgate, 1999;
    Zhang, 2018). In contrast, multi-transitory flooding events at the vegetative
    stage conserve considerable water resources (>50 %) while having marginal negative
    effects on crop yield (Fig. 11e and f). The optimized irrigation practice initiated
    new flooding events to largely maintain soil moisture in the rootzone above ∼0.45
    m3/m3. This is consistent with the recommendation that the threshold of soil water
    potential should be > −10 kPa to avoid drought stress, following AWD guidelines
    (Lampayan et al., 2015). Therefore, the modeled optimized management practices
    are not only consistent with the current literature, but also highlight the essential
    role of an integrated approach in rice farming. 4.2. Could DNDC-NSGA-III optimization
    reduce CH4 and N2O emissions simultaneously? This study demonstrated the feasibility
    of substantially reducing CH4 emissions while maintaining N2O footprints at or
    below the current levels (Fig. 11g and h), although a trade-off between CH4 and
    N2O emissions can be expected (Fig. 5e) due to anaerobic decomposition (Neue,
    1993) and aerobic nitrification (Bouwman, 1998). A recent global meta-analysis
    showed that non-flooded days, bulk density, and nitrogen application rate underpinned
    the benefits of non-continuous flooding on global warming (Bo et al., 2022), where
    fertilization is the source of nitrification–denitrification and moisture content
    affects the gas diffusivity of N2O through the soil column (Klefoth et al., 2014).
    In the present study, prioritizing maximum yield, DNDC-NSGA-III optimization resulted
    in nearly identical water table dynamics among the optimized solutions (Fig. 11d),
    sustaining a balance between anaerobic and aerobic soil environments. Importantly,
    we determined that the optimal fraction was ∼54 % of non-flooding days relative
    to the growing season length (Fig. 11d and e), which is comparable to that (>50
    %) reported for South Korea in the aforementioned meta-analysis (Bo et al., 2022).
    Additionally, our scenario-modeling results indicate that non-flooded days should
    occur primarily in vegetative stages, shortly after sowing and before the grain-filling
    stage. Furthermore, the model-inferred optimized practices (Fig. 8) are consistent
    with the effects of farm management on GHG emissions in the current literature,
    particularly with reduced tillage leading to decreased N2O emissions (van Kessel
    et al., 2013) and CH4 emissions in rice paddies (Cheng-Fang et al., 2012), as
    well as the positive response of N2O emissions to nitrogen fertilizer additions
    (Shcherbak et al., 2014). However, the situation in South Korea, where farmers
    may have little motivation to actively reduce GHG emissions through water management,
    is largely shaped by the absence of an effective carbon emission tax policy and
    the dependence on abundant water supply from rainfall events and well-established
    irrigation infrastructure. This highlights the urgent need for policy updates
    to integrate long-term environmental sustainability measures, drawing immediate
    attention to this concerning issue. 4.3. Limitations and uncertainties Several
    limitations of the present study should be noted. First, we did not validate the
    N2O simulation results due to a lack of observations, although a well-calibrated
    DNDC model can reliably track daily N2O fluxes (Katayanagi et al., 2012; Li et
    al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2020). Furthermore, although we demonstrated the robustness
    of the calibrated DNDC model through multifaceted validation (Fig. 2, Fig. 3,
    Fig. 4), uncertainties regarding overestimated GPP during the early growing season
    remain to be addressed. Collecting data over a longer period would also aid evaluation
    of the ability of the model to capture interannual variability. In our case, as
    noted in Hwang et al. (2020), observed CO2 data, after quality control, were available
    only 38.4 % of the time. Although low-quality data were concentrated at night,
    and there were few long-term gaps that introduced relatively large uncertainties
    in flux partitioning, it is crucial to recognize that the comparison in Fig. 3b
    and c may, to some extent, reflect differences in data gaps rather than solely
    the performance of DNDC. Additionally, for a simple and practical integrated method,
    we narrowed farming management down to several pivotal factors (Fig. 11) rather
    than including all possible practices. Future studies could also explore other
    measures, including the use of new rice cultivars (drought-resistant and high-yielding)
    and nitrification inhibitors (Sun et al., 2016), straw addition (Jiang et al.,
    2019b), and different fertilizer types and application methods (Hussain et al.,
    2015). Furthermore, only one rice farming site was included in the study, and
    the extent to which the results can be generalized is not clear. Besides, we did
    not test experimentally if the proposed changes to management indeed would lead
    to the predicted outcome. Experiments should be conducted in the future to verify
    the robustness of the new approach in practice. Nevertheless, we have provided
    a novel approach that could be promptly adopted in other regions if sufficient
    data are available. Implementing our findings into farm practices requires careful
    planning and consideration. Before widespread adoption, on-farm validation trials
    are crucial to ensure practicality. Outreach programs and tailored training sessions
    will promote the adoption of our findings in specific farming systems based on
    regional and climate conditions. Additionally, advocating for incentives and policies
    should be considered to encourage farmers to adopt sustainable practices. 5. Conclusions
    This study introduces a heuristic and holistic approach to simultaneously optimize
    multiple competing farming objectives using the DNDC model and NSGA-III algorithm.
    The results demonstrate that the optimized management approach could maintain
    or even increase current crop yield to its potential while reducing irrigation
    demand and greenhouse gas emissions by more than 50 %. The optimal proportion
    of non-flooded days was found to be approximately 54% of the growing season length,
    and the optimal stage for non-flooding days is the vegetative stage. Earlier sowing
    and improved irrigation practices are essential in the study area for maximizing
    crop yield and environmental benefits. The approach developed in this study could
    be applied to evaluate the environmental sustainability of farming systems under
    various climate and local conditions and guide policymaking and farming practices.

  description: Attaining sustainable agriculture requires water consumption management.
    A water allocation optimization model was developed for the Moghan irrigation
    network (northwest of Iran) based on the AquaCrop plug-in model. The genetic algorithm
    was applied to optimize water allocation for five main crops, including wheat,
    first-cultivation maize, second-cultivation maize, soybeans, and alfalfa. The
    heuristic economic utility (EU) function was used as the objective function to
    optimize water allocation. In this function, drained water salinity was applied
    as a penalty factor to the total benefit, and soil salinity deterioration due
    to irrigation was also considered as a factor in each crop’s benefit. The results
    showed that the optimal allocated water depth was 17% less than the normal water
    consumption. Moreover, the application of soil water salinity coefficients did
    not affect the ratio of EU to EB (economic benefits) for wheat and alfalfa. However,
    first-cultivation maize, second-cultivation maize, and soybeans cultivation led
    to a reduction in EU within the study area. A combination of the crops cultivation
    led to a change in river water quality and an 8.2% reduction in the ratio of EU
    to EB function.

    to advance agricultural water management Article 21 February 2022 Sustainable
    optimization of regional agricultural water use by developing a two-level optimization
    model Article 06 February 2020 Introduction Since agriculture is the largest consumer
    of water among different sectors, optimal water usage in agriculture has the most
    significant effect on water management. To overcome the water shortage and make
    maximum use of the limited available water, the allocation and scheduling of irrigation
    water should be done optimally (Kanooni & Monem, 2014). The optimal allocation
    and irrigation scheduling have been conducted based on two approaches: fixed demand
    (Monem and Namdariyan., 2005; Mathur et al., 2009) and variable demand (Kanooni
    & Monem, 2014; Oad et al., 2009). In the first approach, irrigation is scheduled
    with the assumption of constant demand and without knowing the water needs of
    the irrigation unit and based on the consumers’ request. However, in the second
    approach, crop type, climatic conditions, and soil moisture are influential, and
    optimal irrigation scheduling is determined based on actual demands (Li et al.,
    2020). The simulation models used in irrigation programs provide the possibility
    of checking and predicting the system’s behavior in the face of various variables,
    saving costs and making more appropriate decisions. They also reduce the limitations
    of field research, including time-consuming and lack of human resources (Bastiaanssen
    et al., 2007). The AquaCrop model has been evaluated for irrigation scheduling
    in different climatic conditions (Guo et al., 2021; Li et al., 2018; Linker et
    al., 2016). In recent years, irrigation scheduling has been optimized using plant
    simulation models such as AquaCrop instead of extracting experimental production
    functions (Kheir et al., 2021; Martinez-Romero et al., 2021). Meta-heuristic algorithms,
    such as genetic algorithm, has been used for various optimizations, including
    irrigation scheduling. The Genetic algorithm has led to reasonable outcomes in
    different fields (Rath et al., 2018; Wabela et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2019). The
    single-objective optimization for irrigation scheduling has been gradually replaced
    by multi-objective procedures, which have conflicting objectives without a unique
    optimal solution (Guo et al., 2021). The AquaCrop model was used to optimize the
    winter wheat irrigation schedule under dry, normal, and wet hydrological scenarios.
    The optimization objectives in their research included crop yield, irrigation
    water use efficiency (WUE), and economic benefit (EB). The results showed that
    the optimal irrigation scheduling performed better than the usual farmers’ schedule.
    It also led to an increase in crop yield, EB, and WUE (Guo et al., 2021). This
    study was conducted only for one crop in various hydrological scenarios. García-Vilaa
    and Fereres (2012) used AquaCrop and a farm-scale optimization model to optimize
    the water consumption of some selected crops. They showed that using crops with
    lower water consumption freed up water to produce crops with more water consumption
    and higher economic value. They used the AquaCrop model to extract the production
    functions of the crops, and the AquaCrop model was not combined with the optimization
    model for successive executions. The crop yield, EB, and water charge were among
    determining factors for irrigation scheduling and water resource allocation that
    should be considered during optimization (Rath et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2008).
    Past research shows that the drained water salinity of rivers (Somlyody, 1998;
    McBride, 2002), and soil salinity (Connor et al., 2012; Nemoto & Sasakuma, 2002)
    are factors that affect crop yield and optimal water resources allocation. The
    increase in the environmental pollutants loaded into rivers through industrial,
    urban, and agricultural activities has resulted in changing the rivers’ water
    quality indices (Jahin et al., 2020). Salinity is one of the primary indices of
    rivers’ water quality, which quantifies water-soluble salts (Quinn, 2011). Enhancing
    water quality and reducing its salinity requires efficacious efforts to manage
    water resource utilization (Somlyody, 1998; McBride, 2002). To this end, managing
    farms drained water entering the rivers is one of the most effective practices
    to preserve long-term cropping yield benefits. Water and soil salinity are environmental
    hazards leading to soil deterioration and a reduction in agricultural efficiency,
    especially in arid and semi-arid regions such as Iran (Connor et al., 2012; Alizade
    Govarchin Ghale et al., 2017). Furthermore, salinity is a major factor in limiting
    crop growth by reducing root water and nutrient uptake (Wilkinson, 2000). The
    increase in soil electrical conductivity brings about salt stress and crop biochemical
    and physiological changes, which reduces crop growth and yield (Nemoto & Sasakuma,
    2002). Hence, soil physical and chemical properties, irrigation water quality,
    and their management play an important role in long-term farm management (Douaik,
    2006). The EB function is considered the main objective function in most studies
    related to irrigation scheduling (Rath et al., 2018; Kumar & Yadav., 2019), while
    the economic utility function (EU), which in addition to EB, considers the long-term
    environmental effects and the production sustainability, has not been evaluated.
    In this study, the heuristic EU function is used instead of the EB for optimal
    irrigation water allocation. This heuristic function is proposed instead of the
    EB function by applying two coefficients of soil salinity and the salinity of
    drained water to the river. By applying the two coefficients, in addition to maximizing
    the EB in the same year, the long-term environmental effects caused by the cultivation
    of different crops, soil quality preservation, river water quality variation,
    sustainable agriculture, and long-term benefits are also evaluated. To evaluate
    crop yield response to water, the AquaCrop plug-in model has been used instead
    of experimental production functions such as Doorenbos and Kassam (Doorenbos et
    al., 1979). Therefore, the present study aims to maximize the EU and optimal water
    and land allocation for five main crops in a part of the Moghan irrigation network
    in the northwest of Iran using the genetic algorithm optimization method incorporated
    with the AquaCrop model. Materials and Methods Study Area The Moghan Plain is
    located in the northwest of Iran. The Moghan irrigation network is fed by the
    Aras River and irrigates 72,000 ha of the Moghan Plain agricultural lands, as
    shown in Fig. 1. According to the statistics and information of the regional water
    company of Ardabil, a part of Aras River water extracted by the Moghan network,
    the other part enters the Mil network of Azerbaijan, and the rest overflows the
    diversion dam and flows back to the Aras River and finally leads to the Caspian
    Sea. The volume of and salinity of water transferred back to the Aras River, for
    the years 2011–2020 are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. The study site is part of
    this network, located in the Pars-Abad region and irrigated by canal M with a
    covered area of about 2000 ha and 3 m3/s capacity. This area was considered an
    irrigation analysis unit (IAU). In the 2020 agricultural year (Sep. 2020–Aug.
    2021), the main cultivated crops in the study area were wheat, grain maize (first
    cultivation maize, second cultivation maize), soybeans, and alfalfa. In this research,
    mean long-term data (20 years) of the Pars-Abad weather station were used to prepare
    meteorological information (Fig. 4). Table 1 shows some information related to
    the studied crops. The information about the crops in the region was obtained
    from the Agricultural Organization of Ardabil Province. The unit price of the
    crops was also collected from the reports of the Iranian Statistics Center. According
    to the Agricultural Water Price Stabilization Law, average water charge from modern
    networks is 3% of the crop yield. Fig. 1 Location of Moghan irrigation network

    irrigation network in 2020 Full size table AquaCrop Model The AquaCrop model is
    an advanced program published by the World Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
    The development of this model is based on biophysical interactions in the plant-soil-atmosphere
    system (Sandhu & Irmak, 2019). Evapotranspiration calculation in this program
    is based on the dual crop coefficient method (Steduto et al., 2012). This model
    simulates the crop yield as a function of water consumption in different irrigation
    regimes. It also connects crop yield to crop water consumption and estimates the
    amount of biomass resulting from actual crop transpiration through normalized
    water productivity, which is the core of AquaCrop’s growth engine (Steduto et
    al., 2012). In the AquaCrop model, the yield is calculated based on the product
    of crop dry matter (B) and the harvest index (HI) (Eq. 1). Separation of yield
    (Y) into the dry matter and harvest index distinguishes the relationship between
    environment and dry matter production with the relationship between environment
    and harvest index. Therefore, the effect of water stress on dry matter and harvest
    index is investigated separately. The applied changes have led to the development
    of the following Eq. in this model: $$\\text{B=WP}\\sum {\\text{Tr}}$$ (1) $$Y
    = HI \\times B$$ (2) where WP is water productivity (in units of kg (biomass)
    m−2 (land area) mm−1 (water transpired)) and Tr is plant transpiration (mm). AquaCrop
    Plug-in Program FAO has developed the AquaCrop plug-in program, whose calculation
    methods are similar to the standard AquaCrop program (Raes et al., 2012). It provides
    the simulation possibility without a user interface. The plug-in program runs
    consecutive projects and saves each project’s simulation results (daily, 10-day,
    monthly, and quarterly) of each project in an output file that includes information
    about the simulation period, climate, soil, and water balance, and crop yield.
    (Raes et al., 2012). The plug-in program makes it possible to include the AquaCrop
    model in other programs and makes consecutive runs possible without a user interface.
    The AquaCrop plug-in version 6.0 was used in this research. In this study, the
    AquaCrop model was run for each crop in net irrigation water requirement mode
    to find the potential crop yields. The agricultural year was divided into 36 periods
    of 10 days to allocate water to the different crops. The potential yield and the
    corresponding amount of water calculated from the model simulation were then entered
    into the optimization model. The optimization code (i.e., AquaCrop plug-in for
    irrigation scheduling) uses a specified irrigation depth based on the water content
    at field capacity and irrigation time based on the irrigation interval (Generation
    of irrigation schedule). There are some studies in the Moghan Plain for the calibration
    and validation of the AquaCrop model for important crops (Adabi et al., 2020;
    Izadfard et al., 2021). In this research, to determine the calibration parameters
    for the main cultivated crops in the study area, the results of Izadfard et al.
    (2021) were used. The calibrated parameters are shown in Table 2. For forage crops
    such as alfalfa, the average effect of cuttings in the growing season was considered.
    A standard crop coefficient curve was considered, in which only a single value
    for crop coefficient mid needs to be employed for the whole growing season (Allen
    et al., 1998). Table 2 AquaCrop model calibration parameters for the main cultivated
    crops in the study area (Izadfard et al., 2021) Full size table Objective Function
    and Decision Variables The optimal irrigation water management was carried out
    in the IAU under different water requirements conditions on a ten-day scale. The
    decision variables in this model were the amount of irrigation water depth in
    each of the 36 periods as well as the crop cultivation area. Equation 3 represents
    the EB for each crop: $$EB = {\\text{ benefitper crop per hectare }} = \\, \\left(
    {{\\text{crop sales per hectare }} - {\\text{ costs per hectare}}} \\right) =
    \\left( {Y_{i} \\times P_{i} } \\right) - \\left( {C_{i} + P_{w} \\times IR_{i}
    } \\right)$$ (3) where Yi is the yield of crop i (kg/ha), Pi is the market price
    (Rial/kg), Ci represents production cost (Rial/ha), Pwi is water charge (Rial/m3)
    and IR is irrigation depth (mm). The meaning of the production costs is: land
    preparation, planting, cultivating and harvesting. These costs are different for
    each product and for each agricultural year. The amount of IR is calculated by
    dividing the net irrigation depth by the irrigation efficiency (IR = NIR/E). In
    Eq. 4, the EB function for the crop pattern is shown: $$EB = \\left( {\\mathop
    \\sum \\limits_{i = 1}^{n} A_{i} \\times \\left( {Y_{i} \\times P_{i} - C_{i}
    - P_{w} \\times NIR_{i} /E} \\right)} \\right)$$ (4) where NIRi is net irrigation
    depth (mm), E is irrigation efficiency, and Ai is the cultivated area (ha). Water
    allocation in this model was performed to maximize the IAU’s EU for five main
    crops. The selected option for the objective function was assumed to include the
    drainage water salinity as a penalty factor in the total benefit and the effect
    of soil water salinity as a factor in each crop’s benefit. Therefore, considering
    the soil water salinity and drainage water salinity, the EU function can be calculated
    as follows, $$EU = \\alpha \\prime \\left( {\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} {\\gamma_{i}
    \\times A_{i} } \\times \\left( {Y_{i} \\times P_{i} - C_{i} - P_{wi} \\times
    NIR_{i} /E} \\right)} \\right)$$ (5) The coefficient ɣ represents changes in benefit
    due to the soil water salinity effects, and α′ is a coefficient to consider the
    effect of drained water salinity in the total benefit. By applying these coefficients,
    the benefit obtained will not be the net benefit of that year, but the long-term
    environmental effects are also considered. Conditions Governing the Optimization
    Model Using the optimization model, the appropriate combination of cultivation
    is selected among the common crops of the region. The crops’ sowing date, harvest
    date, total cost, and market price are entered into the optimization model. The
    following constraints limit the optimization: 1- The total cultivated area of
    different crops in each period should not exceed the area of arable land in the
    region (Eq. 6). $$\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{i} {A_{i,d} } \\le AT$$ (6) where Ai,d,
    and AT are the cultivated area of crop i in period d and the total area of arable
    land in the region. d is considered to be ten days in this study. 2- A mild water
    deficit is optimal and can reduce water consumption without reducing yield (Wang
    et al., 2022). In this study, deficit irrigation of less than 25% and over-irrigation
    of more than 25% (to meet the leaching requirement) were prohibited. The net irrigation
    depth variation was limited to: $$0.75 \\times NetIrri_{id} \\le NIR_{id} \\le
    1.25 \\times NetIrri_{id}$$ (7) where, NetIrrii,d and NIRi,d are, the crop irrigation
    requirement and the irrigation depth for crop i in period d. 3- The total volume
    of irrigation water used for crops in each period should not exceed the available
    water volume in that period (Eqs. 8 and 9). $$V_{d} = \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{i}
    {IR_{i,d} } \\times A_{i}$$ (8) $$V_{d} \\le W_{d}$$ (9) where IRi,d, and Vd are
    the depth of gross irrigation water for plant i in period d and the total volume
    of water used for all crops in period d. Wd is the volume of available irrigation
    water in period d. 4- The discharge of drainage water should not lead to an increase
    in the salinity of the river water more than the permissible limit. Drained water
    volume and salinity for each crop can be derived from AquaCrop outputs. Thus,
    the salt amount coming from certain irrigation for each period of IAU which enters
    the river can be obtained from the average cultivated crops’ salinity in that
    period (Eq. 10). Furthermore, the river water salinity at output location in a
    certain period before the entrance of drainage water and its volume is available.
    Therefore, the river water salinity after the entrance of the drained water derives
    as follows: $$ECdrain_{d} = \\frac{{\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{i} ECdrain_{i,d}
    \\times Vdrain_{i,d} }}{{\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{i} Vdrain_{i,d} }}$$
    (10) $$ECriver_{d} - \\bmod = \\frac{{\\left( {ECriver_{d} \\times Vriver_{d}
    } \\right) + \\left( {ECdrain_{d} \\times Vdrain_{d} } \\right)}}{{Vriver_{d}
    + Vdrain_{d} }}$$ (11) In these equations, ECdraind is the average electrical
    conductivity of the drained water in period d, ECriverd –mod represents the river
    EC after receiving the drained water, ECdraini,d is the contribution of crop i
    to the salinity of drained water in period d, Vdraini,d is the volume of the drained
    water due to irrigation of crop i, ECriverd is the salinity of the river at the
    outlet before receiving drained water, Vriverd is the volume of the river water
    in period d at the outlet before receiving drained water, and Vdraind is the total
    drained volume in period d. To consider the drained water salinity as a penalty
    factor in the benefit, the coefficient C is calculated every day by Eq. 12. $$C
    = \\frac{{ECriver_{d} - \\bmod - ECriver}}{ECriver}$$ (12) In case the river water
    salinity after the entrance of the drainage water is lower than the river water
    salinity at the output location before the entrance of drainage water, C is lower
    than or equal to zero. In such cases, there is no need to apply a punishment coefficient
    (α′) (i.e., α′ equals one). In contrast, if the entered drainage water increases
    the river water salinity, C exceeds zero, and α′ can be applied. Moreover, the
    punishment coefficient intensifies according to the salinity increment. The α′
    is calculated daily, and an average yearly coefficient applies to the objective
    function. α′ values for the Moghan region were derived based on local experts’
    observations and suggestions, as shown in Table 3. Noteworthy, α′ regional coefficients
    can be modified depending on the initial river water salinity and its environmental
    effects. Table 3 Suggested values for determining the α′ coefficient Full size
    table 5- Cultivation should not drastically affect soil salinity in the root zone
    to achieve sustainable agriculture and maintain soil quality. Therefore, in this
    study, the soil water salinity coefficient (ɣ) was determined by multiplying two
    salinity change coefficients in the range of in-class coefficient (ɣ1) and the
    class change coefficient (ɣ2) (Eq. 13). If initial soil salinity (ECso) and soil
    water salinity after irrigation of plant i (ECswi) are known (which are outputs
    of the AquaCrop model), salinity classes are also considered based on the Wilcox
    diagram (Table 5), and each class changes between ECmin and ECmax, ɣ1 and ɣ2 can
    be obtained from Table 4. It should be mentioned that the coefficient within the
    class is applied exponentially (Table 5). $$\\gamma = \\gamma_{1} \\times \\gamma_{2}$$
    (13) Table 4 Classification of soil water salinity coefficients (ds m−1) Full
    size table Table 5 Salinity classes to determine the ɣ coefficient (Wilcox, 1955)
    Full size table If the soil water salinity at the end of the irrigation equals
    the initial soil water salinity, ɣ1 equals one. If the soil water salinity at
    the end of the irrigation exceeds the initial soil water salinity, ɣ1 is considered
    lower than one, and vice versa. Furthermore, if the amount of reduction or increase
    in the soil water salinity in the root zone after the end of the irrigation does
    not exceed ECmin and ECmax of the Wilcox index, ɣ2 equals one, which shows no
    change in the soil salinity class. Otherwise, ɣ2 is considered lower (ECswi > ECmax)
    or higher than one (ECswi < ECmin), which leads to a change in the soil salinity
    class. ɣ1 and ɣ2 values for the Moghan region were suggested in Table 4 based
    on an engineering judgment. Undoubtedly these values could be enhanced with more
    experience and based on economic evaluations. Applying these coefficients (ɣ1
    and ɣ2) to the objective function accounts for the crop cultivation effects on
    production stability and long-term benefit. To this end, an increase in soil salinity
    destabilizes the production and reduces the long-term benefit while a reduction
    in soil salinity improves the production stability and long-term benefit (although
    it may not affect the current year''s benefit). Genetic Optimization Algorithm
    Researchers developed algorithms to optimize any alternative issue in the agriculture
    (Osroosh et al., 2016), being stochastic or deterministic among the most accepted
    algorithms. The evolutionary algorithms allow changing a result to change until
    receiving the optimal solution by seeking a process that simulates living beings
    in nature, such as genetic algorithms (Villacampa et al., 2019). Since AquaCrop
    software is needed to calculate the crop yield without any provided formula, it
    is not feasible to use the optimization software and solve the mathematical model.
    Genetic algorithm has been used in many studies to generate irrigation data and
    crop area (Guo et al., 2021; Rabie et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2021). Hence, in
    this research, the genetic algorithm optimization method was used to allocate
    water to crops in the Moghan network. A genetic algorithm is one of the intelligent
    methods for optimization problems. This algorithm is based on repetition. In this
    method, a set of decision variables or chromosomes that are effective on the objective
    function forms the initial population (possible solutions). Maintaining genetic
    operators such as selection, cross and mutation on the decision variables of the
    initial population leads to the production of a more competent generation. This
    process is repeated in different generations (Goldberg, 1989). Thus, members or
    better solutions evolve over generations. Then, based on the value of the objective
    function, it categorizes the best answers among the answers in the form of the
    new generation. This process is repeated until a new generation is not produced.
    The produced irrigation data is used as an input to AquaCrop, and the crops’ yield
    is derived as an output from the model. In addition to the yield, drainage water
    salinity for each crop is also calculated by AquaCrop. To this end, C# coding
    was done in Visual Studio. Results and Discussion Water Optimal Allocation The
    optimal cultivated area of the studied crops was obtained by running the optimization
    program. Figure 5 shows the cultivated area of the IAU in the current conditions
    compared to the optimal allocation conditions. The numbers in the figure demonstrate
    the difference between the existing cultivated crop areas compared to the optimal
    allocation conditions. The model prioritized crops with more EU and less water
    requirement than other crops by reducing costs and complying with restrictions.
    In the optimal cropping pattern, the cultivated areas of wheat, first-cultivation
    maize, and alfalfa have increased by 2.5%, 3.2%, and 3.4%, respectively, compared
    to the initial cultivated area. Among the crops, wheat requires less water than
    other crops, whereas first-cultivation maize and alfalfa have a higher water requirement.
    Their cultivation area has increased more due to their higher yield and, as a
    result, greater economic value than the other crops. The cultivated areas of second-cultivation
    maize and soybean experienced a reduction of 2.3 and 1.8 percent. Fig. 5 Comparison
    of the existing and optimal cultivated area of the Moghan irrigation network crops
    Full size image The AquaCrop model was run for each crop in the net irrigation
    water requirement mode. Therefore, the maximum crop yield and the water depth
    calculated from the implementation of this model were considered normal conditions.
    Table 6 compares the allocated crops'' water depth in two normal and optimal conditions.
    According to Table 6, the allocated water depth in the optimal conditions for
    all crops is lower than the allocated water depth in the normal conditions. The
    highest percentage of reduction in the allocated water depth is related to the
    alfalfa by 24%, and the lowest is related to the first-cultivation maize by 10%.
    A fraction of the first-cultivation maize’s water requirement, during the growing
    season, is supplied with rainfall. Alfalfa, a crop that grows and develops throughout
    the year, has received less water than other crops. For all the investigated crops,
    the allocated water depth in the optimal condition compared to the normal condition
    has saved water consumption by 17%. The optimal distribution of water in different
    growth periods of each crop is shown in Fig. 6. The model can run a deficit irrigation
    of less than 25% and an over-irrigation of less than 25%. For soybean (Fig. 6d),
    first-cultivation maize (Fig. 6b), and second-cultivation maize (Fig. 6c), the
    optimal water depth distribution in the entire growth stages has been less than
    the normal water depth. However, for the wheat (Fig. 6a) in the 34th and 35th
    growth stages (the last ten days of February and the first ten days of March),
    7 and 17% over-normal water were considered. For the alfalfa (Fig. 6e) in the
    fourth growth stage (last ten days of April), 15% over-normal was considered.
    Since in the previous irrigation periods, the optimum water depth was lower than
    the normal water depth, it caused a decrease in the soil moisture content in the
    root zone. Therefore, to compensate water content, the model has chosen over-irrigation,
    which, in addition to compensating the soil moisture, it also helps to leaching.
    In the remains of the growth stages of wheat and alfalfa, the optimal water depth
    distribution was lower than the normal water depth. Table 6 Comparison of the
    crops allocated water depth in normal and optimal conditions Full size table Fig.
    6 Comparison of normal and optimal water depth distribution in growth stages of
    wheat (a), first-cultivation maize (b), second-cultivation maize (c), soybean
    (d), and alfalfa (e) Full size image EB The volume of water consumed by the IAU
    and the amount of EB for two normal and optimal conditions are given in Table
    7. In the conditions of optimal water allocation, the volume of allocated water
    decreases by 14.7%, while EB increases by only 5.7%. Therefore, the optimal water
    allocation in this area encourages saving water consumption more than increasing
    benefit. Saving water consumption causes a slight increase in EB due to the small
    water charge in the Moghan network. As a result, water users consider water a
    worthless commodity and use it without economic considerations. Meanwhile, if
    the correct price for water is determined, the EB will increase to a greater extent.
    The former researchers'' findings have shown that a water charge is an important
    option for saving water for farmers (Chu and Grafton., 2020). Also, if the water
    charge is set correctly, the farmers will be sensitive to it (Huang et al., 2010).
    The study by Cortignani and Severini (2009), conducted in Italy, showed that increasing
    water charges by 200 and 300 percent and applying five to ten percent water reduction
    policies are effective in reducing water consumption. Table 7 Comparison of the
    EB and the volume of water consumed in normal and optimal conditions Full size
    table Water Productivity Table 8 shows the potential crop yield values after optimization
    and the water productivity for each crop. The results indicate that the water
    productivity index has increased after optimization for all crops. Alfalfa has
    the most significant increase in water productivity (by 35%), with a 24% decrease
    in the allocated water depth. Kanooni (2013) also presented similar results for
    the current study area. Table 8 Water productivity values in normal and optimal
    conditions Full size table The Effect of Soil Water Salinity Coefficient on EU
    It has been shown that the AquaCrop model could be a feasible tool to predict
    the soil salinity change trend (Mohammadi et al., 2016; Pourgholam-Amiji et al.,
    2021). The soil water salinity values (ECSW) after the completion of irrigation
    of each crop, which are the outputs of the AquaCrop model in the optimization
    model, are presented in Table 9. Based on detailed soil studies, the studied area
    has different types of soils. However, according to the detailed soil science
    report of the canal a area, the dominant soil of the Pars-Abad series has a salinity
    of 1.8 ds/m, which is placed in the medium class of salinity (Table 5), according
    to Wilcox''s classification. The results of Table 9 indicate that the soil water
    salinity for first and second-cultivation maize and soybean after the completion
    of irrigation has increased from the initial soil salinity. However, this value
    did not exceed the maximum salinity of the Wilcox classification. Therefore, the
    coefficient of change of class ɣ2 (Table 4) equals 1. For the wheat, due to the
    insignificant difference between the initial soil salinity and soil water salinity
    after irrigation (the difference is less than 0.1), the value of the in-class
    coefficient (ɣ1) and class change (ɣ2) is equal to 1. The crop yield and soil
    salinity could be significantly affected by rainfall conditions (Liu et al., 2019;
    Zhai et al., 2022). In the study area, during the growth period of crops such
    as wheat and the first-cultivation maize, rainfall distribution is higher, and
    crops obtain part of their water requirement from rainfall. During the summer
    season, rainfall is reduced, and the crops’ rainwater usage, such as second-cultivation
    maize and soybeans, which are part of their growth period in summer, is reduced.
    For alfalfa, the soil water salinity after irrigation is equal to the initial
    soil salinity, so for this crop, both the in-class coefficient (ɣ1) and class
    change coefficient (ɣ2) are equal to 1. Crops such as developed alfalfa that have
    extensive roots can be beneficial in lowering the average salinity in the root
    zone (Minhas & Gupta, 1993; Hanks et al., 1990). The roots of an established alfalfa
    can extend to a depth of 2.5 m (Vaughan et al., 2002). Therefore, the results
    indicate that, except for alfalfa and wheat, inappropriate crop rotation and neglect
    of soil salinity management (e.g., using certain fertilizers to prevent and eliminate
    soil salinity) increase the soil salinity over time. (The values of the soil water
    salinity coefficient (γ) for all the studied crops are given in Table 10). Table
    9 Salinity of soil water after completion of irrigation for studied crops Full
    size table Table 10 EB and EU for the studied crops Full size table EU Table 10
    presents the obtainable EB for each crop, the obtainable total EB for the entire
    IAU, and the amount of IAU’s EU. The results show that the IAU’s EB is equal to
    790,821 million Rials. For wheat and alfalfa, the amount of EU (excluding α′)
    is equal to the amount of EB, but the amount of EU (excluding α′) for the first
    and second-cultivation maize and soybeans is 10% is lower than the value of EB.
    The reason for this reduction is the increase of soil salinity in the root zone
    due to the irrigation of these crops. The annual average value of α′ coefficient
    was calculated as 0.97. The value of α′ less than 1 indicates that the inflow
    of drained water produced by the IAU will enter the Aras River in the long term,
    increasing the river water’s salinity. By applying the α′ coefficient as a penalty
    factor in the total benefit, the EU value of the IAU was reduced by 8.2% compared
    to EB. Resultantly, the combination of planting the studied crops will be beneficial
    for the farmers in the same growing season, but in case of choosing incompatible
    plants for the local climate, and not considering the proper measures to prevent
    soil salinity and river water salinity, the EU of the IAU decreases. Furthermore,
    the EU can be increased by planting crops such as alfalfa and wheat, which reduce
    soil water salinity. Conclusions Sustainable agriculture should be environmentally
    compatible with nature and economically beneficial, and this benefit should continue
    in the long term. In this regard, optimization models are valuable tools that
    not only increase benefits but also assess the feasibility of extending the cultivation
    area and can be used for economic analyses. Therefore, in this study, a combination
    of the AquaCrop plug-in model with the genetic algorithm optimization model was
    used for the optimal water allocation in the Moghan irrigation network. The objective
    function in this study was set to maximize the EU heuristic function instead of
    the EB function. The results indicated that the allocated water depth to the IAU
    decreased by 17% in the optimal condition compared to the normal condition while
    the water productivity increased after optimization for all crops. Alfalfa had
    the highest increase in water productivity compared to other crops by reducing
    the allocated water depth by 24%, followed by wheat with a 20% reduction. The
    values of soil water salinity coefficient (γ) showed that in case of mismanagement
    in soil salinity prevention, maize and soybeans increase soil salinity in the
    long term. The α′ coefficient of 0.97 indicated that the combination of five major
    crop cultivation in this area increases the river water salinity in the long term.
    By applying all two mentioned coefficients, the EU value in the IAU was reduced
    by 8.2% compared to EB. Therefore, using the proposed EU, it is possible to identify
    crops that reduce soil salinity and river water salinity, and not only EB but
    also EU is increased. The result of this study can be used by the network managers
    for selecting the best crop pattern in a network scale. Utilizing this approach
    can protect the country’s limited water resources to obtain sustainable agriculture.

  description: Cascade pumping stations (CPS) consume a large amount of energy every
    year in lifting districts. To obtain a reasonable and feasible operation scheme
    for CPS, this paper proposes an optimal operation model for CPS based on simulations.
    A one-dimensional unsteady flow model of open canals was coupled with the optimal
    operation model of CPS, and an energy-dominated optimization was proposed with
    the water level of the inlet pool as the coordinated variable. The optimization
    model was solved by using the catch-up method and the nondominated sorted genetic
    algorithm II (NSGA-II). The optimal operation method was validated and implemented
    in the first-stage and second-stage pumping stations of the Zuncun Irrigation
    Project by lifting water from the Yellow River in Shanxi province. The results
    showed that the proposed optimization model can reduce the energy consumption
    of the CPS by 4% compared with the actual operation. In addition, the optimal
    operation model of the CPS coupled with simulation can realize the dynamic balance
    of flow by stabilizing the inlet pool level to operate within a safe range. The
    energy consumption of the CPS can be reduced by keeping the water level of the
    intake pool as high a level as possible.

    (CPS) consume a large amount of energy every year in lifting districts. To obtain

    level as possible. 1 INTRODUCTION The cascade pump station irrigation project
    (CPSIP) plays a pivotal role in agricultural production in China by effectively
    addressing the issue of agricultural water consumption resulting from topographical
    elevation differences (Ma et al., 2020). The CPSIP consists of cascade pumping
    stations (CPS), water transmission and distribution canals and gates. Through
    pumping stations (PS) at all stages, water is lifted from low-lying areas to high-lying
    areas for irrigation. During the operation of the CPSIP, maintaining a flow balance
    between stages while meeting interstage irrigation demands is crucial. However,
    achieving accurate control is difficult because the units of CPS and gates are
    operated solely through human decision-making by dispatchers. As a result, several
    potential problems, such as increased energy consumption and water waste, occur
    frequently (Bonvin et al., 2017). Therefore, it is necessary to carry out research
    on the optimal operation of CPS (Chen et al., 2021; De Ocampo & Dadios, 2017;
    Kabulov et al., 2020). Numerous researchers have conducted studies on the optimal
    operation of CPS. Gao et al. (1990) employed dynamic programming to optimize the
    operation of Dayudu CPS, achieving 7.6% energy savings by using the storage volume
    of the diversion canal and sedimentation tank to address flow matching issues
    between PS. As the number of CPS stages increases, the concept of large-scale
    system governance is incorporated into the framework of optimal operation (Zhang
    et al., 2019). Based on this concept, the irrigation planning process of CPS at
    different decision-making levels can be effectively delineated through the establishment
    of a three-tier decomposition-coordination model (Gong & Cheng, 2018). Furthermore,
    by optimizing water distribution among different time periods and irrigation areas
    (Jiang et al., 2019), crop planting layout, irrigation methods (Bai et al., 2022),
    pump station water-lifting rates, daily operating times and quantities of units
    (Perea et al., 2020), water demand and energy costs can be minimized while meeting
    irrigation water requirements. Most current studies do not consider the water
    transmission canals between PS. The water transmission process through open canals
    (WTPOC) exhibits a time delay in irrigation districts (Clemmens et al., 2017;
    Savari & Monem, 2022). When the operational state of the units of the upper-stage
    PS or water distribution flow rates are adjusted, the change in flow may take
    several hours to propagate to the upper-stage PS (Diniz et al., 2015). However,
    previous optimizations neglected this process, resulting in mismatches between
    the lift and flow of the upper-stage PS in the optimization scheme and the actual
    operation (Kong et al., 2023). Furthermore, in practical operation, the water
    level in the inlet pool of PS must be maintained within a certain safe operating
    range (Kong et al., 2019). The operation operator of PS regulates units based
    on artificially observed water conditions or changes in inlet pool water levels,
    with the aim of achieving interstage flow balance to the greatest possible extent,
    regardless of the energy consumption or the number of pump units switched. To
    solve such problems, several data-driven methods have been used for optimizing
    PS operation in water transfer projects, using big data analysis to determine
    the optimal start times for upper-stage PS after canal transportation to achieve
    flow balance (Liu et al., 2022; Yan et al., 2023). Unlike in water transfer projects,
    in irrigation districts, CPS need to meet interstage water demands in addition
    to supplying water to upper-stage PS (Wan et al., 2023). Moreover, the variation
    in the water distribution flow rate during irrigation seasons also needs to be
    considered. Therefore, data-driven methods for applying cascade pump station irrigation
    districts (CPSID) are challenging. In addition, one-dimensional unsteady flow
    simulation models have been introduced into the optimal operation of CPS, where
    the optimized solutions are validated through simulations in which solutions are
    selected with matching water levels for pump unit operation, facilitating the
    adoption of optimized solutions by schedulers (Gong & Cheng, 2018). Therefore,
    if the simulation can accurately simulate the lifting water process at cascade
    pumping stations (LWPCPS) and optimize the PS operation through the simulation
    results, the actual operation of the CPS in the irrigation district can be effectively
    guided. In this paper, an optimal operation model based on simulation was proposed
    for the CPSID model, which combines a one-dimensional unsteady flow simulation
    model and an optimal operation model. In this model, the water level of the inlet
    pool of the PS, which is strongly influenced by the WTPOC and the operation states
    of PS units, is taken as the coordinated variable. Through the data interaction
    between the simulation model and the optimization model, a reasonable and feasible
    daily optimal operation scheme for the PS is obtained. The water distribution
    control strategy was incorporated into the simulation model to regulate the opening
    of the water diversion gates based on the simulated real-time water levels at
    the water distribution outlets, ensuring an adequate irrigation water supply.
    In the optimization model, the energy consumption of the PS was prioritized as
    the main optimization objective, while the total number of pump unit switchings
    that affect equipment wear and human input was considered as a secondary optimization
    objective. The nondominated sorted genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II) was used for
    solving the model. The method proposed in this paper aims to reduce energy consumption
    and operational costs in lifting water while ensuring flow balance between CPS.
    2 MODEL CONSTRUCTION 2.1 Simulation model of CPSID A simulation model was constructed
    to simulate the LWPCPS and WTPOC by using the one-dimensional Saint-Venant equation
    and pump performance curves. 2.1.1 Simulation module of LWPCPS The performance
    curves of pump units serve as comprehensive representations of various operational
    parameters. During field operations, notable disparities may exist between the
    observed performance parameters and the manufacturer''s specifications provided.
    A more precise approximation of the pump head, flow rate and energy consumption
    was achieved to accurately simulate actual conditions by fitting these curves
    with operational data. In this study, the flow head performance curve of pump
    units was fitted using the least squares method, and the fitted expression is
    as follows: (1) where H is the actual operating head of the pump (m); Q is the
    flow rate of the pump (m3/s); and a, b and c are coefficient constants. The performance
    curve of the pump and the characteristic curve of the pipeline were combined to
    solve the actual operating point of the pump unit. The formula is as follows:
    (2) (3) (4) where Hst is the static head of the pump station (m); S is the impedance
    of the pipeline; and Zout and Zin are the water levels of the outlet and inlet
    pool of the pump station (m), respectively. 2.1.2 Simulation module of WTPOC The
    one-dimensional surface flow model, based on the Saint-Venant equation, is extensively
    employed in open-canal water transmission systems, and its solution results are
    considered to accurately reflect the water conveyance process (Lu et al., 2018;
    Qiao et al., 2021). In this paper, a canal water flow propulsion model was constructed
    based on the Saint-Venant equations, and the canal flow was regarded as a one-dimensional
    open-canal flow to simulate the spatial-temporal changes in discharge and water
    level in the canal. Continuity equation: (5) Momentum equation: (6) where A is
    the area of the overflow section (m2); t is the calculation time (s); x is the
    length in the flow direction (m); Q is the overflow flow rate (m3/s); ql is the
    flow rate of the side inflow per unit length (m3/s); u is the average flow velocity
    of the section (m/s); g is the acceleration of gravity (m/s2); Z is the water
    level (m); n is the coefficient of roughness; and R is the hydraulic radius (m).
    For distribution canals, it is necessary to calculate the outlet flow rate based
    on the formula for gate flow. This calculated flow rate is then employed as a
    boundary condition in the Saint-Venant equations to simulate the WTPOC. The research
    employed the conventional flow rate formula from the Hydraulic Calculation Manual
    (Li, 2006) to calculate the flow rate through the water distribution canal gate,
    with the gate sill being treated according to the approach of a broad-crested
    weir. When e/H ≤ 0.65, the flow rate over the gate is calculated using the orifice
    flow formula: (7) where Q is the flow through the gate (m3/s); μ0 is the flow
    coefficient; e is the gate opening (m); n is the number of gate holes; b is the
    net width of each hole of the gate (m); and H0 is the water level upstream of
    the gate (m). When e/H > 0.65, the flow rate over the gate is calculated using
    the weir flow formula: (8) where σs is the coefficient of submergence; σc is the
    side contraction coefficient; and m is the flow coefficient. The Preissmann method
    is the most widely applied implicit finite difference method and is renowned for
    its simplicity, high accuracy, excellent numerical stability, good convergence
    properties and strong practicality (Shayannejad et al., 2022). The model employs
    the Preissmann four-point eccentric implicit scheme for discretizing the Saint-Venant
    equation and utilizes the catch-up method to solve it, thereby enabling the determination
    of water level and discharge values at different time intervals. 2.2 Optimal operation
    model of CPS 2.2.1 Objective function In CPSID, the energy consumption of PS is
    a critical factor affecting the operational costs of irrigation management units.
    Reducing energy consumption is one of the primary tasks in optimizing the operation
    of a PS. Furthermore, reducing the number of pump unit switchings can facilitate
    operational management and maintenance. Frequent switching can lead to wear and
    tear on the units and may result in considerable surge pressure on the connected
    pipelines (Makaremi et al., 2017). The less frequent the pump switches are, the
    lower the maintenance costs (Torregrossa & Capitanescu, 2019). Therefore, the
    model established the following objective function: Objective Function 1: Minimize
    the energy consumption of the CPS. (9) where E is the power consumption of the
    PS (KW·h); SD is the number of time slots, and a day is divided into 24 time slots
    according to the time-sharing tariff; JZ is the total number of units contained
    in the PS at this stage; ρ is the density of water, which is taken to be 1.0 × 103 kg/m3;
    g is the acceleration of gravity, which is taken to be 9.81 m/s2; Qj,k is the
    water-lifting flow rate of the kth unit in the jth time slot in this stage of
    PS (𝑚3/𝑠); Hj is the head of the PS in this stage in the jth time period (m);
    δj,k denotes the switching state of the kth unit in the jth time period, which
    is 1 for on time and 0 for off time; and Tj,k denotes the on-time operation length
    of the kth unit in the jth time period (h). Objective Function 2: Optimal number
    of pump unit switchings. (10) where TI is the sum of the number of pump unit switchings;
    the other parameters are the same as above. 2.2.2 Decision variables and constraints
    In this optimal operation model for the PS, the decision variables are selected
    as the on–off state of the pumping units. In the ‘on’ state, the operating angle
    and speed of the units are set to the installation angle and rated speed, respectively.
    The model considers the inlet pool of the PS reservoir as a small-scale regulating
    reservoir, with fluctuations in the inlet pool water level being the optimization
    variables. During the optimization process, several constraints are imposed: (1)
    The total daily water-pumping volume of the PS should meet the minimum pumping
    requirements (Equation 11). (2) The water level in the inlet pool of the PS should
    remain within the range of the minimum safe level (Equation 12). (3) To ensure
    the safety of the inlet pool, the rate of water level fluctuations in the inlet
    pool should be limited to within 0.5 m/h (Equation 13). (4) The units should operate
    in the high-efficiency range (above 90% of the maximum efficiency) (Equation 14).
    (5) The outflow from the PS should be less than the maximum outflow capacity of
    the PS (Equation 15). (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) where Wob is the target total amount
    of water lifted (m3); ΣWsd is the total amount of water lifted during the optimization
    time (m3); Zin,j is the water level of the intake pool during the j time period
    (m); Zin,min and Zin,max are the minimum water level and the maximum safe limiting
    water level of the intake pool (m); η is the operating efficiency of the unit;
    Qk is the outflow from the kth unit (m3/s); and Qmax is the design maximum outflow
    capacity of the PS (m3/s). 2.2.3 Optimization and solution algorithm It is worth
    noting that the energy consumption of PS and the number of pump unit switchings
    are two conflicting objective functions that cannot simultaneously achieve their
    optimal values. Previous research has typically limited the total number of switches
    for each pump unit and optimized the problem based on the total number of switches
    for all pumps in the PS. Usually, single-objective optimization is repeated for
    different numbers of pump switch counts to strike a balance between two factors
    (López-Ibáñez et al., 2008). In this study, the primary objective function prioritizes
    the energy consumption of the PS, while the total number of pump units switches
    is used as a secondary objective function. The multiobjective genetic algorithm
    was employed for solving this problem. As heuristic algorithms, multiobjective
    genetic algorithms enable global search and provide a Pareto front under different
    priorities (i.e. the optimal solution set for each objective) (Fan et al., 2023;
    Gong & Zhu, 2022; Xu & Bai, 2019). When using multiobjective optimization, the
    total number of switching for each pump is not restricted, allowing the determination
    of the lowest energy consumption for different start-stop counts simultaneously
    within the Pareto front. This approach provides irrigation managers with a range
    of feasible scheduling options. The solution process of NSGA-II is as follows:
    (1) Initialization: Start by generating an initial set of individuals to randomly
    create the initial population. Fitness Evaluation: Calculate the fitness values
    for each individual based on multiple objective functions. Non-dominated sorting
    is performed to categorize individuals into different non-dominated fronts, and
    the crowding distance is computed to maintain diversity within each front. (2)
    Selection: Use non-dominated sorting and crowding distance to select parent individuals
    for crossover and mutation operations. Generate new individuals through these
    genetic operators. (3) Merging and re-evaluation: Combine the new individuals
    with the current population; then, perform non-dominated sorting and crowding
    distance calculations again to prepare for the selection of the next generation.
    (4) Environmental selection: From the merged population, individuals with higher
    fitness values are selected while considering non-dominated fronts and crowding
    distances. (5) Termination criterion: The above steps are repeated iteratively
    until the termination criterion is met. This could be a predefined number of generations
    or convergence criterion. (6) Output: At the end of the process, NSGA-II outputs
    a set of non-dominated individuals representing different levels of Pareto-optimal
    solutions. These individuals provide a range of approximate optimal solutions
    for the multiobjective optimization problem. 2.3 Optimal operation model based
    on simulation The simulation model of the CPSID was integrated with the optimal
    operation model of the PS in this study. By leveraging the interaction between
    these two sets of data, we constructed an optimal operation model for the PS that
    incorporates the inflow process, thereby achieving dynamic coupling between flow
    movement and PS operation. As illustrated in Figure 1, the simulation process
    begins by generating an initial operation scheme for the PS through optimization
    scheduling of the PS. The simulation model of the CPSID simulates hydraulic factors
    such as the water level and flow of the canal according to the operation scheme
    of the PS and the water distribution scheme of the canal, obtains the flow arrival
    process of the next-stage PS and calculates the target value (energy consumption
    of water lifting, times of start and stop) under the operation scheme. Second,
    the optimal operation model of the PS accepts the target value and gives a new
    optimization scheme through the optimization algorithm, which is passed into the
    simulation model of the CPS for calculation and repeated until the end conditions
    are met; finally, the optimization scheme results are obtained. FIGURE 1 Open

    model for cascade pumping stations. 3 APPLICATION CASE 3.1 Introduction to irrigation
    district The Zuncun Irrigation District is a CPSID for which water is lifted from
    the Yellow River in Shanxi province; this system integrates flood control, drainage
    and irrigation. Water from the Yellow River is transported to farmlands through
    CPS and through water transmission and distribution opening canals. The irrigation
    district is currently equipped with nine CPS, with a total installed capacity
    of 61,400 kW. The design head is 165.44 m, and the lifting flow rate is 46.50 m3/s.
    It is a typical CPSID with open canals. This study used the first-stage pumping
    station (FSPS), second-stage pumping station (SSPS) and first main canal (MC1)
    as the research objects to verify and simulate the established model. The FSPS
    is equipped with 9 units, with a total installed capacity of 6665 kW, all of which
    are axial-flow pumps; the SSPS is equipped with 18 units, with a total installed
    capacity of 17,200 kW, all of which are centrifugal pumps. MC1 starts from the
    outlet of the FSPS and extends to the inlet of the SSPS, for a total length of
    15.6 km. The cross section of MC1 is a trapezoid with an arc bottom. There are
    a total of 5 branch canals and 11 lateral canals in MC1, for which the effective
    irrigation area is 4025 ha. The parameters of MC1 are shown in Table 1, and the
    installed parameters of the PS are shown in Table 2. The data were sourced from
    the Zuncun Yellow River Irrigation Service Centre in Yuncheng City, Shanxi province

    Overview map of research area. 3.2 Simulation model application To ensure the
    reliability of the constructed optimal operation model based on simulation, we
    first validated the simulation module of the LWPCPS built in Section 2. We used
    the basic information of the irrigation district from Section 11 and the actual
    operational data within the study area from 5:00 AM on 27 June 2021 to 8:00 AM
    the next day as input data and evaluated and analysed the simulation results of
    the model. The measured data were provided by the Zuncun Yellow River Irrigation
    Service Centre in Yuncheng City, Shanxi province, and included the operational
    status of each unit, the PS and the water distribution for each hour. The initial
    operational status of the FSPS was as follows: Units 3, 4 and 5 were in the open
    state; the total lifting flow of the PS was 19.00 m3/s; and the diversion flow
    of Branch Canal 0 at Station 13 + 100 was 0.26 m3/s. The initial operational status
    of the SSPS was as follows: Units 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13 and 16 were in the
    open state, and the lifting flow was 20.69 m3/s. During operation, the number
    of pump unit switchings for the FSPS was 7, and for the SSPS, it was 11. The recorded
    operations of operators at the FSPS and the SSPS, as well as the interval water
    diversion flow rates from 5 AM on 27 June 2021 to 8 AM the next day, are shown
    in Table 3. TABLE 3. Actual dispatching strategies for pump stations on 27 June

    to the characteristics of the CPSID, the upper boundary was established by representing
    the flow boundary through the discharge flow process of the FSPS, while the lower
    boundary was defined by the flow-depth boundary. Additionally, within this model,
    the water distribution processes at specific locations serve as internal boundaries.
    Figures 3-6 show the results of the water-lifting flow of the FSPS and SSPS and
    the water level process of the SSPS. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    in inlet pool of second-stage pumping station. The performance curve of the units,
    fitted using the measured data, demonstrates an accurate simulation of the water-pumping
    process, as depicted in Figure 3. The observed values of the LWPCPS in the FSPS
    are consistent with the simulated results of the model, yielding a fitting determination
    coefficient (R2) of 0.845 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.942. In the
    model, the water-lifting flow is recalculated according to the different heads
    of each period, making the results closer to reality than those obtained with
    a fixed head. The simulation results of the water-lifting process of the SSPS
    are shown in Figure 4, where the fitted R2 is 0.905 and the RMSE is 0.875, which
    confirms the reliability of the established simulation of the water-lifting process.
    Figure 5 shows the flow process at the water distribution points. Due to the addition
    of the control measures of the sluice gate in the simulation, the model adjusts
    the opening of the sluice gate according to the real-time water level to meet
    the water distribution flow. The process of water distribution flow in 1 day is
    basically maintained at the average level of the total water distribution flow
    on that day. During the simulation period, the observed water distribution flow
    process closely aligns with the modelled water distribution flow process. The
    fitted R2 is 0.827, and the RMSE is 0.866. Figure 6 shows the water level process
    of the inlet pool at the SSPS. Since the water level of the inlet pool at the
    SSPS is strongly affected by the inflow process of the canal and the SSPS water-lifting
    process, it is difficult to accurately simulate the change in the inlet pool water
    level. The fitted R2 is 0.501, and the RMSE is 0.579; however, the trends of the
    simulated and observed values are basically the same, and the simulation results
    are reasonable, so the results can be used for research. In general, the simulation
    of the LWPCPS and the WTPOC constructed by the model can reflect the actual operation
    process of the CPSID. The lift and discharge of the upper-stage PS after adding
    the WTPOC are closer to the actual operation lift and flow. Therefore, the simulation
    model can provide preview support for subsequent optimization schemes. 3.3 Application
    of optimal operation model based on simulation The optimal operation model and
    simulation model constructed in Section 9 was applied to the study area. The actual
    startup scheme of the FSPS units and the water distribution scheme on 27 June
    2021 were used as boundary conditions. The objective was to optimize the operation
    scheme of the SSPS, aiming to reduce energy consumption and the number of pump
    unit switchings. The results of the model optimization are compared with the optimization
    results without considering the water transmission process through open canals
    (No-WTPOC) and the actual operation results. This comparative analysis was conducted
    to assess the optimization effectiveness of the comprehensive model constructed
    in this study. The constructed model is used to optimize the actual operation
    plan of the SSPS on 27 June 2021. According to the control range of the inlet
    pool controlled by the dispatcher on that day, the water level of the inlet pool
    of the control in the model fluctuates within 0.5 m of the initial water level
    on that day. Additionally, the pumping capacity of the SSPS should not fall below
    166.5 × 104 m3. The NSGA-II parameter settings used are shown in Table 4. TABLE
    4. Parameter settings of non-dominated sorted genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II).

    F9 from right to left as shown in Figure 7. FIGURE 7 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Optimized Pareto solution set. MOEA, multi-objective evolutionary algorithm; PF,
    Pareto front. Figure 8 shows the water level change process in the inlet pool
    of the SSPS under these three methods. Notably, the No-WTPOC method assumes that
    the pumping head of the PS is fixed during optimization. When the scheme was input
    into the simulation system, the flow imbalance was caused by a lack of consideration
    of the incoming water process. As shown in Figure 8, the water level in the inlet
    pool of the SSPS varies greatly beyond the safe operating range. In contrast,
    considering the simulation optimization method and the actual operation scheme,
    the water level fluctuation range of the inlet pool is within the control range,
    and the water level change gradient per hour is within the control range. This
    is because in actual operation, the dispatcher adjusts units according to the
    water level of the inlet pool to meet the flow balance. Similarly, the optimization
    model optimizes the scheme that meets the constraint conditions according to the
    simulation results to achieve flow balance so that the final scheme can also run
    safely. FIGURE 8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Comparison of water levels in
    inlet pool of secondary pumping station under different optimization methods.

    The energy consumption of water lifting of the actual operation scheme is 207,200 kW·h,
    as depicted in Figure 8 and Table 5. However, after implementing the optimization
    scheme, the energy consumption ranges from 198,756 to 199,870 kW·h, representing
    a reduction of 3.5%–4.1% compared to the actual operation scheme. Remarkably,
    even with an equal number of start and stop times, the operation energy consumption
    is still reduced by 4.1%. The optimization algorithm yields a lower energy consumption
    operation scheme globally under the same conditions than does the human decision
    scheme. TABLE 5. Comparison between actual and optimized solutions. Solutions

    4.1% −9% The energy consumption is inversely related to the number of pump unit
    switchings. In the Pareto solution set, the number of pump unit switchings reaches
    the highest value in the lowest energy consumption scheme. It can be observed
    that the optimized scheme generally results in less pump unit switching than in
    actual practice. However, when the switching number of pump units were more than
    eight times, even with adjustments made to water extraction during each period,
    there was only a marginal reduction in energy consumption. This indicates that
    within the controlled range of total water withdrawal and daily water inlet levels,
    the minimum achievable level for optimizing energy consumption is approximately
    198,892 kW·h. Under the constraint of the floating range of the water level of
    the inlet pool, the energy consumption of the unit in the F9 scheme is the lowest.
    The switching strategy involves maintaining the water level of the inlet pool
    at a high water level as much as possible and reducing energy consumption by reducing
    the lift head of the PS; however, the number of pump unit switchings will also
    increase with fluctuations in the incoming water. The unit energy consumption
    of the F1 scheme is the highest compared with that of the other schemes, and the
    number of pump unit switchings is only three. It is important to highlight that
    the start-stop strategy for F1 does not manifest as adjusting the units only when
    the water level reaches the constrained threshold (i.e. maintaining the original
    unit operation within the constraint range and adjusting the units when the water
    level is about to reach the threshold). Instead, it searches all the schemes that
    meet the constraints globally and selects the minimum number of pump unit switchings
    that can keep the water level within a feasible range for a long time. According
    to the optimization results, there is no scheme with zero pump unit switchings,
    possibly because if the unit operation is kept constant, depending on the incoming
    water, the level of the inlet pool will exceed the constrained water level range,
    resulting in a flow imbalance that will be left out of the evolutionary process.
    In each optimization scheme, the water level of the inlet pool is generally higher
    than that of the actual scheme, while the energy consumption of the optimized
    scheme is lower than that of the actual scheme, which also indicates that reducing
    the operating head of the PS can reduce its energy consumption to a certain extent.
    In general, the optimal operation model based on the simulation established in
    this paper comprehensively considers the impact of canal water delivery and pump
    station control strategies on achieving flow balance between stages. By optimizing
    the operational units of the SSPS, it is observed that the fluctuation range of
    the water level remains within the control limits, and the optimization reduces
    the operational energy consumption and the number of pump unit switchings. Considering
    that the main goal is to achieve the lowest energy consumption, switching the
    number of pump units is used as an auxiliary optimization goal. According to the
    optimization results, F4 reduces the energy consumption by 4.0% and reduces the
    number of pump unit switchings by 46%. Therefore, we choose F4 as the optimal
    scheme, and the results are shown in Table 6. Of course, the Pareto solution of
    the optimization gives the lowest energy consumption of the operation scheme under
    the respective number of pump unit switchings, and the administrator can also
    compare the schemes according to the actual situation. TABLE 6. Optimal control

    1:00–8:00 1#3#5#9#11#12#16# 4 DISCUSSION The proposed method in this study considered
    the dynamic balance between the LWPCPS and the WTPOC. The optimization model was
    constructed by integrating the simulation model of the CPSID and the optimal operation
    model of the CPS. Under the conditions of satisfying both the water distribution
    demands and the flow balance between stages, the proposed unit operation scheme
    can optimize energy consumption. The inclusion of the simulation model makes the
    optimization scheduling model for the CPS more readily acceptable to dispatchers.
    During irrigation, when there are changes in the operation state of the units
    or during the water distribution process, the water flow process from the upper-stage
    PS will also change. This change does not occur simultaneously with regulation
    but requires a certain amount of transmission time. The previous optimization
    schemes, such as the No-WTPOC scheme, will inevitably result in a mismatch of
    flow between the upper-stage and lower-stage PS, endangering the safe operation
    of the PS. From the research results in Figure 8, it is evident that the water
    level in the SSPS inlet reservoir varies significantly under this scheme. In practical
    terms, such an operational plan would be deemed unacceptable. Therefore, this
    study integrated the simulation model with the optimization model. The ability
    of the simulation model to simulate water flow and pumping processes continuously
    increases the understanding of the incoming water process in the upper-stage PS.
    The optimization results also reveal that the flow between the upper-stage and
    lower-stage PS can achieve dynamic balance. This finding is consistent with the
    conclusion that the optimized scheme was put into the simulation model for verification
    (Gong & Cheng, 2018). As evident from the results in Figures 3 and 4, the LWPCPS
    is more representative of the actual conditions. By introducing the multiobjective
    optimization model into the PS optimization scheduling model, the dispatcher can
    flexibly choose the operation scheme. In this study, the objective function was
    reconsidered. The traditional model was a single-objective optimization model
    constructed by setting the number of pump units to be switched into constraints.
    In contrast, this paper constructed a multiobjective optimization model by considering
    the number of pump unit switchings as the secondary optimization goal. The Pareto
    frontier solution set is obtained using a genetic algorithm, aiming to flexibly
    guide the daily operation of pump station dispatchers. The optimized solution
    set can yield the lowest energy consumption scheme under different unit switching
    compared to the traditional model. For example, in this case, the optimization
    model provides nine different options. Among these options, several can significantly
    reduce the wear of the unit caused by the number of pump unit switchings without
    significantly increasing energy consumption, for instance, the F1 scheme, which
    has only three switches, for which the energy consumption increases by only 7330 kW·h.
    When the maintenance cost of units and personnel operation costs, when converted,
    are significantly higher than the electricity cost, this scheme becomes the preferred
    choice for dispatch operators. There are also several schemes with relatively
    higher start-stop frequencies but with a significant reduction in energy consumption,
    such as the F9 scheme. By judiciously managing the water level of the pump station
    inlet pool, it is possible to mitigate unit wear, reduce energy consumption and
    alleviate the workload of management personnel. The optimization process selects
    the water level of the inlet pool of the PS as the coordinated variable. Treating
    the inlet pool as a small regulating reservoir enables achieving a two-stage flow
    balance by adjusting its water level. If the water level in the inlet pool needs
    to be maintained at maximum stability, frequent opening and stopping procedures
    should be implemented at the PS. However, if the water level in the inlet pool
    can fluctuate within a certain safe range, significant reductions in the frequency
    of opening and stopping operations at the PS can be achieved (Kong et al., 2019).
    In this study, water level fluctuations within 0.5 m of the initial level on the
    same day were controlled in the inlet pool. From the perspective of the optimization
    results, both the energy consumption and the number of pump units switched within
    an appropriate and acceptable range. Among the different PS, dispatch operators
    can reasonably adjust the fluctuation range of the influent inlet pool for each
    PS based on their characteristics, thereby achieving flow balance with smaller
    unit switching frequencies. According to the optimized result, the water level
    of the inlet pool of the scheme with lower energy consumption is basically maintained
    at a high level, as exemplified by F9. This also shows that it is energy-saving
    to keep the water level of the inlet pool as high as possible to reduce the lifting
    head. There is still room for optimization in the selection of algorithms. This
    study employs the fundamental NSGA-II to address this problem. While effectively
    identifying solutions and ensuring diversity in multiobjective optimization, NSGA-II
    still encounters challenges such as premature convergence and insufficient exploration
    of the solution space when dealing with complex models. In this paper, only the
    secondary station is optimized, while the water-lifting scheme and water distribution
    process of the primary station remain unchanged. The SSPS consists of four different
    types of units. The optimization period is discretized into 24 intervals, with
    decision variables limited to two states: ‘on’ and ‘off’. The solution is relatively
    simple, so the optimization results are ideal. However, in cases where the optimization
    cycle is prolonged and there is an increased number of pump stations, it becomes
    imperative to judiciously configure parameters such as crossover, variation and
    population size to enhance the global search capability. Failure to do so may
    lead to premature convergence and consequently yield suboptimal results during
    the optimization process. Although this study only applied the proposed model
    to the Zuncun Irrigation District, the proposed methodology remains applicable
    to other CPSID. The model proposed in this study consists of a simulation model
    of the CPSID and an optimal operation model of the CPS. For the simulation model
    of the CPSID, the WTPOC is constructed using the Saint-Venant equations. With
    respect to different open-canal cross-sectional shapes and inflow conditions for
    the PS, adjustments can be made by modifying the fundamental data and boundary
    conditions. The LWPCPS is modelled based on the characteristic curves of the PS
    itself. Commonly used centrifugal pumps and axial-flow pumps in irrigation areas
    are both applicable. 5 CONCLUSION This study proposes an optimization scheduling
    method for PS based on simulation modelling. In the optimization process, simulation
    deduction is incorporated to obtain scheduling schemes that satisfy flow balance.
    The proposed method was tested in a water-lifting irrigation area in China, and
    the results indicate that the model is capable of simulating the actual operational
    status of the irrigation area. The water-lifting process at the pump station and
    the trend of the changes in the inlet pool water level closely resemble real-world
    conditions. Compared to existing optimization scheduling methods, the optimal
    operation approach based on simulation can more effectively achieve flow balance.
    Furthermore, when state transitions occur in the lower-level pump station units
    or when changes in water distribution occur, the fluctuations in the inlet pool
    water level at the upper-level pump station remain within the controlled range.
    The optimized approach is also more likely to be practically adopted and applied.
    Compared to the actual scheduling schemes implemented by dispatch operators, the
    optimization approach results in a 4% reduction in energy consumption. Overall,
    the model developed in this study is rational and versatile, allowing for its
    application in other CPSID. This application has the potential to enhance both
    the energy efficiency of PS and the overall operational management proficiency.

    has many advantages over the open-field production as better monitoring for climate
    conditions and proper maintenance techniques which allows to have off-season year-round
    production and higher yield. Greenhouse can produce up to 15 times more yield
    per area compared to open-field production [43]. Greenhouses are categorized according
    to the applied technology inside them. During the last 25 years, Egypt has applied
    new greenhouse structures with double span that have better ventilation and easier
    management. In the middle of 1990s, new investigators in Egypt started to use
    multi-span greenhouses as double span ones don’t suit large farming. During the
    last 15 years, farmers adopted Parron system to greenhouses by using wooden structure
    with higher height and more ventilation. They implement such technique to have
    better production for vegetables and tropical fruits inside greenhouses. Using
    wooden structures instead of steel structures will reduce the capital cost of
    the project so motivating more investors to start apply protective farming [1].
    During 1980s, low technology greenhouses started to shift to modern technology
    greenhouses to reduce the environmental hazards such as soil fertility degradation
    and groundwater pollution that occur because of the excess use of pests and chemicals
    inside the low technology greenhouses [2]. In addition, adequate and suitable
    water irrigation resources are essential for growth of crop producing food; indeed,
    there are barriers that face the reclamation of large areas of desert land such
    as the lack of suitable water resources and the high cost of providing water.
    Although surface irrigation water is insufficient on a global scale to meet our
    demands, there is an abundance of salt water in Earth’s seas and oceans, covering
    2/3 of the area of the world, as well as brackish water on land. Both of which
    may be adequately desalinated using techniques such as reverse osmosis, provided
    that sufficient energy is available. In addition, with sufficient energy, we can
    also draw water from deep aquifers and bring them to the surface to water the
    crops, as well as reduce their salinity if need be. Hence, long-term development
    requires a sustainable source of energy to be used to fill the gap in the available
    irrigation water resources. The agricultural sector dependency on energy resources
    has been increased like other sectors [7]. The reason behind that is the modernization
    of many agricultural production operations such as irrigation using new techniques
    to save time and water loss [29]. Globally, irrigation pumps consume about 62,000,000
    MWh of electricity annually [57]. Some areas don’t have access to the grid; therefore,
    they have to find an alternative way to get electricity. Most of these areas mainly
    depend on diesel, gasoline, and kerosine pumps to pump water for irrigation. Diesel
    pumps are the most used for crop irrigation [33]. However, this might not be a
    proper solution especially for remote areas, as transportation cost and cost of
    maintenance for pumps are relatively high [3]. Some experts estimate that the
    remaining fossil fuel will be fully used within 50 years as the annual increase
    rate of energy consumption is assumed to be 1.4% from 2008 to 2035 [34]. This
    raises the importance of using renewable energy sources. In particular, solar
    energy is expected to have an effective role in renewable and sustainable energy
    development especially in remote areas [26]. In Egypt, the annual global solar
    radiation ranges between 2000 and 3200 kWh m−2 from north to south which gives
    a great potential for applying PV systems [50]. According to New and Renewable
    Energy Authority (NREA), the total installed capacities in Egypt are around 15
    MW, and most of them are stand-alone systems to power different applications such
    as lighting systems (27%), cell phone networks (25%), advertising lighting systems
    (16%), communication systems (13%), cathodic protection systems (7%), water pumping
    systems (6%), rural electrification, refrigeration, and others (6%) [12]. Generally,
    the most abundant source of renewable energy in the areas of the world which suffer
    most from shortage of irrigation water, such as the Sahara Desert region, is the
    solar energy. This also raises the importance of installing PV system to generate
    electricity to drive deep submersible pumps to draw water from boreholes. The
    PV system is characterized by durability, low carbon emissions, easy maintenance,
    and relatively low cost for maintenance [40]. The output of the PV installations
    is continuously variable and depends on both the characteristics of the PV modules
    and their components and the instantaneous atmospheric conditions. On the demand
    side, the amount of daily water requirements for irrigation fluctuates widely
    with location, climate, season, soil type, water type, and crop type. Hence if
    PV system is used to meet the irrigation needs of one single crop, it may be dormant
    most of the time if this crop is seasonal, and highly oversized the rest of the
    time if the summer and winter demands vary widely as the case with most crops.
    Hence, this situation will be highly uneconomical and is also waste of energy
    resources. In this paper, an optimization model was developed to aid investigators
    in the agricultural industry to find the best combination of crops inside greenhouses
    that have the maximum EACF. 2 Literature Review 2.1 Greenhouse Farming Management
    Optimizing greenhouse farming annual return is done by proper planning for greenhouse
    farming, resource allocation, and optimizing the use of resources. Due to the
    complexity of the sector, most of the researchers use linear programming approach
    to determine the optimal crop combinations and feasibility of decision variables
    [8]. Linear programming starts with a feasible solution and uses pivot operations
    to maintain the feasibility of the solution and identify the value of the objective
    function. Pap [45] established a mathematical model of optimal agricultural production
    plan applied on a small farm located in west Vojvodina using linear programming
    model to maximize the total return by adopting crop rotation policy. The results
    indicate that applying rotation policy will aid to have higher revenues compared
    to the traditional crop practices [45]. The Food and Agricultural Organization
    estimates that food production will need to be increased by 70% to feed the population
    in 2050 [28]. This leads researchers to not only focus on crop yield but also
    on sustainable growth. Sarker and Quaddus [53] compared two versions of the crop
    planning problem which are single objective linear programming approach and multi-objective
    approach with conflicting objectives. Linear programing approach presents one
    optimal solution while multi-objective technique offers set of possible solutions
    as so provides a better vision for crop planning program, and the user has to
    choose the appropriate solution [53]. This raises the importance of optimizing
    the net benefit in addition to the environmental factors such as water and energy
    to reach the optimum solution. Optimizing the water use will aid to increase the
    annual return as well as optimize the resources used; therefore, [36] developed
    a multi-objective water allocation model to optimize the economic, social, and
    environmental benefits of an area. The results showed that the model provides
    a sustainable approach to allocate water resources in regions where there is lack
    of water resources and accordingly allocates the resources [36]. However, this
    requires accurate estimation for the required water for irrigation as well as
    the available water to be able to calculate the required energy to draw water
    from the water source. Studying the regional climate is essential for accurate
    calculations for the irrigation water requirements. Most of the previous models
    were developed using linear programing approach; however, Hosny et al. [27] introduced
    a comprehensive database and multi-objective optimization model using GA that
    aids the user to find efficient and economic methodology for the best utilization
    of land for either open-field farming or greenhouse farming. However, the greenhouse
    farming depends on data that has to be entered by the user [27]. This means higher
    consumption of energy, i.e., higher cost of production. Therefore, developing
    a comprehensive database and having a balance between crop planning, used resources,
    the yield of production and energy consumption is essential to reach the maximum
    net benefit. 2.2 Stand-alone PVWP System for Irrigation Collecting the sun energy
    is for free but it needs the appropriate equipment to have an optimized system.
    There are various methods for optimizing stand-alone PV systems [23, 31, 32, 46].
    The previous studies analyzed the performance of PV system based on two important
    factors which are regional climates (i.e., the geographical factors and meteorological
    factors) and the available area characteristics (i.e., the on-site installation
    factors and the available area) [4, 22, 31]. Some studies have been done to maximize
    the performance of PV system by only considering the azimuth angle of the installed
    panels (ψ) which concluded that the southwest orientation is the best orientation
    for year-round performance for the Northern hemisphere [51]. Other studies have
    been done to maximize the average year-round performance by optimizing the slope
    of the installed panels (β) which revealed that the optimal angle for the installed
    panels is the same as the latitude [54]. Gopinathan et al. [24] developing a model
    to maximize the performance by introducing more than one factor. The solar irradiance
    was estimated based on the ψ (− 90° to 90°) and the β (0°–90°), and the results
    showed that the β changed as the ψ got away from south (0°) [24]. However, most
    of the previous studies ignore the effect of the ambient temperature on the PV
    performance. Several studies have identified that the PVWP system can be an attractive
    application for sustainable energy for irrigation. Hamidat et al. [25] established
    a program to test the PVWP system performance used to irrigate regions in the
    Sahraa, and it was concluded that PVWP systems are suitable for crop irrigation
    in small-scale applications [25]. Cuadros et al. [15] illustrated how to design
    PVWP systems using drip irrigation method to have an effective irrigating water
    system for olive tree orchard in Spain [15]. Recent research on PVWP systems has
    focused mainly on system modeling and improvements in the system components (PV
    modules, controllers, inverters), performance of PVWP system under various operating
    heads, and their effect on the environment [35, 38, 41]. Glasnovic and Margeta
    [22] proposed an optimization model for optimizing the PVWP size taking into consideration
    the required water for irrigation and the available water. They concluded that
    dynamic models give more realistic results; however, the economic performance
    for the lifecycle cost analysis (LCCA) was not covered [22]. Kelley et al. studied
    the technical and economic feasibility for implementing PVWP system for irrigation
    and concluded that there are no barriers for applying PVWP system; however, the
    only barrier is the high price of the PV modules [31]. Therefore, a LCCA is required
    to prove the compatibility of the PVWP system. 3 Model Development and Formulation
    The model targets the best utilization of the land by maximizing the return, and
    this will occur by balancing between the crops’ profit, the required water, and
    the size of PVWP system. As the user enters the necessary inputs, the model investigates
    the best combination of crops, starting date for each crop, occupied area for
    each crop and type of panel (ToP). The purpose of the model is to find the maximum
    equivalent annual net cash flow (EACF) by having a dynamic simulation of PVWP
    system, solar irradiance, required water for irrigation, and crop yield response
    to season. In addition, the economic aspects of the PVWP systems are investigated.
    IIC and LCCA are used to compare different water pumping techniques, and EACF
    is used to evaluate the net benefits gain, which will be further detailed in the
    upcoming sections. 3.1 Model Architecture The developed model consists of five
    different modules: (1) inputs module, (2) database module, (3) calculations module,
    (3) optimization module, and (5) output module. First, the user inputs all the
    required information for the project through the input module. Then, the database
    module is filtered according to the input data. Next, the calculation module uses
    the filtered database and the inserted inputs to calculate the required parameters
    for calculating crops net benefits and sizing the PVWP system. After that, the
    optimization modules will use these data to optimize the objective function which
    is maximizing the EACF by adjusting the model variables to generate the results
    in the output module. 3.1.1 Inputs Module The model allows the user to enter the
    required data which includes the following: • Location • Irrigation method • Area
    (feddan) • Cost of structure system/m2 (US$) • Budget (US$) • Cost of wiring/m2
    (US$) • Soil salinity Ece (dS/m) • Electricity annual degradation (%) • Electric
    conductivity Eciw (dS/m)   The model reads and uses the input data to optimize
    EACF and PVWP system for the combination of crops that have been selected by the
    model. The model has been developed using Microsoft-Excel and Evolver 8.2 which
    is an Excel Add-in [44]. The model consists of several worksheets. To be able
    to insert the inputs, gets into the worksheet, named “model inputs,” and fills
    in the required data as indicated in Table 1. Inputs guide the user to include
    the correct data in the right place. The model has been developed to read the
    input data inserted by the user and share them among other worksheets to estimate
    the essential parameters for optimizing the model such as the reference evapotranspiration
    (ETO) and the hourly average solar radiation (I). Table 1 PV panels’ specification
    Full size table 3.1.2 Database Module The database module consists of two main
    parts: data on crops’ requirements and data on PVWP system. Data on Crops’ Requirement
    The first part in the crops’ requirement database contains data about the crops
    and trees that can be grown inside greenhouses in Egypt. The total duration for
    a pool of crops according to planting season is collected [13, 27, 48, 56]. In
    addition, the crop coefficient (KC) value for each crop during different growing
    stages is identified according to Cropwat that are freely distributed by the Food
    and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United States [30]. Also, the crops’
    costs are recognized according to the Egyptian market, they include the cost of
    making rows, seeds, fixed, temporary workers and engineers, composites, fertilizers,
    and pesticides. The second part includes data about the greenhouses and their
    costs. In this study, the analysis was based on single span greenhouses using
    medium technology. Data on PVWP Systems It includes two main sections which required
    for PV system and data on water pumping system. Concerning, the database of PV
    system involves two main parts. The first one covers the regional meteorological
    and geographical information for 27 governorates in Egypt collected from the National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). The global sunshine hours and solar
    radiation values for 27 locations covered almost all regions in Egypt are calculated
    and presented in “database module.” The yearly average value of sunshine hours
    is 12 h per day, and the global solar radiation in Egypt is found to be around
    6.0 kWh m−2 day−1 which give a great potential for applying PV system there. The
    second part deals with the specifications of the PV modules. They are categorized
    into six groups according to their type (monocrystalline or polycrystalline) and
    number of cells (36, 60, or 72) as indicated in Table 1. The physical information
    for the panels, i.e., capacity, efficiency, dimensions, losses, average cost,
    temp coefficient of power, PV transmittance, rated voltage, rated current open
    circuit voltage, and short circuit current, was collected according to the Egyptian
    market. Moving to the water pumping system, the selection of a proper pump in
    a solar water pumping system depends on required discharge (Q) and total head
    losses (HTE) [19]. Each pump type has its own efficiency as presented in Table
    2 [6]. Usually, the pump controller system includes maximum power point tracker
    (MPPT) to assure that the solar array is delivering power at its maximum. AC powered
    pump has also inverter to convert the DC power to AC. Table 2 Pump’s type versus
    efficiency [6] Full size table 3.1.3 Calculation Module The calculation module
    consists of three models. The first model calculates the hydraulic energy (EH)
    by identifying the required discharge (Q) for the combination of crops and the
    total head losses (HTE). The second unit is for sizing the PV system that gives
    the power output from the PV array based on location (Φ), slope (β), type of panels
    (ToP), azimuth of panels (Ψ), and ambient temperature (Ta) to generate the water
    irrigation system. The third model is to analyze the economic performance of PVWP
    system using EACF approach. Hydraulic Energy (EH): The hydraulic energy demand
    (EH) is determined according to the plants water requirements, the irrigation
    method, and the total head losses according to Eq. (1) [22, 55], $$ E_{\\text{H}}
    = \\frac{{\\rho gQ_d H_{{\\text{TE}}} }}{36*10^5 *\\eta_F \\eta_N } $$ (1) where
    Qd is the total water demand in (m3 day−1), EH is the hydraulic energy (kWh),
    ρ is the density of water (1000 kg m−3), g is the acceleration due to gravity
    (9.81 m s−2), ηF is the efficiency of the irrigation system (fractional losses),
    ηN is the efficiency of the irrigation method (open channel, drip, trickle, flood).
    Concerning the total water demand if the sum of crop evapotranspiration (ETc),
    leaching requirement (LR), and irrigation applied in soil disinfection and pre-transplanted
    irrigation, i.e., 50 mm for soil disinfection done every (1–2) years and 20 mm
    for pre-transplanted, needed to be calculated [9, 14, 30]. To be able to calculate
    the ETc using Eq. (2) [47], the reference evapotranspiration (ETO) was calculated
    according to Almeria radiation method using Eq. (3) [39], and the KC values are
    extracted from Cropwat. $$ {\\text{ET}}_{\\text{c}} = K_{\\text{c}} {\\text{*ET}}_{\\text{o}}
    $$ (2) $$ {\\text{ET}}_{\\text{o}} = \\left\\{ {\\begin{array}{*{20}l} {\\left(
    {0.288 + 0.0019n} \\right)R_o \\tau } \\hfill & {{\\text{Julian}}\\;{\\text{days}}
    \\left( n \\right) \\le 220} \\hfill \\\\ {\\left( {1.339 - 0.00288n} \\right)R_o
    \\tau } \\hfill & {{\\text{Julian}}\\;{\\text{days}} \\left( n \\right) > 220}
    \\hfill \\\\ \\end{array} } \\right.{ } $$ (3) The leaching requirement (LR):
    The leaching requirement is the amount of water needed to remove excessive salts
    that cause a crop yield decrement, and it was calculated using Eq. (4) [14], where
    ECiw is the electrical conductivity of the irrigation water applied, and ECe is
    the soil salinity tolerated by crop as measured on soil saturation extract. $$
    {\\text{LR}} = \\frac{{{\\text{EC}}_{{\\text{iw}}} }}{{5{\\text{EC}}_{\\text{e}}
    - {\\text{EC}}_{{\\text{iw}}} }} $$ (4) Moving to the total head loss, the typical
    head consists of static head (HST), kinetic head (HDT), and pressure head (HF).
    According to Ghoneim, the static head is the elevation head from the water surface
    level to the point of discharge, the kinetic head represents the kinetic energy
    of the fluid (\\(H_{{\\text{DT}}} = V^2 /{ }2g\\)), where V is the velocity and
    g is the acceleration (9.81 m sec−2). In addition, there is a fraction loss that
    can be reduced by enlarging the pipe diameter, eliminating bends, and reducing
    the flow rate [21]. Therefore, the total head from borehole TTE can be expressed
    by Eq. (5) [22], where increment i assumes the values i = 1 to N (N is the total
    number of time stages, decades), HTE(i) the total head lift (m). $$ H_{{\\text{TE}}\\left(
    i \\right)} = H_{{\\text{ST}}\\left( i \\right)} + H_{{\\text{DT}}\\left( i \\right)}
    + H_{{\\text{F}}\\left( i \\right)} $$ (5) Friction losses are calculated according
    to Eq. (6) [16], where f is Darcy friction factor, l is the pipe length (m). Darcy
    friction factor can be identified from moody chart. The minor fractional losses
    are assumed to be 10% according to PV project analysis in 2005 [49]. $$ H_{{\\text{F}}\\left(
    i \\right)} = \\frac{8flQ^2 }{{\\pi^2 gd^5 }} $$ (6) Nominal power capacity of
    PV system (Pel): The nominal capacity or peak power of PV (Pel) generator under
    standard conditions is given by Eq. (7) [18, 22] considering the effect of the
    ambient temperature (Ta), where Pel is the nominal capacity (W), αP is the temperature
    coefficient of PV module (/°C), TC is the cell temperature (°C), TC,STM is the
    cell temperature at standard test conditions (°C), ηS is the efficiency of the
    subsystem (inverter, motor, pump), IT is the daily solar irradiation on PV surface
    (kWh m−2). $$ P_{{\\text{el}}} = \\frac{1000}{{(1 - \\alpha_{\\text{P}} \\left(
    {T_{\\text{C}} - T_{{\\text{C}},{\\text{STM}}} } \\right)\\eta_{\\text{S}} }}{*}\\frac{{E_{\\text{H}}
    }}{{I_{\\text{T}} }} $$ (7) To calculate the daily solar irradiance in PV surface,
    an empirical model is greatly needed especially for areas where there is no available
    data for the solar irradiance. The model is established to estimate the hourly
    horizontal solar radiation from the average daily solar radiation. El Shimy proved
    that CR model [11] has a higher correlation than LJ model [37] [18]. Therefore,
    the ratio between the hourly solar radiation and the daily solar radiation was
    calculated using CR model as identified in Eq. (8) [11] [18], where I is the mean
    hourly solar radiation, H is the mean daily solar radiation, ω is the hour angle,
    and ωs is the sunset hour angle. $$ \\frac{I}{H} = a + b\\cos \\omega \\frac{{\\left(
    {\\frac{\\pi }{24}} \\right)(\\cos \\omega - \\cos { }\\omega_s )}}{{\\sin \\omega_s
    - \\left( {\\frac{2\\pi \\omega_s }{{360}}} \\right)\\cos \\omega_s }} $$ (8)
    The coefficients of the CR model are defined as the following: $$ \\begin{aligned}
    a & = 0.409 + 0.5016\\sin \\left( {\\omega_S - 60{\\circ} } \\right) \\\\ b &
    = { }0.6609 - 0.4767\\sin \\left( {\\omega_S - 60{\\circ} } \\right) \\\\ \\end{aligned}
    $$ Next, Erb’s correlation equation is used to calculate the diffuse fraction
    using Eq. (9) [20]. Then, the direct hourly solar radiation (Ib) is calculated
    by subtracting the diffused hourly solar radiation (Id) from the total hourly
    solar radiation (I). After that, the HDKR model is used to estimate the collected
    solar radiation on tilted surface (IT) using Eq. (10) [17]. Figure 1 represents
    a sample that was developed by the model for total, diffused, and direct solar
    radiation on horizontal surface and the estimated collected solar radiation on
    a tilted PV surface (β = 25°) at Aswan that lies at latitude 24.09011 on July
    17.Next, Erb’s correlation equation is used to calculate the diffuse fraction

    According to photovoltaic project analysis, the ambient temperature is considered
    using Eq. (11), as it affects the power capacity of the PV as indicated before
    in Eq. (7), $$ T_c = \\frac{{T_a + \\left( {219 + 832K_t } \\right)C_f \\left(
    {T_{cn} - 20} \\right)}}{800} $$ (11) where Ta is the ambient air temperature
    (°C), Kt is the monthly average clearance index, Cf is a correction factor to
    account for the effect of off-optimal tilt angle of the PV generator on the temperature
    of the PV modules [49], and Tcn is the nominal operating cell temperature (°C).
    Lifecycle Economic Assessment: The IIC is estimated based on the component prices,
    structure costs, wiring costs, and engineering and installation costs. The LCC
    is estimated using Eq. (12) [42], where CO&M is present worth of the operation
    and maintenance costs, and CF is the fuel costs. The operational and maintenance
    costs are considered as 1% of IIC of PV system/year [46]. $$ {\\text{LCC}} = {\\text{IIC}}
    + {\\text{C}}_{{\\text{O}}\\& {\\text{M}}} + {\\text{C}}_{\\text{F}} $$ (12) Crops
    revenue, excess electricity generated in case, there PV system is connected to
    the grid, and reduction of CO2 emissions is the potential revenues that can be
    generated through the operation of a PVWP irrigation system. In this study, the
    profitability of PVWP system is analyzed using the NPV and EACF as economic indicators
    and can be calculated using Eqs. (13)–(15) [52], where i is the discount rate,
    n is the period of the LCCA, Rt is the net cash flow at time t, and t is the time
    of cash flow. EACF approach is used to solve the problem of having different life
    spans. Therefore, lifecycle economic model is developed to conduct LCCA based
    on EACF, and some assumptions need to be established as follows: the analysis
    approach, the real discount rate, the analysis period, and the significant cost
    of ownership. $$ {\\text{NPV}} = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{t = 0}^n \\frac{R_t
    }{{\\left( {1 + i} \\right)^t }} $$ (13) $$ {\\text{EACF}} = \\frac{{{\\text{NPV}}}}{{A_{t,i}

    $$ (15) 3.1.4 Optimization Module The model is developed on Microsoft-Excel using
    Evolver. Evolver is an Excel Add-in that applies GA technique to reach the near
    optimum solution. The Add-in makes several runs by adjusting the decision variables
    which is defined as adjustable variables, then the GA keeps running different
    likelihoods in an iterative mode till the stopping criteria is met, then the optimum
    solution is reached. The stopping criteria will be defined by the user as number
    of trials, run time, maximum progress (%) that happens for last specific number
    of trials, formula if true, or/and stop if error occurs. In this study, the model
    adjustable variables are defined as the combination of crops, the starting data
    for each crop (planting date), the occupied area for each crop and ToP. Every
    adjustable parameter has a defined lower and upper limit. The constraints are
    set as the allowable budget and the available land area to meet the objective
    function which is maximizing the EACF. Concerning the occupied area for crops,
    it was found that there should be a minimum assigned area for each crop to worth
    the investments. Therefore, another constraint is added that the minimum occupation
    area for any crop should be one feddan. In addition, overestimation for the PVWP
    system size will lead to over increase the IIC and consequently minimizing the
    EACF. On the other hand, underestimation for the PVWP system means to have improper
    Q which will have negative effects on the quality and the quantity of the crops
    and also affects the EACF negatively. Therefore, other constraints are set as
    the following: The actual energy at any instant is higher than the required energy
    to ensure that the system is sufficient and minimizing the difference between
    the actual and the required energy to prove system efficiency. 3.1.5 Output Module
    The output module provides the user with the maximum EACF, in addition, identifying
    the combination of crops, the starting date for each crop, occupied area for each
    crop and ToP to be used to meet the objective function. In addition to other economic
    parameters such as NPV, IIC, estimated quantity for water used per year, and percentage
    for the maximum utilization of the land. 3.2 Model Development The development
    of the model depends on integrating two main models to reach the required objective
    which is selecting combination of crops that have the maximum EACF and irrigated
    using an optimized PVWP system. The first main model is to select the combination
    of crops that have the maximum equivalent annual return, and the second model
    is to optimize the size of the PVWP system. Integrating these two models with
    some modifications leads to develop the new model which is never done before.
    The model formulation is described in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Model formulation flow diagram
    Full size image 4 Model Validation To outline to what extent the developed optimization
    model describes the system and for the purpose of determining appropriate results,
    verification of the model is essential. To verify the developed optimization model,
    two locations in Egypt, i.e., Luxor and Giza, having different climatic and environmental
    conditions have been selected. Considering all system parameters are variable,
    it is required to determine their reference values upon which certain variables
    change. Then, their effect on calculation of EACF and other parameters is observed.
    4.1 Area in the Luxor Region 4.1.1 Reference Parameters The reference parameters
    for Luxor region have been selected as indicated in Table 3. Table 3 Reference
    parameters for Luxor region Full size table This study selects the irrigation
    period to be twice a week in summer and once a week in winter, which is in practice
    more realistic, in view of water and energy consumption as there is no significant
    change in the moisture of the active soil from which crops intake water. 4.1.2
    Optimization Results for Reference Parameters for Luxor The optimization results
    of the combination of crops, area for each crop, and starting date for each crop
    and ToP are shown in Table 4 which represents the log of progress steps in the
    optimization process of the developed optimization model. The EACF was maximized
    to 318,620 US$ when the combination of crops was Tomato I, Tomato IV, Sweet Pepper
    II, and Mango, and the corresponding area for each crop was 2, 1, 1, and 1 feddan,
    respectively, as illustrated in Table 5. The maximum EACF satisfied by selecting
    3 different types of crops that required 50,803 Wp as optimal nominal electric
    power of PV generator. Tomato crop is planted in two different seasons as indicated
    in Table 5. To satisfy the required nominal power, 134 panels of type 6 were required.

    table Table 5 Optimization results of PVWP system for Luxor Full size table The
    difference between the daily energy produced and the daily required hydraulic
    energy is as shown in Fig. 3. The positive values for the energy indicate that
    the system is sufficient as EAi − EHi >= 0. To have an efficient system the max
    (EAi) − max (EHi) ≈ 0, it was observed that the critical period occurs on day
    72 as the difference between max EAi − max EHi is 3.88 kWh as indicated in Fig.
    3. Fig. 3 Daily energy losses for Luxor (kWh) Full size image 4.2 Location in
    the Giza Area 4.2.1 Reference Parameters The same reference parameters have been
    selected as for the area in Luxor location except for the climate parameters and
    the soil type. Giza is located at latitude of 30.00951 resulted in different meteorological
    data than Luxor area. The type of soil is assumed to be sand. 4.2.2 Optimization
    Results for Reference Parameters for Giza The optimization results of the combination
    of crops, area for each crop, starting date for each crop, and occupied area for
    each crop and ToP are shown in Table 6 which represents the log of progress steps
    in the optimization process of the developed optimization model. The EACF was
    maximized to 397,064 US$ when the combination of crops was Sweet Pepper, Green
    Beans II, and Mango, and the corresponding area for each crop was 3, 1, and 1
    feddan, respectively, as illustrated in Table 7. Sweet Pepper has three different
    planting dates as indicated in Table 7. The nominal maximum power required to
    satisfy the requirements of the irrigation system is 72,486 Wp. To satisfy the
    required nominal power, 191 panels of type 6 were required. Table 6 Log of progress
    steps in the optimization process for Giza Full size table Table 7 Optimization
    results of PVWP system for Giza Full size table The difference between the daily
    energy produced and the daily required hydraulic energy is as shown in Fig. 4.
    The positive values for the energy indicate that the system is sufficient as EAi
    − EHi >= 0. To have an efficient system the max (EAi) − max (EHi) ≈ 0, it was
    observed that the critical period occurs on day 209 as the difference between
    EAi − EHi is 7.77 kWh as indicated in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Daily energy losses for Giza
    (kWh) Full size image 5 Results and Discussion The LCCA indicated that it worth
    to investigate in Giza than in Luxor as it has higher NPV, higher estimated revenue
    for the first year, and higher return per every 1 m3 of water within the allowable
    budget compared to Luxor as indicated in Table 8. Table 8 LCCA for Luxor and Giza
    optimizations Full size table Although the average daily water requirements for
    both locations are almost the same, there is a big difference in the number of
    required panels. The required number of panels are 134 for Luxor and 191 for Giza
    although same ToP is used in both locations. This can be justified as Luxor has
    higher estimated solar irradiance than Giza as indicated in Fig. 5 considering
    the effect of the Ta on the performance of the PV modules. Fig. 5 Estimated monthly
    average solar radiation PV surface (kW/m2) Full size image Although the same reference
    parameters were used for both locations except for climate values and soil type,
    noticeable difference in the EACF is obtained. This can be justified as Luxor
    has lower net benefit form crops because of the transportation costs. In addition,
    soil salinity for Luxor (1.1 dS m−1) has lower value compared to Giza (1.3 dS
    m−1) resulted in higher leaching requirement for Luxor. The higher solar irradiance
    in Luxor also leads to higher ETo which means higher ETC. Therefore, the total
    water requirements for Luxor will be greater compared to Giza. By variation of
    different elements in the optimization output, it can be concluded that the model
    response to any change in the reference parameters. 6 Conclusion The proposed
    model presented in this study introduced a new approach to the problem by considering
    almost all the relevant factors affecting both the PV system and the irrigation
    system such as location, PVWP system, local climate, soil type, water source,
    total head losses, pool of different crops, and irrigation system. Accurate estimation
    for the irrigation water requirements and solar irradiance was carried out. In
    addition, the PV energy output was calculated taking into consideration the slope
    of installed panels (β), modules’ azimuth (Ψ), and the effect of the ambient temperature
    (Ta) on the performance of the PV modules as well. The model was developed based
    on GA technique. Then, the model was verified by comparing the model outputs for
    two locations in Egypt (Luxor and Giza), and it was proved that the model describes
    the subject system very well as several useful outcomes achieved. The model was
    run to maximize the EACF by considering the net benefit from the combination of
    the crops and the PVWP system costs. Accordingly, the ToP, combinations of crops,
    starting date for each crop, and occupied area for each crop were adjusted to
    meet the objective function. This model is characterized by having a flexible
    database module that can be edited by the user if needed. Next, the model outputs
    were generated including maximum EACF, economic analysis, and optimized PVWP system
    size. It was also observed that the total irrigation water requirements and the
    available solar irradiance have significant effects on the EACF through comparing
    the optimization results for the two locations (Luxor and Giza). Although Luxor
    is characterized by high solar irradiance which gives it an advantage over other
    locations in optimizing the PV system size, it was noticed that higher percentage
    of water for irrigation is required because of higher ETo value resulted from
    the high solar irradiance. Giza provided better economic analysis than Luxor as
    it had higher EACF (397,064 US$) compared to Luxor (318,620 US$) and higher return
    per 1 m3 of water (20.15 US$) compared to Luxor (16.26 US$). In both locations,
    the PVWP system was considered as sufficient system as the EAi − EHi > 0. The
    percentage of the total energy losses in both locations exceeded 50% which highlight
    the importance of optimizing the percentage of the total energy losses; therefore,
    further investigation on applying other options for energy storage systems is
    greatly needed. To sum up, the optimization model presented in this study is an
    example for how technology and sustainability can be integrated into agricultural
    sector to help farmers and investigators to find efficient and economic practice
    for the best utilization of land for greenhouse farming while bridging the gap
    of overestimation for irrigation water and consequently oversizing for PVWP system.

  description: Besides irrigation and power generation, reservoirs in India also play
    a vital role in protecting the country from floods. During flood, reservoirs store
    and release the excess water according to its capacity and future requirement.
    It is imperative that the reservoir has to be operated effectively to conserve
    water so that competing goals can be accomplished. This requires an extensive
    investigation and the development of new system analysis approaches using meta-heuristic
    techniques of soft computing. The Omkareshwar Sagar Project (OSP) Reservoir in
    India has been designed to satisfy annual demands, protect against flooding, and
    produce maximum power generation, which is used for analysis in the current study.
    The present study incorporates one conventional optimization method the nonlinear
    programming (NLP), a semi- conventional method the genetic algorithm (GA) and
    a meta-heuristic technique the teaching–learning-based optimization (TLBO) to
    solve the problem of optimum operation in a flood scenario. A flood-release protocol
    has to be developed keeping the objective of maximum power output and reach the
    specified storage target at the end of the operation. Present study has been a
    successful attempt in getting the desired results, and the adoptability of the
    TLBO for complex problem is also proven.

    Optimization Algorithms Article 06 February 2024 1 Introduction Irrigation, hydropower,
    navigation, and flood management are reservoirs’ significant economic contributors
    to the benefit of any country. Besides irrigation and power generation, the reservoirs
    in India also play a vital role in protecting the country from floods. During
    the floods, reservoirs store and release the excess water according to its capacity
    and future requirement. Flood protection and optimizing power generation and storage
    for future use are important reservoir objectives that are competing with one
    another. It is imperative that the reservoir has to be operated effectively to
    conserve water so that competing goals can be accomplished in an optimum manner.
    Reservoir management has benefited from the development and use of both traditional
    and more recent meta-heuristic optimization methodologies. Traditional reservoir
    operation methods include linear programming (LP), nonlinear Programming (NLP),
    and dynamic programming (DP). Each one had many advantages thus has been applied
    to many problems in reservoir operation studies. The disadvantages of these strategies
    outweigh the benefits. LP requires a linear objective function and constraints,
    whereas DP is bound by dimensionality, and NLP is incapable of addressing the
    non-convex issue efficiently on its own (Hosseini-Moghari et al. 2015). Many reviews
    (Yeh 1985; Wurbs 1993; Rani and Moreira 2010) on reservoir planning and operation
    are available in the literature. To alleviate the difficulties and to overcome
    the limitations, there has been a constant hunt for new optimization techniques
    that can produce globally optimal solutions. The advent of soft computing techniques
    in general and meta-heuristic algorithms [MA] techniques in particular have revolutionized
    the optimization process. MA are probabilistic approximation techniques that allow
    efficiently solving optimization problems. (Nesmachnow 2014) A review on MA along
    with the water resources applications can be seen in Reddy and Kumar (2020) and
    reservoir optimization problems in particular in Lai et al. (2022). The MA techniques
    are further classified as evolutionary algorithms (EA), swarm intelligence algorithms
    (SIA), and other algorithms based on certain natural physical processes or human-induced
    processes. The basic premise on which EAs work is to generate a population of
    possible solutions through a selection mechanism, evolution, and reproduction
    to achieve better solutions. The genetic algorithms (GA) introduced by Holland
    (1992) is the most commonly applied EA which is applied mostly to the optimization
    of reservoir operations. The algorithm is straightforward and easy to implement.
    The limitations of GA are discussed in Lai et al. (2022). GA is considered to
    be a slower optimization technique, and its chance of sticking to a local optimum
    is maximum. The teaching–learning-based optimization (TLBO) algorithm was developed
    by Rao et al. (2011). When a teacher has a significant impact on student performance,
    it is referred to as TLBO. Results or grades are used to measure output here.
    In the field of water resources, the TLBO algorithm has only recently been applied
    in a few studies, including (Kumar and Yadav 2018) on reservoir operation, (Patel
    and Balve 2018) on multi-reservoir operation policy, (Patnaik and Swain 2021)
    on the comparison of PSO and TLBO for Hirakud reservoir operation, (Kumar and
    Yadav 2021) on water allocation, and (Ajudiya et al. 2022) on optimization of
    cropping pattern in the command area of multiple reservoir system. To summarize,
    TLBO is broadly applicable in the field of water resources as a global optimization
    technique, and these studies show that it is also a reliable technique for producing
    global optimal solutions. In this study, target storage generation was optimized
    to meet annual demands, prevent floods, and maximize power generation at the Omkareshwar
    Sagar Project (OSP) reservoir in India. The OSP reservoir operations are optimized
    for a monsoon flood wave situation using a conventional NLP approach and a semi-conventional
    genetic algorithm method to validate the accuracy of the TLBO results. The Omkareshwar
    Sagar Project (OSP) reservoir in India has been designed to satisfy annual demands,
    protect against flooding, and produce maximum power generation, which is used
    for analysis in the current study. Present study incorporates one conventional
    optimization method the nonlinear programming (NLP), a semi-conventional method
    the genetic algorithm (GA), and a meta-heuristic technique the teaching–learning-based
    optimization (TLBO) to solve the problem of optimum operation in a flood scenario.
    A flood-release protocol has to be developed keeping the objective of maximum
    power output and reach the specified storage target at the end of the operation.
    Present study has been a successful attempt in getting the desired results, and
    the adaptability of the TLBO for complex problem is also proven. 2 Theoretical
    Background 2.1 Genetic Algorithm Over other optimization techniques, GA provides
    a lot of advantages. Both parallelism and the ability to work through challenges
    of varying complexity are critical. A linear or nonlinear, continuous or random
    noise objective (fitness) function is just as valid as a non- stationary (changing
    over time) linear objective (fitness). All of these optimizations can be handled
    by genetic algorithms. Genetic algorithms, on the other hand, have some downsides.
    It is vital to take into account the size of the population, mutation and crossover
    rates, as well as other important aspects, when creating a new population in order
    to arrive at an accurate fitness function. Choosing the incorrect selection will
    hinder or eliminate the algorithm’s ability to converge. Genetic algorithms, despite
    these drawbacks, are nevertheless widely used in nonlinear optimization. (Yang
    2021) provides a comprehensive description of the algorithm. 2.2 Teaching–Learning-Based
    Optimization A novel population-based algorithm called TLBO (Rao et al. 2011)
    simulates classroom teaching and learning. The professor’s approach to getting
    their students to participate in class and work together more effectively is the
    basis for the algorithm. You don’t have to worry about making precise modifications
    with the TLBO. TLBO’s key regulating elements are the number of iterations and
    the size of the population. It is the major goal of teachers at TLBO to improve
    the average grade of classes. The two components of the algorithm are: the teacher
    and the learner. 2.2.1 Teacher Phase The teacher phase is the first step in the
    TLBO algorithm. Teachers place a high priority on raising the average grade in
    their classes. A new solution is created using the population’s mean value and
    the solution’s best fitness value (teacher). This is how each solution (x) variable
    gets changed: $$x_{{{\\text{new}}}} = x + r(x_{{{\\text{best}}}} - t_{f} x_{{{\\text{mean}}}}
    )$$ (1) There are five factors in this equation: the current solution/population
    value x, the newly generated solution/population value xnew, the teacher’s selection
    of the xbest solution/population based on the objective function’s minimum and
    maximum values, the population’s mean value xmean, the teaching factor Tf, which
    can be either 1 or 2, and a random number between zero and one for each variable.
    2.2.2 Learner Phase The learner phase requires students to interact with each
    other. With the help of partner solutions, new ideas might be generated. For the
    sake of finding the finest potential companion, the population will be culled.
    As an example, consider the fact that a partner''s answer cannot be the same as
    a solution that the learner examines. All variables can be changed based on current
    and partner fitness levels. $$x_{{{\\text{new}}}} = x + r(x - x_{{\\text{p}}}
    )\\quad {\\text{if}}\\;\\;f_{i} < f_{{\\text{p}}}$$ (2) $$x_{{{\\text{new}}}}
    = x - r(x - x_{{\\text{p}}} )\\quad {\\text{if}}\\;\\;f_{i} > f_{{\\text{p}}}$$
    (3) where the current solution/learner value is x, xnew is the new generated value,
    xp represents the partner solution/learner, fi is the current solution/fitness
    learner’s value, ft is the partner solution/fitness learner’s value. The value
    r will be randomly chosen between 0 and 1 for each variable. 3 Study Area India''s
    Omkareshwar Sagar Project reservoir in Madhya Pradesh is used to compare nonlinear
    programming, genetic algorithm, and teaching–learning-based optimization for reservoir
    operation under a flood scenario. The OSP is made up of eight 65-MW power plants
    and a gravity dam that stands 53 m tall and 949 m long. The reservoir’s total
    capacity of 987 Mcm is used to irrigate more than 146,800 hectares of crops. India’s
    Sardar Sarovar Project (SSP) and India’s Indira Sagar Project (ISP) are two of
    the country’s major reservoir projects. The intercepted flow between ISP and OSP
    joins with the water already released from ISP, which creates a vast reservoir.
    OSP’s operations have been complicated as a result of the mandatory release of
    water for SSP. As a result, OSP must be triggered in order to protect the reservoir’s
    downstream side from floodwaters, maximize power output, target storage for future
    use, and ensure that the reservoir’s downstream receives the appropriate release.

    The objective function is defined in light of the following purposes: By adding
    a continuity constraint to the objective function, the objective function is modified.
    The release from the hydropower is kept constant at 6.87 Mcm per hour to enhance
    power generation. $$\\begin{aligned} & {\\text{Min}}\\left[ {\\sum\\limits_{t
    = 1}^{T} {V_{1} (Q_{1} )^{2} + V_{2} \\left( {S_{{{\\text{t}} + 1}} - S_{{\\text{t}}}
    - I_{{\\text{t}}} + Q_{{\\text{t}}} + Q_{{{\\text{pt}}}} } \\right)^{2} } } \\right.
    \\\\ & \\quad + \\left. {\\sum\\limits_{t = 2}^{T + 2} {V_{3} (S_{{\\text{t}}}
    - T_{{\\text{s}}} )^{2} } } \\right] \\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ (4) where Qt = Outflow
    through Spillway, Qpt = Outflow through turbine taken as a constant value equal
    to 6.87 Mcm per hour, St = Storage at time t, St + 1 = Storage at time t + 1,
    Ts = Target storage in the reservoir, Qt max = Maximum outflow through the spillway,
    Qt min = Minimum Outflow through the spillway, Qpt max = Maximum Outflow through
    the turbine. The objective function is confined by variable value boundaries.
    $$Q_{{\\text{t}}} \\min \\le \\, Q_{{\\text{t}}} \\le \\, Q_{{\\text{t}}} \\max$$
    (5) $$Q_{{{\\text{pt}}}} \\min \\le Q_{{{\\text{pt}}}} \\le Q_{{{\\text{pt}}}}
    \\max$$ (6) $$S_{{\\text{t}}} \\min \\le S_{{\\text{t}}} \\le S_{{\\text{t}}}
    \\max$$ (7) V1 is the weight related to the spillage that must be minimized, V2
    is the weight connected to the continuity equation, and V3 is the weight involved
    with meeting the reservoir’s target storage at the conclusion of operation. The
    current challenge has 25 release values and 25 storage values. Due to the fact
    that weights are fixed, multiple objective problems can be treated as a single
    optimization problem. 5 Result and Discussion Optimizing reservoir operation with
    aims of maximizing power generation, achievement of storage targets, protecting
    the downstream side from flooding are the objectives of the present study applied
    to OSP reservoir during flood. Three techniques, one of them is NLP and other
    two are meta-heuristic techniques the GA and the TLBO, have been employed to solve
    the same problem for comparison. MATLAB platform was used for coding of the problem
    and solving it. The results of the problem are stated in following lines. All
    the three algorithms result in to maximization of the hydropower releases and
    have maintained it to a value of 6.87 Mcm throughout the flood season. The problem
    is basically a weighed sum of squares and squared. The following are the weights
    assigned in the objective function: As a result, V1 is set at 0.1 to reduce spillage,
    V2 is set at 100 to achieve maximum power, and V3 is arbitrarily varied between
    0.00001 and 100,000 for the inflow value of a flood wave to emphasize reaching
    target storage at the end. Using a heuristic method to allocate weights ensures
    that the study’s many goals are completed in the order they were given in the
    beginning. The objective function is optimized using genetic algorithms, nonlinear
    programming, and teaching–learning-based optimization with a population size of
    20 and 500 iterations. The convergence generated by GA and TLBO for a flood inflow
    scenario of monsoon duration to an optimal solution is shown in Fig. 2. It is
    clearly seen in the figure that TLBO initiates with lower fitness value, on the
    other hand GA initiates with very higher value. After 152 iterations, GA stucks
    in local minima. Details of fitness value at different iteration numbers can be
    seen in Table 1. By observing Table 1, results of fitness value generated by TLBO
    (3.607e + 5 in 398 iterations) are much better than GA and NLP on all stages of
    iteration. Table 1 is restricted to 400 iterations due to the achievement of convergence
    at 398 iterations of TLBO, while NLP and GA already converge at 319 and 152 iterations,
    respectively. Fig. 2 Convergence of TLBO to best fitness value for different flood
    inflow scenarios Full size image Table 1 Fitness value at different iteration
    numbers Full size table Two more distinct algorithms are used to determine the
    TLBO algorithm’s correctness in achieving the target storage of 299.00 Mcm. The
    TLBO results were compared to the GA and NLP outcomes. Figure 3 illustrates a
    comparison of gradually increasing storage plots computed from flood wave inflow
    values using GA, NLP, and TLBO. As illustrated in Fig. 3, all models take the
    same path to reach the destination storage with very slight changes. Fig. 3 Comparative
    gradually increasing storage plot from GA, NLP and TLBO Full size image The final
    storage values derived by GA, NLP, and TLBO for a flood inflow scenario are shown
    in Table 2. The model is compressed based on the near target storage value achieved
    by GA, NLP, and TLBO in terms of Mcm and percentage. From Table 2, it is apparent
    that the percentages of target storage reached by GA, NLP, and TLBO are 96.1706%,
    96.9264%, and 97.1237%, respectively, indicating that TLBO performs well in attaining
    near target storage. Table 2 Target storage (299.00 Mcm) achievement by GA, NLP,
    and TLBO Full size table GA, NLP, and TLBO developed a flood influx scenario inflow
    and outflow charts are shown in Fig. 4. Outflows formed by each algorithm are
    clearly shown in Fig. 4; however, TLBO’s path is smoother than those generated
    by GA and NLP. Outflow plot provided by TLBO is a smoother hydrograph, which reduces
    the peak flood level to safeguard downstream areas while also releasing a mandated
    amount of water to a downstream side water supply system. Fig. 4 Comparative inflow
    versus outflow plot generated from GA, NLP, and TLBO Full size image Flood peak
    reduction by GA, NLP, and TLBO can be seen in Table 3. In order to compare the
    algorithms, GA, NLP, and TLBO result in reducing the flood peak in terms of Mcm
    and percentage. From Table 3, it is clear that TLBO lowered the flood peak by
    18.4764%, which suggests that TLBO''s performance in reducing the flood peak to
    safeguard the downstream side together with the mandatory release is excellent.
    Table 3 Flood peak reduced by GA, NLP, and TLBO Full size table Results of TLBO
    model for a flood inflow scenario show that the TLBO is capable of maximizing
    hydropower output, attaining target storage levels, protecting the downstream
    sides of reservoirs from flooding, and releasing mandated amounts for the reservoir
    on the downstream side. TLBO findings were also tested against conventional NLP
    and semi-conventional GA results, and it was determined that TLBO can be utilized
    to optimize reservoir operation difficulties during flood situations. 6 Conclusion
    A nonlinear optimization model is solved with genetic algorithms, teaching–learning-based
    optimization, and nonlinear programming for the achievement of target storage
    for future use and maximize hydropower generation and provide flood protection
    on the downstream side of the reservoir. The model was applied to Omkareshwar
    Sagar Reservoir to simulate a monsoon flood inflow. For a population of 20, the
    best fitness outcomes can be achieved by running the TLBO algorithm for 500 iterations.
    GA achieves and converges at a fitness value of 7.987e + 5 in 151 iterations at
    the same iteration time. TLBO’s fitness value is 4.40e + 5, which is much lower
    than GA. TLBO finally converged at 3.607e + 5 in 398 iterations to obtain the
    global optimal solution, proving its robustness and speed. The highest increased
    power output has been achieved by maintaining hydropower release at a higher value.
    GA, NLP, and TLBO achieve 96.1706%, 96.9264%, and 97.1237% of the target storage
    value, respectively. In addition to helping to safeguard the downstream from flooding,
    GA, NLP, and TLBO’s reduction in flood peak is 18.1961, 18.1261, and 18.4764%,
    respectively, which offers mandatory release for the downstream side reservoir,
    and TLBO''s results show the highest reduction rate among all algorithms. According
    to comparative results of GA, NLP, and TLBO results for a of convergence plot,
    target storage achievement, and flood peak reduction flood inflow scenario, TLBO
    performed better than conventional and semi-conventional approaches. This research
    shows that teaching–learning-based algorithm approach is capable of optimizing
    large-scale, sophisticated water resource systems. References Ajudiya B, Yadav

    EN FR Rapid and accurate field evaluation of hydraulic performance is critical
    for the operation of a microirrigation system. However, the optimal sample size
    and the specific locations of the emitters selected in one subunit for field tests
    have not been determined. A model (Hydraulic Analysis of Pressurized Irrigation
    System,HAPIS) was constructed for hydraulic analysis of a pressurized irrigation
    system by coupling MATLAB and EPANET. The random sampling method (RSM) and uniform
    sampling method (USM) were optimized for emitters selected through simulation,
    aiming to achieve higher estimation accuracies of the mean emitter discharge rate
    of the subunit ( q ¯ ) and the Christiansen uniformity coefficient (CU) while
    minimizing the number of emitters tested. In addition, a linear sampling method
    at predetermined emitter locations (LSMPE) was developed to simplify the evaluation
    process using a genetic algorithm (GA). The results indicate that the appropriate
    sample size range for RSM was 20–40, in which the maximum percentage difference
    between q ¯ and CU was maintained at ±10%. For the USM, a sample size of approximately
    18 can provide relatively accurate estimations of q ¯ and CU, while it is recommended
    that the sampled emitters be distributed over three to five laterals. The optimal
    sample size of LSMPE could be decreased to approximately 10, and the selected
    emitters were arranged along the sampling line. The absolute relative estimation
    error of q ¯ and CU could be maintained at <1%. 1 INTRODUCTION In arid and semi-arid
    regions, microirrigation has been widely used because it achieves crop intensification
    while enabling highly efficient water and fertilizer application (Bai & Gao, 2021;
    Daccache et al., 2010; Luquet et al., 2005). The main purpose of designing a microirrigation
    system is to obtain high uniformity while avoiding excessive and insufficient
    irrigation for the entire system. While the performance of a microirrigation system
    designed by engineers is a reference value for the installation of the network,
    the actual irrigation performance may be drastically different (Benouniche et
    al., 2014; Wang et al., 2022). Field evaluations of system performance are necessary
    for the efficient use of water and fertilizers in an installed drip irrigation
    system. Several parameters have been proposed as performance assessment indicators,
    such as the Christiansen uniformity coefficient (CU, %), emission uniformity (EU,
    %) and distribution uniformity (DU, %) (ASAE, 2019; Burt et al., 1997; Christiansen,
    1942). To calculate these indicators, the discharge rates of a certain number
    of emitters in a subunit must be determined through a field test. Researchers
    have deduced formulas to find a more precise method of performing an assessment
    based on analytic methods and statistics (Burt, 2004; Styles et al., 2008). Several
    simplified procedures, such as design curves and nomographs, have also been developed
    to improve the efficiency of performance assessments (Bralts et al., 1981; Bralts
    & Kesner, 1983). Although many studies have optimized assessment indicators and
    computational methods, few studies have focused on field sampling standards (sampling
    sizes and emitter locations). Wu and Irudayaraj (1989) developed a random sampling
    method (RSM) model to randomly select emitter discharge samples for field evaluation
    purposes. Their results showed that, if the sample size was 18, the difference
    in the uniformity coefficient of the subunit would be ±36%, while this result
    has not been widely used in actual performance tests. Currently, there are two
    typical sampling methods for selecting test emitters in the field: (1) the RSM
    and (2) the uniform sampling method (USM) (Ju et al., 2016; Juana et al., 2007).
    The field sampling design usually depended on the experience of the testers; thus,
    the sample sizes in different studies were different. Li et al. (2010) evaluated
    the performance of drip irrigation subunits by measuring the discharge of 20 emitters,
    while the sample size in the research of Wang et al. (2022) was 75. Regardless
    of the method used, the number and location of sampling emitters directly affect
    the test results (Solé-Torres et al., 2021; Wu & Irudayaraj, 1989). To achieve
    a higher estimation accuracy of microirrigation uniformity, testers tend to increase
    the sample size as much as possible, which leads to time-consuming and laborious
    field testing. However, the influence of sample size and location on the accuracy
    of hydraulic performance assessments is still unclear, and appropriate sampling
    standards are important for performance testing. Due to the size of the irrigation
    equipment, the measuring conditions in the field and the variety of hydraulic
    performances in microirrigation systems, few studies potentially meet these needs.
    Hydraulic models can assist in quantifying and evaluating the hydraulic performance
    of irrigation networks and equipment and have been widely used in hydraulic analyses
    of microirrigation systems. For example, the PRESUD model was developed to assist
    in decision-making for the optimization of designing microirrigation subunits
    (Carrión et al., 2013, 2014; Moreno et al., 2016). Several decision support systems
    (DSS) using EPANET as a hydraulic simulator have also been developed to optimize
    water and fertilizer use and manage centralized fertigation systems in pressurized
    irrigation systems (Fernandez Garcia et al., 2016; González Perea et al., 2014,
    2020). The genetic algorithm (GA), a search and optimization method based on the
    principles of genetics and natural selection, has also been used to solve the
    optimization problem in irrigation system design (González Perea et al., 2016;
    Haupt & Haupt, 1998; Ma et al., 2019). Aral et al. (2008) developed a multiobjective
    optimization method to design and optimize sensors in water supply systems. The
    model determines the appropriate sensor layout mode through the non-dominated
    sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Dursun and Özden (2017) optimized the
    number and position of water sensors in a drip irrigation field by the GA algorithm,
    in which the soil water content of the whole field can be well predicted by arranging
    five sensors in key positions. These methodologies offer opportunities for optimizing
    the sample size and location of microirrigation performance assessments in subunits.
    In this context, a hydraulic model (HAPIS) combined with a GA was developed at
    the microirrigation subunit level. The main objectives of this study were (i)
    to evaluate the influence of the sample size and position of emitters on the accuracy
    of field evaluation of system performance and (ii) to find another easier sampling
    method in addition to the RSM and USM to improve the efficiency and accuracy of
    field evaluation of system performance. 2 METHODOLOGY 2.1 Description of subunit
    A rectangular microirrigation subunit, which is the most common shape in irrigation
    systems, was selected. The irrigation system of the typical subunit consisted
    of one hydrant near a corner, one manifold running along a boundary and a number
    of laterals perpendicular to the manifold (Figure 1). The laterals were uniformly
    spaced along the manifold, and the emitters were uniformly spaced along the lateral.
    The manifold length (Lm) and lateral length (Ll) are equal to the lengths of the
    short (b) and long (a) sides of the subunit, respectively. FIGURE 1 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Description of microirrigation subunit and three sampling methods:
    (a) random sampling method (RSM), (b) uniform sampling method (USM) and (c) linear
    sampling method at predetermined emitter locations (LSMPE). The mean emitter discharge
    rate ( ) and CU were recommended as the performance evaluation parameters in this
    work. The two indicators are defined as follows: (1) (2) where is the mean emitter
    discharge rate of the subunit (L h−1), CU is the Christiansen uniformity coefficient
    of the subunit, N is the number of sampling emitters in the subunit, and qi is
    the discharge rate of sampling emitters in the subunit (L h−1). 2.2 Description
    and evaluation of sampling methods Placing a sufficient number of sampling emitters
    in the appropriate locations in the subunits was the basic task of hydraulic performance
    evaluation. Three sampling methods, (1) the RSM, (2) the USM and (3) the linear
    sampling method at predetermined emitter locations (LSMPE), were compared in this
    study. For a given sample size N, the selected emitters of RSM were distributed
    within the whole subunit, in which the emitter location was randomly determined
    by the tester (Figure 1a). For uniform sampling, laterals were evenly selected
    along the manifold and the sampling emitter was determined uniformly along each
    lateral selected (Figure 1b). In fact, according to the designed number of selected
    laterals (Nl) and the number of selected emitters along the laterals (Ne), the
    sample size could be determined (N = Nl × Ne), and the emitter location could
    be determined by the arrangement pattern of uniform sampling. In LSMPE, all the
    sampling emitters were arranged in a straight line for a given sample size N,
    and the tester could complete the whole field test by sampling along the straight
    line (Figure 1c). Xn represents the distance between two selected emitters, and
    this value varies with the position of the sampling emitter. Obviously, the proposed
    method was intended to reduce the distance of tester movement and avoid the difficulty
    of accessing fields. 2.3 Optimization of sampling methods The optimum sampling
    methods for a microirrigation subunit are based on finding the best sample size
    and location that ensure optimal estimation accuracy of performance from economic
    and efficiency perspectives. The objectives of optimization are different for
    the three sampling methods. For the RSM, the sample size N is the only optimization
    parameter due to the randomness of the emitter location. For the USM, finding
    the optimum combination of Nl and Ne, which determines the sample size and location,
    is an important objective of this research. For LSMPE, not only should the appropriate
    sample size N be determined but also the locations of the sampling emitters along
    the sample line should be further optimized. Considering the different optimization
    objectives, an optimization model (HAPIS), which was developed and implemented
    in MATLAB using EPANET (Rossman, 2000) as a hydraulic simulator, was used to perform
    hydraulic analysis and optimize the sampling method in the subunit. The different
    phases of optimization are as follows: (1) a hydraulic simulation module that
    determines the hydraulic behaviour of the emitter and provides the discharge rate
    of each emitter in the irrigation subunit and (2) a sampling simulation module
    that performs a simulation of each sampling method and calculates the evaluation
    parameters. 2.3.1 Hydraulic simulation procedures The hydraulic simulation determines
    the hydraulic behaviour of the irrigation emitter, which is essential for the
    whole work. Thus, the emitter flow–pressure head equation, the manufacturer coefficient
    of variation of the emitters (CVm) and the head losses in connections must be
    defined. MATLAB is used to process the parameter information of the microirrigation
    subunit, generate a pipe network information file (.inp) and then input it into
    EPANET for hydraulic analysis. The shape and dimensions of the subunit, including
    the diameter of the irrigation pipes and the hydrant location, are also defined
    in this section. EPANET software has been widely used as a hydraulic and water
    quality simulator due to its efficiency and robustness (Jimenez-Bello et al.,
    2011; Khatavkar & Mays, 2018). The EPANET solves the flow continuity and head
    loss equations that characterize the hydraulic states of the irrigation subunit
    using a hybrid node-loop approach. According to this approach, the hydraulic state
    of the irrigation subunit at any given time is determined by solving a series
    of nonlinear equations consisting of continuity equations at all nodes and energy
    conservation equations around each elementary loop. Thus, by solving this set
    of equations, the pressure head and discharge at any node and the discharge rate
    and pressure head losses in the pipes of the irrigation subunit can be derived.
    In addition, the ‘Emitter’ component of the EPANET model is based on the exponential
    relationship between node flow and pressure, which is consistent with the characteristics
    of the flow–pressure relationship of emitters. The Hazen–Williams formula (Equation
    3) is used to calculate the friction loss (hf, m): (3) where Lp is the pipe length
    (m), D is the internal pipe diameter (m), Q is the pipe discharge (m3 s−1), and
    C is the roughness coefficient. The emitter flow rate–pressure head equation can
    be represented by (4) where q is the emitter discharge rate (L h−1), P is the
    inlet pressure head of the emitter (m), K is the emission coefficient, and x is
    the emission exponent. Considering the emitter discharge variability caused by
    manufacturing variability within the subunit, the emitter discharge rate and pressure
    head relation may be represented by Equation (5) (Chamba et al., 2019): (5) where
    u is the normalized random variable and CVm is the manufacturer''s coefficient
    of variation. After performing the hydraulic simulation, the discharge rate applied
    by each emitter of the subunit during the irrigation event was used to calculate
    the indicators and CU0. These values were used as reference values for the sampling
    simulation. In this work, the values of and CUt obtained from sampling simulation
    were compared with the values of and CU0 calculated by the discharge rate of all
    emitters in the subunit to assess the impact of sampling methods on hydraulic
    performance evaluation. 2.3.2 Parameter determination for sampling methods The
    sampling module computes the performance parameters of a given sampling method
    based on the discharge rate of the sampling emitter in the subunit. Once the ‘Hydraulic
    module’ is completed, the discharge rate of each emitter in the microirrigation
    subunit is generated as a file (.txt) that will be used for sampling simulation.
    To determine the discharge rates of the sampling emitters, several sampling method
    parameters need to be defined. The simulation process of three different sampling
    methods by this module is described below. Part 1. Simulation process of RSM In
    this part, the sample size N of random sampling must be defined first. Once the
    number of sampling emitters has been obtained, the location of each selected emitter,
    the distance from the hydrant along the manifold direction (yi) and the distance
    from the hydrant along the lateral direction (xi) must be determined. For an assigned
    sample size N, the selected emitter location was determined by a developed MATLAB
    program that randomly generated the information of the emitter location (xi, yi).
    The module automatically identified the generated location information and extracted
    the discharge data of the sampling emitter. Each simulation was repeated 1000
    times. Part 2. Simulation process of USM The aim of this part was to determine
    the discharge rate of the sampling emitter according to the design of Nl and Ne.
    The location of the emitter included the distance of the selected lateral (yj),
    where the emitter was located, along the manifold direction and the relative location
    of the emitter on the selected lateral (xj). In the USM, the location of the selected
    laterals yj depended on the value of Nl; thus, the module calculated the spacing
    between two selected laterals (Stl) and then determined the yj of each selected
    lateral: (6) (7) where Stl is the distance between two selected laterals (m) along
    the manifold direction; Lm is the length of the manifold (m); yj is the location
    of the selected lateral in the manifold direction (m); and j is the node of the
    selected laterals, from 1 to Nl. Similarly, according to the value of Ne, the
    distance between two sampling emitters (Ste) can be calculated, and the xj of
    each emitter can be determined: (8) (9) where Ste is the distance between two
    sampling emitters along a lateral (m); Ll is the length of the lateral (m); xj
    is the emitter location in the lateral direction (m); and k is the node of the
    emitter on a lateral, from 1 to Ne. Eventually, the module automatically extracted
    the emitter discharge data through the calculated location information, and the
    and CUt of each combination of Nl and Ne could be obtained. Part 3. Simulation
    process of LSMPE using a GA An optimized LSMPE in which the sampling emitters
    were selected along a straight line was developed. In this part, the sample size
    N and the location of the sampling line must be defined first. Obviously, the
    position of the selected emitter affects the result of LSMPE. Thus, for a given
    N, the placement of selected emitters on the sampling line was an important issue
    for achieving the goal of LSMPE. The problem was defined as an optimization problem
    to find the layout of the sampling emitter with minimum error. The GA, which attempts
    to find a solution using random search techniques, is a search technique based
    on parameter coding. In other words, the GA is a search and optimization method
    based on the principles of genetics and natural selection. The basic principle
    of the GA is to ensure that the best generation lives and the worst generation
    dies. The GA was intended to find the best parameters for the system by modelling
    evolutionary events (selection, crossover, mutation) that occur in nature. In
    this section, the locations of the sampling emitters along the sampling line were
    determined by GA software developed in a MATLAB environment; the purpose was to
    find the best emitter location to minimize the calculation error of the performance
    parameters. The steps used in the developed GA are given below. Step 1: Generation
    of the initial population. Every individual is uniquely identified by a code called
    a chromosome, which is mapped to a certain value of the objective function (the
    function to optimize) representing the fitness of the individual. The sample size
    and location of each selected emitter were recorded for each individual: (10)
    Here, the indexes i and j represent the sample size of the testing emitters and
    the population size, respectively. Each Cij term (a gene) consists of the emitter
    locations, and each row in Equation (10) is one of the possible solutions for
    the placement problem. This matrix is the population solution of the problem.
    The population number (n) and number of generations are defined as 100 and 200,
    respectively. The initial population is generated randomly. The limits of the
    individuals are set to the emitter on the sampling line. Step 2: Calculate the
    objective function value of individuals in the population and evaluate the fitness
    function. According to the emitter position data carried by each gene, the emitter
    discharge rate was selected from the output data of the hydraulic model. All the
    emitter discharge data of an individual were used to calculate the performance
    parameters. The individuals were evaluated in terms of their performances, which
    are based on their fitness values. The fitness function of the developed system
    is given in Equation (11): (11) where Fitness is the fitness function; δ1 and
    δ2 represent the absolute relative errors ( ) of the estimated and CUt, respectively;
    and c and d represent scale factors for δ1 and δ2, respectively. In this work,
    c and d are 1. Step 3: Select the dominant individuals to pass on to the next
    generation. The tournament selection method is used. In this step, the worst individuals
    are deleted from the population. Step 4: Crossover and mutation. Discrete crossover
    is used as the crossover method. After selection, two individuals are randomly
    selected from the remainder of the population, and their genetic information is
    mixed, thereby generating new individuals. A mutation is generated by randomly
    changing the binary code of a gene slightly. The mutation operator randomly changes
    certain subparts of a chromosome. The crossover probability and mutation probability
    are 0.65 and 0.05, respectively. Step 5: This cycle runs for the number of generations
    defined. Thus, the best point locations were searched for and defined by the GA.

    dotted lines represent the input data and the solid lines represent the simulations
    and results generated by the model. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint

    2.4 Case study A typical irrigation subunit in southern Xinjiang, China, was selected
    as a case study. The soil within 0-60cm depth of farmland was classified as sandy
    loam with 56% sand, 43% silt, and 1% clay, and the soil bulk density was 1.52 g cm−3.
    Cotton is a predominantly agricultural planting crop. The net irrigation requirement
    was considered to be approximately 4 × 103 m3 ha−1 year−1 for cotton in the study
    area. The cotton in the field was planted at a row distance of 0.25 m with a planting
    density of 257,640 plants per hectare. The subunit was designed as a rectangle,
    measuring 0.48 ha, with a and b being 80 and 60 m, respectively. The slopes of
    the farm along the manifold (S1) and lateral (S2) directions were set to 1/500
    and 1/1000, respectively. The spacing between two adjacent laterals was 1 m, using
    an emitter in which qn was 2 L h−1, operating at an average pressure of 10 m,
    with 0.3-m spacing between emitters (Se) and CVm 3%. The manifold and lateral
    layers are made of polyvinylchloride (PVC) and polyethylene (PE), respectively.

    Considering the possible influence of the design parameters, the effects of the
    nominal emitter discharge (qn), emitter exponent (x) and manifold diameter (Dm)
    on the performance assessment were evaluated under the irrigation network. For
    qn, by varying K (Equation (5)), three possible discharge rates (0.5, 1 and 3 L h−1)
    were tested. For x, by varying K, three possible values (0.1, 0.3 and 0.6) were
    analogously tested. In addition, three kinds of Dm (44.0, 55.4 and 79.2 mm) were
    also used. Table 2 shows the 10 scenarios of the microirrigation network. The
    abbreviations D, F and M represent the network scenarios of qn, x and Dm, respectively,
    where CK represents the typical design of the subunit (qn = 2 L h−1, x = 0.5,
    Dm = 66 mm). The scenario design is also beneficial for studying the universality
    of sampling methods under different hydraulic uniformities of subunits. TABLE

    selected for 10 levels in the RSM (10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100).
    The USM method was simulated with 100 combinations built through 10 levels of
    Nl (2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20 and 30) and 10 levels of Ne (2, 4, 6, 8, 10,
    15, 20, 30, 40 and 50). In the LSMPE, five sample sizes (6, 8, 10, 12 and 14)
    were analysed. The sampling line was designed as the diagonal of the subunit starting
    from the water hydrant (Figure 1c). 3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 3.1 Effect of design
    parameters on hydraulic uniformity of subunit An actual irrigation subunit and
    another nine scenario designs of the microirrigation network were assessed to
    determine the appropriate sample size and location. Figure 3 shows the spatial
    distribution of the emitter pressure and discharge rate applied in the subunit
    of CK. The emitter pressure ranged from 5.16 to 9.81 m, with a maximum difference
    (regarding the average pressure) of 57.5%. The simulation results conform to the
    actual pressure distribution pattern of a microirrigation system: The pressure
    is greater when the emitter is closer to the hydrant (Figure 3a). The emitter
    discharge rate ranged from 1.35 to 2.00 L h−1, with a maximum difference of 28%.
    Compared to that of the emitter pressure, the spatial distribution of the emitter
    discharge rate was more complicated. This phenomenon was attributed to the influence
    of CVm. After performing the hydraulic simulation, and CU0 were calculated by
    the discharge rate of all the emitters in the subunit (Table 3). For the four
    scenarios of qn, significantly increased from D1 (0.5 L h−1) to D3 (3L h−1), while
    CU0 decreased. A larger qn was accompanied by greater hydraulic loss, which reduced
    the hydraulic uniformity in the subunits. and CU0 decreased when x increased,
    and the decreases in and CU0 were 17% and 4%, respectively. The exponent index
    represents the sensitivity of the discharge rate to variations in pressure (Yao
    & He, 1999). The lower x is, the lower the sensitivity of the emitter discharge
    to pressure changes, which will result in better hydraulic uniformity in the subunit.
    In contrast, and CU0 increased when Dm increased, and the increase rates of and
    CU0 were 65% and 28%, respectively. The pipe diameter was related to the frictional
    head loss in the manifold (Wu et al., 2010). Choosing a large Dm reduced the loss
    of pressure in the manifold, which led to uniform pressure along the manifold
    (minimal pressure variations at the lateral inlets) and improved the uniformity
    of the subunit. Overall, the HAPIS provides good simulation of the hydraulic performance
    of microirrigation subunits under different operating conditions and provides
    an effective tool for the optimization of sample size and location for hydraulic
    performance evaluation. FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Spatial distributions

    the distributions of the simulated and CUt in CK. The results of the simulated
    and CUt show a normal distribution in 1000 repetitions. The average simulated
    was equal to the reference value, and the average simulated CUt was slightly greater
    than the reference value. In this study, sample sizes of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60,
    70, 80, 90 and 100 were evaluated for randomly selected emitters. The results
    indicated a definite trend: the larger N was, the better the estimate was. For
    and CUt, the first quartile (Q25), third quartile (Q75) and interquartile ranges
    (between Q25 and Q75) significantly decreased when the sample size increased (Figure
    4). Similar trends were obtained for the other scenarios. When the distribution
    of a parameter for any given N can be considered a normal distribution, the standard
    deviation of the target parameters can be used to show the confidence or the probability
    that the calculated values will lie within a certain range. The normal numbers
    in Figure 4 represent the maximum percentage of differences in and CUt compared
    with and CU0 (95% confidence limits), respectively. When N was only 10, the results
    showed maximum differences of +4.4%/−4.4% and +3.4%/−2.6% for and CUt, respectively.
    The difference is reduced to +2.2%/−2.2% and +1.6%/−1.4% for and CUt, respectively,
    when N is increased to 40. This result is similar to that found by Wu and Irudayaraj
    (1989) based on the dimensionless energy gradient curve. The estimation accuracy
    varies with the number of selected emitters, and a higher N will result in better
    accuracy. If a difference of 1% is expected, N should exceed 100. Considering
    the working strength caused by the field test of the emitter discharge rate, the
    sample size of the performance evaluation in the microirrigation subunit should
    be controlled within a certain range. A sample size of 40 was recommended as the
    appropriate upper limit, which controls the maximum percentage of difference within
    ±4%. FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Descriptive statistics of mean

    In the box diagram, lower and upper hinges correspond to Q25 and Q75, respectively,
    and upper and lower whiskers extend to largest and smallest values, respectively,
    no further than 1.5 times the interquartile range (Q25–Q75) from upper and lower
    hinges. Dashed lines and solid lines represent mean and median relative errors,
    respectively. Italicized numbers indicate and CUt for different sample sizes,
    and normal numbers represent maximum percentage of difference caused by sample
    sizes (95% confidence limits). Values of mean emitter discharge rate calculated
    by discharge rate of all emitters in subunit ( and Christiansen''s uniformity
    coefficient calculated by flow rate of all emitters in subunit (CU0) were 1.57 L h−1
    and 94.11%, respectively. For each scenario of qn, x and Dm, the maximum percentage
    of difference (95% confidence limit) in and CUt compared with and CU0 was computed
    (Table 4). The difference percentages of and CUt significantly increased with
    increasing qn or x. For example, as qn increased from 0.5 L h−1 (D1) to 3 L h−1
    (D3), the maximum percentage of at 20 emitters increased from +0.9%/−0.9% to +5.7%/−5.7%,
    and the difference percentage of CUt increased from +0.6%/−0.5% to +4.3%/−3.4%.
    Obviously, the hydraulic behaviour of irrigation emitters affects the performance
    of tests. Emitters with a small x (such as pressure-compensating emitters) or
    qn could maximize the hydraulic uniformity in subunits, which leads to good estimates
    of and CUt. However, the differences in and CUt significantly decreased with increasing
    manifold diameter. Furthermore, an extremely greater difference (≥10%) was found
    when the sample size was less than 20, which indicated that the sample size needed
    to set a lower limit to adapt to the different uniformities of the microirrigation
    subunits. Therefore, the appropriate sample size for the subunits was 20–40. TABLE

    rate calculated by sampling simulation. 3.3 Estimation accuracy of USM A comparison
    of the estimation accuracy of the USM in the four irrigation networks with different
    qn values is shown in Figure 5, which illustrates the absolute relative errors
    of and CU0. The absolute relative errors of the estimated ranged from 0.0% to
    1.8%, from 0.0% to1.7%, from 0.0% to 1.3% and from 0.0% to1.5% for D1, D2, CK
    and D3, respectively, and the absolute relative errors of the estimated CUt ranged
    from 0.0% to 1.3%, from 0.0% to 1.2%, from 0.0% to 1.6% and from 0.0% to 2.5%
    for D1, D2, CK and D3, respectively. In general, the absolute relative errors
    of and CUt increase when qn increases, except for the extreme values (Nl ≤ 3,
    Ne = 2). The emitter has a large qn compared with a high hydraulic loss, which
    reduces the estimation accuracy of the USM. Notably, USM with Nl = 2 achieved
    an absolute relative error of and CUt was greater than 1%. This means that the
    subunits with emitters that have higher qn should avoid choosing an excessively
    small Nl. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Distribution of absolute relative
    errors of uniform sampling method (USM) in four irrigation networks whose qn values
    were 0.5 L h−1 (D1), 1 L h−1 (D2), 2 L h−1 (CK) and 3 L h−1 (D3). Figure 6 shows
    the estimation accuracy of the USM in the four irrigation networks with different
    x values. The absolute relative errors of the estimated ranged from 0.0% to 1.7%,
    from 0.0% to 1.5%, from 0.0% to 1.3% and from 0.0% to 1.2% for F1, F2, CK and
    F3, respectively, and the absolute relative errors of the estimated CUt ranged
    from 0.0% to 1.1%, from 0.0% to 1.3%, from 0.0% to 1.6% and from 0.0% to 1.8%
    for F1, F2, CK and F3, respectively. Although the absolute relative error of in
    the extreme area (Nl ≤ 3, Ne ≤ 4) is larger when x is smaller, the estimation
    accuracy of and CUt decreases with increasing x globally. The increase in the
    absolute relative error caused by the sampling design is less than 1% regardless
    of the irrigation network, which indicates that the emission exponent has a slight
    influence on the estimated accuracy of the USM. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Distribution of absolute relative errors of uniform sampling method
    (USM) in four irrigation networks whose x values were 0.1 (F1), 0.3 (F2), 0.5
    (CK) and 0.6 (F3). Figure 7 shows the estimation accuracy of the USM in the four
    irrigation networks with different Dm values. The absolute relative error of the
    estimated ranged from 0.0% to 2.9%, from 0.0% to 1.6%, from 0.0% to 1.3% and from
    0.0% to 1.4% for M1, M2, CK and M3, respectively, and the absolute relative error
    of the estimated CUt ranged from 0.0% to 3.2%, from 0.0% to 2.3%, from 0.0% to
    1.6% and from 0.0% to 1.6% for M1, M2, CK and M3, respectively. Differences in
    absolute relative error show that the USM was suitable for subunits with large
    Dm values for fixed Nl and Ne. The reason is that a larger diameter is accompanied
    by better hydraulic uniformity, and the estimated error of the USM is relatively
    reduced. With decreasing pipe diameter, the absolute relative errors of and CUt
    increase, especially when Nl is less than 4. For M1 (44 mm)，the result shows that
    a higher estimation error occurs in the combination of uniform sampling with Nl < 4,
    indicating that choosing a larger Nl was beneficial for estimating the performance
    of the subunit with a small value of manifold diameters. FIGURE 7 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Distribution of absolute relative errors of uniform sampling
    method (USM) in four irrigation networks with Dm values of 44.0 mm (M1), 55.4 mm
    (M2), 66.0 mm (CK) and 79.2 mm (M3). The hydraulic uniformity of the subunit varies
    with the emitter type and pipe size. Previous studies have shown similar results
    and explained the fluctuation in hydraulic uniformity (Aminpour et al., 2022;
    Gajghate & Mirajkar, 2020). Obviously, the USM achieved a superior estimation
    accuracy compared with the RSM for a given sample size. Therefore, the USM, which
    evenly extracts tested laterals along the manifold and evenly selects sampling
    emitters along the laterals, is favoured by researchers in the performance assessment
    of subunits (Puig-Bargués et al., 2005; Tang et al., 2018). In addition, the results
    obtained with emitters evenly selected among the subunits were relatively more
    stable. According to the simulation results, the estimation accuracy of the USM
    fluctuated according to the performance of the subunit for a fixed Nl and Ne.
    It is necessary to test additional emitters when the hydraulic uniformity of the
    subunit decreases. To obtain the best estimation accuracy, the arrangement of
    the USM must be adjusted at any time according to the object. From a practical
    standpoint, it is not important to precisely determine the performance of the
    microirrigation subunit, as a reasonable estimate is sufficient. In this work,
    it was found that rather than Ne, choosing an appropriate Nl was more important
    in USM. The reason may be that the minimized difference in emitter discharge in
    the lateral direction was due to the short lateral length of the research subunits
    (80 m). Notably, an unreasonable combination of Nl and Ne may increase the actual
    working intensity. For example, when Nl and Ne were both 4, the measuring emitter
    was evenly distributed, which led to a long distance between the two selected
    emitters. A sample size of 18 (Nl = 3, Ne = 6) was recommended as the appropriate
    sample size for meeting the accuracy and economic objectives of the study. 3.4
    Estimation accuracy of LSMPE according to GA emitter location The diagonal of
    the subunit was selected as the optimal range of LSMPE, and 60 emitters near the
    line were extracted for optimization using GA. The random initial population consisted
    of 40 chromosomes that evolved for 100 generations with probabilities of crossover
    and mutation of 65% and 5%, respectively. Figure 8 shows the emitter locations
    of CK obtained by the GA. For N values of 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14, the discharge rates
    of the selected sampled emitters ranged from 1.42 to 1.74, from 1.42 to 1.80,
    from 1.42 to 1.78, from 1.42 to 1.84 and from 1.39 to 1.81 L h−1, respectively.
    The distribution of the applied emitter discharge was related to the location
    on the sampling line. Generally, LSMPE achieved superior estimation accuracy,
    and the absolute relative errors and CUt were both less than 1%. The table in
    each figure shows the distance between adjacent sampling emitters, which represents
    the distance that testers needed to complete the field test (Figure 8). The minimum
    total distance was 73 m (Figure 8e). It is worth noting that the results in this
    paper represent only a reasonable sampling arrangement, and there was no obvious
    correlation between N and the total distance between sampling emitters. Overall,
    by determining the sampling line, sampling direction and sampling emitter spacing,
    LSMPE has the potential to reduce the time and labour inputs. FIGURE 8 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Emitter locations in diagonal direction of subunit in
    CK: (a) 6 emitters, (b) 8 emitters, (c) 10 emitters, (d) 12 emitters and (e) 14
    emitters. The solid circle, which is between blue and purple, represents sampling
    emitter. The table in the figure shows spacing between two adjacent sampling emitters.
    Along sampling direction, sampling emitters are numbered (from 1 to N) from first
    upstream emitter, and node 0 represents hydrant. To further evaluate the practicability
    of LSMPE, the estimation accuracy of LSMPE in different scenarios was calculated
    (Table 5). By extracting the discharge of the sampling emitter whose location
    was determined using GA, the absolute relative error and CUt could be maintained
    at <1%. In the above sections, the issues of appropriate sample standards in the
    RSM (3.2) and USM (3.3) have been discussed. However, the number of test samples
    was still relatively large in general (>18). In addition, these results are not
    conducive to field hydraulic performance evaluation due to the difficulty in determining
    emitter positioning in the field, which requires considerable time and manpower.
    Compared with two traditional methods, LSMPE concentrates the sampling emitters
    on a straight line, which greatly improves the sampling efficiency. Remarkably,
    despite all the sample sizes analysed in this paper achieving satisfactory accuracy,
    the recommended minimum N of LSMPE was 10, considering the uncertainty caused
    by manufacturing deviation and emitter blockage. The diagonal line of the subunit
    analysed in this paper is recommended as the sampling line in the field test because
    the discharge of the emitter on the line is more representative. TABLE 5. Estimated

    4 CONCLUSIONS The optimization of the sample size and location in the hydraulic
    performance assessment of the microirrigation subunits was studied. The HAPIS
    model was developed as a tool to assist in the optimization of three sampling
    methods (RSM, USM and LSMPE). The results showed that the solution with a greater
    N tended to achieve better estimation accuracy in the RSM. However, the estimation
    accuracy varies with changes in the design parameters of the irrigation network,
    especially the manifold diameter. An acceptable range of N is 20–40, considering
    the possibly unreasonable design, to ensure that the maximum percentage of difference
    of and CUt could be maintained at ±10%. The USM achieved a superior estimation
    accuracy compared with RSM under the same sample size N. The relative absolute
    error can be kept within 3.5% for different irrigation network scenarios. Choosing
    an appropriate Nl is more important for improving the estimation accuracy of the
    USM, while the value of Ne can be appropriately reduced. From a practical standpoint,
    it is recommended that the sampled emitters be distributed over three to five
    laterals due to the high sensitivity of the estimation accuracy to Nl. The LSMPE
    was defined to improve the field sampling efficiency, in which the emitters were
    selected along the sample line. For every scenario in the study, the absolute
    relative error of estimation and CUt could be maintained at <1% by using the LSMPE
    when the emitter location was determined by the GA. A reduction in the distance
    between sampling points is also beneficial for reducing the time and labour inputs.
    A minimum sampling of 10 emitters along the diagonal lines of subunits was recommended.
    The results obtained from this work are suitable for normal microirrigation subunits.
    However, for a long-term microirrigation system, emitter clogging seriously reduces
    the hydraulic performance of the subunit, which directly affects the estimation
    accuracy of the sampling methods. In future work, this issue will be addressed
    through accurate simulation of emitter clogging, and appropriate sampling standards
    for long-term microirrigation subunits will be established. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS This

    In determining the irrigation depth of barley, it is inevitable to find the best
    periods to increase the efficiency of water consumption and also to achieve the

    of multi-objective self-reproducing automata has been used to develop agricultural
    water supply model. Estimated solutions were validated by fuzzy bounding by domination
    concept. The results showed that the use of supplementary irrigation in dry areas
    was a sustainable solution in food security. crowding distance, determination
    of irrigation depth, non-domination INTRODUCTION Listen From the 700 million hectares
    of grain-cultivated land in the world, 2.2 billion tons of crops are harvested,
    of which corn, rice, and wheat have the largest share with an annual production
    of 790, 660, and 600 million tons, respectively (Steduto et al. 2012). By developing
    a mathematical model to determine the depth of irrigation and by considering the
    effective factors in productivity, such as the amount of available water and effective
    rainfall, it is possible to present and evaluate the solutions for planning and
    managing water in the agricultural sector. Since the optimization of the cultivation
    pattern is affected by the amount of water consumed by the plant, the allocation
    of consumed water during the growth period should be managed in such a way that
    maximum water efficiency is obtained. By optimizing the allocation, it is possible
    to manage the allocation of water in the network and, as a result, each product
    during a specific period. Shortage irrigation management is one of the ways to
    improve the efficiency of water consumption, in which the amount of water needed
    for irrigation is reduced compared to full irrigation levels, and a mild moisture
    stress that has a proportional reduction is applied to crop production. In the
    conditions of drought and water scarcity, the technique of low irrigation can
    increase the economic profit of the crop by producing the maximum crop per unit
    of irrigation water (English 1990). Decreasing the amount of water received by
    the plant causes a decrease in the yield of the crop, therefore, before applying
    reduced irrigation, the reaction of the plant to moisture stress in each stage
    of growth should be evaluated. Production function is an empirical approach that
    describes the relationships between water and crop performance. In the economic
    analysis of agricultural patterns and optimizing the allocation of water resources,
    the use of production functions has found many applications (Shangguan et al.
    2002; Ganji et al. 2006). Doorenbos & Kassam (1979) production function, which
    was discussed in the 33rd edition of FAO Irrigation and Drainage, is one of the
    significant functions in this field (Kaboosi & Kaveh 2010; Jiao et al. 2023).
    Several achievements have been obtained from the studies of water allocation to
    plants in dry areas, and determining the depth of irrigation, which should be
    considered in the form of limitations of the problem. Therefore, in the case of
    wheat and barley products, due to their sensitivity to water scarcity and the
    possibility of a sharp decrease in yield from November to late March, no water
    stress is considered (Hakuzimana & Masasi 2020). Nasreen & Ashraf (2021) and Luo
    et al. (2022) obtained about 50% of the water requirement of wheat to achieve
    the highest water consumption efficiency. On the other hand, the efficiency of
    water consumption caused by supplementary irrigation increases the efficiency
    of water consumption caused by precipitation (Tavakkoli & Oweis 2004). Among the
    efficient managements in improving the performance and efficiency of water consumption
    in rainfed agriculture, we can mention mono-irrigation, limited irrigation and
    supplementary irrigation (Zhang & Oweis 1999). Khayatnezhad et al. (2023a and
    b) showed that increasing the depth or time of irrigation when the plant is facing
    moisture stress caused by lack of rainfall can increase the total efficiency of
    water consumption during a growing season by 15%. (Tavakkoli et al. 2013) in order
    to investigate mono-irrigation management in agriculture in dry areas on the yield
    of wheat and barley in Maragheh city, they determined the best and most economical
    proposal in the condition of limited available water. Three propositions of water
    allocation for mono-irrigation of wheat, barley and combination of wheat and barley
    were defined and compared with the superior agricultural management in rainfed
    conditions and the traditional proposition and the optimal area allocated to each
    crop was determined in each of the propositions. The results showed that integrated
    management contributed more than 70% and superior agricultural management less
    than 30% in obtaining the highest profit per unit area. Also, the rainfall productivity
    index of wheat, barley, and chickpeas has increased by 83, 56, and 164%, respectively,
    compared to traditional management conditions. The efficiency of water consumption
    in rainfed lands is between 0.5 and 0.3 kg/m3 and in some countries it reaches
    2.5. The average actual yield of the country''s rainfed lands is 20% of the potential
    yield, and by applying management practices such as one or two irrigations, the
    yield can be improved up to 80%. In China, the efficiency of water consumption
    in rainy conditions is reported to be 0.79 kg/m3, which has reached 0.87 kg/m3
    with single irrigation. In other words, the yield increased from 2.95 ton/ha in
    rainfed conditions to 3.53 ton/ha with the application of single irrigation (Huang
    et al. 2004; Rockstrom et al. 2007; Zhu et al. 2022). Mathematical model of water
    allocation to the products of Hulunbuir district, the model for determining the
    optimal amount and time of irrigation depth and the effective use of rainwater
    are the goals of interest in this study. Multi-objective self-reproducing automata
    (MCA) and an optimization algorithm based on nondominated sorting (NS) (Deb et
    al. 2002) have been used for this purpose. MATERIALS AND METHODS Mathematical
    model of water allocation Listen In general, products to a limited extent can
    be the subject of optimization or simulation problems in cropping model scenarios.
    Considering the multi-crop model, the area under cultivation is entered as the
    first variable to improve the income from the available lands and the depth of
    irrigation in order to apply water allocation management and increase yield in
    the planning model of the cropping pattern. Therefore, the decision-making variables
    in the developed model include both the mentioned influential parameters, i.e.
    the amount of water allocated to a plant in a 10-day period in millimeters and
    the cultivated area of each crop in hectares. In the first step, a string of variables
    is generated by a matrix of random numbers between the upper and lower limits
    of water that can be assigned with dimensions np × Sp (Sp is the number of 10-day
    periods in the study period, 36 and np is the number of plants in the cultivation
    pattern, 3). The lower limit of the allocated water is the height of the effective
    rainfall in each period, in other words, it is assumed that the effective rainfall
    is not within the discretion of the decision maker and is forced into the cycle
    of plant consumption. As a result, it is the least amount of water that the plant
    will receive if there is no water supply. Taking into account these conditions,
    a matrix with 36 columns including the effective rainfall in each period in millimeters
    was defined, which is responsible for controlling the lower limit of allocated
    water in each transaction and change in the model. Effective rainfall refers to
    the fraction of total rainfall that reaches plant consumption and was calculated
    by the relationships proposed by the US Soil Conservation Service for each period
    (Lalehzari et al. 2016). On the other hand, the upper limit of the decision variable
    is the evapotranspiration potential for each plant in each period. Potential evaporation
    and transpiration is calculated by the FAO Penman–Monteith method based on the
    climatic conditions of the region. Therefore, unlike the lower decision limit
    which is constant for all variables located in a 10-day period, there is a maximum
    amount of evaporation and transpiration for each variable. Based on this, in all
    the processes that cause changes in the initial values of the data, such as initial
    selection, population generation, mutation, intersection and movement of particles,
    the allowed range of variables for each period and each plant should be checked.
    Due to the special conditions of optimal allocation of water to agricultural products,
    a separate sub-program according to the flowchart in Figure 1 was prepared to
    identify and determine the upper and lower limits of water requirement at each
    stage of the growth of agricultural products and was defined as the initial conditions
    in creating variable domains of decision-making. Figure 1 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE
    Algorithm for determining upper and lower limits of decision variables. Supplementary
    irrigation depth Listen Supplementary irrigation is planned to provide the minimum
    water requirement of agricultural plants in some parts of the growing season,
    which will improve the yield of the crop. Finding the time and amount of supplementary
    irrigation and how to achieve the highest efficiency of water consumption and
    net income requires optimizing the algorithm of water allocation to agricultural
    plants. The first step in managing the irrigation depth is to identify the periods
    of plant growth when receiving water during that period of time will increase
    the yield the most. These periods are determined based on the three factors of
    the plant''s maximum water requirement, the sensitivity of each stage to drought
    stress, and the amount of effective rainfall. In other words, periods with less
    rainfall, more evaporation and transpiration, and higher sensitivity to water
    scarcity are the priority for allocating irrigation depth in agricultural lands.
    Therefore, to decide on the best time for irrigation, all three mentioned parameters
    were involved. For this purpose, a special code is assigned to the characteristics
    of each plant that is planted in a rainfed manner, and after identifying the plants,
    the model determines the maximum and minimum limits of water allocation for each
    period. Based on this, if two levels of irrigation depth are considered for the
    model, the maximum water requirement will be provided for each period and the
    equivalent of effective rainfall will be allocated for other periods. After estimating
    the product performance based on the production function, this process was repeated
    for all periods and the two periods that had the highest performance were selected.
    Solving the problem with self-reproducing automata method Listen Self-reproducing
    automata was proposed by Ulam (1960) and von Neumann (1966) to model self-reproducing
    automata systems. The application of this algorithm to optimize the exploitation
    of the reservoir was started by Afshar & Shahidi (2009), in which the problem
    was solved with the objectives of water supply and electric energy production,
    and it presented promising results in comparison with meta-exploration algorithms.
    The self-reproducing automata algorithm has four main components including cell,
    cell state, neighborhood and transition rule, which are defined depending on each
    problem. Each component of the self-reproducing automata network is called a cell
    and the characteristic of each cell is called a cell state. The behavior of self-reproducing
    automata is completely based on local communication and interaction. Each cell
    obtains its new state according to its rules at each step considering its immediate
    neighborhood. By applying these simple rules, which are called transition rules,
    the new position of the cells is determined based on their previous position and
    their neighbors. Therefore, presenting a model that directs the position of cells
    (the value of decision variables) to the best position in relation to one or more
    goals, can be the basis of using this algorithm as an optimizer. In order to solve
    the irrigation optimization problem with the self-reproducing automata method,
    in the first step, the problem is redefined based on the components of this algorithm.
    In the proposed cell model, a moment in time and the irrigation depth at that
    moment are defined as the state of the cell (decision variable). In other words,
    the irrigation depth variable at the beginning of each 10-day period is the state
    of the cell in the formulation of the self-reproducing automata method. The updating
    process is performed on this variable in each step of solving the algorithm. For
    an arbitrary cell, the adjacent cells are considered as the cell''s neighborhood.
    Cells related to periods t = 1 and t = T + 1 are bound to have a neighbor due
    to being located in the boundaries of the irrigation period. The next step in
    the self-reproducing automata model is to define the update rule. In this study,
    by using the objective function for each cell, the decision variable is solved
    and the amount of irrigation is updated. Based on the problem framework and decision
    variables, the minimization of the difference of allocated water and evapotranspiration
    in order to increase the efficiency of water consumption and the minimization
    of the transpiration stress ratio of the model are considered as the two main
    goals of the model. (1) (2) where I and Im are the irrigation depth and maximum
    irrigation requirement of the period t (mm/10 days), respectively, Ta and Tm are
    the actual and maximum transpiration (mm/10 days), respectively, IL is the irrigation
    losses (mm/10day), t is the period of plant growth (10 days), and T is the total
    number of periods. Multi-objective allocation planning model Listen Calculating
    the solution of the problem with the proposed model requires validation, which
    is done by the widely used NS algorithm. Therefore, the fuzzy limits of each solution
    obtained by the objective functions of the problem were estimated by the NS method,
    and the solutions that were in the fuzzy limit were proposed as the final solution.
    As shown in Figure 2, the implementation steps of this model are as follows: Generation
    of random parent generation (P0) in the number of N; Sorting the initial generation
    of the parent based on non-superior answers (the answer p to q is non-superior
    when p is not worse than q in any of the objectives and is superior to q in at
    least one objective); Considering the rank corresponding to the non-excessive
    level for each non-excessive answer (1 for the best level, 2 for the best level
    after 1 and …); Generation of children (Q0) in the number of N using selection,
    mating and mutation operators; The combination of parent (Pt) and offspring (Qt)
    chromosomes and generational production (Rt) in the number of 2N; Sorting the
    generation (Rt) based on the non-dominant classification method and identifying
    non-dominant fronts (F1, F2, …, Fl); Generation of the parent generation for the
    next iteration (Pt + 1) using non-dominate fronts produced in the number of N.
    In this step, according to the number of chromosomes required for the parent generation
    (N), first the number of chromosomes of the first front is selected for the parent
    generation. If this number does not correspond to the total number required by
    the parent generation, it is taken from the 2nd, 3rd and… fronts, respectively,
    to reach the total amount (N). Figure 2 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Structure of
    NS multi-objective optimization model. This selection is based on the crowding
    distance criterion, which is calculated from Equation (3); (3) where CD is the
    crowding distance, OF is the objective function, i is the chromosome rank in the
    front, and o is the objective function number. Applying the mating, mutation operators
    to the newly produced parent generation (Pt + 1) and the generation of children
    generation (Qt + 1) in the number of N. Repetition of ranking by dominance principle
    and crowding distance for the combined generation Rt + 1 in the defined number
    of repetitions. Case study Listen The MCA planning model was evaluated for two
    climate regime (Humid area and dryland) in Hulunbuir district in the Inner Mongolia
    where these products occupy a high cultivated area. This city is located at a
    distance of 1,125 km from Hohhot city in the capital of Inner Mongolia in the
    north of China, with latitude 47° 22′ and longitude 122° 11′. The average elevation
    from the area is 612 m. The district area is 1,519 km2. The study was conducted
    for the year 2020–2021 with the rainfall distribution shown in Table 1. The agricultural
    specifications are given in Table 2. Table 1 Rainfall and effective rainfall in

    Oct  20 May  2,850  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION Listen Three scenarios including three
    levels of water supply were analyzed to study the pattern of water allocation:
    (1) providing the minimum water requirement by observing the defined limits, (2)
    allocating 50% of the total water requirement for optimal distribution between
    periods, and (3) full irrigation. Figure 3 shows how to allocate water to rainfed
    and rainfed barley as well as rainfed barley according to the amount of potential
    evaporation and transpiration and distribution of effective rainfall in the crop
    growing season for scenario 1. According to the figure, from the period 7th (early
    December) to the 16th, the effective rainfall meets the water needs of the crops
    and even in the periods 10, 11, and 12 it is more than that. Due to the higher
    water sensitivity of barley in the final stage, compensation for the lack of water
    in the final three periods has been done by water allocation. Figure 3 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE Optimal allocation in different periods (scenario 1). In the second scenario,
    irrigation plays a significant role in increasing the economic efficiency of the
    project (Figure 4). Periods 23 and 25 have been introduced as the best time for
    irrigation and the optimal water height varies between 60 and 80 mm according
    to the constraints of the problem. It is necessary to explain that according to
    the potential evaporation and transpiration line, the total allocated water and
    the effective rainfall provide the total water requirement of rainfed crops in
    irrigation periods. On the other hand, the distribution of water for irrigated
    land has been done with more dispersion but less height. According to the figure,
    the role of rainfall and water demand, the potential in determining the best time
    and amount of irrigation is clear, but in practice, less attention is paid to
    these factors, and usually irrigation is done with a fixed frequency and volume.
    Figure 4 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Optimal allocation in different periods of scenario
    2. The full irrigation planning of barley in Figure 5 confirms the sufficiency
    of rainfall in the winter period and calculates the highest water requirement
    in April and May (periods 19–23). The comparison of potential evaporation and
    transpiration diagrams, irrigation water height and effective rainfall shows that
    in barley cultivation, paying attention to the time and amount of rainfall plays
    a more important role in determining the efficient irrigation program than the
    available water resources. Because rainfed cultivation with irrigation can meet
    the production needs of the crop. In the developed program, the number of irrigations
    is given to the model as a user input parameter, and it is possible to estimate
    the amount of production and water required for each number of irrigations. In
    general, humid area is considered a special scenario of dryland with different
    irrigation number. Figure 5 VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Optimal allocation in different
    periods of complete irrigation (scenario 3). The evaluation parameters of water
    allocation scenarios, including water use efficiency, income–cost ratio, low irrigation
    rate and relative performance are compared and analyzed in Table 3. In scenarios
    2 and 3, the first priority was the full allocation of irrigation, and the rest
    was allocated to humid area. The efficiency of water consumption has not changed
    much and in all cases it is estimated to be about 0.3 kg/m3. On the other hand,
    irrigation has made a significant difference in the yield and profitability of
    crops. Table 3 Evaluation parameters of the water allocation system in scenarios
    1, 2, and 3 Required water/Irrigation depth Actual yield/Potential yield Actual
    yield/Irrigation volume mm/mm kg/kg kg/m3 Humid area  S1  43  64  0.75  S2  56  78  0.62  S3  100  100  0.33  Dryland  S1  27  52  0.76  S2  41  74  0.88  S3  41  74  0.88  The
    optimum cultivation area for irrigated barley is less than its current area, which
    shows that increasing water intake has a greater role in crop profitability (Table
    4). On the other hand, the share of barley out of the 36 thousand hectares of
    the total dry land area of study area is more than that of barley and the competition
    of these two crops for land has been faced with the superiority of wheat. Table

    Listen In this research, the optimal amount and time of irrigation in rainfed
    agriculture and its effect on economic efficiency and water consumption efficiency
    have been evaluated. In this regard, the irrigation time was determined in the
    form of a mathematical model based on the amount of effective rain, water requirement
    and crop growth stage, and drought sensitivity coefficient. The results showed
    that increasing the area of rainfed cultivation compared to irrigated scenario
    has priority in drylands. Due to the high sensitivity to water and the absence
    of rainfall, the most water consumption is managed in the third stage of barley
    growth, and irrigation and underground water harvesting are mainly done in this
    period. Irrigation played a big role in increasing the profit–cost ratio, but
    it did not show much effect on the efficiency of water use. Different ratios of
    water supply have different levels of yield productivity, and in the case of barley,
    the lowest water consumption is estimated to be 55% by observing all the optimization
    conditions. In water shortage conditions, about 50% of the total allocated water
    comes from rainfall, so the second stage of crop growth includes more than half
    of the total water received. The third stage of growth is the source of groundwater
    consumption and determines the number and volume of barley irrigation. The tendency
    of farmers toward rainfed cultivation and not using the maximum potential for
    barley production seems to be caused by this factor. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Listen This

  description: Irrigation is a significant process in smart precision agriculture
    to manage the water utilization of crop demand. The water required for irrigation
    is remarkably inconsistent, and the farmer’s decision is final regarding when
    and how much to irrigate. The accurate decision of irrigation process occurrence
    in the farm field is an important cause to scale and improve the water management
    procedure, accordingly, the sustainability of smart irrigation. In this proposed
    research work, a heuristic methodology that combines an Artificial Neural Network
    and the Genetic Algorithm had developed to predict the optimal water demand of
    the crop. The proposed methodology tested with real-time agricultural data showed
    that developed models have been well-suitable for optimal irrigation in precision

    I. INTRODUCTION With the rapid development of the agricultural Internet of Things
    (AIoT), agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization wireless sensor networks
    (AIFWSNs) are widely used to improve the efficiency of agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization control and production.1–3 In AIoT, AIFWSNs generate massive
    data that need to be processed urgently. Sensor nodes are unable to process a
    large amount of data quickly due to hardware constraints and usually upload these
    data to cloud servers for processing.4 However, unlike traditional wireless sensor
    networks (WSNs), AIFWSNs are used in agricultural production activities where
    latency requirements are much lower. If based solely on the traditional cloud
    computing model, a significant time delay will occur due to the distance of the
    cloud server from the location where the task is generated, thus reducing the
    drip irrigation fertilization efficiency and fertilization accuracy, resulting
    in resource waste and environmental pollution.5 Thus, proposing a method that
    can effectively reduce the offloading time delay of agricultural drip irrigation
    fertilization tasks holds immense research significance. Edge computing6 addresses
    the issues of extended latency, network instability, and limited bandwidth encountered
    in conventional cloud computing models by establishing a network of edge servers
    close to data sources. The main attributes of edge computing of AIFWSNs are agricultural
    drip irrigation, fertilization task, and edge server attributes. Specifically,
    the attributes of the agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization tasks include
    the execution difficulty in the task, the input file size of the task, and the
    output file size. How to perform edge task offloading is a critical issue in reducing
    the task offloading latency of AIFWSNs. However, current task offloading algorithms
    have some limitations. Most existing studies usually focus on dividing and migrating
    these tasks to other devices while ignoring the latency constraints and the selection
    of offloading nodes for different tasks.7 For example, Thinh et al.8 introduced
    a linear relaxation-based approach and a comprehensive search-based approach to
    determine the offloading decision, effectively offloading tasks to cloud servers.
    However, both methods incur significant latency. Wu et al.9 proposed a Lyapunov-based
    task offloading technology, which satisfies the latency constraint, but the approach
    does not take into account different difficulties of task execution and sensitivity
    to latency. To reduce the latency of task offloading for AIFWSNs, a new task offloading
    model and a new heuristic algorithm called QCGA are proposed in this paper. The
    proposed QCGA utilizes quantum optimization and chaotic initialization to enhance
    the algorithm’s performance and obtain the desired latency reduction solution.
    The results of simulations indicate that the QCGA-based task offloading model
    surpasses other approaches of AIFWSNs in terms of latency performance. The main
    contributions of this paper are as follows. A new offloading model for agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks is proposed, which aims to reduce the
    latency of offloading tasks at the edge of AIFWSNs. The model transforms the task
    offloading problem into a problem of assigning a certain number of tasks to the
    appropriate edge servers. A novel quantum operator is proposed to improve task
    offloading methods’ global search capability. The quantum operator uses quantum
    rotation gates and quantum non-gates to update the matrix, and in the process
    of completing the quantum rotation gate update, the operator removes the query
    operation of the rotation angle table, which reduces the complexity of the algorithm
    to a certain extent. A new chaotic operator based on chaos theory is introduced
    to enhance the convergence speed of the task offloading method. The proposed strategy
    effectively avoids premature convergence and falling into local optima by utilizing
    the traversal and randomness characteristics of chaos, resulting in a significant
    improvement in the algorithm’s convergence speed and accuracy. The remainder of
    this paper is organized as follows: Sec. II presents the work related to edge
    task offloading for AIFWSNs. Section III shows the edge offloading model for AIFWSNs.
    In Sec. IV, the proposed QCGA approach for solving the edge offloading problem
    of agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization tasks for AIFWSNs is explained
    in detail. Subsequently, simulation experiments are conducted in Sec. V to verify
    the effectiveness of QCGA in reducing the delay, and the results are explained
    in detail. Finally, Sec. VI describes this paper’s conclusions and future work
    directions. II. RELATED WORK In most task offloading studies, researchers usually
    focus on how to segment and migrate these tasks to other devices. With the convergence
    and development of mobile Internet, Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence
    technologies, various types of mobile applications based on deep learning are
    emerging. However, due to the limitations of the computing power and storage capacity
    of mobile devices, they cannot effectively support the inference process of complex
    deep neural network models, which directly affects the user experience. Offloading
    the inference computation of the models to edge servers or the cloud for execution
    becomes an effective way to solve this contradiction. Tang et al.10 designed a
    Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) algorithm for optimizing the dynamic sub-frame offloading
    of large-scale sequential subtasks in the context of Telematics, which can significantly
    reduce the total latency and performs better, especially in the context of high-speed
    mobile and congested environments. Xue et al.11 proposed a Double Dueling Prioritized
    deep Q-Network (DDPQN) algorithm for deep learning model partitioning and offloading
    strategy acquisition with multiple metric co-optimization by introducing a coupling
    coordination metric and a node balancing metric in a local-edge-cloud cooperative
    environment. Wu et al.12 proposed to construct a virtual queue to assist the actual
    queue, ensuring that the problem of deep learning task duration constraints is
    transformed into a virtual queue stability control problem by constructing a Lyapunov
    function and designing an adaptive online task offloading algorithm to achieve
    long-term energy minimization and queue stability. Sun et al. proposed an energy-aware
    user-centric mobility management scheme that only uses user energy consumption
    as a constraint for task offloading and does not consider delay and energy consumption
    in an integrated manner.13 Chen and Hao14 treated the task offloading issue as
    a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem. This study proposed to transform
    the task offloading problem into two subproblems, task assignment and resource
    allocation, and proposed a software-defined task offloading scheme based on these
    two subproblems. The method succeeded in offloading the tasks, but the scheme
    did not consider the time delay as a constraint. Yi et al.15 proposed a MOTM task
    offloading technology based on queuing model, which considered that the equilibrium
    of a noncooperative game among mobile users successfully offloaded the tasks to
    the cloud server, but the method did not consider the priority among tasks. Energy
    consumption, latency, and task priority are critical concerns for AIFWSNs.16–18
    While conventional wireless sensor networks are also affected by these factors,
    the distinctive aspect of AIFWSNs is that if the nodes’ tasks are not offloaded
    on time, it can lead to task blockage, longer response latencies, reduced drip
    irrigation efficiency, and compromised fertilization accuracy. These outcomes
    result in resource wastage and environmental contamination. In addition, the task
    offloading optimization issue can be abstracted as a multi-objective optimization
    issue because AIFWSNs need to consider multiple constraints simultaneously, which
    is an NP-hard problem.19 Cui et al.20 proposed to use the K nearest neighbor algorithm
    to decide whether tasks are offloaded to the cloud or edge execution and use reinforcement
    learning to allocate non-local computational resources, which considers the task
    inter priority, but the disadvantage of the slower speed of K nearest neighbor
    algorithm is not optimized, while the use of K nearest neighbor algorithm is not
    effective when the samples are not balanced; therefore, the overall latency of
    the method is relatively high and less effective in AIFWSNs. Chen et al.21 explored
    the problem of offloading multiple tasks in a multi-channel wireless interference
    environment for edge cloud computing. They presented a distributed algorithm based
    on game theory to address task offloading, but the approach did not significantly
    reduce task offloading latency. The second class of task offloading methods for
    AIFWSNs is based on heuristic algorithms that can give a set of ideal task offloading
    solutions quickly. Ning et al.22 proposed integrating mobile cloud computing and
    edge computing to formulate task offloading decisions and gave an iterative heuristic
    task offloading strategy. Shen et al.23 presented an offloading technique utilizing
    an enhanced bald eagle search optimization algorithm, efficiently reducing task
    offloading latency. However, the algorithm exhibits slow convergence due to a
    more intricate model, and the inclusion of multiple conventional optimization
    operators in the algorithm results in increased algorithmic complexity. As heuristic
    algorithms continue to advance rapidly, there is an increasing application of
    quantum optimization to augment the global search ability of algorithms.24 Flori
    et al.25 proposed a particle swarm algorithm for quantum optimization based on
    the context of agricultural drip irrigation fertilization, which used quantum
    superposition to adjust the parameters of the particle swarm optimization (PSO)
    to effectively improve the problem of PSO easily falling into local optimum. However,
    the algorithm only applies to some specific scenarios, has poor applicability
    on global convex functions, and converges very slowly. de Andoin and Echanobe26
    proposed a quantum optimization algorithm based on an ant colony optimization
    algorithm to find an approximate solution to the NP-hard problem in agricultural
    drip irrigation fertilization production. The algorithm uses non-error-correcting
    quanta to generate new possible solutions as a superposition of states, but the
    algorithm does not perform well in the face of complex update strategies. In heuristic
    algorithms, a well-diversified initial population helps improve the search efficiency
    of the algorithm. Therefore, various chaotic operators have been added to heuristic
    algorithms in recent years to increase the population diversity and thus speed
    up the convergence of the algorithm.27–29 Xia and Li30 proposed a chaotic particle
    optimization algorithm that uses logistic chaos to search for the elite individuals
    in the population. Although it improves the situation where the PSO falls into
    a local optimum, the convergence speed of the algorithm is not significantly improved
    when facing high-dimensional optimization problems. In 2022, Hashim and Hussien
    proposed a new snake optimizer algorithm for solving complex high-dimensional,
    multi-constraint optimization problems based on natural behaviors, such as mating
    and competition of snakes, which possesses a strong performance for finding optimal
    results. However, the population updating mechanism of SO only considers the optimal
    and the worst individuals. It ignores the contribution of other individuals, and
    the search process of SO is limited by the snake’s movement mode, which can only
    be carried out along the direction of the optimal and the worst individuals.31
    Gupta and Deep proposed an improved gray wolf optimization algorithm based on
    the chaotic local search to alleviate the stagnation of the wolf population in
    the local optimum solution by enhancing exploration and maintaining a relevant
    balance between exploration and exploitation. The overall complexity of the algorithm
    is high, and the computational resources consumed increase the computational cost.32  To
    address the limitations of existing task offloading schemes for AIFWSNs, which
    are either limited in global search capability or slow in convergence speed, this
    paper proposes a new task offloading model and a heuristic approach based on quantum
    and chaos strategies. The proposed approach aims to obtain near-optimal task offloading
    solutions by introducing novel quantum and chaotic operators to enhance the algorithm’s
    search efficiency. By doing so, this research aims to contribute to filling the
    research gap in this area. III. SYSTEM MODEL To achieve proper and reasonable
    offloading of agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization tasks, this paper
    abstracts the process by evaluating the processing difficulty in agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks in AIFWSNs in terms of the number of millions
    of instructions. Considering that edge devices usually have limited computing
    resources, it is assumed in this paper that all edge agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization devices need to offload their tasks to the edge server for execution
    completely and in a full offload manner. In addition, this paper also assumes
    that all agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization tasks have the same priority,
    including tasks such as agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization flow control
    tasks, agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization storage tasks, and agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization device status monitoring, i.e., they are processed
    with equal urgency. Under the above assumptions, the edge offloading problem for
    agricultural drip irrigation fertilization tasks can be translated into the problem
    of how to allocate a certain number of tasks to the appropriate edge servers.
    The goal of the problem is to ensure that the total completion time of all agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks over some time is minimized. To this end,
    this paper proposes an edge computing task offloading system model for AIFWSNs,
    as shown in Fig. 1. FIG. 1. VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Offloading system model for
    edge computing tasks. In the edge offloading model of agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization task designed in this paper, the attributes of agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization task and edge server are mainly involved. Specifically,
    the attributes of the agricultural drip irrigation fertilization task include
    execution difficulty, input file size, and output file size, while the attributes
    of the edge server include bandwidth, the number of central processing unit (CPU)
    cores, and computational power. In the task offload scenario of AIFWSNs considered
    in this paper, the computational power of the edge server is described in terms
    of the number of million machine language instructions processed per second. The
    primary optimization goal of the model is to minimize the total completion time
    of the agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization task. To achieve this, the
    edge offloading delay for the task is divided into three components: task upload
    delay, task execution delay, and task result return delay. Task upload delay refers
    to the time the agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization edge device takes
    to upload the task to the edge server through either wired or wireless means.
    In other words, it is the duration starting from the initiation of offloading
    by the edge device to uploading the task to the edge server. The task upload delay
    D1 is calculated, as shown in the following equation: D 1 = I F L b w , (1) where
    IFL is the size of the task file to be sent to the edge server, including detailed
    task data information, and bw is the transmission bandwidth. When the agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization task is successfully uploaded from the edge
    device to the edge server, the latter will be responsible for parsing and executing
    the input agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization task file, and the time
    spent in this process is the task execution delay D2, which can be calculated
    by using the following equation: D 2 = M I M I P S × C N , (2) where MI represents
    the amount of computation required for the execution of agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization tasks, MIPS represents the number of million machine language
    instructions per second processed by a single CPU of the edge server, and CN is
    the number of CPUs on an edge server. After the edge server executes the assigned
    agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization task, the whole task offloading
    process is not yet finished because the agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization
    edge device is not yet able to obtain the result of task execution completion.
    Therefore, the last part of the delay, the task result return delay D3, is calculated
    as follows: D 3 = O F L b w , (3) where OFL is the size of the task file that
    the edge server sends back to the agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization
    edge device, which includes information about the results of the task execution.
    To effectively reflect the benefits obtained by the agricultural drip irrigation
    fertilization task being assigned to different edge servers and based on the definition
    of the time delays of the three different parts of the edge offloading process
    of the agricultural drip irrigation fertilization task mentioned earlier, this
    paper introduces a task assignment evaluation function to reflect the task assignment
    efficiency obtained by an assignment scheme, whose mathematical expression is
    shown as follows: F obj = α × D 1 + β × D 2 + λ × D 3 , (4) where α, β, and λ
    are the time delay coefficients and D1, D2, and D3 are the task upload time delay,
    task execution time delay, and task result return time delay, respectively. In
    addition, the three different delay coefficients must satisfy both the constraints
    shown in the following equations: α + β + λ = 1 , (5) α + λ ≤ β . (6) In the above
    two constraints, Eq. (5) ensures that the delay coefficients balance the weights
    of the different delay components in the final evaluation criteria. Moreover,
    the constraint of Eq. (6) is that the task execution latency is usually longer
    compared to the other two latency components, and therefore, its weight should
    be larger. IV. QCGA-BASED METHOD FOR REDUCING THE OFFLOADING DELAY OF TASKS OF
    AIFWSNs The task edge offloading model of AIFWSNs proposed in this paper takes
    into account the heterogeneity of different agricultural drip irrigation fertilization
    tasks and edge servers, which complicates the task allocation problem. The problem
    can be judged as an NP-hard problem due to the following reasons: As the number
    of tasks and servers increases, the combination of task–server mappings grows
    exponentially, and the computational complexity of searching for the complete
    solution space is exceptionally high. Different tasks have different computational,
    storage, and network requirements, and there are also differences in the performance
    of the servers, which increases the problem-solving difficulty in solving the
    problem. The execution time of the task, server load, and other objectives need
    to be optimized at the same time while solving the problem. The tasks and servers
    change dynamically in the natural environment, which brings many challenges to
    the solution algorithms. Meanwhile, similar task allocation problems have been
    proven to be NP-complete, so traditional deterministic algorithms are complex
    to solve within polynomials.33–36 Therefore, in this paper, an improved algorithm
    QCGA based on a genetic algorithm (GA) is proposed to solve this NP-hard multi-objective
    optimization problem. Specifically, the main steps of QCGA are as follows. A.
    Population coding In solving the edge offloading problem of agricultural drip
    irrigation and fertilization tasks, QCGA adopts a special coding format, as shown
    in Fig. 2. Suppose there are three edge servers E1, E2, and E3. There are six
    urgent agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization tasks t1, t2, t3, t4, t5,
    and t6. Each edge server must complete two tasks on average, assuming that the
    initial solution is t 1 , t 2 t 3 , t 4 t 5 , t 6 ⁠, indicating that edge server
    E1 needs to complete tasks t1 and t2. The order of completing tasks is t1 first
    and then t2. Other edge servers complete tasks in the same order. If the encoding
    is changed to t 1 , t 5 , t 3 t 4 t 2 , t 6 after one mutation, edge server E3
    turns task t5 to E1 to execute, and the order is t1 → t5 → t3. In this way, the
    operations of each crossover variant can be operated on a single gene chain, increasing
    the simplification of the process. FIG. 2. VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Coding method
    of QCGA. B. Population selection, crossover, and mutation The initial population
    is subject to the roulette wheel method during the selection operation, which
    selects individuals to form a new population. Subsequently, the new population
    is subjected to crossover operations, increasing the gene diversity on the chromosomes.
    The specific steps for selecting the operation are as follows: obtaining the value
    of the fitness function corresponding to the initial population by the fitness
    function and using the roulette wheel method to perform a selection operation
    on the initial population by the value of the fitness function corresponding to
    the initial population. The specific steps of the crossover are as follows: The
    crossover operation requires the comparison of crossover probabilities with random
    numbers for individuals who meet the requirements, as shown in the following equation:
    d m , n ( k + 1 ) = v m , n ( k + 1 ) , r ≥ r , d m , n ( k ) , o t h e r w i
    s e , (7) where d m , n k + 1 is the mth individual of the population in the k
    + 1 generation, n is the nth gene in the mth individual, and r is the crossover
    probability. A certain probability is used to decide whether to perform the crossover
    operation. During the crossover operation, two individuals are selected from the
    current population, known as the parent gene strings. A crossover position is
    randomly chosen on the two selected individuals to perform the crossover operation,
    as depicted in Fig. 3. When the crossover gene of the red gene string crosses
    the crossover gene of the blue gene string during the crossover process, a conflict
    elimination operation is necessary when the gene after the crossover conflicts
    with its gene. To conduct the conflict elimination operation, the gene at the
    crossover point of the blue gene string is initially swapped with the gene at
    the conflicting position. The original gene at the crossover point of the blue
    gene string is then compared with the gene at the crossover point of the red gene
    string. If a conflict exists, the gene in the red gene string at the conflicting
    position is swapped with the gene at the conflicting position. Finally, the blue
    gene string is crossed with the gene in the red gene string that requires crossing.
    By introducing a small probability of mutation, individual genetic diversity is
    enriched. After the crossover operation is completed, the mutation operation is
    executed. The mutation operation in the QCGA is intended to enhance the algorithm’s
    global search capability. Using only selection and crossover operators to generate
    new task assignment sequences can lead to the algorithm getting stuck in locally
    optimal solutions when optimizing the edge offloading of agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization tasks. These two operators can only combine permutations based
    on existing sequences and cannot generate new gene sequences as mutation operators
    can. Therefore, by introducing a certain probability of mutation operation on
    chromosome individuals, QCGA can obtain new task assignment sequences, thus increasing
    the search space and avoiding the risk of falling into local optimal solutions.
    Figure 4 shows how the mutation operation is implemented. FIG. 3. VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE Schematic diagram of two-point crossover operation. FIG. 4. VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE Schematic diagram of mutation operation. C. Quantum operator In the QCGA,
    a novel simplified quantum operator has been suggested to guide the algorithm’s
    evolution toward the optimal offloading scheme. This operator can update the quantum
    rotation gate without the need to query the rotation angle table. It consists
    of the quantum non-gate and the quantum rotation gate operation. At the initialization
    stage of the QCGA, each individual includes a quantum probability amplitude matrix,
    which is updated based on the offloading sequence after the current individual
    update. The pseudo-code of the quantum revolving gate for this streamlined quantum
    operator is shown in Algorithm 1. ALGORITHM 1. Refined and simplified quantum
    revolving door pseudocode. Inputs: current population pop, number of agriculture
    tasks n, number of edge servers m, quantum probability amplitude increment Pquantum,
    and quantum probability amplitude matrix F.  Output: The updated quantum probability
    amplitude matrix F.  01 for each i ∈ [1, n] do  02 for each j ∈ [1, m] do  03

    In solving the edge offloading problem of agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization
    task, the optimal solution generated in the current iteration is easily lost in
    the previous steps of QCGA, thus affecting the convergence performance of the
    algorithm. Therefore, this paper proposes a new chaotic operator to significantly
    accelerate the convergence speed of QCGA and enhance the global search capability.
    The specific implementation of the chaotic operator consists of the following
    two steps: The following equation presents the mathematical expression of the
    logistic mapping model, which is utilized for chaotic sequence initialization
    and population generation: y i j + 1 = 4 × y i j ( 1 − y i j ) , (8) where y i
    j ∈ 0 , 1 is the chaotic variable, i = 1, 2, 3, …, n denotes the ordinal number
    of the chaotic variable, and j = 1, 2, 3, …, N denotes the population ordinal
    number, where N denotes the population size. Using the feature that the logistic
    chaos mapping model is sensitive to initial values, n chaotic variables are obtained
    by assigning n small differences to the initial values of Eq. (8), and then, the
    chaotic variables are mapped to the solution space variables x i j of QCGA by
    using the following equation: x i j = l i + y i j × ( u i − l i ) . (9) Chaotic
    perturbation strategy: the unoptimized GA has the disadvantages of quickly falling
    into local optimum and insufficient search accuracy in the late stage of the algorithm.
    To overcome the above disadvantages, this paper uses the randomness, regularity,
    and ergodicity of chaotic sequences to perturb the three individuals in the decision
    layer, which can make the GA escape the local optimum and thus improve the global
    search ability of the GA. The chaotic perturbation strategy is shown in the following
    equation: y k ′ = y * × ( 1 − φ ) + φ × y k , (10) where y k ′ denotes the chaotic
    variable formed after adding the perturbation, y* denotes the chaotic variable
    formed after mapping individuals in the decision layer to [0,1], yk is the chaotic
    variable after k iterations, and φ φ ∈ 0 , 1 is the strength of the perturbation,
    which is calculated as shown in the following equation, where N is the population
    size: φ = 1 − k − 1 k N . (11) The complete algorithm flowchart of QCGA is shown
    in Fig. 5. E. Algorithm complexity analysis Because SO is the algorithm with the
    smallest performance gap with QCGA among several compared algorithms, the effectiveness
    of QCGA is further demonstrated by comparing the complexity of the two algorithms.
    The primary source of complexity in the proposed QCGA is attributed to the GA,
    chaotic operator, and quantum operator. The GA involves a triple loop encompassing
    the number of iterations, population size, and the number of edge servers, leading
    to its maximum computational complexity. Since the triple loop of the GA is executed
    three times in QCGA, its complexity can be expressed as follows: Q C G A G A =
    3 × M a x × P × T × e , (12) where Max expresses the maximum number of iterations,
    P expresses the population size, T expresses the number of agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization tasks, and e expresses the number of edge servers. The complexity
    of the quantum operator consists of the maintenance and update of the quantum
    probability amplitude matrix for each individual. In each iteration, the quantum
    rotation gate and the quantum non-gate are executed once, so the computational
    complexity of the quantum operator can be denoted as follows: Q C G A quantum
    = 2 × M a x × P × T × e . (13) The complexity of the chaotic operator is concentrated
    in the initial population and perturbed population operations. The complexity
    of the chaotic operator can be denoted as follows: Q C G A chaotic = log 2 ( P
    + T ) . (14) The total computational complexity of the QCGA can be denoted as
    follows: Q C G A total = log 2 ( P + T ) + 5 × M a x G e n × P × T × e . (15)
    The computational complexity of SO mainly comes from iterative computation, initialization
    of the population as a whole, updating of female and male population positions,
    elite individual replacement, and the number of edge servers. The computational
    complexity of the male population is shown in Eq. (16), and the female population
    is shown in Eq. (17), S O m = M a x G e n × P m 2 × T × e , (16) S O f = M a x
    G e n × P f 2 × T × e , (17) where MaxGen represents the maximum number of iterations,
    T represents the number of agricultural drip irrigation fertilization tasks, e
    represents the number of edge servers, Pm and Pf denote the male and female population
    sizes, respectively, which are calculated as shown in Eq. (18), and P is the overall
    population size, P m = P f = P 2 . (18) Therefore, the overall computational complexity
    of SO is shown in the following equation: S O total = P 3 2 × M a x G e n × T
    × e . (19) To compare the computational complexity of QCGA and SO, this study
    uses the big O notation to simplify the formulas; the lower-order terms, constant
    terms, and coefficients are removed, and the highest-order terms are retained,
    which leads to the following equations: Q C G A = O ( log 2 ( P + T ) + M a x
    G e n × P × T × e ) , (20) S O = O ( P 3 × M a x G e n × T × e ) . (21) Because
    log2(P + T) is a function of logarithmic order, it grows much slower than both
    P and T so that it can be ignored, and in addition, MaxGen, T, and e are set the
    same for both algorithms, which further leads to the following equations: Q C
    G A = O ( P ) , (22) S O = O ( P 3 ) . (23) Through the algorithm complexity analysis,
    the QCGA proposed in this paper is also lower in complexity than the advanced
    algorithm SO proposed in recent years, and the results show that the QCGA can
    accomplish the same task in less time and the effectiveness of the QCGA is verified
    in large-scale complex optimization scenarios. V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To verify
    the effectiveness of QCGA in edge task offloading of AIFWSNs, this paper compares
    it with other state-of-the-art task offloading methods and traditional offloading
    methods, including SO, GA, PSO, random offloading, and sequential offloading.
    This paper used the CloudSim cloud computing simulation platform to conduct real-world
    edge offloading tests for agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization tasks.
    The specific test method is to use CloudSim to build an edge computing platform
    for agricultural drip irrigation fertilization task, which contains some agricultural
    drip irrigation fertilization task attributes, such as task execution difficulty,
    task execution completion output file size, task input file size, and some edge
    server attributes, such as server memory, computational power, number of CPUs,
    and computational power. The above task attributes and server attributes are references
    to the task attribute parameters and server parameters that exist in the actual
    scenario. Based on this, the edge offloading method in agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization application obtained using various task offloading algorithms
    is tested, and the total task migration time is counted. The specific technical
    route is as follows: first, using the powerful computing power of the central
    cloud server, the characteristics data of the current agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization tasks are collected, including the attributes of the agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks and the attributes of the edge server,
    and based on these data, the central cloud server obtains the edge offloading
    scheme in the agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization application by various
    offloading algorithms and then sends the detailed information about the location
    where the agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization tasks are offloaded to
    the edge server. After that, control information about the detailed location of
    the offloaded tasks to the edge server is sent, and the actual offloading of agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks is finally realized. In addition, all
    simulation tests were done on a Windows 11 device with 12th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM)
    i5-12400F 2.50 GHz. The experimental data involved in this paper are averaged
    from the results of 100 experiments. To compare the time delay of different task
    offloading schemes of AIFWSNs, uniform standard parameters are used to ensure
    the objectivity and fairness of the simulation experiments. In the simulation
    experiments, all algorithms’ population size is 40, and the number of iterations
    is 1000. The detailed parameter settings of the four heuristic algorithms are
    shown in Table I. TABLE I. Algorithm parameter setting. Name Parameter QCGA  mutation_rate

    comprehensively evaluate the superiority of offloading schemes obtained by QCGA,
    this paper uses four offloading schemes based on heuristic algorithms, QCGA, SO,
    GA, and PSO, and two common offloading schemes for agricultural drip irrigation
    and fertilization tasks: sequential offloading and random offloading. Sequential
    offloading assigns agricultural drip irrigation fertilization tasks to edge servers
    in the order of task numbers, while random offloading randomly assigns agricultural
    drip irrigation fertilization tasks to one edge server for execution. In this
    paper, four test scenarios with different metrics are set up: (1) 50 agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks and 10 edge servers; (2) 100 agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks and 20 edge servers; (3) 200 agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks and 25 edge servers; and (4) 300 agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks and 30 edge servers. The primary evaluation
    metric is the aggregate duration required to accomplish all agricultural drip
    irrigation and fertilization tasks, whereby a smaller value indicates the superior
    performance of the offload solution. Figures 6(a)–6(d) show the variation of the
    delay benefit values for the four heuristic-based task offloading methods. The
    horizontal axis of Figs. 6(a)–6(d) represents the number of iterations, and the
    vertical axis represents the delay benefit value, with lower benefit values indicating
    a lower delay of the associated task offloading schemes. Based on the iteration
    changes, it is obvious that the QCGA-based task offloading method has significantly
    lower latency than the other three heuristic comparison algorithms, while the
    latency results of the other task offloading methods do not differ much. FIG.
    5. VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Algorithm flowchart of QCGA. FIG. 6. VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE Delay benefit values of task offloading algorithms with different indicators:
    (a) 50 tasks, 10 servers; (b) 100 tasks, 20 servers; (c) 200 tasks, 25 servers;
    and (d) 300 tasks, 30 servers. In addition, the QCGA algorithm presented in this
    paper has a superior completion time for obtaining an offloading scheme for agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks compared to the other three heuristic
    algorithms. This is due to the fact that QCGA employs novel quantum and elite
    operators to enhance the algorithm’s ability to search for the best task offloading
    scheme. By comparing the results of QCGA, SO, PSO, and GA, as well as analyzing
    the result curves of the four algorithms in different scenarios, the results show
    that not only QCGA is significantly faster than the other three comparison algorithms
    in terms of convergence speed but also the delay benefit value obtained by QCGA
    is markedly better than the comparison algorithms. On the contrary, all three
    comparison algorithms fail to utilize the population information fully and lack
    population diversity, thus falling into local optimal solutions and ultimately
    not finding the best task offloading solution. The analysis of the results further
    demonstrates the effectiveness of QCGA using new quantum and novel elite operators
    to enhance its performance. Figures 7(a)–7(d) show the total offload time of the
    agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization tasks vs the number of tasks and
    edge servers in scenarios 1–4. As the number of tasks and edge servers increases,
    the task offloading delay increases for all algorithms. The QCGA-based offloading
    scheme performs the best among all algorithms, with the shortest time required
    to complete the agricultural drip irrigation fertilization task, while the random
    offloading method-based offloading scheme performs the worst. FIG. 7. VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD
    SLIDE Different indicators under the agriculture task offloading completion time:
    (a) 50 tasks, 10 servers; (b) 100 tasks, 20 servers; (c) 200 tasks, 25 servers;
    and (d) 300 tasks, 30 servers. Taking scenarios 1 and 4 as an example, in scenario
    1, when there are 50 agricultural drip irrigation fertilization tasks and 10 edge
    servers, the total task completion times of QCGA, SO, GA, and PSO are 121.52,
    130.24, 140.59, and 133.31 ms, respectively. At this time, the performance difference
    between these four heuristic optimization algorithm-based offloading schemes is
    not significant. In contrast, the total task completion times of the unplanned
    sequential and random offloading schemes are 163.55 and 209.02 ms, respectively,
    which are much higher than those of the first four heuristic task offloading algorithms;
    the results show that the sequential and random offloading schemes do not consider
    the processing capacity and status of the edge servers, which leads to load imbalance,
    with some servers overloaded, while others are idle. However, the heuristic optimization
    based algorithm can find a better task allocation scheme through iterative search,
    which ultimately reduces the overall task completion time. In scenario 4, when
    there are 300 agricultural drip irrigation fertilization tasks and 30 edge servers,
    the total task completion time of QCGA is the shortest, which is only 274.98 ms.
    In contrast, the total task completion time of QCGA is lower than that of SO,
    GA, PSO, sequential offloading, and random offloading by 8.38%, 22.48%, 18.01%,
    54.22%, and 63.22%, respectively. The results show that when the problem size
    becomes more significant, the advantages of the QCGA algorithm’s fast convergence
    speed and strong search ability become more pronounced, and it can find the optimal
    solution in the large-scale solution space quickly and efficiently. To further
    validate the effectiveness of the task offloading schemes obtained by the QCGA
    algorithm, two different experimental scenarios are designed in this paper to
    test the stability of QCGA in large-scale AIFWSNs. With a fixed number of 100
    edge servers, Fig. 8 shows the variation of total task completion time for different
    task offloading schemes as the number of agricultural drip irrigation fertilization
    tasks increases from 1000 to 4000. When the number of agricultural drip irrigation
    fertilization tasks is 1,000, the total task completion time of QCGA is 330.97
    ms, SO is 363.38 ms, GA is 392.17 ms, PSO is 373.19 ms, sequential offloading
    is 398.96 ms, and random offloading is 475.01 ms. When the number of agricultural
    drip irrigation fertilization tasks increases to 4,000, the total task completion
    time of the QCGA algorithm is 1021.76 ms, SO is 1169 ms, GA is 1396.38 ms, PSO
    is 1223.40 ms, sequential offloading is 1424.48 ms, and random offloading is 1621.49
    ms. From the latency trends of different offloading scenarios in Fig. 8, it can
    be seen that when the number of edge servers is fixed, the number of tasks keeps
    increasing, and the task offloading scheme obtained by QCGA is still the scheme
    with the shortest total task completion time. According to the trend of the curve,
    it can be seen that the larger the size of AIFWSNs, the more pronounced the advantage
    of QCGA. By analyzing the above results, it is found that the design of a new
    delay evaluation function in this paper is one of the reasons why the total task
    completion time of QCGA is significantly lower than that of several other schemes;
    at the same time, in the evaluation function, this paper entirely takes into account
    the impact of different delay components on the evaluation function and balances
    the weights of different delay components in the final evaluation criteria. FIG.
    8. VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Task offload completion time for different numbers
    of agriculture tasks under 100 edge servers. Figure 9 demonstrates that with a
    fixed number of 1000 agricultural drip irrigation fertilization tasks, this study
    evaluates the latency variations of different task offloading schemes when the
    number of edge servers is 200, 300, 400, and 500. The results show that when the
    number of edge servers is 200, the total time for QCGA to complete task offloading
    is 177.70 ms. In contrast, when the number of edge servers is increased to 500,
    the total time for QCGA to complete task offloading is 88.76 ms, compared to the
    total time for task offloading completion of SO, GA, PSO, sequential offloading,
    and random offloading, which is 113.78, 157.07, 144.07, 164.88, and 190.74 ms,
    respectively. The results show that QCGA exhibits more significant advantages
    as the number of edge servers increases with a fixed number of tasks. In addition,
    the new chaos operator and quantum operator designed in this paper are also among
    the reasons why QCGA shows excellent advantages. The convergence speed of QCGA
    is accelerated by designing new chaotic operators. At the same time, the ability
    of QCGA to jump out of local optimum is also enhanced as the number of agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks increases from 1000 to 4000 with increasing
    quantum probability. FIG. 9. VIEW LARGEDOWNLOAD SLIDE Task offload completion
    time for different numbers of edge servers under 1000 agriculture tasks. As the
    number of tasks and edge servers increases, the performance advantage of the QCGA
    task offloading scheme becomes more and more significant. Several experimental
    results show that the QCGA is more efficient in task offloading scheme optimization
    and can complete tasks faster. Compared with other algorithms, the QCGA can significantly
    reduce the task completion time, thus enhancing the efficiency and performance
    of the system. This is important for agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization
    tasks in edge computing application scenarios that require high task processing
    speed. VI. CONCLUSIONS Due to the high time delay requirement for agricultural
    drip irrigation and fertilization tasks, task offloading in edge computing of
    AIFWSNs is more focused on satisfying the time delay constraints. Therefore, in
    building the model, this paper introduces a new delay coefficient design evaluation
    function to divide the delay of agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization
    task offloading into the task upload delay, task execution delay, and task completion
    delay. In addition, this paper proposes a QCGA task offloading method. The quantum
    revolving gate in QCGA innovatively simplifies the update method of quantum probability
    amplitude and significantly enhances the global search capability of QCGA. In
    addition, a new chaos learning operator is designed in this paper to improve the
    convergence performance of QCGA. Simulation results show that the solutions of
    the QCGA-based edge task offloading algorithm for AIFWSNs are all better than
    several other offloading methods and dramatically reduce the task offloading delay.
    With the continuous development of edge computing technologies and the expansion
    of application scenarios, future edge computing deployments will become more complex.
    To better address these challenges, this team will continue to study the edge
    task offloading problem of AIFWSNs in-depth and explore methods and strategies
    for task offloading in more complex edge computing environments. This includes
    considering more edge devices and network topologies and addressing the challenges
    of more dynamic and unstable network environments and task load variations. In
    addition, to further improve the stability and reliability of the QCGA, this team
    will conduct more in-depth research. This will include further analyzing and optimizing
    the performance of the QCGA, exploring more efficient and reliable genetic operators
    and quantum revolving gates, and designing evaluation functions and chaotic learning
    operators more suitable for agricultural drip irrigation and fertilization application
    scenarios. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This paper was funded by the National Natural Science

    Accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ETr) is important for irrigation
    planning, water resource management, and preserving agricultural and forest habitats.
    The widely used Penman–Monteith equation (ASCE-PM) estimates ETr across various
    timescales using ground weather station data. However, discrepancies persist between
    estimated ETr and measured ETr obtained from weighing lysimeters (ETr-lys), particularly
    in advective environments. This study assessed different machine learning (ML)
    models in comparison to ASCE-PM for ETr estimation in highly advective conditions.
    Various variable combinations, representing both radiation and aerodynamic components,
    were organized for evaluation. Eleven datasets (DT) were created for the daily
    timescale, while seven were established for hourly and quarter-hourly timescales.
    ML models were optimized by a genetic algorithm (GA) and included support vector
    regression (GA-SVR), random forest (GA-RF), artificial neural networks (GA-ANN),
    and extreme learning machines (GA-ELM). Meteorological data and direct measurements
    of well-watered alfalfa grown under reference ET conditions obtained from weighing
    lysimeters and a nearby weather station in Bushland, Texas (1996–1998), were used
    for training and testing. Model performance was assessed using metrics such as
    root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean bias error (MBE),
    and coefficient of determination (R2). ASCE-PM consistently underestimated alfalfa
    ET across all timescales (above 7.5 mm/day, 0.6 mm/h, and 0.2 mm/h daily, hourly,
    and quarter-hourly, respectively). On hourly and quarter-hourly timescales, datasets
    predominantly composed of radiation components or a blend of radiation and aerodynamic
    components demonstrated superior performance. Conversely, datasets primarily composed
    of aerodynamic components exhibited enhanced performance on a daily timescale.
    Overall, GA-ELM outperformed the other models and was thus recommended for ETr
    estimation at all timescales. The findings emphasize the significance of ML models
    in accurately estimating ETr across varying temporal resolutions, crucial for
    effective water management, water resources, and agricultural planning. Keywords:

    (ET) is a significant factor in the hydrological cycle and is frequently used
    to calculate hydrological losses through several important processes that take
    place between the ground and the atmosphere. It is essential for the optimal design
    of irrigation schedules [1], management of regional water resources [2], and estimation
    of different hydrological processes [3]. ET has a significant impact on several
    terrestrial ecosystem processes as well as pertinent characteristics, such as
    soil water content and energy balances [4]. Considerable progress in estimating
    ET and understanding the mechanisms of its ongoing variations in daily, annual,
    and inter-annual timescales has been made through numerous studies, motivated
    by the early awareness of the importance of water as an essential resource for
    life sustainability on earth. Despite the findings in these studies, the complex
    and nonlinear processes that dominate evapotranspiration have made its estimation
    a great challenge, partly due to several influencing factors, such as landform,
    geomorphological, soil moisture, and vegetation traits [5,6,7]. In this context,
    the precise estimation of ET is still of particular importance for careful water
    resource management. An overview of the evolution of ET-estimating methods during
    the previous century was discussed in Ref. [8], and these methods are often classified
    as direct and indirect. Direct methods, such as lysimeters and micrometeorological
    techniques, demand special construction and high maintenance, which is expensive.
    Indirect methods, on the other hand, are less expensive and time-saving and are
    in some contexts regarded as suitable alternatives to the direct ones. The indirect
    methods are commonly classified into water-balance-based, radiation-based, mass-transfer-based,
    and temperature-based models [9]. Because it considers both aerodynamic and thermodynamic
    factors, the FAO Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) model for calculating the ET of a reference
    short (grass) crop continues to be the most extensively used indirect method for
    ETr estimation in a variety of regions and climates [10]. The Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) approved the equation after determining that it accounts for
    all the variables influencing evapotranspiration and fixes most of the flaws in
    the other empirical techniques. The Penman–Monteith Equation was slightly modified
    and standardized by the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) for both tall
    crop (alfalfa) (ETrs) and short crop (clipped grass) surfaces with similar parameterizations
    as the FAO-PM for computation of the equation components after national and international
    discussions on the adoption of a taller reference crop [11]. The result was the
    ASCE-PM equation, and it was formulated to allow calculations for both daily and
    hourly or shorter time steps [12]. The complexity involved in the calculations
    of all the required inputs in the ASCE-PM is a disadvantage for its application,
    which could lead to significant errors [13]. Another drawback in using the ASCE-PM
    is the difficulty in obtaining the extensive weather data needed and the absence
    of adequate historical records for each study location, which are crucial aspects
    for calculating reliable ETr estimates [4]. This can be particularly challenging
    in developing countries, where there are limited meteorological stations and a
    scarcity of weather data records. Reference evapotranspiration depends on latitude,
    altitude, and several climatic variables, such as relative humidity, air temperature,
    soil temperature, wind speed, net radiation, and dew point temperature [14]; several
    researchers have utilized a combination of these different parameters to model
    ETo using machine learning models at daily and monthly timescales to overcome
    the identified limitations and difficulties of traditional methods [15]. CatBoost,
    generalized regression neural network (GRNN), and the random forest (RF) models
    were evaluated for estimating daily ETo in the arid and semi-arid regions of northern
    China, using limited meteorological data with eight different combinations of
    inputs [16]. It was found that CatBoost demonstrated superior performance and
    was identified as the most effective method for estimating ETo. The efficiency
    of extreme learning machines (ELM) was compared to the empirical Penman–Monteith
    equation and the feedforward backpropagation (FFBP) in predicting ETo for three
    meteorological stations in Iraq, utilizing meteorological data from thirteen years
    (2000–2013) as inputs [5]. They concluded that the ELM model demonstrated efficiency,
    simplicity, high speed, and good generalization performance for ETo estimation.
    Four different variants of an extreme learning machine (ELM) model optimized using
    bio-inspired search algorithms were evaluated to estimate daily reference evapotranspiration
    (ETr) across various regions in China using data from eight meteorological stations
    [1]. The results highlighted the effectiveness of bio-inspired optimization algorithms,
    particularly the FPA and CSA algorithms, in enhancing the performance of the conventional
    ELM model for daily ETo prediction. Kernel-based (Gaussian process regression
    (GPR), support vector regression (SVR)) and deep learning methods (Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno
    artificial neural network (BFGS-ANN)) were compared to long short-term memory
    (LSTM) for estimation of monthly reference evapotranspiration using minimal meteorological
    parameters in ten different combinations [17]. The results showed that all four
    methods predicted ETo amounts with acceptable accuracy and error levels. Due to
    consistent climatic changes and the complexity of the evapotranspiration process
    that leads to its high variability in time and space, in this study, modeling
    the ETr was extended to quarter-hourly and hourly timescales. Meteorological data
    at high temporal resolution has become easier to collect due to the recent advancements
    in the development of automatic weather stations [18]. This, in turn, boosts the
    estimation of ETr at such resolutions, which is commonly used for calibrating
    surface energy balance models in the determination of geospatial evapotranspiration
    from drone imagery or satellite images [19,20]. Therefore, assessing the performance
    of the ASCE-PM at timescales lower than the daily interval is increasingly becoming
    necessary. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that have evaluated
    the use of ML models for the estimation of ETr at lower timescales, such as hourly
    or quarter-hourly with varied meteorological input data. In addition, studies
    that evaluated ETr at a daily timescale mostly considered parameters directly
    measured from weather stations. This is desirable for the estimation of reference
    evapotranspiration in areas with incomplete meteorological data [9]. However,
    the sensitivity of ETr to different meteorological variables (directly measured
    or those calculated from directly measured) has been studied [21,22], and they
    were all found to influence the energy budget of the surface [23]. Changes in
    wind speed produced the largest decrease in ETr, followed by vapor pressure, net
    radiation, and mean temperature [21]. Also, computed ETr was found to be most
    sensitive to net radiation, followed by vapor pressure deficit and wind travel
    transfers; the contribution of the aerodynamic and net radiation components to
    the ETr value varied throughout the year [24]. The difference in the contribution
    of these components could be attributed to the difference in climates [8]. Therefore,
    it is evident that for proper evapotranspiration estimation, proper assessment
    of all meteorological parameters (directly measured or not) is necessary. In this
    study, we combined directly measured weather parameters with subsequently calculated
    parameters for ETr estimation using machine learning models. Advantages of ML
    include the ability to use reduced data inputs, capturing non-linearity in the
    data inputs, and utilizing the computing power of modern-day computer systems
    to analyze big data. Collectively, these factors have made ML algorithms attractive
    options for estimating ETr. The choice of the best possible algorithm and the
    choice of adequately representative variables are among the challenging aspects
    of any ML task [25]. Moreover, the performance of ML algorithms strongly depends
    on the size and structure of available data [25]. To improve performance, several
    bio-inspired algorithms, such as GA, are coupled with ML models to find the optimal
    set of parameters during model training [1,5]. This is because default optimization
    algorithms, such as backpropagation, are often trapped in the local minima, several
    parameters influence its speed and robustness, and its best parameters appear
    to vary from problem to problem [26]. Unlike the backpropagation technique that
    always adjusts weights towards the descending direction of the error function,
    GA is a parallel stochastic optimization algorithm good at global searching. The
    drawback of GA is its slowness during model training due to its exploration mechanism
    through reproduction, crossover, and mutation, as well as searching for optimal
    solutions from random genes [27,28]. Nonetheless, GA provides multiple optimal
    solutions from the search space, and has thus gained prominence in recent years.
    For evapotranspiration studies, ML models coupled with GA were found to perform
    better than the corresponding single models [29,30,31,32]. Therefore, in this
    paper, GA was utilized to optimize ML models and compared to standardized ASCE-PM
    for ETr estimation on daily, hourly, and quarter-hourly timescales considering
    different input meteorological variables. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Lysimetric
    and Weather Data Collection A research study was set up for the actual estimation
    of alfalfa reference evapotranspiration in Bushland, Texas, facility of the USDA
    Agricultural Research Service Conservation and Production Research Laboratory,
    in 1996. Bushland has a semi-arid climate that is impacted by local and regional
    advection events [33]. The site was subdivided into two square fields, designated
    northeast (NE) and southeast (SE), each measuring ~5.0 ha. Monolithic weighing
    lysimeters (NE and SE) with 3 m × 3 m surface dimensions and 2.4 m deep were located
    at the center of each of the two fields. These were used for the direct measurement
    of ETr-lys. The details about the study area and the lysimeter’s site in Bushland
    (35°11′ N, 102°6′ W, and 1170 m above MSL) can be found in Refs. [34,35]. Alfalfa
    was seeded in the two fields, which were irrigated simultaneously by a Lindsay
    lateral move sprinkler system to maintain a well-watered condition. Experiments
    were conducted for 4 years from 1996 through 1999 [36], but the data for the year
    1999 were omitted in this study because reference conditions for a tall reference
    crop (alfalfa) were not always met [10]. The leaf area index (LAI), growth stage,
    and plant height were measured periodically between and at each harvest in each
    field (Figure 1). The whole planting and agronomic management of alfalfa crops
    during the four-year growing period were described in Ref. [36], and the data
    and metadata are available in Ref. [37]. Figure 1. Alfalfa harvesting patterns

    from 1996 to 1998. The methodology for meteorological data acquisition was extensively
    described in Refs. [35,36] and are available in Ref. [38]; therefore, only the
    measured variables and other noteworthy points will be presented in this work.
    Meteorological measurements were made at 5 s intervals and reported as quarter-hourly
    averages. This meteorological data, including the mean air temperature at 2.0
    m height, mean relative humidity at 1.8 m height, mean wind speed at 2.0 m height,
    and mean solar irradiance were necessary to obtain the ETr calculated in this
    study. 2.2. Data Processing Lysimeter and meteorology data were processed and
    analyzed under three different timescales: quarter-hourly, hourly, and daily.
    Only the days when alfalfa height was at least 0.5 m were used in this study in
    accordance with reference conditions for a tall reference crop (alfalfa) [10].
    Also, days were not considered if irrigation or rainfall affected the accuracy
    of the water balance calculations for measured ETr or if the crop was lodged or
    badly watered. Figure 2 shows the Kc values for the days selected in this study.
    Note that the Kc values were often >1, which indicates that alfalfa ET under reference
    conditions exceeded the ASCE 2005 PM reference ET in the advective environment
    of Bushland. Figure 2. Kc values for the days when reference conditions were met
    for alfalfa growing period (1996–1998). ETr-lys values from the NE and SE lysimeters
    were averaged for each of the data points to obtain the full ETr-lys dataset under
    the quarter-hourly timescale. The hourly ETr-lys was computed as the sum of four
    (4) consecutive quarter-hourly readings, while the same number of readings were
    averaged to obtain the mean hourly values of the meteorological variables (air
    temperature, wind speed, solar radiation, relative humidity). On the daily timescale,
    the daily ETr-lys was computed as the sum of all ninety-six (96) consecutive quarter-hourly
    readings, while the meteorological variables were extracted as follows; the maximum
    and minimum values of temperature and relative humidity were taken as the maximum
    and minimum of the 15 min average values for a given day, respectively. The ninety-six
    (96) consecutive quarter-hourly readings were averaged to obtain the mean daily
    values of the meteorological variables (wind speed, solar radiation, temperature).
    This resulted in daily meteorological data, including maximum temperature (Tmax),
    minimum temperature (Tmin), mean wind speed (u2), maximum relative humidity (RHmax),
    minimum relative humidity (RHmin), and mean solar radiation (Rs). 2.3. Calculation
    of Parameters for Reference Evapotranspiration Estimation Equation (1) presents
    the form of the ASCE-PM by Ref. [12] for different time steps. The constants Cd
    and Cn for each of the timescales are shown in Table 1. E T rs = 0.408∆( R n −G)+γ
    C n T+273 u 2 ( e s − e a ) ∆+γ(1+ C d u 2 ) (1) where ETrs is the standardized
    reference crop evapotranspiration for a tall surface (mm d−1 for daily time steps
    or mm h−1 for hourly time steps); Rn is the net radiation at the crop surface
    (MJ m−2 d−1 for daily time steps or MJ m−2 h−1 for hourly time steps); G is the
    soil heat flux density at the soil surface at the daily (MJ m−2 d−1) and hourly
    (MJ m−2 h−1) basis; T is the mean daily or hourly air temperature at 1.5 to 2.5
    m height (°C); u2 is the mean daily wind speed at 2 m height (m s−1); es is the
    saturation vapor pressure at 1.5 to 2.5 m height (kPa); ea is the mean actual
    vapor pressure at 1.5 to 2.5 m height (kPa); ∆ is the slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure–temperature curve (kPa °C−1); γ is the psychrometric constant (kPa
    °C−1); Cn is the numerator constant that changes with reference type and calculation
    time step; and Cd is the denominator constant that changes with reference type
    and calculation time step (s m−1). Table 1. Parameters of the ASCE-PM at different
    timescales. The ASCE-PM reference evapotranspiration was calculated using REF-ET
    software (Version 4.1.4.22) [39], which calculates ETo and ETr for grass and alfalfa
    as short and tall reference crops, respectively, on different timescales. It can
    be used to calculate reference evapotranspiration on monthly, daily, and hourly
    or less timescales, and it has been adopted in several studies [40,41]. The calculated
    ETrs values from the software were compared to the outputs of ML models at daily,
    hourly, and quarter-hourly timescales. 2.4. Machine Learning Algorithms and Optimization
    Four ML models with different operation principles were used in this study to
    estimate ETr: random forest (RF), extreme learning machine (ELM), support vector
    regression (SVR), and artificial neural network (ANN). These models have gained
    prominence in evapotranspiration studies in recent years [42,43]. ELM is different
    from ANN and SVR, as it does not require iterative training, and its hidden layer
    parameters are randomly selected [1]. It was first proposed by Ref. [44] and has
    received wide applicability due to its fast convergence speed, strong generalization
    ability, and no local extrema [45]. RF is a tree-based approach that manages high-dimension
    regression problems, where the final decision results via a bagging procedure.
    The structure of each of these models is shown in Figure 3, but a further detailed
    description of the definitions and principle of operation is out of the scope
    of this paper; it has been extensively discussed elsewhere [46,47,48,49]. Figure
    3. Structure of the machine learning models: ANN (a), SVR (b), ELM (c), and RF
    (d). 2.4.1. Genetic Algorithm The GA is a widely used optimization technique that
    has shown promise in agricultural studies for fine-tuning the parameters of ML
    models [50]. It is an evolutionary algorithm used to search for optimized solutions
    to the natural evolutionary process through simulation [1]. Several evapotranspiration
    studies indicated that coupling GA with machine learning models, such as ANN,
    SVR, and ELM, yields better results than the single models [29,30,31,32]. An extensive
    overview of the implementation of a genetic algorithm including potential integration
    with ML models was provided in Ref. [51]. In this study, its integration with
    ML models is demonstrated in Figure 4. Across all models, the population size,
    mutation probability, crossover probability, and the number of generations of
    the GA were set to 50, 0.2, 0.3, and 5, respectively. Also, input features were
    normalized within the range of [–1, 1] using the Mix and Max method [4]. Figure
    4. Flow diagram for tuning the hyperparameters of the machine learning models.
    For the SVR model, the radial basis function was used as the kernel function,
    and the regularization parameter and kernel parameter (gamma) were optimized with
    them ranging from 5 to 1000, and from 0.05 to 0.99, respectively. For the RF models,
    the maximum depth of the tree (max_depth), the number of features (max_features),
    the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node (min_samples_leaf),
    the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node (min_samples_split),
    and the number of trees in the forest (n_estimators) were optimized ranging from
    5 to 500, from 2 to 6, from 5 to 20, from 5 to 20, and from 1 to 500, respectively.
    The weight matrix and bias vector of the ELM were randomly generated and the activation
    function was set to sigmoid. The hidden units and the regularization parameters
    were optimized from 5 to 1000 and from 0.02 to 0.9, respectively. Detailed descriptions
    of the ELM parameters used in this study are extensively discussed in [44]. The
    ANN model consisted of an input layer, a hidden layer, and the output layer. The
    Rectified Linear Unit (ReLu) was taken as the activation function. The neg_mean_squared_error
    and neg_mean_absolute_error of the scikit-learn package in Pyhtonv3.8 were used
    as the loss functions. The number of neurons and hidden layers were both optimized
    ranging from 3 to 100, while the learning rate was optimized from 0.01 to 0.3.
    Additional parameters were taken as the default values in the scikit-learn package.
    2.4.2. k-Folds Cross Validation The k-fold cross-testing approach was used during
    this phase to train and test the models. The meteorological dataset was randomly
    divided into training and testing datasets, each with 80% and 20% of the total
    data, respectively. The training dataset was then equally divided into five folds,
    of which four were utilized to train the models and one for model testing. To
    make sure that each fold was used at least once for model testing, the procedure
    was carried out five times. The performance of each of the model hyperparameters
    was assessed by the resulting error. The errors of the five trials were averaged
    as the expected generalization error. The parameters that provided the minimum
    average error were returned as the tuned hyperparameters. 2.4.3. Arrangement of
    Datasets for Machine Learning Models The datasets for ML models were arranged
    to reflect the impacts of aerodynamic and radiation components on ETr (Figure
    5). Aerodynamic components are represented by wind speed, relative humidity, and
    vapor pressure deficit (VPD), while radiation components are represented by net
    radiation (Rn), solar irradiance (Rs), air temperature, vapor pressure–temperature
    curve (∆), and the relative cloudiness (Rs/Rso). Figure 5. Representation of radiation
    and aerodynamic components for ETr estimation. Further considerations included
    the simplicity of measuring the weather parameters, the ease of calculation of
    the intermediate parameters, and the completeness of the climatic variables. Parameters
    u2, Rs, and the means, minimums, and maximums of temperature and relative humidity
    can be directly measured by weather stations. Parameters that are calculated from
    the directly measurable variables include the VPD, the Rs/Rso, the ∆, and the
    Rn. The requirement for the calculation of all these parameters for ETr estimation
    has been cited as one of the challenges of the ASCE-PM that could lead to significant
    errors [13]. Such errors could be reduced by determining the most crucial parameters
    that influence evapotranspiration for a given area through machine learning algorithms.
    For this, eleven DTs were considered for the daily timescale, while seven input
    datasets (DTs) were considered for the hourly and quarter-hourly timescales, as
    shown in Table 2. On a daily timescale, DT3, DT5, and DT10 contain all or the
    majority of the aerodynamic components, while DT1, DT4, DT7, and DT8 provide a
    good mix of both aerodynamic and radiation components. The presence of aerodynamic
    components is reduced in DT6, DT9, and DT11. Among these datasets, all the parameters
    in DT8 can be directly measured from a weather station, followed by DT3 and DT4,
    which have additional parameters that require computation. The need for computation
    is increased in DT1 and DT5. A similar arrangement was followed at hourly and
    quarterly timescales, however, in this case, the minimums and maximums of relative
    humidity and temperature were replaced by their mean values. The calculation of
    all the parameters we included in our datasets is defined and extensively explained
    in Ref. [12]. Rs/Rso represents relative cloudiness and can be derived from pyranometer
    data and calculated Rso values [52]. The calculation of VPD requires air temperature
    and relative humidity, while ∆ requires air temperature. The net radiation indicates
    the amount of solar irradiance absorbed by vegetation, and it is commonly calculated
    from the short and long-wave radiation components (Equation (2)) at either a daily,
    hourly, or lower timescale. 𝑅 𝑛 = 𝑅 𝑛𝑠 − 𝑅 𝑛𝑙 (2) where Rns and Rnl are net short-wave
    and net outgoing long wave radiation in MJ m−2 d−1/h−1, respectively. Table 2.

    respectively. 2.5. Evaluation Metrics The competency of the ASCE-PM, GA-SVR, GA-ANN,
    GA-ELM, and GA-RF models for estimating ETr-lys at daily, hourly, and quarter-hourly
    timescales was assessed by comparing the estimated ET from each model with the
    ET measured using the lysimeters and quantified using four commonly used statistical
    indices, i.e., the coefficient of determination (R2) [1], the mean bias error
    (MBE) [53], the mean absolute error (MAE), and the root mean squared error (RMSE)
    [54], which can be expressed as follows: R 2 : 1− [ ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 )( 𝑥 𝑖
    − 𝑥 𝑖 )] 2 ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 𝑖 ) 2 ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥 𝑖 )] 2 (6) RMSE:  ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1

    the observed ETr. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Comparison of the Estimation
    Accuracy of the ASCE-PM and Machine Learning Models at a Daily Timescale The estimated
    ETr using ASCE-PM (ETrs) and that from ML models was compared to that from weighing
    lysimeters (ETr-lys) on a daily timescale. Table 3 indicates that DT3, DT4, and
    DT6 provided the best-performing estimators of ETr-lys across the different ML
    models. However, Figure 6 illustrates that the ASCE-PM equation performed better
    than these models (considering R2) but tended to underestimate ETr-lys (slope
    of 0.91, MBE = −0.43 mm/day) for values from 7.5 mm day−1 and greater. Also, the
    residual plot in Figure 7b shows that the largest errors occurred at approximately
    > 7.5 mm day −1 but, generally, the equation seems to persistently underestimate
    ETr-lys throughout all estimates. Underestimation or overestimation of ETr-lys
    by the different variants of the Penman–Monteith equation due to low and high
    evaporative demands has been reported in earlier studies, and it was attributed
    to the difference in local climatic conditions and lysimetric measurement errors.
    Due to the semi-arid climate and relatively large wind speeds at Bushland [33],
    the slight deviations between ETrs and ETr-lys could be attributed to the advective
    transport that adds energy, thus increasing the ETr-lys in the reference alfalfa
    fields, in agreement with Ref. [55]. Such underestimations were reported from
    other highly advective environments [56]. Figure 6. Relationship between ASCE,
    machine learning algorithms, and ETr-lys at daily timescale for days when reference
    conditions were met. (a) GA-ELM-DT3, (b) ASCE-PM, (c) GA-ANN-DT4, (d) GA-ELM-DT6.

    indicators for machine learning ETr estimations at a daily timescale (fit linear
    equations representing the slope and intercept for each respective model are presented
    in italics). Comparison of the ETr from ML models with the ETr-lys shows that
    the underestimation was reduced, most significantly for GA-ELM, when applied to
    DT3 (slope = 0.97, MBE = −0.25) and DT6 (slope = 0.95, MBE = −0.19) (Figure 6a,d).
    It also demonstrates that GA-ELM can reduce the positive offset and slope, similar
    to Refs. [22,57], who found ELM to be suitable for reference evapotranspiration
    estimation. The best-performing model (GA-ANN-DT4, considering R2) had a smaller
    slope (0.90), although it reduced underestimation (MBE = −0.15). According to
    RMSE values shown in Table 3, ASCE-PM performed better than both the SVR and RF
    models for the majority of the datasets. These models performed close to the ASCE-PM
    with RMSE values of 0.98 and 0.93 for the GA-SVR and GA-RF models, respectively,
    for the DT8. However, the high positive offsets, 0.81 and 0.46 for the GA-SVR
    and GA-RF, respectively, indicate the poor performance of the models as compared
    to that of ASCE-PM (0.30). The statistical parameters shown in Table 3 give a
    clear idea about the interaction of the meteorological variables used in estimating
    ETr-lys across the different models. Based on these results, u2 was involved in
    all the best-performing datasets (DT3, DT4, and DT6); therefore, it can be concluded
    that it is one of the most relevant estimators for daily ETr-lys in this region
    and that accurate estimates of ETr-lys might not be achieved without the inclusion
    of this parameter. Also, the inclusion of VPD and Rs/Rso in DT3 led to improved
    slope and offset values compared to those of DT4 for GA-ELM, GA-ANN, and GA-SVR.
    In DT6, when Rn was excluded from the inputs, it did not affect the performance
    of the ML models. This result presents an opportunity for estimating ETr-lys without
    the long Rn calculations and could suggest that in dry and advective environments,
    radiation components might primarily contribute to pressure deficit through temperature
    changes, but aerodynamic components play a major role in driving evapotranspiration.
    This might affirm the relevancy of the inclusion of aerodynamic components in
    ML models in advective environments for daily ETr-lys calculations. Values of
    RMSE and MAE for GA-ELM-DT4 and GA-ELM-DT5 confirm that the inclusion of ∆, VPD,
    and Rs/Rso in DT5 decreased the model accuracy from a MAE of 0.56 mm/day and RMSE
    of 0.85 mm/day to a MAE of 0.90 mm/day and RMSE of 1.20 mm/day (Table 3). Removing
    ∆ in GA-ELM-DT3 and replacing it with Tmean and Rn reduced the MAE from 0.90 mm/day
    to 0.61 mm/day. A similar trend is observed in all the datasets where it was included
    (DT1, DT2). The effect of the inclusion of Rs/Rso (an indication of cloudiness)
    can also be assessed by looking at the values of MAE and RMSE for DT7 and DT8
    in Table 3. It is evident that across all models, the MAE and RMSE for DT7 ranged
    from 0.79 mm/day to 0.86 mm/day and from 0.95 mm/day to 1.21 mm/day, respectively,
    which are larger than the range for DT8 (0.68 mm/day–0.89 mm/day and 0.92 mm/day–0.98
    mm/day, respectively). Therefore, this suggests that ∆ and Rs/Rso might not be
    suitable for daily ETr-lys estimation in the advective environment tested. It
    is observed from Table 3 that replacing the maximums and minimums of relative
    humidity and temperature with their mean values for DT6 and DT7 slightly improved
    the RMSE values. However, when the Rs/Rso was excluded as shown for DT8, the RMSE
    and MAE were improved. This means Rs/Rso might not be suitable as a direct input
    into ML models for daily ETr estimation for the conditions of this study. MAE
    and RMSE values for DT4 and DT8 indicate that Rn and Rs might have a similar effect
    on the daily ETr-lys estimation and can be used interchangeably. Hence, precautions
    should be taken into consideration for deploying ML models in locations such as
    the Bushland, TX station when records of both Rn and Rs are missing. Among all
    the ML models tested, GA-ANN subjected to DT4 produced the largest R2 value (0.91),
    while the GA-ELM applied to DT8 produced the slope closest to unity and the smallest
    offset. Figure 7a,c,d also reveals that residuals for the GA-ELM and GA-ANN were
    persistently close to the zero line, which indicates that these models can reduce
    underestimation or overestimation of ETr-lys. Overall, the results indicated that
    on a daily timescale, ML models can give better estimates of ETr-lys than the
    ASCE-PM under the tested conditions, and we can learn some things about the importance
    of the various input parameters on the accuracy of the equations. This is important
    since weather data are normally collected with missing data, which is sometimes
    estimated or imputed [58]. Therefore, the relevance of the parameters indicates
    how much effort should be expended to replace or estimate missing data based on
    the prevailing local conditions. For instance, if accurate estimates of ETr-lys
    can be obtained without a particular parameter, no effort would be required to
    impute its missing values. 3.2. Comparison of the Estimation Accuracy of the ASCE-PM
    and Machine Learning Models at Hourly and Quarter-Hourly Timescale Table 4 gives
    the performance of the ML models across the different datasets for hourly and
    quarter-hourly timescales. Residual plots for the best-performing ML models and
    ASCE-PM are shown in Figure 8. Residuals for all ML models in Figure 8a,c,d indicate
    more points close to the zero line as compared to the ASCE-PM plot (Figure 8b).
    The errors appear to increase at about 0.6 mm/h. A similar trend is observed in
    Figure 9b, where the slope of the straight line coincides sensibly with the bisector
    up to about 0.6 mm/h, indicating the method’s success for that set of values.
    However, the method slightly underestimates ETr-lys above this value, although
    the overall MBE was calculated as −0.008 mm/h. Our results agree with the findings
    of other previous studies [56]. In contrast, some studies have had results slightly
    different from ours, where grass reference (ETr) was evaluated and compared with
    measurements from a lysimeter [59]. In that paper, the ASCE-PM overestimated lysimeter
    measurements by 4% for values above 0.45 mm/h. The behavior of the ASCE-PM might
    vary depending on the reference crop considered and the study site [36]. Figure

    indicators for machine learning ETr-lys estimations at the hourly and quarter-hourly
    timescales (fit linear equations representing the slope and intercept for each
    respective model are presented in italics). For the ML models GA-ELM-DT2, GA-ELM-DT3,
    and GA-ELM-DT7, the residuals were close to zero and slopes (Figure 9a,c,d) close
    to unity, indicating that the models performed quite well. It can be perceived
    from Table 4 that these models performed better than the ASCE-PM, considering
    all statistical parameters. The MAE and RMSE for ASCE were 0.36 and 0.24, respectively,
    lower than values for DT7, where all models performed better than the ASCE, with
    ranges for MAE and RMSE being 0.04 mm/h–0.05 mm/h and 0.06–0.07 mm/h, respectively.
    Considering the effect of the different variables on the model’s performance,
    results for DT4 show that excluding ∆, VPD, and Rs/Rso led to a reduction in the
    slope. However, when the data for the three variables were present in DT5 and
    data for Rn and Tmean were absent, the slopes were still reduced across all models.
    This indicates that Tmean and Rn could be major contributing factors as direct
    inputs for hourly ETr estimation using ML models. The contribution of Rn to hourly
    ETr-lys estimation can be further assessed by looking at the results for DT4 and
    DT7. The consistent MAE, RMSE, and slope values for all the evaluated models indicate
    that Rs and Rn can be used interchangeably as direct inputs to the ML models.
    In fact, when data for both variables were absent in DT5, the worst estimates
    were observed from the ML models. The performance of ML models on DT4 is encouraging
    and indicates a potential for estimating hourly ETr with directly sensed meteorological
    data. It can be perceived from both Figure 10a and Figure 11a that the ASCE-PM
    produced biased estimates at the quarter-hourly timescale (slope of 0.93, MBE
    = −0.0012 mm/h), tending to underestimate ETr-lys. On the other hand, the residuals
    for the best-performing models (Figure 10b,c) appear to be close to the zero line,
    and the R2 values in both cases (Figure 11b,c) are larger than that for the ASCE-PM
    (Figure 11b). Figure 10. Residual plots for ASCE and machine learning algorithms

    11. Relationship between ASCE, machine learning algorithms and ETr-lys at quarter-hourly
    timescale. (a) ASCE-PM, (b) GA-ELM-DT2, (c) GA-ELM-DT7. An improved performance
    can be observed from the best-performing ML models (GA-ELM-DT2, GA-ELM-DT7) with
    residuals (Figure 10b,c) close to the zero line and slopes (Figure 11b,c) close
    to unity. Additionally, all the other models tested (GA-SVR, GA-RF) performed
    better than ASCE-PM, as shown by the statistical parameters in Table 4. The MAE
    and RMSE for ASCE were 0.36 and 0.24, respectively, higher than values for all
    models and across all datasets that ranged from 0.01 to 0.02 mm/h and from 0.02
    to 0.03 mm/h, respectively. The superiority of ML models for quarter-hourly ETr-lys
    estimation provides an opportunity to use more high temporal resolution data for
    ETr-lys estimation. Some relevant findings have emerged from the results shown
    above. The adopted machine learning algorithms are a powerful tool for the prediction
    of reference evapotranspiration at lower timescales. Starting from the parameters
    that are directly sensed, as in DT8, to a combination with parameters calculated
    from them, as in DT2, and other datasets, it is possible to obtain prediction
    models characterized by very high accuracy. Mean temperature, as well as net solar
    radiation, play a significant role in influencing the various processes of the
    hydrological cycle. These parameters appear to be relevant for modeling at hourly
    or quarter-hourly timescales; therefore, a data-driven model that considers the
    above two factors most likely leads to satisfactory results. However, in the absence
    of net radiation measurements or in case the resources for its long calculations
    are limiting, it is still possible to build a reliable prediction model of ETr-lys
    with the aid of the machine learning algorithms, based only on solar radiation,
    mean temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity data. This would especially
    be desirable for remote sensing applications in data-scarce environments. The
    use of climatic data that are not very recent may appear to be a limitation of
    this study. However, the ability to interpret patterns in past climatic data will
    be crucial to climatic forecasting, and ML models have been deemed necessary.
    3.3. Transferability of the Developed Machine Learning Models Developing models
    for reference evapotranspiration estimation requires an understanding of how the
    different features contribute to the model estimations. This is necessary, especially
    for data-scarce environments, where the most dominant variables can be utilized
    to provide real-time ETr-lys estimates through ML algorithms. Our investigation
    of the different parameter combinations and contributions to ETr-lys estimation
    at different timescales indicated that ML models can perform better than ASCE-PM
    while utilizing fewer data inputs to achieve reasonable results. If the estimated
    ETr-lys values are acceptable representations of ETrs, then the improved accuracy
    on shorter timescales is especially relevant for remote sensing of ET since daily
    or weekly ET is extrapolated from ETrs estimates from the small time window that
    the images were taken, and thus, improved estimates on these shorter timescales
    could improve the overall accuracy of these methods. However, the use of the models
    from this study could be limited to the study region and to places that have similar
    climatic conditions. Areas with similar climatic conditions might experience similar
    patterns of the meteorological parameters, producing similar variability as our
    results. Still, it is necessary to create similar or novel ML models using different
    parameter combinations to investigate their performance in other regions. Moreover,
    based on the target application, the timescale of the required data might be different
    from region to region. The models developed here showed the potential of capturing
    variability even at small timescales (quarter-hourly), which is a common temporal
    resolution for weather data collection in many regions. The necessity to test
    different models at different timescales is paramount for a given region. In fact,
    different regions have been found to suit different empirical models for ETr computation,
    primarily based on local climatic conditions. In the case that the models of the
    current study are transferred to other regions, proper training of the models
    is required as well as paying extra attention to the underfitting and overfitting
    phenomena commonly experienced during ML model training. Future developments of
    this study will concern coupling the ML models, surface energy balance models,
    and satellite imagery to improve the estimation of ETr. Increasing the spatial
    scale of ETr estimation would be necessary to enhance water management and planning.
    4. Conclusions Machine learning models (GA-ELM, GA-SVR, GA-RF, and GA-ANN) were
    investigated in modeling lysimeter-measured reference evapotranspiration (ETr-lys)
    at daily, hourly, and quarter-hourly timescales using various input combinations
    of radiation and aerodynamic components for a highly advective environment. The
    results were compared with those of the standardized Penman–Monteith Equation
    (ASCE-PM). Based on the comparison results, it was observed that machine learning
    models yielded more accurate ETr-lys estimates compared to ASCE-PM across all
    timescales. ASCE-PM consistently underestimated ETr-lys at all timescales. Radiation
    components, as well as a combination of radiation and aerodynamic model inputs,
    demonstrated superior performance at the hourly and quarter-hourly timescales.
    Conversely, datasets primarily characterized by aerodynamic components performed
    better at the daily timescale. The results indicate that machine learning models
    can effectively replace ASCE-PM for ETr-lys estimation in highly advective environments.
    Moreover, different climatic variables exert varying influence on model performance
    at a given timescale based on local weather conditions. This approach can be integrated
    to enhance the accuracy of ETr-lys estimation at hourly or quarter-hourly timescales,
    which is crucial for precise geospatial ET estimation using land surface energy
    balance models. Additionally, the same approach could be applied in similar advective
    environments to evaluate the impact of meteorological parameters on ETr estimation.
    This is imperative for ensuring precise ETr estimation for agricultural water
    management. Author Contributions Conceptualization, S.K., R.T.P. and B.M.; methodology,

  description: From the perspective of sustainable development in irrigation areas,
    imperfect constraints, which have negatively impacted previous agricultural planting
    structure optimization models, tend to produce unreasonable optimization results.
    Thus, in this paper, attempts are made to incorporate the resilience of water
    resource systems into the constraint set and explore the optimal layout of agricultural
    planting structures in irrigation areas. We selected 12 sample irrigation areas
    in Heilongjiang Province, China, including Chahayang, Fuyu, and Tailai, as the
    research areas and considered their actual situations. Then, we established a
    multiobjective optimization model for an agricultural planting structure with
    rice, soybean, and corn planting areas as decision variables; socioeconomic benefits,
    agricultural production benefits, ecological benefits, and water resource benefits
    as objective functions; and water resource system resilience and net crop output
    value and other factors as constraints. Fifteen scenarios were assessed through
    the combination of objective functions, and the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm
    III (NSGA-III) was used to optimize and analyze the agricultural planting structure
    of typical irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province and to determine the optimal
    planting plan. The research results found that the function values adjusted by
    planting area have significantly improved compared to those before optimization.
    The adjustment trend of agricultural planting area is to increase the planting
    area of rice and soybean and reduce the planting area of corn. The introduction
    of constraints on water resource system resilience ensures that other benefits

    path of embedding the resilience of water resource systems. • Seeking the optimal
    adjustment plan for agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas based
    on the NSGA-III algorithm. • Analyzing the constraint effect of water resource
    system resilience on the optimization of agricultural planting structure. Abstract
    From the perspective of sustainable development in irrigation areas, imperfect
    constraints, which have negatively impacted previous agricultural planting structure
    optimization models, tend to produce unreasonable optimization results. Thus,
    in this paper, attempts are made to incorporate the resilience of water resource
    systems into the constraint set and explore the optimal layout of agricultural
    planting structures in irrigation areas. We selected 12 sample irrigation areas
    in Heilongjiang Province, China, including Chahayang, Fuyu, and Tailai, as the
    research areas and considered their actual situations. Then, we established a
    multiobjective optimization model for an agricultural planting structure with
    rice, soybean, and corn planting areas as decision variables; socioeconomic benefits,
    agricultural production benefits, ecological benefits, and water resource benefits
    as objective functions; and water resource system resilience and net crop output
    value and other factors as constraints. Fifteen scenarios were assessed through
    the combination of objective functions, and the nondominated sorting genetic algorithm
    III (NSGA-III) was used to optimize and analyze the agricultural planting structure
    of typical irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province and to determine the optimal
    planting plan. The research results found that the function values adjusted by
    planting area have significantly improved compared to those before optimization.
    The adjustment trend of agricultural planting area is to increase the planting
    area of rice and soybean and reduce the planting area of corn. The introduction
    of constraints on water resource system resilience ensures that other benefits
    remain basically unchanged; thus, the water resource objective function is significantly
    better with resilience constraints than without them. Therefore, water resource
    system resilience can act as an effective constraint; this finding enriches and
    expands the theoretical and methodological system for optimizing the management
    of agricultural planting structures in irrigation areas and thus provides important
    technological support for ensuring regional food security, ecological security,
    and water security, which has substantial practical significance. Previous article

    coupling coordinationIrrigated area 1. Introduction Agriculture, the foundation
    of the national economy, plays a crucial role in the healthy development of regional
    economies (Byerlee et al., 2009; Dorosh and Thurlow, 2018). However, due to people''s
    excessive pursuit of grain yield and nonstandard agricultural production management,
    environmental and resource issues related to agricultural ecology and water resources
    are becoming increasingly serious (Garnett, 2013; Misra, 2013). A reasonable agricultural
    planting structure not only promotes local economic development but also reduces
    pollution and harm to the natural environment, promoting green and sustainable
    development of the agricultural economy. Optimization of the agricultural planting
    structure is a hot research topic in the field of agriculture today. The classical
    British economist Ricardo D proposed the theoretical basis of regional agricultural
    planting structure optimization, the comparative advantage theory, as early as
    1817 (Watson, 2017), and subsequent research has continuously extended and developed
    on this theoretical basis. On the premise of ensuring normal grain growing operations,
    the optimization of agricultural planting structures in irrigation areas can fully
    leverage the resource advantages of the research area, develop regional planting
    characteristics according to local conditions, achieve maximum benefits and match
    agricultural modernization construction, which is of great significance (Li et
    al., 2020d). Relevant research (Garg and Dadhich, 2014; Adeyemo and Otieno, 2010;
    Mahmoodi-Eshkaftaki and Rafiee, 2020) focuses on the optimization and adjustment
    of agricultural planting structures in irrigation areas through the transformation
    of irrigation models; the economic benefits brought by adjustments to planting
    structure; and the growth environment and water requirements required by the crops
    themselves. Few scholars have optimized the sustainable development of water resources
    in irrigation areas. Therefore, to address challenges to the sustainable development
    of water resources in irrigation areas, which are caused by insufficient agricultural
    irrigation water, imperfect irrigation water management, and low irrigation water
    efficiency (Li et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020e), the concept of adjusting agricultural
    planting structure from the perspective of water resource resilience constraints
    is introduced. This concept, as part of the study of sustainable development issues
    in irrigation areas, can help to effectively alleviate the pressure on agricultural
    development and explore new paths for sustainable development in these areas.
    In the modeling of agricultural planting structure optimization and adjustment,
    the setting of constraint conditions is key to ensuring the rationality and reliability
    of the optimization results. Existing research mostly selects economic, ecological,
    social and other related constraint conditions (Li et al., 2020b; Notte et al.,
    2020; Yu et al., 2021). However, with the simultaneous growth of the agricultural
    production level and water resource demand, the contradiction between water resource
    supply and demand is evident. The optimization of agricultural planting structure
    can be explored from the perspective of sustainable development of water resources
    to effectively improve the resource utilization rate and address the contradiction
    between regional water resource shortages and agricultural production. In this
    field of research, Liu et al. (2021) organized and summarized the existing viewpoints
    on the resilience of water resource systems; furthermore, they proposed the connotation
    and measurement methods of the resilience of water resource systems in irrigation
    areas based on the agricultural characteristics of irrigation areas. However,
    the research results were limited to exploring the feasibility and spatiotemporal
    characteristics analysis of the resilience measurement and did not effectively
    establish a connection with agricultural planting structures. Therefore, based
    on these research results, water resource system resilience constraints are adopted
    to further explore the relationship between water resource system resilience and
    agricultural planting structure; to extend the research field of water resource
    system resilience; to enrich the research content of water resource system resilience
    in irrigation areas; and to provide a new path for the sustainable development
    of regional agriculture and water resources. In the process of optimizing agricultural
    planting, it is necessary to comprehensively consider multiple aspects, such as
    water resource systems, agricultural systems, socioeconomic systems, ecosystems,
    and technological management systems, which have typical multiobjective problem
    characteristics. The NSGA-III proposed by Deb and Jain (2013) has strong convergence
    ability in multiobjective optimization problems and can efficiently obtain the
    number of Pareto-optimal solutions in constrained multiobjective optimization
    problems. Compared to traditional multiobjective algorithms such as multiobjective
    particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) and decomposition-based multiobjective algorithms
    (MOEAD), it is not prone to problems such as local optima and poor robustness
    (Luo et al., 2018; Britto and Pozo, 2014). The NSGA III algorithm has advantages
    in solving diverse solutions, strong stability, and high-dimensional multiobjective
    optimization (Sun et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2019). Therefore, in this study,
    the NSGA-III algorithm is selected for multiobjective optimization research. The
    resilience constraint of water resource systems is then introduced into the optimization
    analysis of agricultural planting structures in irrigation areas, and the NSGA-III
    model is applied to solve it. The aim is to further strengthen the scientific
    nature of the optimization analysis of agricultural planting structure in irrigation
    areas, improve the connection between regional sustainable development and agricultural
    planting structure optimization, and enhance the pertinence of regulatory plans.
    The research objectives are as follows: (1) To explore the feasibility and implementation
    path of embedding the resilience of water resource systems into the constraint
    set of agricultural planting structure optimization models in irrigation areas;
    (2) To seek the optimal adjustment plan for agricultural planting structure in
    irrigation areas based on the NSGA-III algorithm; (3) To analyze the constraint
    effect of water resource system resilience on the optimization of agricultural
    planting structure. 2. Materials and methodology 2.1. Research area Heilongjiang
    Province, located in northeastern China, is one of the three largest black soil
    regions in the world, with four water systems: Heilongjiang, Wusuli River, Songhua
    River and Suifen River. The abundant water and soil resources mean that Heilongjiang
    Province''s grain production occupies a special position in China, with the Sanjiang
    Plain and Songnen Plain being important strategic bases for ensuring national
    food security and agricultural product supply. However, the one-sided pursuit
    of increasing grain production, the imbalanced use of water and fertilization
    patterns, which results in groundwater overexploitation and water environment
    degradation, and the emphasis on planting patterns of high economic efficiency
    crops, which are not based on regional resource allocation, have severely affected
    the water security, food security, and ecological security of regional agriculture
    (Qi et al., 2018; Li et al., 2020c; Zhang et al., 2019b; Faiz et al., 2020). China
    attaches great importance to the food security and sustainable development of
    the two major plains and has successively proposed the overall plan for the comprehensive
    reform of modern agriculture in the “Two Great Plains” of Heilongjiang Province,
    as well as guiding opinions on the adjustment of corn structure in the “Sickle
    Bend” area. Under the constraint of water resource system resilience, the optimization
    and adjustment of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas is crucial
    for ensuring food production and output value in the two major plains, while effective
    assistance for the sustainable development of regional agriculture must still
    be provided. Based on the representativeness and data completeness of the Sanjiang
    Plain and Songnen Plain irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province, the agricultural
    planting structure optimization of the irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province
    was studied by taking four irrigation areas in the Songnen Plain, namely, Chahayang,
    Fuyu, Tailai and Yi''an, and eight irrigation areas in the Sanjiang Plain, namely,
    Qixing, Erdaohe, Daxing, Jiangchuan, Wutong River, Xingkai Lake, Suibin and 859,
    as sample irrigation areas. The specific locations of the 12 irrigation areas
    are shown in Fig. 1. Download : Download high-res image (543KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 1. Geographical location of the sample irrigation area. 2.2.
    Data sources Materials were collected from the Statistical Yearbook of Heilongjiang
    Reclamation Area (2008–2017), Meteorological Data of Heilongjiang Reclamation
    Area (2008–2017), Comprehensive Annual Report of Water Resources of Qiqihar Branch
    (2008–2017), Comprehensive Annual Report of Water Resources of Jiansanjiang Branch
    (2008–2017) and the multiobjective model construction data of rice, soybean, and
    corn planting areas corresponding to 12 irrigation areas including Chahayang Irrigation
    District from 2007 to 2016, as well as from evaluation index data of natural,
    economic, ecological, and social development. In addition, due to the uncertainty
    of the input parameters in a long time series and the output result being the
    optimal planting pattern obtained under certain objective functions and constraint
    conditions, various indicators from 2016 were used as reference values, and the
    constraint values were determined based on the 10-year data from 2007 to 2016
    for subsequent research on optimizing and adjusting the agricultural planting
    structure in irrigation areas. 2.3. Construction of the multiobjective optimization
    model 2.3.1. Decision variables Heilongjiang Province grows mainly food crops,
    oil crops, hemp, medicinal herbs, fruits and vegetables, among which grains and
    legumes are the main crops. Grain is mainly composed of rice, wheat, and corn,
    while legumes are mainly composed of soybeans. In addition, Heilongjiang Province
    has planted crops such as sugar beets, tobacco leaves, medicinal herbs, forage
    grass, and green fodder. The crop planting proportion of 12 sample irrigation
    areas in Heilongjiang Province from 2007 to 2016 was calculated, as shown in Fig.

    Fig. 2. The planting area of three crops and the proportion of grain crop planting
    area to the total planting area in the sample irrigation area. Note: SR: rice
    planting area; SS: soybean planting area; SC: corn planting area; SG: planting
    area of grain crops; SE: planting area of crops other than grain crops; and ST:
    total planting area. Fig. 2 shows that the planting of grain crops is dominant,
    with the planting area of grain crops accounting for over 90% of the total planting
    area over the past decade. The minimum planting area reached 92.73% in 2007; it
    reached over 99% annually in 2014, 2015, and 2016. For food crops, the planting
    areas of rice, soybeans, and corn dominate. In the past decade, the total planting
    area of the three crops accounted for over 95% of the total planting area of grain
    crops, with the lowest value reaching 96.49% in 2008 and even exceeding 99% from
    2010 to 2016. This proves that except for the three crops of rice, soybeans, and
    corn, there are almost no other grain crops planted in the 12 sample irrigation
    areas in Heilongjiang Province. Therefore, in this study, the planting areas of
    rice, soybean, and corn are used as decision variables to explore the optimization
    of agricultural planting structure under the constraint of water resource system
    resilience. 2.3.2. Objective function At present, research on the optimization
    of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas and the resilience of water
    resource systems in irrigation areas is mainly analyzed from the perspectives
    of water resource systems, agricultural systems, ecological environment systems,
    and socioeconomic systems. Therefore, for the selection of objective functions
    for the optimization of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas under
    the constraint of water resource system resilience, fertilizer application amount,
    net crop output value, total crop yield, and irrigation water consumption are
    proposed to characterize ecological environmental benefits, social and economic
    benefits, agricultural production benefits, and water resource benefits, respectively.
    Based on these four aspects, the optimization of agricultural planting structure
    is comprehensively considered (Wang et al., 2020; Chen, 2018; Chen, 2008). However,
    there is a contradictory and competitive relationship between various benefits,
    and during the mediation process, there is often a phenomenon where one aspect
    of the benefits improves while the other worsens. To better optimize the agricultural
    planting structure in irrigation areas of Heilongjiang Province, the objective
    functions of minimizing fertilizer application, maximizing net crop output, maximizing
    total crop yield, and minimizing irrigation water consumption are adopted. (1)
    Ecological benefit objective function (1) In the formula, yE is the total amount
    of fertilizer applied (kg); mi is the fertilizer application rate per unit area
    for the i-th crop, where the fertilizer application rate per unit area for rice
    is m1 = 339.45 kg/hm2, the fertilizer application rate per unit area for corn
    is m2 = 372.3 kg/hm2, and the fertilizer application rate per unit area for soybean
    is m3 = 128.1 kg/hm2 (Liu and Lian, 2019). xi is the optimal planting area (hm2)
    for the i-th crop. (2) Socioeconomic benefit objective function (2) In the formula,
    yS is the net output value of crops (yuan); bi is the unit price of the i-th crop
    (yuan/kg); ci is the unit yield of the i-th crop (kg/hm2); di is the unit area
    cost of the i-th crop (yuan/hm2); and xi is the optimal planting area (hm2) for
    the i-th crop. (3) Agricultural production efficiency objective function (3) In
    the formula, yA is the total crop yield (kg); ci is the unit yield of the i-th
    crop (kg/hm2); and xi is the optimal planting area (hm2) for the i-th crop. (4)
    Water resource efficiency objective function (4) (5) In the formula, yW is the
    total amount of irrigation water (m3); wi is the gross irrigation quota of the
    i-th crop (m3/hm2); xi is the optimal planting area for the i-th crop (hm2); wy
    is the net irrigation quota of the i-th crop (m3/hm2); and n is the effective
    utilization coefficient of irrigation water. Based on the objective functions
    of ecological benefits, socioeconomic benefits, agricultural production benefits,
    and water resource benefits mentioned above, a combination function of agricultural
    planting structure suitable for 12 sample irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province
    is established. (6) 2.3.3. Constraint condition To construct an optimization model
    for agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas under resilience constraints,
    based on the establishment of objective functions, suitable constraint conditions
    should be developed according to local specific situations. In addition to resilience
    constraints, other constraints must be established in terms of ecological benefits,
    socioeconomic benefits, agricultural production benefits, and water resource benefits.
    Based on the objective function established in the previous section, the optimization
    of agricultural planting structure must be constrained in terms of fertilizer
    application per unit area, net crop output value, total crop yield, irrigation
    water consumption, and cultivated land area. The specific constraint expressions
    are as follows: (1) Constraints on fertilizer application rate (7) In the formula,
    yi is the amount of fertilizer applied to the i-th crop (kg); xi is the optimal
    planting area for the i-th crop (hm2); A = 420 kg/hm2 is the constraint value
    of fertilizer application per unit area (Liu and Lian, 2019); yj is the amount
    of fertilizer applied in the j-th irrigation area (kg); and xj is the optimal
    planting area (hm2) for the j-th irrigation area. (2) Constraints on net output
    value of crops (8) In the formula, bi is the unit price of the i-th crop (yuan/kg);
    ci is the unit yield of the i-th crop (kg/hm2); di is the unit area cost of the
    i-th crop (yuan/hm2); xi is the optimal planting area for the i-th crop (hm2);
    and B is the total net output value of crops (yuan). (3) Constraints on total
    crop demand (9) In the formula, ci is the unit yield of the i-th crop (kg/hm2);
    xi is the optimal planting area for the i-th crop (hm2); and C is the total demand
    for crops (kg). (4) Constraints on water consumption for crop irrigation (10)
    In the formula, wi is the gross irrigation quota of the i-th crop (m3/hm2); xi
    is the optimal planting area for the i-th crop (hm2); and D is the total amount
    of irrigation water used for crops. (5) Constraints on cultivated land area (11)
    In the formula, xij is the optimal planting area (hm2) for the j-th type of crop
    in the i-th irrigation area; e is the multiple cropping index; and ki is the total
    cultivated area of the i-th crop (hm2). (6) Constraints on water resource system
    resilience The resilience of water resource systems generally refers to the ability
    of the water resource system to gradually recover to structural stability, resource
    supply, and normal ecological environment regulation under the joint action of
    its own and external forces when the system structure and function undergo a certain
    degree of change in response to external factors such as natural, ecological and
    economic interference. The resilience of the water resource system in the irrigation
    area (RWRSIA) is related to the structure, function, and complexity of the system
    itself, as well as to external stress. For example, if the canal system has a
    high anti-seepage rate, good vegetation conditions, and social and economic prosperity,
    then people''s lives are relatively abundant, water resource utilization is reasonable,
    and the resilience of the water resource system is high. In the opposite situation,
    the resilience of water resource systems is low. The optimization of agricultural
    planting structure in irrigation areas, such as the evaluation of the resilience
    of water resource systems in irrigation areas, is closely related to water resource
    systems, socioeconomic systems, ecological environment systems, and agricultural
    systems. Although the evaluation indicators for RWRSIA do not directly include
    the planting area of three crops, the adjustment of planting structure will cause
    dynamic changes in key driving factors for the evaluation of RWRSIA, such as the
    planting ratio of high water-consuming crops, per capita arable land area, and
    effective utilization coefficient of irrigation water, thereby indirectly affecting
    the resilience index and level of the water resource system in irrigation areas.
    To ensure the sustainable development of regional water resources after the optimization
    and adjustment of the agricultural planting structure, a constraint on the resilience
    of the water resource system is set. Referring to Liu et al., 2021, the evaluation
    level of RWRSIA is determined to be level I as the optimal level and level IV
    as the worst level. Whether the restoration level of the water resource system
    is ≤ Level III is determined after the planting structure is optimized under the
    constraint of water resource system restoration. Namely, (12) Ⅲ In the formula,
    RWRSIA (A, B, C) represents the water resource system resilience of the irrigation
    area when the optimized rice planting area, soybean planting area, and corn planting
    area are A, B, and C, respectively; IGWO-SVM (A, B, C) is the result based on
    the IGWO-SVM mode rating; and IGWO-SVM (A, B, C) indicates that the evaluation
    results of the IGWO-SVM model in scenario i should all be ≤ Level III. Based on
    this, the resilience level constraints of the water resource system in the irrigation
    area are set and organically combined with the optimization of the agricultural
    planting structure. The specific constraints of the resilience level of the water
    resource system in the irrigation area on the planting structure are shown in
    Fig. 3. (7) Nonnegative constraint Download : Download high-res image (863KB)

    of the water resource system in irrigation areas. Note: Level I, II, III, and
    IV represent the resilience level of the water resource system. The planting area
    of each crop needs to meet nonnegative conditions: (13) In the formula, xi is
    the optimal planting area for the i-th crop (hm2). 2.4. Method for solving multiobjective
    optimization models 2.4.1. Pareto dominance relationship In minimizing multiobjective
    optimization problems, for m objective components , i = 1∼n, given any two decision
    variables , . If there is a need for , all have holds or exists i , such that
    is established. Then, it is called dominates . If there are no other decision
    variables that can dominate a decision variable, then the decision variable is
    called a nondominated solution, which is the Pareto optimal solution. However,
    for multiobjective problems, for a given set of optimal solutions, if the solutions
    in this set are mutually nondominant, i.e., the pairwise relationship is not dominant,
    then this solution set is called the Pareto solution set (Han et al., 2021). 2.4.2.
    NSGA-III algorithm The NSGA-III algorithm was initially improved by Deb and Jain
    on the basis of NSGA-II, using reference points instead of crowding to improve
    the selection mechanism. Compared to NSGA-II''s ranking based on the crowding
    degree, NSGA-III''s role in maintaining the population diversity ranking is more
    pronounced due to the introduction of reference points. Due to its advantages
    compared to other multiobjective optimization algorithms, especially its satisfactory
    results in various aspects compared to the MOEA/D method in the calculation process
    of up to 15 objectives, the NSGA-III algorithm was selected to solve the multiobjective
    problem. The specific implementation process of the algorithm is detailed in Deb
    and Jain (2013). 2.5. IGWO-SVM model The support vector machine (SVM) model was
    initially proposed by Vapnik et al. (1994). Due to its excellent performance in
    solving small sample, nonlinear, and high-dimensional problems, it has been widely
    applied by scholars from various countries in various fields (Li et al., 2020a;
    Wang et al., 2020). The main purpose of SVM is to build a classification hyperplane
    to distinguish different samples and maximize the classification interval. Specifically,
    the feature vector can be mapped from the low-dimensional space to the high-dimensional
    space through the kernel function to establish the discriminant function. The
    penalty parameter C and kernel function parameter σ have a great impact on the
    solution of the hyperplane. C represents the degree of punishment for exceeding
    the error range and is used to adjust the fit of the data. σ controls the radial
    action range of the kernel function. If its value is too small, it can easily
    cause overfitting, and if its value is too large, it can lead to a loss of learning
    ability. Therefore, the introduction of optimization algorithms for C and σ allows
    for parameter optimization. The gray wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithm was first
    proposed by Mirjalili et al. (2014) in 2014 in the article Gray Wolf Optimizer.
    This algorithm simulates the hierarchical system and hunting mechanism of gray
    wolves in nature. Due to its simple and efficient advantages, it has been widely
    used in various fields. However, the original GWO is prone to problems such as
    local optimization, low precision, and poor robustness for high-dimensional, multipeak
    function and multiobjective optimization problems. Deng S et al. (2019) proposed
    the differential evolution (DE)-GWO theory of combining the DE algorithm and the
    GWO algorithm to address GWO''s comparative disadvantages. After updating the
    position of the wolf pack, this approach performs DE operations and selects mutations,
    crossovers, and other operations to create better individuals for the next generation.
    DE-GWO helps the GWO algorithm to avoid falling into local extrema and improves
    its overall search capabilities. Compared to the SVM model optimized by algorithms
    such as gravity search, the IGWO-SVM model exhibits higher classification accuracy
    and mean square error. Therefore, the IGWO-SVM model was selected to evaluate
    RWRSIA in Heilongjiang Province. The specific implementation process of the algorithm
    is detailed in Liu et al., 2021). 2.6. Scenario building Scenario analysis is
    typically used for the judgment of regional development trends. The conventional
    scenario setting method constructs scenarios by using three different levels:
    high, medium, and low, or the presence or absence of a certain key variable. In
    the Opinions on Implementing the Rural Revitalization Strategy issued by the Central
    People''s Government of the People''s Republic of China (Yang et al., 2021), it
    is clearly noted that rural revitalization should adhere to the principle of adapting
    measures to local conditions and then gradually progressing. To balance the coordination
    of the objective function and the acceptability of farmers in the process of optimizing
    and adjusting the agricultural planting structure, the selection of planting area
    adjustment plans is tailored to local conditions. Based on the scenario setting
    method proposed by Li et al. (2020d), from the perspective of the objective function,
    different dimensional target combinations are set into 15 scenarios, as shown
    in Table 1. The 1st-4th scenarios in Table 1 are single-objective scenarios that
    can be directly solved through equations. The 5th-15th scenarios in Table 1 are
    multiobjective scenarios that need to be brought into the NSGA-III algorithm for

    3.1. Analysis of algorithm solving efficiency To fully validate the reliability
    of the NSGA III algorithm, in this study, Deb et al.''s comparative pattern was
    referenced and DTLZ1, DTLZ2, DTLZ3, and DTLZ4 were selected as test functions.
    The NSGA III algorithm, the multiobjective evolutionary algorithm based on decomposition
    penalty-based boundary intersection (MOEA/D-PBI), the multiobjective evolutionary
    algorithm based on decomposition-Tchebycheff approach (MOEA/D-TECH), and the DE
    algorithm based on decomposition differential algorithm (MOEA/D-DE) were used
    to analyze model efficiency by calculating the inverse generational distance (IGD).
    The IGD represents the minimum distance between each point on the real Pareto
    frontier and the set of individuals obtained by the algorithm and evaluates the
    convergence and distribution performance of the algorithm. The smaller the value
    is, the better the overall performance, including convergence and distribution.
    The calculation results are shown in Table 2. Table 2. IGD values of different
    test functions for each algorithm. Algorithm Test function NSGA-Ⅲ MOEA/D-PBI MOEA/D-TCH

    10−1 Table 2 shows that among the IGD values calculated by the four algorithms
    for the four test functions, only NSGA-III in DTLZ 2 has slightly better results
    than MOEA/D-PBI, though it has stronger results than the MOEA/D-TECH and MOEA/D-DE
    algorithms. The IGD results of NSGA-III are the minimum values in the remaining
    three test functions. Especially in DTLZ4, there is a significant difference in
    the calculation results. This result demonstrates the reliability of the model
    solution results obtained by the NSGA-III algorithm. 3.2. Benefit analysis of
    optimizing agricultural planting structure To obtain the optimal planting conditions
    and target benefits, the NSGA-III algorithm used population size pop_size = 100,
    cross parameter t1 = 20, mutation parameter t2 = 20, and number of iterations
    n_generations = 800 (Zhou et al., 2022) to calculate the single objective function
    values under the optimal planting conditions. Then, 11 sets of multiobjective
    combination forms were substituted into the NSGA-III algorithm. Finally, the objective
    function values under 15 different scenario modes were obtained; the results are
    shown in Fig. 5. Download : Download high-res image (839KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Optimal planting mode optimization benefits under different
    scenarios: (a) single objective; (b) dual objective; (c) three objectives and
    (d) four objectives. Fig. 5(a) shows that the single objective optimization corresponding
    to S1–S4, without considering other objective functions, significantly improves
    the corresponding objective function values after adjusting the planting area
    compared to before optimization, with a net output value increase of 11.08%, a
    total yield increase of 2.88%, a decrease in fertilizer application rate of 7.24%,
    and a decrease in irrigation water consumption of 30.77%. In the multiobjective
    situation, the values of different objective functions decrease compared to those
    in the single-objective situation. Fig. 5(b) shows that under the dual target
    scenario, the overall increase in net output value is 6.13%–9.43%, the overall
    increase in total yield is 1.57%–2.36%, the overall decrease in fertilizer application
    is 2.07%–6.47%, and the overall decrease in irrigation water consumption is 27.97%–29.37%.
    Fig. 5(c) shows that under the three target scenarios, the overall increase in
    net output value is 4.6%–8.49%, the overall increase in total yield is 0.79%–1.57%,
    the overall decrease in fertilizer application is 2.42%–4.96%, and the overall
    decrease in irrigation water consumption is 26.92%–28.67%. Fig. 5(b) and (c) show
    that S5, S11, and S12 are scenarios that consider both net output value and total
    yield objective functions. Among the three scenarios, the social benefit objective
    function is slightly larger than its combination with other objective functions,
    and the agricultural production benefit objective function is slightly larger
    than its combination with other objective functions. S7, S12, and S14 are scenarios
    that consider both net output value and irrigation water consumption, and the
    resulting social benefit objective function values are slightly smaller than their
    combined form with other objective functions. Rice can bring significant economic
    benefits due to its high economic efficiency but has far greater water needs compared
    to corn and soybeans; thus, Heilongjiang Province, which is short of water resources,
    needs to limit increases in rice area to some extent. S8, S11, and S13 are scenarios
    that simultaneously consider the two objective functions of total yield and fertilizer
    application. Among the three scenarios, the value of the agricultural production
    efficiency function is slightly smaller than its combination with other objective
    functions. Similarly, from the perspective of ecological benefits, when considering
    both the fertilizer application and total yield objective functions, the value
    of the ecological efficiency function is also slightly smaller. As the amount
    of fertilizer applied increases, the crop yield increases. Excessive application
    of fertilizer not only limits crop growth but also reduces fertilizer utilization
    efficiency, leading to a series of environmental problems, such as increased greenhouse
    gas emissions and water resource pollution. From the perspective of water resource
    efficiency, when irrigation water consumption is arbitrarily combined with three
    objective functions, the objective function values have no obvious characteristics.
    Fig. 5(d) shows that under the four target scenarios, the overall increase in
    net output value is 6.13%, the overall increase in total yield is 1.31%, the overall
    decrease in fertilizer application is 2.42%, and the overall decrease in irrigation
    water consumption is 29.02%. When considering all objectives comprehensively,
    due to the competitive relationship between them, their benefit values do not
    reach the optimal effect. 3.3. Analysis of planting area adjustment in different
    scenarios Since it is not suitable for different regions to adjust the corresponding
    planting structure after considering all objectives, the data of 15 scenarios
    are substituted into the NSGA-III algorithm for analysis, and suitable schemes
    are selected according to local conditions. The results of the optimal scheme
    of agricultural planting structure under different scenarios are shown in Table
    3. Notably, since multiobjective problems cannot obtain unique solutions, there
    may be multiple sets of solutions on the Pareto front. Therefore, in response
    to the current planting situation in Heilongjiang Province, under the premise
    of ensuring that the objective function value is the Pareto-optimal solution,
    the group with relatively small changes in planting area is selected. Combined
    with the ecological environment protection policies in Heilongjiang Province,
    the group with the highest ecological benefits was selected when the changes in
    planting area were generally similar. Table 3. Optimal plan for agricultural planting
    structure under different scenarios (Unit: hm2). Scenario Existing planting situation

    S14 371,286 26,024 38,593 S15 369,073 31,726 35,103 Table 3 shows that among the
    15 scenarios, S3, S4, S7, S9, and S10 reduce the rice planting area; S7, S11,
    and S14 reduce the soybean planting area; and S7 increases the corn planting area.
    The optimization trend of the agricultural planting structure in Heilongjiang
    Province is to increase the planting area of rice and soybeans and reduce the
    planting area of corn. From the perspective of rice, the irrigation water consumption
    target has a significant inhibitory effect on the planting area, but when comprehensively
    considered, its inhibitory effect is weakened to a certain extent, which conforms
    to the changing pattern. When irrigation water consumption has an inhibitory effect
    on rice, multiple types of corn can be selected to compensate for economic benefits.
    When it does not produce inhibitory effects, multiple types of rice can continue
    to maintain economic benefits. If we consider the total yield objective function
    or the fertilizer application objective function again, we can consider adjusting
    the planting ratio of rice and soybean appropriately to achieve optimal treatment
    for multiple objectives in the region. To more intuitively demonstrate the changes
    in planting area before and after multiobjective optimization, 15 scenarios were
    compared with existing planting situations to obtain the optimal crop area changes
    under different scenarios. The results are shown in Fig. 6. Download : Download
    high-res image (296KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 6. Changes in
    crop area under the optimal planting mode in different scenarios. Fig. 6 shows
    that S9 has the highest changes in total area, rice area, and corn area. S10 has
    the smallest changes in total area and corn area. The smallest change in rice
    area is in S7, while the largest and smallest changes in soybean area are in S6
    and S3, respectively. Because the main planting area in Heilongjiang Province
    is rice, 8 of 12 irrigation areas are located in the Sanjiang Plain, where most
    of the area is composed of paddy fields. Excessive adjustment of the rice area
    will lead to a deviation in the overall planting structure of Heilongjiang Province.
    However, the relatively small change in rice leads to a significant change rate
    for soybeans and corn with relatively small planting volumes. Therefore, rice
    is the crop with the largest amount of change and the smallest rate of change
    in the optimization and adjustment of agricultural planting structure in the 12
    sample irrigation areas in Heilongjiang Province. Adjustments in the area of three
    crops to extreme values is often considered a double objective function or even
    a single objective function. When three objective functions or even four objective
    functions are simultaneously used, the area adjustment situation is actually smaller.
    This shows that when more objective functions are considered, the effect can be
    achieved by adjusting the planting area relatively less to achieve the relatively
    optimal objective function value. However, when fewer objective functions are
    considered, it is necessary to adjust the planting area according to different
    scenarios or make minimal or maximum adjustments to the planting area to achieve
    a better objective function value. 3.4. Spatial analysis of agricultural planting
    structure under multiple scenarios To visually display the spatial changes in
    agricultural planting structure in Heilongjiang Province, specific data from 12
    irrigation areas were substituted into the NSGA-III algorithm to obtain the adjustments
    of the planting areas for 3 crops in 12 irrigation areas under 15 scenarios. The
    results are shown in Fig. 7. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Change in area of optimal planting patterns
    in sample irrigation areas under different scenarios. Among the four irrigation
    areas in the Songnen Plain, in the Chahayang irrigation area (Fig. 7a), 4 out
    of 15 scenarios consider increases in the planting area of corn, of which 3 consider
    irrigation water consumption. Among the 9 growth scenarios for rice, 7 include
    the total yield objective function. Except for S5, all scenarios that consider
    the total yield objective function require increases in the planting area of rice.
    This finding demonstrates that the total yield objective function in the Chahayang
    Irrigation District plays an important role in adjusting the rice planting area
    and the irrigation water consumption objective function in adjusting the corn
    planting area. From an overall perspective, the adjustment trend in the Chahayang
    Irrigation District involves reductions in the planting of corn and increases
    in the planting of rice and soybeans. Because the Chahayang Irrigation District
    is located between the Nomin River and the Allen River, with well-developed water
    systems and good soil water-saving conditions, it is appropriate to consider the
    impact of reductions in the irrigation water consumption objective function on
    the adjustment of its planting structure. Therefore, the Chahayang Irrigation
    District should reduce the planting of corn and increase the planting area of
    rice and soybeans. The Tailai Irrigation District (Fig. 7b) shows a reduction
    in corn cultivation in all scenarios, with 11 out of 15 scenarios reducing soybean
    cultivation and all scenarios increasing rice cultivation. The graph shows that
    in the Tailai Irrigation District, the change in soybean planting area does not
    play a critical regulatory role but only serves as an auxiliary regulatory role.
    Therefore, the future planting mode in the Tailai Irrigation District should reduce
    the planting of corn and increase the planting of rice. In the Fuyu irrigation
    area (Fig. 7c), except for S7, the planting area of corn is reduced. The majority
    of the reduced corn planting area should be used to grow rice, while a small portion
    should be used to grow soybean. In S7, to reduce the rice planting area, the soybean
    and corn areas should be increased by almost same amount. In the Yi''an Irrigation
    District (Fig. 7d), except for S9, in all situations, the planting of corn should
    be reduced and the planting of rice should be increased. Among the 15 scenarios,
    only 2 were designed to reduce soybean cultivation, and all considered the objective
    function of fertilizer application. When more target factors are considered, the
    growth of the soybean planting area is greater. A vertical comparison of the four
    irrigation areas on the Songnen Plain indicates that the Yi''an irrigation area
    has the highest growth rate of soybean planting, and its proportion of optimized
    adjustment of planting area increases compared to the other three irrigation areas.
    Looking at the four irrigation areas in the Songnen Plain, the overall goal is
    to reduce the planting area of corn and increase the planting area of rice. In
    most scenarios, the planting area of soybeans plays a regulatory role and accounts
    for a relatively small proportion of the adjustment. Among the eight irrigation
    areas in the Sanjiang Plain, the Qixing irrigation area (Fig. 7e) generally presents
    a reduction in maize planting area and an increase in rice and soybean planting
    area. Among the six scenarios where the planting area of rice increases, there
    are five cases where the total yield objective function is considered, and all
    of these involve a combination of multiple objectives. Among the six scenarios
    where the planting area of soybeans decreases, there are four cases where the
    objective function of irrigation water consumption is considered. Among the four
    multiobjective combination forms, three groups consider the objective function
    of irrigation water consumption. Therefore, in the Qixing Irrigation District,
    when the multiobjective combination form does not consider the objective function
    of irrigation water consumption, the planting area of soybeans can be increased.
    The Erdaohe Irrigation District (Fig. 7f) needs to reduce the planting area of
    rice in all 15 scenarios, with the planting area of soybeans reduced in 4 scenarios
    and the planting area of corn reduced in 3 scenarios. However, in the scenario
    of soybean and corn reductions, the reduction area is lower than that of rice.
    Therefore, the future planting model of the Erdaohe Irrigation District should
    entail moderate reductions in the planting area of rice and increases in the planting
    of corn and soybean. The overall situation of the Daxing Irrigation District (Fig.
    7g) entails increase in the planting area of rice and corn and reductions in the
    planting area of soybeans. Among the four scenarios where soybeans increased,
    three considered the objective function of irrigation water consumption, while
    among the seven scenarios where corn decreased, five considered the objective
    function of irrigation water consumption. This finding further shows that irrigation
    water consumption plays an important role in adjusting the planting area in the
    Daxing Irrigation District. The Jiangchuan Irrigation District (Fig. 7h) needs
    to reduce the planting area of rice and increase the planting area of soybeans
    and corn in all 15 scenarios. The main reason is that the original planting mode
    of the Jiangchuan Irrigation District has a very small proportion of soybeans
    and corn. Therefore, in the adjustment process, it is necessary to increase the
    planting area of soybeans and corn appropriately according to different scenarios.
    The Wutong River irrigation area (Fig. 7i) needs to reduce the planting area of
    corn in 15 scenarios, most of which need to reduce the planting area of corn and
    increase the planting area of rice and soybean, and a few of which need to reduce
    the planting area of soybean and corn and increase the planting area of rice.
    The overall trend is that the more objective functions are considered, the smaller
    the adjustment of planting area. The overall presentation of the 15 scenarios
    in the Xingkaihu Irrigation District (Fig. 7j) indicates that the planting of
    rice should be reduced and the planting area of soybeans and corn should be increased.
    Except for S6 and S15, where the planting area of rice and soybeans is reduced
    to increase the planting area of corn, in all other scenarios, the planting area
    of rice is reduced to ensure the planting of large beans and corn. The overall
    situation of the Suibin Irrigation District (Fig. 7k) requires reductions in the
    planting area of rice and increases in the planting area of soybeans and corn.
    Among the four scenarios for rice growth, there are three that consider only a
    single target; among the five scenarios for corn reduction, there are also three
    that consider only a single target. Therefore, in the Suibin Irrigation District,
    when a multiobjective situation is considered, the planting area of rice should
    be reduced, and the planting of corn should be increased. When a single target
    is considered, only the target situation can be considered. The overall situation
    of the 859 irrigation area (Fig. 7l) requires increases in the planting area of
    rice and corn and reductions in the planting area of soybeans. Among them, in
    three cases of rice reduction, three cases of soybean growth, and seven cases
    of corn growth, the objective function of irrigation water consumption is considered.
    The 859 irrigation area is near mountains and rivers, with dense water systems
    and good water retention. If the irrigation water consumption objective function
    is not considered, it is recommended to increase the planting area of rice and
    moderately reduce the planting area of soybeans and corn. In summary, the eight
    irrigation areas in the Sanjiang Plain have shown an overall increase in soybean
    planting area and a decrease in rice and corn planting area. Compared to the Songnen
    Plain, the Sanjiang Plain irrigation areas have a higher complexity of changes
    and weaker regularity. The comprehensive optimization benefits of agricultural
    planting structure, adjustment of planting area under different scenarios, and
    spatial analysis of agricultural planting structure under multiple scenarios can
    provide the following suggestions: The scientific allocation of crop spatial patterns
    should not only meet the requirements of local natural ecosystems but also leverage
    the advantages of agricultural resources according to local conditions to achieve
    good economic results. Based on the characteristics of grain crop cultivation
    in different regions, the government can effectively promote the transformation
    of the local planting structure and promote the structural reform of the agricultural
    supply side by taking water-saving irrigation measures as the starting point.
    In corn planting areas with water scarcity, the government can increase the rice
    planting area by investing in water-saving irrigation projects or guiding farmers
    to adopt water-saving technologies, thereby steadily increasing the net output
    value of the area. In addition to water-saving irrigation measures, price factors,
    grain production policies, climate change, and individual characteristics of farmers
    impact changes in the grain planting area. For example, the changes in precipitation
    and temperature caused by climate change will lead to an increase in the planting
    area of corn and soybeans, as well as a decrease in the planting area of rice.
    4. Discussion To further explore the constraint effect of water resource system
    resilience, based on the existing planting structure models in Heilongjiang Province,
    four objective functions were synthesized, and S15 was taken as an example to
    compare and analyze the specific impact of water resource system resilience constraints
    on the adjustment of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas. The
    calculation results are shown in Table 4. Table 4. Objective function values and
    changes in the overall planting area of irrigation areas with and without resilience
    constraints. Comparison project With resilience constraints Without resilience

    soybean area (hm2) 7509.862 7832.478 Change in corn area (hm2) 11079.74 15364.91
    Table 4 shows that in terms of net output value and total yield, the objective
    function values without the constraint of water resource system resilience are
    greater than those obtained under the constraint of water resource system resilience.
    In terms of the fertilizer application rate, the objective function values are
    almost equal in both cases, while in terms of irrigation water consumption, the
    objective function values without the constraint of water resource system resilience
    are significantly greater than those under the constraint of water resource system
    resilience. The adjustment of the total area without constraints and the adjustments
    of rice, soybean, and corn are greater than those with constraints. Taking S15
    as an example, the optimization results of the agricultural planting structure
    in each irrigation area were calculated under two scenarios, as shown in Table
    5, Table 6. Both cases involved converting a portion of the corn planting area
    to rice and soybean planting areas. However, the difference is that when there
    is no resilience constraint, the planting area of corn decreases more, and the
    percentage of transfer to rice is much greater than when there is a resilience
    constraint. The reason for this is that when constraining the resilience of water
    resource systems, due to the mutual inhibition between objective functions, as
    water resource benefits are effectively improved, social and economic benefits
    and agricultural production benefits are reduced to a certain extent. Due to the
    high economic benefits of rice among grain crops, the current oversupply of corn
    has led to a significant increase in inventory, reduced planting efficiency, and
    an increasingly prominent issue of increased production without increased income.
    Moreover, the problems of pesticide residues and soil nutrient imbalance caused
    by continuous cropping of corn cannot be ignored. After increases in the constraint
    of water resource resilience, due to the good water quality of rice, the planting
    area of corn converted into rice and soybean decreases compared to that without
    the constraint of water resource resilience. Thus, for the 12 sample irrigation
    areas in Heilongjiang Province, in both cases, the planting area of rice and soybean
    should be increased appropriately, while the planting area of corn should be reduced.
    Under the constraint of resilience, irrigation water consumption should be reduced,
    and the net output value and total yield should be reduced appropriately to ensure
    that the level of resilience of the water resource system is greater than or equal
    to level III. Table 5. Optimization results of agricultural planting structure

    in terms of adjusting the rice planting area, regardless of whether there is a
    resilience constraint, the four irrigation areas of Erdaohe, Jiangchuan, Xingkai
    Lake, and Suibin all reduce the rice planting area, while the other eight irrigation
    areas all increase the rice planting area. Among them, the four irrigation areas
    in the Songnen Plain all increase the rice planting area. In terms of adjusting
    the soybean planting area, when there is a resilience constraint, five irrigation
    areas show a decreasing trend, with 2 in the Songnen Plain irrigation area and
    3 in the Sanjiang Plain irrigation area. When there is no resilience constraint,
    four irrigation areas show a decreasing trend, with 1 in the Songnen Plain irrigation
    area and 3 in the Sanjiang Plain irrigation area. Among them, the Daxing Irrigation
    Area and Bawujiu Irrigation Area significantly decrease. In terms of adjusting
    the planting area of corn, when there are resilience constraints, five irrigation
    areas show an increasing trend, all of which are Sanjiang Plain irrigation areas.
    When there is no resilience constraint, six irrigation areas show a growth trend,
    all of which are Sanjiang Plain irrigation areas, but their area growth is much
    smaller than the reduction area. In summary, the presence or absence of resilience
    constraints has no significant impact on the adjustment of rice planting area.
    For the Songnen Plain, an irrigation area with resilience constraints and an increase
    in soybean planting area has no significant impact on corn planting area. For
    the Sanjiang Plain, an irrigation area with resilience constraints and an increase
    in corn planting area has no significant impact on soybean planting area. From
    an overall perspective, the presence or absence of resilience constraints does
    not have a significant impact on the overall trend of change, but it has a significant
    impact on the specific adjustment of planting area changes. Unlike previous studies
    on the optimization and adjustment of agricultural planting structure, in this
    study, optimization and evaluation are combined to a certain extent in the process
    of exploring the optimization and adjustment of agricultural planting structure
    in sample irrigation areas of Heilongjiang Province under the constraints of water
    resource system resilience and other conditions. In the analysis process, the
    emphasis was placed on the improvement of benefits brought about by optimization
    and adjustment, the adjustment of planting area in different scenarios, the adjustment
    of planting area in different irrigation areas under different scenarios, and
    the impact of water resource system resilience on the optimization and adjustment
    of planting structure. In terms of evaluation, the emphasis is on demonstrating
    the adjustment of planting area obtained through the NSGA3 algorithm and, based
    on this, conducting multiangle analysis. In terms of optimization, the emphasis
    is mainly reflected in the increased benefits of the four objective functions
    brought about by the adjustment of planting area in the irrigation area. The adjustment
    of planting area obtained through the NSGA3 algorithm can effectively analyze
    the increase in benefits brought by the adjustment, further deepening the connection
    between optimization and evaluation. The optimization of agricultural planting
    structure in irrigation areas under multiobjective conditions is a hot and difficult
    issue. However, limitations in data acquisition, insufficient selection of indicators,
    insufficient consideration of natural factors such as climate change and precipitation
    conditions, and insufficient time series may impact the results. In the future,
    the increasing improvement in soil and water environmental monitoring data in
    irrigation areas will promote the effective resolution of scientific issues related
    to the optimization of agricultural planting structure in irrigation areas. 5.
    Conclusion This study aims to address the drawbacks of imperfect constraint conditions
    in previous agricultural planting structure optimization models, which can easily
    lead to unreasonable optimization results. Taking 12 sample irrigation areas,
    such as the Chahayang Irrigation District in Heilongjiang Province, as examples,
    the constraint values were determined based on data from 2007 to 2016, and the
    2016 data were used as reference values for analysis. A multiobjective optimization
    model based on regional conditions was developed, with rice, soybeans, and corn
    as decision variables; net output value, total yield, fertilizer application amount,
    and irrigation water consumption as objective functions; and water resource system
    resilience as constraints. The NSGA III algorithm was used to optimize the agricultural
    planting structure of 12 sample irrigation areas under the constraint of water
    resource system resilience, and the following conclusions were obtained: (1) From
    the perspective of optimizing the benefits of agricultural planting, considering
    only a single objective, the function values adjusted for planting area were much
    better than those before optimization. After considering multiple objectives,
    the net output value representing social benefits increased by 4.72%–9.43%, the
    total output growth representing agricultural production benefits remained between
    0.79% and 2.36%, the decrease in fertilizer application representing ecological
    benefits remained between 2.03% and 4.73%, and the overall decrease in irrigation
    water consumption representing water resource benefits was 26.92%–29.02%. (2)
    Through specific analysis of 15 scenarios, the area change of the optimal planting
    mode under different scenarios was determined. The results showed that S9 had
    the largest changes in total area, rice area, and corn area. S10 had the smallest
    changes in total area and corn area. The smallest change in rice area was in S7,
    while the largest and smallest changes in soybean area are in S6 and S3, respectively.
    From the perspective of specific changes in planting area under different scenarios,
    when considering 15 scenarios comprehensively, the overall trend in Heilongjiang
    Province is to increase the planting area of rice and soybeans and reduce the
    planting area of corn. (3) The analysis results of the NSGA-III algorithm were
    applied to 12 irrigation areas to further analyze the spatial change characteristics
    of the agricultural planting structure in Heilongjiang Province from the perspective
    of spatial transformation. The overall trend of the four irrigation areas in the
    Songnen Plain was a reduction in the planting area of corn and an increase in
    the planting area of rice. In most scenarios, the soybean planting area played
    a regulatory role and accounted for a small proportion of the adjustment. Eight
    irrigation areas in the Sanjiang Plain required an overall increase in soybean
    planting area and a decrease in rice and corn planting area. Compared to the Songnen
    Plain, the changes in the Sanjiang Plain irrigation areas were complex and had
    weak regularity. (4) From the perspective of the constraint effect of water resource
    system resilience, increases in resilience constraints had a negative impact on
    the net output value and total yield in the objective function, a significant
    positive impact on irrigation water consumption, and little impact on fertilizer
    application. Simultaneously, increases in the resilience constraint effectively
    reduced the adjustment of the planting area to achieve a relatively optimal situation.
    For the adjustment of the planting area of the three crops, increases in resilience
    constraints had a small impact on the planting area of corn and soybean but no
    significant impact on the planting area of rice. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Optimization of crop structure is an efficient way to reduce greenhouse
    gas (GHGs) from agriculture production. However, carbon footprint have rarely
    been incorporated into previous planting structure optimization models due to
    the challenges of assessing the spatial and temporal distribution of agricultural
    carbon footprint for multiple crops in irrigated districts. In addition, previous
    planting structure models suffered from strong subjectivity in objective function
    determination, and the obtained non-dominated solution set offered difficulties
    to decision-makers in selecting specific implementation options. To fill such
    gaps, an integrated accounting-assessment-optimization-decision making (AAODM)
    approach was proposed, which remedies the shortcomings of previous crop planting
    structure optimization models in carbon footprint mitigation, and overcomes the
    subjectivity of objective function determination and the difficulty in selecting
    specific implementation options. Firstly, life cycle assessment (LCA) method was
    used to account for the multi-year agricultural carbon footprints of multiple
    crops in the irrigation district. The optimization objective functions of planting
    structure optimization models can then be determined based on the assessment method
    of carbon footprint influencing factors. Next, the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic
    Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) was used to generate a non-dominated solution set of the
    optimization model. The optimal planting structure can be finally obtained based
    on decision making methods by determining the maximum harmonic mean (HM) and knee
    points (KPs) of the non-dominated solution set. The developed AAODM approach was
    then applied to a case study of agricultural crop management in Bayan Nur City,
    China. The results showed that the level of economic development was a key factor
    influencing the increase in carbon footprint in Bayan Nur City over the past 20
    years. The regulation of the level of economic development would significantly
    influence the agricultural carbon footprint in Bayan Nur City. Moreover, two optimal
    crop cultivation patterns were provided for decision-makers by selecting solutions
    from the Pareto front with decision making methods. The comparison results with
    other methods showed that the solutions obtained by NSGA-II were superior to MOPSO
    in terms of carbon reduction. The developed AAODM approach for agricultural GHG
    mitigation could help agricultural production systems in achieving low carbon
    emissions and high efficiency.

    modernization, agricultural production has become an important source of greenhouse
    gases (GHGs) (Karwacka et al., 2020; Tan, 2015; Zhang et al., 2020a). The Food
    and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations has reported that global GHG
    emissions from agriculture and food production have increased by 17% over the
    past 30 years (FAO, 2022). The State of Food and Agriculture (2016) from The Food
    and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations shows that the agricultural
    sector must implement measures to mitigate climate change if the global temperature
    rise is to be maintained within 2 °C (Wollenberg et al., 2016). Irrigation districts
    are important bases for agricultural production, and usually require large amounts
    of fertilizer. Nitrogen from the fertilizer is converted to ammonia by microorganisms
    and then oxidized to N2O, which is a potent GHG (Shi et al., 2020; Yue et al.,
    2020). Additionally, the demand for electricity and fuel is increasing with the
    modernization of irrigation districts, resulting in increased CO2 emissions (Shi
    et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2014). Therefore, a reliable method must be developed
    to systematically assess the sources and influencing factors of GHG emissions
    from agricultural production and identify the optimal crop pattern for GHG mitigation.
    The carbon footprint is a measure of GHG emissions resulting from by a certain
    activity (Matuštík and Kočí, 2021) or accumulated over a product''s life cycle
    (Zhang et al., 2021a). As a novel approach to measure the impact and pressure
    of GHG emissions on the global environment, the carbon footprint has become a
    prevalent subject of research in recent years (Durojaye et al., 2020; Mancini
    et al., 2016). The theory of the agricultural carbon footprint was proposed based
    on the research results of the carbon cycle in agricultural ecosystems, which
    provided theoretical support for the accurate analysis of agricultural GHG emissions
    (Lal, 2004). Some studies have investigated the carbon footprint accounting of
    single crops in irrigation districts seeking low-carbon agricultural management
    technologies using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. For example, Wu and
    Chai (2014) compared the carbon footprint of maize under different mulching and
    irrigation conditions. Wang (2020) explored a low-emission and high-efficiency
    wheat cultivation model for an irrigation district. Nie et al. (2023) estimated
    the carbon footprint of maize under drip irrigation in an irrigation district.
    Based on accounting, many researchers have analyzed the spatial and temporal variation
    in multi-year agricultural carbon footprints from national and provincial perspectives
    to conduct an empirical analysis of the influencing factors, providing policy
    insights for decision-makers to reduce the agricultural carbon footprint. For
    example, Balogh (2019) used a feasible generalized least squares estimator and
    panel unit root tests to explore the impact of the agricultural economy, production,
    export, and population on the global carbon footprint from 1961 to 2013. Yang
    et al. (2019) used the structural vector autoregression (SVAR) model to analyze
    the factors influencing the agricultural carbon footprint in Shandong Province
    from 2000 to 2017 in terms of the economy, population, and foreign trade. Zhen
    et al. (2017) used the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model to confirm
    that the level of the agricultural economy was a determinant of the growth of
    the carbon footprint in Guangdong Province from 1993 to 2013. Unfortunately, the
    assessment of the spatial and temporal variations in the multi-year agricultural
    carbon footprints of multiple crops in irrigation districts is still lacking,
    and the crop planting structure management did not incorporate it. In addition,
    most studies on the factors influencing the agricultural carbon footprint have
    only used empirical analysis, and only few studies have conducted detailed investigations
    on the key influencing factors to support practical applications. Previously,
    programming models have been widely used to address optimization problems in many
    fields (Hu et al., 2022; Lima et al., 2022; Szkutnik-Rogoz et al., 2021). There
    have also been many attempts in agricultural systems that have used optimization
    methods. The early attempts focused on single-objective optimization of agricultural
    systems, where economic benefits was considered as the main objective. To promote
    resource conservation (Jain et al., 2021), environmental protection (Yin et al.,
    2022), improvement of crop species (Rangarajan et al., 2022) and agricultural
    machinery (Park and Miao, 2015), more objectives were considered in the optimization
    of agricultural systems. In order to alleviate the global environmental pressure,
    GHG reduction in agriculture is both an important initiative and has great potential.
    Recently, researchers have attempted to apply multi-objective optimization (MOO)
    models to optimize the allocation of water and land resources to address GHG emissions
    in agricultural systems. For example, Yue and Guo (2021) optimized the allocation
    of water and land resources in different sectors of irrigation districts to balance
    agricultural production and environmental impacts. Zhang et al. (2021a) optimized
    the planting structure in a semi-arid basin to reduce carbon emissions in an agricultural
    water-energy-food nexus system. Ren et al. (2022) developed a MOO model for a
    water-energy-food-carbon nexus system to achieve sustainable agricultural development
    in the Yellow River Basin and solved the model using a genetic algorithm. They
    demonstrated the effectiveness and applicability of the MOO model for managing
    the water and land resources for GHG mitigation. In the determination of the objective
    function, in addition to the objective of minimizing GHG emissions, the objectives
    of maximizing the competitiveness of low-carbon agriculture, renewable energy
    production, ecological benefits, economic benefits, and minimizing the Gini coefficient
    of economic income were chosen. There is subjectivity in the determination of
    the objective function, which means that it may lack relevance and effectiveness
    when formulating agricultural carbon footprint mitigation policies and technical
    solutions. There have been many optimization methods to address the subjectivity
    caused by the uncertain parameters (Wang and Huang, 2011; Wang and Huang, 2012).
    However, methods to the subjectivity caused by objective function determination
    are still rare. Existing MOO models in agriculture often use intelligent algorithms
    (Jain et al., 2021; Park and Miao, 2015; Rangarajan et al., 2022; Ren et al.,
    2022), weighting (Yue and Guo, 2021; Zhang et al., 2019), ℇ-constraint (Galán-Martín
    et al., 2017; Han et al., 2020) and other methods for solving. In order to avoid
    the difficulty of selecting accurate solutions from Pareto front (PF), researchers
    often transformed the MOO model into a single-objective optimization model to
    obtain only one solution (Li et al., 2020; Tiammee and Likasiri, 2020; Yue and
    Guo, 2021; Zhang et al., 2021a), which resulted in failing to obtain Pareto optimal
    solutions or ignoring some efficient solutions. To address these issues, researchers
    used Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II) (Jiang et al., 2020;
    Ren et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2021) and Multi-Objective Particle Swarm Optimization
    Algorithm (MOPSO) (Yousefi et al., 2018; Zhai et al., 2018) to solve MOO models
    in the agricultural field. As demonstrated by No Free Lunch theorem (Wu et al.,
    2019), no learning algorithm can always performs well in any problem, so different
    algorithms are suitable for different real-world problems. Overall, NSGA-II stands
    out as a popular choice in agricultural optimization (Kropp et al., 2019). However,
    the high number of obtained non-dominated solutions not only increased the burden
    on decision-makers but also interfered with their decision making. Identifying
    the PF does not completely solve MOO problems. Specific solutions still have to
    be chosen from the non-dominated solution set for decision-makers, which is a
    challenging process (Coello et al., 2007). This process is known as decision making.
    The maximum harmonic mean provides a reasonable compromise between the objectives,
    and this decision making method has previously been successfully applied (Ayala
    and Coelho, 2008; Neto et al., 2018). Another approach is the determination of
    knee points, which is very attractive to decision-makers because of the minimal
    trade-off loss on all objectives (Deb et al., 2003; Ramirez-Atencia et al., 2017).
    Integration of MOO methods with the maximum harmonic mean and knee points methods
    may help to solve such problems in agriculture. According to the existing literature,
    several aspects are worthy of further enhancement, as follows: (i) Research on
    the agricultural carbon footprint of irrigation districts is still in its infancy,
    focusing on accounting for the carbon footprint of single-crop production under
    different agricultural management technologies. The assessment of the spatial
    and temporal variations in the multi-year agricultural carbon footprints of multiple
    crops is still lacking. This hinders the incorporation of carbon footprints into
    optimization models. (ii) Previous multi-objective planting structure optimization
    models rarely considered the carbon footprint and suffered from strong subjectivity
    in objective function determination, which may lead to suboptimal or even infeasible
    solutions. Additionally, the obtained high number of non-dominated solutions not
    only increased the burden on decision-makers but also interfered with their choice
    of specific planting structure optimization options. To the best of our knowledge,
    no studies have simultaneously resolved the abovementioned concerns to ensure
    sustainable agricultural resource management in irrigation districts. To resolve
    these deficiencies, this study aimed to develop a systematic accounting-assessment-optimization-decision
    making (AAODM) approach to integrate the assessment of carbon footprint into planting
    structure management, and tackle the subjectivity existing in objective function
    determination and the difficulty in selecting specific implementation options.
    First, the LCA method was used to account for the carbon footprints of crop planting
    in the irrigation district over the years and clarify the spatial and temporal
    variations in the carbon footprints during the development of the irrigation district.
    Second, the coupled Kaya-LMDI method was used to determine the key factors influencing
    the agricultural carbon footprint. Finally, this study developed a MOO model based
    on the carbon footprint to regulate the key factors influencing the carbon footprint
    that was solved using the NSGA-II to generate a non-dominated solution set. Rational
    optimization solutions from the Pareto optimal set were provided to decision-makers
    based on decision making methods by determining the maximum harmonic mean and
    knee points of the non-dominated solution set. Therefore, the developed model
    can determine the optimization objective functions based on the assessment of
    the influencing factors to resolve the subjective nature of objective function
    determination. It can also obtain two optimal planting structures based on decision
    making methods to resolve the difficulty in selecting specific implementation
    options. The capabilities of the model were demonstrated through a case study
    of agricultural cropping management in Bayan Nur City, China, which could help
    decision-makers identify desirable solutions to reduce the carbon footprint. The
    remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The development of the assessment-based
    planting structure optimization model for GHG mitigation is introduced in Section
    2. In Section 3, the methodology is applied to Bayan Nur City. In Section 4, the
    optimal crop cultivation pattern and the effect of carbon footprint reduction
    are analyzed. The rationality of the results, the applicability and superiority
    of the methodology are discussed in Section 5. Finally, the conclusions are presented
    in Section 6. 2. Methodology The AAODM approach of this study is shown in Fig.
    1. In this study, AAODM approach was proposed to remedy the shortcomings of previous
    crop planting structure optimization models in neglecting carbon footprint, and
    overcome the subjectivity of objective function determination and the difficulty
    in selecting specific implementation options. First, the four-step LCA method
    was used to account for the multi-year agricultural carbon footprints of multiple
    crops in the irrigation district, and clarify the spatial and temporal variations
    in the carbon footprints. Based on the Kaya model, dividing the factors influencing
    the carbon footprint into four dimensions: energy structure, energy intensity,
    level of economic development, and population size factors. LMDI method was coupled
    to reveal the key factors influencing the spatial and temporal variations in the
    multi-year agricultural carbon footprints. Then, a MOO model of planting structure
    management based on carbon footprint was developed to regulate the key factors
    influencing the change in carbon footprint. The NSGA-Ⅱ was used to solve the model
    to generate a non-dominated solution set. Finally, two decision making methods,
    the maximum harmonic mean and knee points methods, were used to provide decision-makers
    with two optimal crop cultivation patterns of the non-dominated solution set.

    1. The general framework of this study. 2.1. Life cycle assessment method This
    subsection provides a brief introduction to the computational structure of LCA
    since it was used to account for the agricultural carbon footprint in irrigation
    district and calculate the parameters required in the optimization model. With
    increased awareness of environmental protection and a greater understanding of
    the impacts that may accompany the production and consumption of products, there
    is a desire to establish methods to better understand and account for these impacts.
    One of the techniques developed for this purpose is LCA. The LCA method uses a
    top-down approach to identify total GHG emissions by clarifying the links that
    generate GHGs throughout the life cycle of a product (Yang et al., 2022) or service
    (Chen et al., 2009), and is chosen to account for the agricultural carbon footprint.
    According to Environmental management - Life cycle assessment - Principles and
    frameworks, it can be divided into four steps: the determination of purpose and
    scope, inventory analysis, impact assessment and interpretation (Chen et al.,
    2009). Step 1 Determination of purpose and scope Considering the carbon footprint
    of crop production in irrigation district during 1998–2018. Emissions from agri-food
    systems are those generated by pre-production, farm-gate emissions, post-production
    and land use change processes (FAO, 2021), as shown in Fig. S1. Among them, farm-gate
    emissions were the largest component of agri-food systems emissions in 2019 with
    roughly 7 billion tons CO2eq, followed by pre- and post-production processes and
    land use change. Additionally, for carbon footprint studies focusing on agricultural
    processes, the system boundary can be restricted to “cradle to farm gate” instead
    of “cradle to grave” to avoid complications of a full carbon footprint study (Peter
    et al., 2017). Therefore, the accounting scope is chosen from “raw material production”
    to “crop harvest”, which includes the pre-production and farm-gate emissions processes,
    encompassing the majority of agri-food systems emissions. Step 2 Inventory analysis
    Inventory analysis, which lists all the links that generate a carbon footprint
    within the scope boundary, is the most important step in LCA. The carbon footprint
    generated during the processes from “raw material production” to “crop harvest”
    includes upstream and downstream carbon footprints. The production and processing
    of fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, and agricultural films, electricity for irrigation,
    the use of diesel for agricultural machinery, and nitrogen fertilizer application
    were included. The life cycle and system boundary are shown in Fig. 2. The main
    crops in Bayan Nur City are wheat, corn, sunflower, tomato and melon. Download

    assessment The impact assessment step involves a specific calculation of the carbon
    footprint of each link. The following seven links are included: A Fertilizer production

    (15%N, 42%P2O5) and potash (60%K2O). (1) where WFER is the carbon footprint generated
    by fertilizer production and processing (kg); j represents the type of crops (j
    = 1 for wheat, j = 2 for corn, j = 3 for sunflower, j = 4 for tomato and j = 5
    for melon); k represents the type of fertilizer (k = 1 for urea, k = 2 for diammonium
    phosphate, and k = 3 for potash); UFEjk is the amount of fertilizer k applied
    to crop j per unit area of production (kg/hm2); Aj is the planting area of crop
    j (hm2); WFEk is the carbon footprint coefficient of the production and processing
    of chemical fertilizer k (kgCO2eq/kgN, kgCO2eq/kgP2O5, kgCO2eq/kgK2O); FCOk is

    (2) where WSED is the carbon footprint generated by seed production and processing
    (kg); USEj is the seed consumption of crop j per unit area of production (kg/hm2);
    WSEj is the carbon footprint coefficient for the seeds production and processing
    of crop j (kgCO2eq/kg). C Pesticide production and processing (3) where WPES is
    the carbon footprint generated by pesticide production and processing (kg); UPEj
    is the pesticide consumption of crop j per unit area of production (kg/hm2); WPE
    is the carbon footprint coefficient of production and processing of pesticides
    (kgCO2eq/kg effective components); PCO is the active ingredient of pesticide (%).
    Due to the limitation of data acquisition, PCO takes the value of 1. D. Agricultural

    by agricultural film production and processing (kg); UFIj is the agricultural
    film consumption of crop j per unit area of production (kg/hm2); WFI is the carbon

    electricity (kg); UELj is the electricity consumption of crop j irrigation per
    unit area of production (kWh/hm2); WEL is the carbon footprint coefficient of

    machinery (6) where WDIS is the carbon footprint generated by diesel for agricultural
    machinery (kg); UDIj is the diesel consumption for agricultural machinery for

    phosphate consumption of crop j per unit area of production (kg/hm2); FCP is the
    effective content of N in diammonium phosphate, taken as 15%; WFN is the carbon

    total carbon footprint is: (8) where CFS is the total carbon footprint (kg). The
    above seven carbon footprint links were added to obtain the total carbon footprint
    in the study area during 1998–2018. Step 4 Interpretation According to Environmental
    management - Life cycle assessment - Principles and frameworks (Chen et al., 2009),
    the interpretation of the life cycle assessment is a stage that integrates the
    findings of the inventory analysis (Step 2) and impact assessment (Step 3). The
    results of the interpretation (Step 4) should be consistent with the identified
    purpose and scope (Step 1), with corresponding conclusions, explanations of limitations,
    and recommendations presented to decision-makers. 2.2. Kaya-Logarithmic Mean Divisia
    Index method At the IPCC seminar, the Kaya model was proposed to divide the factors
    influencing the carbon footprint into four dimensions: energy structure, energy
    intensity, level of economic development, and population size factors (Fan and
    Hu, 2020; Kaya, 1990). Moreover, factor decomposition method provided an effective
    way to determine the contribution of each impact factor to the change of carbon
    footprint. The index decomposition analysis (IDA), production-theoretical decomposition
    analysis (PDA) and structural decomposition analysis (SDA) were the mostly used
    factor decomposition methods. Among above-mentioned methods, SDA method was mainly
    used in practical applications to provide a basis for GHG emissions reduction
    from the industrial structure using input-output tables. The PDA method was mainly
    used to determine the share of GHG reduction tasks for each region by dividing
    the study area into multiple regions. Compared to SDA and PDA methods, the data
    required by IDA method is easier to acquire and analyze. Among the many IDA methods,
    the LMDI method has no residuals, effectively avoiding the spurious regression
    problem. Owing to its high operability and adaptability, it has become one of
    the most commonly used carbon footprint decomposition methods in recent years
    (Chong et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). A practical guide to LMDI is reported
    in Ang (2005). Agricultural carbon footprint are ultimately produced by agricultural
    production activities (Chen et al., 2018). (i) Agricultural energy structure reflects
    the type and proportion of energy used in agricultural production. Different types
    of energy sources produce different levels of agricultural carbon footprint (Astier
    et al., 2014). (ii) Agricultural energy intensity reflects the amount of energy
    consumed per unit of output in agricultural production. A high energy intensity
    means that more energy is needed to produce the same amount of agricultural products
    and vice versa (Zhang et al., 2015b). (ⅲ) The level of agricultural economic development
    reflects the productivity of agricultural production system. The larger the indicator,
    the higher the productivity of the system (Zhang et al., 2015b). (ⅳ) Changes in
    the agricultural population size can affect arable land area, and the efficiency
    and quality of agricultural production by causing changes in food demand and rural
    labor (Chen et al., 2020). The LMDI method, first proposed by Ang et al. (1998),
    is a factor decomposition method without residuals that effectively avoids spurious
    regression problems (Dong et al., 2019). Based on the above results of carbon
    footprint accounting over the years, the LMDI method was chosen to determine the
    contribution of carbon footprint change to each influencing factor. The agricultural
    carbon footprint can be formulated using energy structure, energy intensity, level
    of economic development, and population size factors as follows: (9) Where TE
    is energy consumption; TGDP is output value; and P is population size. is the
    energy structure, i.e., the ratio of GHG emissions to energy consumption, denoted
    by CE. is the energy intensity, i.e., the ratio of agricultural energy consumption
    in the irrigation district to the corresponding output value, denoted by EP. is
    the level of economic development, i.e., the ratio of agricultural output value
    to population size in the irrigation district, denoted by TP. According to the
    LMDI model, the factors influencing the total change in the carbon footprint over
    the years are decomposed as: (10) Where ΔC is the amount of carbon footprint change
    (kg). Ct is the carbon footprint in period t (kg). C0 is the carbon footprint
    in the starting period (kg). l represents the factors influencing the change in
    carbon footprint (l = 1 for CE, l = 2 for EP, l = 3 for TP, and l = 4 for P).
    ΔCl is the carbon footprint change caused by influencing factor l (kg). (11) Where
    lt is the value of influence factor l in period t. l0 is the value of influence
    factor l in the starting period. The function L (a, b) is defined as: (12) ＞ ＞
    ＞ ＞ 2.3. Crop cultivation structure management model based on the carbon footprint
    A MOO problem is a problem of finding optimal solutions in the feasible domain
    so that multiple objective functions are optimized simultaneously. It usually
    has no unique optimal solution, but rather a set of Pareto optimal solutions that
    cannot be dominated by each other. It is necessary to give a precise description
    of the MOO problem and definitions of the related concepts. A general MOO problem
    (minimization) with k objectives can be described as: Minimize {f1 (x), f2 (x),
    …, fk (x)} subject to: x ∈ X. Where f1 (x), f2 (x), …, fk (x) are k(≥2) objectives
    to be minimized, x is the decision vector, and X is the set of feasible solutions.
    Definition 1 Pareto dominance A decision vector a (a∈X) is said to Pareto dominated
    a decision vector b (b ∈ X) if and only if: fi (a) ≤ fi(b) for all i∈{1,2, …,
    k} and fi (a) < fi(b) for at least one i∈{1,2, …, k}. Definition 2 Pareto optimal
    solution A solution x ∈ X is a Pareto optimal solution (also called non-dominated
    solution) if there is no x’∈X that Pareto dominates x. Definition 3 Pareto optimal
    set and Pareto front The Pareto optimal set is a set containing all (or as large
    as possible) Pareto optimal solutions. The set of objective values corresponding
    to the solutions in the Pareto optimal set is illustrated on the PF. Optimal theory
    is an effective regulation tool that can provide sound management solutions under
    specific conditions and multi-objective requirements (Zhang et al., 2020b, 2021b,
    2023). In this study, a MOO model of crop planting structure management based
    on carbon footprint theory was developed to regulate the key influencing factors
    of carbon footprint change. The NSGA-II was applied to the MOO model and generated
    a non-dominated solution set with high attainability to improve the agricultural
    environment. We developed a multi-objective LP model for the problem addressed
    in this work. Various constraints B–F in agricultural production, such as acreage,
    water availability, and food security constraints, etc., are fully considered
    to ensure the practicality and feasibility of the model. The economic objective
    was defined in equation (13). The environmental objective was defined in equation
    (14). A list of sets, parameters, and decision variables in the optimization model
    was given in the Supplementary Material. 2.3.1. Objective functions and constraints
    Objective one is the objective of maximizing net economic benefits and objective
    two is the objective of minimizing carbon footprint. Consistent with similar studies,
    minimizing carbon footprint from agriculture production should be identified as
    the optimization objective function (Ren et al., 2022; Yue and Guo, 2021; Zhang
    et al., 2021a). In addition, the key influencing factor of carbon footprint changes
    should be incorporated into the optimization model as one of the objectives, as
    their regulation could lead to targeted and effective GHG reduction solutions.
    The agricultural economy is directly linked to the crop planting structure, and
    adjusting this structure can alter the agricultural economy to achieve efficient
    GHG mitigation. By considering the economic benefits and the carbon footprint
    as optimization objectives, and the acreage of each crop in each region as the
    decision variables, planting structure solutions to reduce the carbon footprint
    can be obtained. It is noteworthy that the assessment-based objective function
    determination method proposed in this paper holds broad applicability. In this
    paper, we provide a systematic approach for integrating the assessment of carbon
    footprint into crop planting structure management and solving the problem of subjectivity
    in objective function determination by integrating LCA and Kaya-LMDI with MOO.
    Future research in a similar vein can apply and expand upon this framework, such
    as setting more carbon footprint influencing factors as optimization objective
    functions and assigning their importance according to the degree of impact. A
    Objective functions This model is a multi-objective crop cropping structure optimization
    model. Objective one is the objective of maximizing net economic benefits and
    objective two is the objective of minimizing carbon footprint. (13) (14) Where
    F1 is agricultural economic benefits (yuan); F2 is agricultural carbon footprint
    (kg); i denotes study area; Aij is the planting area with crop j in region i (hm2);
    Pj is unit price of crop j (yuan/kg); Yij is the yield of crop j in region i (kg/hm2);
    Cj is the cost of growing crop j (yuan/hm2). The economic benefits are valuated
    in Chinese yuan. One Chinese yuan equals to 0.1550 US dollars based on the annual
    average currency conversion rate posted by Bank of China in 2021. B Carbon footprint
    constraints The carbon footprint induced by crop production should not surpass
    the present carbon footprint before optimization to improve the agricultural environment.
    The constraints are represented by the following equations. (15) (16) Where Kj
    is the carbon footprint of growing crop j (kg/hm2); A0ij is the planting area
    with the crop j in the region i in base year (hm2); and CFS0 is the carbon footprint
    in base year (kg). C Planting area constraints The optimal planting area should
    not exceed the total effective area. The area that can be made available for a
    specific crop depends on the current area. The constraints ensure that the optimized
    planting area is suitable for crop growth. The effective planting area is the
    sum of the original crop planting area. The constraints are represented by equation
    (17). (17) In addition, considering the production safety of different crops,
    the variation of acreage for each crop should be within a certain range, as shown
    in equation (18). (18) D Water availability constraints It is necessary to ensure
    that the water provided for crop planting should not exceed the water availability
    in each area of the irrigation district. The water availability constraints are
    represented by equation (19). (19) Where mj is the crop j irrigation quota (m3/hm2);
    Qi is the amount of water available for agriculture in the region i (m3); ρ is
    the irrigation water utilization coefficient. E Food security constraints In order
    to ensure that the demand for food production is met, it is necessary to limit
    the production of each crop to no less than the minimum demands of society. The
    food security constraints are represented by equation (20). (20) Where Dj is the
    minimum social demand for crop j (kg). F Non-negative constraints Crop acreage
    cannot take negative values and can be represented by equation (21). (21) 2.3.2.
    Solution method (1) Solution of the optimization model Existing MOO models in
    agriculture often use intelligent algorithms (Jain et al., 2021; Park and Miao,
    2015; Rangarajan et al., 2022; Ren et al., 2022), weighting (Yue and Guo, 2021;
    Zhang et al., 2019), ℇ-constraint (Han et al., 2020) and other methods for solving.
    Compared to global criterion, weighting, and ℇ-constraint methods, the multi-objective
    genetic algorithms (MOGA) method leads to a correct and accurate identification
    of the whole PF. NSGA-II is a popular algorithm to deal with realistic MOO problems
    in agriculture (Kropp et al., 2019). Numerous studies have stated that NSGA-II
    can obtain solutions with better convergence and diversity owing to its stability
    and robustness (Che et al., 2021; Kalyanmoy et al., 2002; Zhang and Liu, 2020).
    The NSGA-II algorithm process is shown in Fig. S2 (Kalyanmoy et al., 2002) and
    the solving description is given in the Supplementary Material. The solution of
    this model was computed by MATLAB R2020b software with NSGA-II algorithm. The
    population size was set to 200, and the mutation and crossover rate were 0.05
    and 0.7, respectively. The PF consisting of a series of non-dominated solutions
    was obtained after 300 iterations. (2) Optimal optimization solution selection
    For the PF obtained by solving MOO model, the high number of non-dominated solutions
    not only increase the burden on decision-makers but also interfere with their
    decision making (Zhang et al., 2021c). The maximum harmonic mean and knee points
    methods were applied to solve this problem and provided decision-makers with optimal
    optimization solutions. (i) Maximum harmonic mean The arithmetic mean, geometric
    mean and harmonic mean are important mean measures in statistics. Compared to
    the arithmetic mean which is a compromise average of strengths and weaknesses,
    geometric mean and harmonic mean are penalized average to encourage balanced development.
    Compared to the geometric mean, the harmonic mean penalises uneven performances
    more heavily. The maximum harmonic mean provides a reasonable compromise between
    the objectives, and this decision making method has previously been successfully
    applied (Ayala and Coelho, 2008; Neto et al., 2018). The more reasonably behaved
    are the solutions for both objectives, the larger is the harmonic mean. The harmonic
    mean H of the positive real numbers x1, x2, …, xn is defined to be: (22) For the
    special case of just two objectives, x and y, the harmonic mean can be written:
    (23) For the special case of just three objectives, x, y and z, the harmonic mean
    can be written: (24) If a set of weight w1, w2, …, wn is associated to the positive
    real numbers x1, x2, …, xn, the weighted harmonic mean is defined by: (25) The
    unweighted harmonic mean can be regarded as the special case where all of the
    weights are equal. Further variations are possible, and they include means, weighted
    or not, of more than two objectives. In this study, the harmonic mean can be calculated
    by equation (26) and the non-dominated solution corresponding to the maximum harmonic
    mean will be selected. (26) where x is the value of the objective one after homogenization
    and normalization; y is the value of the objective two after homogenization and
    normalization. Neither objective one nor objective two is assigned a weight. (ii)
    Knee points Many researchers have tried to find the local points or regions with
    special significance on the PF (Bhattacharjee et al., 2017; Chiu et al., 2016).
    If the PF has a clear knee point, most decision-makers prefer this solution. This
    is because a small improvement in any objective from the knee point leads to the
    significant deterioration in at least one of the other objectives (Deb et al.,
    2003; Ramirez-Atencia et al., 2017). In this paper, we use the definition for
    the knee point of Zhang et al. (2015a) and Zou et al. (2017). An example PF showing
    knee points and normal points is shown in Fig. S3. D has the longest distance
    from the straight line L, so D is the knee point. For a bi-objective minimization
    problem, the mathematical formula of straight line L is as follows: (27) Then,
    the distance from a solution k (xk,yk) to L can be calculated as: (28) For minimization
    problems, only solutions in the convex knee regions are of interest (Zhang et
    al., 2015a). Therefore, the distance measure in equation (28) can be modified
    as follows to identify knee points: (29) ＜ The above distance measure for identifying
    knee points can be easily extended to optimization problems with more than two
    objectives, where the extreme line will become a hyperplane (Zhang et al., 2015a).
    The knee points when there are only two objectives are more obvious and can be
    clearly observed, and thus can be selected more easily and quickly by human observation
    (Neto et al., 2018). 3. Application 3.1. Study area Bayan Nur City (40°13′∼42°28′N
    and 105°12′∼109°53′E) is located in the western part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
    Region, which includes the Hetao Irrigation District, the largest gravity irrigation
    district in Asia and one of the three extra-large irrigation districts in China.
    According to the administrative division of Bayan Nur City, the study area is
    divided into seven regions, which are Dengkou County, Hangjin Houqi, Linhe District,
    Wuyuan County, Urad Qianqi, Urad Zhongqi, and Urad Houqi, as shown in Fig. 3.
    The main grain crops are wheat, corn, etc. The main cash crops include sunflower,
    tomato, melon, etc. These five crops mentioned above account for about 86% of
    the total arable land. The annual precipitation is only 150 mm, while the annual
    evaporation amounts to 2200 mm, which belongs to the area where there is no agriculture
    without irrigation by water transfer (Song et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2019).

    Fig. 3. Study area. The irrigation district has an increasingly prominent strategic
    position. It is an alluvial plain of the Yellow River with a flat terrain, deep
    soil texture, and excellent tillage performance. For a long time, the irrigation
    district has been consolidating and improving the basis of agricultural irrigation
    to fully meet the agricultural water requirements of the district and rapidly
    develop the agricultural economy. Currently, it has become an important base for
    commodity grain and oil for the country and autonomous region, with a total annual
    average grain output of approximately 3 million tons and 600,000 tons of oilseeds
    (Shi et al., 2020). However, irrigation and mechanical tillage in agricultural
    production processes emit large amounts of GHGs. In addition to the production
    processes in the field, the materials used for crop production generate large
    amounts of GHGs (Cheng et al., 2014; Xia et al., 2016). The local government has
    published plans, such as ecological environmental protection planning and carbon
    reduction work programs (Qi et al., 2019), to promote the integration of greening
    and agricultural modernization and actively explore the development of environmentally
    friendly modern agriculture. Therefore, a reliable method must be developed to
    systematically assess the sources and influencing factors of GHG emissions from
    agricultural production and identify the optimal crop pattern for GHG mitigation.
    3.2. Data collection and processing The period of agricultural carbon footprint
    accounting was selected from 1998 to 2018, and the data involved were collected
    and processed as follows: data on planting area, fertilizer application, seed,
    agricultural film usage, pesticide usage, diesel usage of agricultural machinery,
    and electricity consumption for irrigation were obtained from Bayan Nur Statistical
    Yearbook and Bayan Nur Farming and Animal Husbandry Bureau. The inputs of production
    materials of crop cultivation are shown in Table 1. The carbon footprint inventory
    coefficients are shown in Table 2. Table 1. Inputs of production materials of

    the change in carbon footprint was selected from 1998 to 2018, and the data involved
    were collected and processed as follows: the data of agricultural output value
    and population size were obtained from Bayan Nur Statistical Yearbook; agricultural
    energy consumption included diesel for agricultural machinery and electricity
    for irrigation, and the sum of the agricultural carbon footprint generated by
    both was used to denote agricultural energy consumption. The base year selected
    for the optimization model was 2018, and the data involved in the objective function
    were collected and processed as follows: the data of crop yield were from Bayan
    Nur Statistical Yearbook and Bayan Nur Bureau of Statistics; the crop prices were
    from China Agricultural Information Network; the unit cost of planting each crop
    in the study area was from the National Agricultural Products Cost-benefit Data
    Collection; the carbon footprint of crop unit area was calculated with the LCA
    method according to the data in Table 1, Table 2 The data collection and processing
    involved in the constraints of the optimization model were as follows: irrigation
    quotas for different crops were taken from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Industry
    Water Rating Standard; irrigation water utilization coefficients were given by
    the Hetao Irrigation District Administration; agricultural water availability
    for different sub-districts was from Bayan Nur Statistical Yearbook; the current
    carbon footprint before optimization was 2018, which was also the historical maximum
    carbon footprint; the minimum annual demand for wheat per capita was 250 kg, and
    the minimum annual demand for corn per capita was 150 kg. Since local wheat production
    is not self-sufficient, wheat imports from abroad should not exceed 30% of the
    total demand for food security and social stability (Song et al., 2019). The production
    of sunflower, tomato and melon should exceed the minimum production in 20 years.
    The upper and lower limits of the acreage interval for 2013–2018 were set as the
    range of crop acreage values. 4. Results analysis 4.1. Assessment of carbon footprint
    The LCA method was used to account for the carbon footprint of Bayan Nur City
    from 1998 to 2018. The agricultural carbon footprint comprises seven aspects:
    the production and processing of fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, and agricultural
    films, the use of diesel fuel for agricultural machinery, electricity for irrigation,
    and nitrogen fertilizer. Carbon footprint during 1998–2018 is shown in Fig. 4a.
    The carbon footprint showed an overall increasing trend over the past 20 years,
    from 865.55 million kg in 1998 to 1471.69 million kg in 2018. The carbon footprint
    increased by 606.14 million kg and average annual growth rate was 3%. The growth
    rate of GHG emissions peaked in 2004 at 12%. The carbon footprint of electricity
    for irrigation and diesel for agricultural machinery grew significantly, and their
    proportion in the total carbon footprint gradually increased. The production and
    processing of fertilizers and the application of irrigation electricity were the
    main contributors to the carbon footprint of Bayan Nur City, accounting for 32
    and 33%, respectively. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 4. Spatial and temporal variation of carbon footprint. The
    carbon footprint of each region of Bayan Nur City and its composition are shown
    in Fig. 4b. Linhe District, Wuyuan County, and Urad Qianqi were the main areas
    of carbon footprint generation, followed by Urad Zhongqi, Hangjin Houqi, and Dengkou
    County. Urad Houqi had the smallest contribution to the carbon footprint, with
    the proportion increasing from 1% in 1998 to 4% in 2018, and the carbon footprint
    increasing by 42.74 million kg. Dengkou County is the area with the most significant
    carbon footprint change, with the proportion increasing from 3% in 1998 to 15%
    in 2018, and its carbon footprint increased by 187.61 million kg. Before 2010,
    the carbon footprints of Hangjin Houqi and Urad Zhongqi changed only slightly.
    After 2010, the carbon footprints of Hangjin Houqi and Urad Zhongqi gradually
    decreased and increased, respectively. 4.2. Assessment of the carbon footprint
    influencing factors The change in carbon footprint is the result of the combined
    influence of the energy structure, energy intensity, level of economic development,
    population size factors. The contribution of each influencing factor to the change
    in the carbon footprint is shown in Fig. 5. For the whole Bayan Nur City, energy
    structure factor would be an inhibiting factor to the increase in carbon footprint.
    Energy intensity factor would be a promoting factor to the increase in carbon
    footprint before 2007 and an inhibiting factor after 2007. The level of economic
    development factor would be an inhibiting factor to the increase in carbon footprint
    before 2003 and a promoting factor after 2003. Population size factor would be
    not an important influencing factor to the change in carbon footprint until 2004
    and become an inhibiting factor to the increase in carbon footprint after 2004,
    while the effect would be weak. In general, the level of economic development
    factor would be the key factor influencing the change in carbon footprint since
    2004, and contribute to the increase in carbon footprint. The level of economic
    development factor would have a more significant effect on the change in carbon
    footprint than the other three influencing factors. Download : Download high-res
    image (956KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 5. Contribution of factors
    influencing the change in carbon footprint over the years. The assessment of factors
    influencing the carbon footprint by district showed that the population size factor
    would have little influence on the change in carbon footprint in each district.
    With the development of the Bayan Nur City, the main factor promoting the increase
    in carbon footprint in each district would transition from energy intensity to
    the level of economic development factors, and the main factor inhibiting the
    increase in carbon footprint would transition from the level of economic development
    to energy structure and energy intensity factors. Except for Linhe District and
    Dengkou County, energy structure factor would be not an important factor influencing
    the change in carbon footprint, while energy intensity factor would be a main
    factor inhibiting the increase in carbon footprint. Except for Dengkou County,
    energy structure factor would inhibit the increase in the carbon footprint. In
    general, The level of economic development factor would be the key factor influencing
    the increase in the carbon footprint in each district. This indicates that the
    regulation of the level of economic development would significantly influence
    the agricultural carbon footprint in Bayan Nur City. 4.3. Optimization of the
    crop cultivation pattern 4.3.1. Selected optimal optimization solutions The analysis
    results showed that the carbon footprint of the Bayan Nur City showed an overall
    increasing trend from 1998 to 2018, whereas the economic development factor would
    be the key influencing factor for carbon footprint change. The NSGA-II algorithm
    was used to solve the MOO model and obtained the PF consisting of a series of
    non-dominated solutions, as shown in Fig. 6a. There are 200 optimal solutions
    obtained that are in the same non-dominated rank, and the increase in economic
    benefits would come with an increase in the carbon footprint. To reduce the burden
    on decision-makers, the maximum harmonic mean and knee points methods were applied
    to deal with this problem. The two extreme solutions were also selected for comparison.
    The selected solutions are shown in Fig. 6a. The maximum harmonic mean (HM) of
    the two objectives was calculated as shown in Fig. 6b. The knee point (KP) divided
    the PF into two segments, and the small increase in economic benefits would lead
    to the significant increase in carbon footprint for the latter segment compared
    to the former segment of the PF. Fig. 6c compares the objective values before
    and after optimization. MI would be the minimum value that could be achieved for
    the carbon footprint objective and MA would be the maximum value that could be
    achieved for the economic benefits objective. The economic benefits objective
    value would range from −3.6% to 8.7% and the carbon footprint objective value
    would range from −17.1% to −0.4%. Optimal management of crop cropping structure
    could both increase economic benefits and reduce the carbon footprint produced
    from crop cultivation. KP is the knee point, with the economic benefits decreasing
    by 3.6% and the carbon footprint decreasing by 16.8%. HM is the maximum harmonic
    mean point, with the economic benefits increasing by 2.4% and the carbon footprint
    decreasing by 10.2%. HM would provide a reasonable compromise between the two
    objectives. Download : Download high-res image (529KB) Download : Download full-size

    value of the objective one after homogenization and normalization; f2: the value
    of the objective one after homogenization and normalization). 4.3.2. Optimal crop
    cultivation pattern Two objective decision making methods, the maximum harmonic
    mean and knee points methods, were used to provide solutions of potential interest
    to decision-makers, namely, HM and KP. The overall situation before and after
    optimization is shown in Fig. 7a. The adjustment of the crop cultivation pattern
    was illustrated using HM as an example. Compared with the planting structure before
    optimization, the optimized planting structure would increase economic benefits
    by 412.49 million yuan, reduce carbon footprint by 149.11 million kg, and reduce
    water resource consumption by 261.72 million m3. The planting area of wheat, corn
    and sunflower should be reduced, and that of tomato and melon should be increased.
    Before and after optimization, corn and sunflower would be the most important
    crops, and their planting area would account for about 40% of the planting area
    of the five major crops. Since the irrigation quotas for tomato and melon are
    small, and that for corn and wheat are relatively large, the adjustment of the
    planting structure would not only reduce the carbon footprint, increase economic
    benefits, but also greatly save water resources. Download : Download high-res

    pattern (BO: before optimization; KP: knee point; HM: the maximum harmonic mean;
    MI: objective 2 minimum; MA: objective 1 maximum). The adjustment of planting
    structure in each region of Bayan Nur City is shown in Fig. 7b. The planting area
    of sunflower in Linhe District should be increased. The planting area of corn
    in Wuyuan County, Linhe District and Hangjin Houqi, and sunflower in Urad Qianqi
    should be reduced. Acreage for the remaining crops in other regions would require
    only minor adjustments or keep basically the same. Compared with the period before
    optimization, the carbon footprints and economic benefits generated by the cultivation
    of corn in Wuyuan County and sunflowers in Urad Qianqi would decrease significantly.
    The carbon footprint generated by the cultivation of tomato would increase slightly,
    accompanied by a significant increase in economic benefits in Wuyuan County and
    Hangjin Houqi (Fig. S4). The sources of carbon footprint before and after optimization
    are shown in Fig. S5. After adjusting the crop planting structure, the main links
    that generate carbon footprint remain unchanged. Before optimization, the carbon
    footprint mainly came from Linhe District, Wuyuan County, and Dengkou County.
    Compared with before optimization, the contribution of Urad Qianqi and Hangjin
    Houqi to the agricultural carbon footprint would significantly increase. At the
    same time, the carbon footprint of Dengkou County and Urad Houqi would significantly
    reduce. It showed that Dengkou County and Urad Houqi had great emission reduction
    potential. 5. Discussion 5.1. Models comparison 5.1.1. Comparison of intelligent
    optimization algorithms In order to evaluate the performance of NSGA-II used in
    this paper, a comparison with MOPSO was conducted. The solutions were computed
    using MATLAB R2020b software with specific settings. The repository size and number
    of grids per dimension were set to 200 and 7, respectively. The inflation rate,
    leader selection pressure, deletion selection pressure, and mutation rate were
    0.1, 2, 2, and 0.1, respectively. The PF consisting of a series of non-dominated
    solutions was obtained after 300 iterations, as shown in Fig. S6. The results
    were evaluated statistically and explored accordingly (Carrasco et al., 2017,
    2020; Ma et al., 2023). To determine whether there were significant differences
    between the results obtained by NSGA-II and MOPSO, tests for normality and homogeneity
    of variance were conducted. The results of Kolmogorov-Smirnov test showed that
    the solutions obtained by both methods obey normal distribution, as shown in Table
    S1. The results of one-way ANOVA test showed heterogeneity of variance (Table
    S2), leading to the utilization of Welch''s t-test and Bayesian Mann-Whitney U
    test using JASP. As shown in Table 3, since the p-value is less than 0.05, which
    rejects the null hypothesis (Ho). This indicates that the results obtained by
    the two algorithms for F1 (economic benefits) are significantly different. Moreover,
    the effect size is greater than 0.5, indicating a substantial effect in this t-test
    result. As shown in Fig. S7, the Bayes factor further supports the alternative
    hypothesis, and most of the posterior distribution falls on large values of the
    effect size. The Bayesian Mann-Whitney U test yields similar outcomes to the Welch''s
    t-test. In Fig. S8(a), the raincloud plot of statistical tests for F1 demonstrates
    that the economic benefits of the solutions obtained using NSGA-II are higher
    than those with MOPSO. Similarly, Fig. S8(b) shows the raincloud plot of the statistical
    tests for F2 (carbon footprint), indicating that the carbon footprint of the solutions
    obtained by NSGA-II is lower than those generated by MOPSO. Considering that agricultural
    economic benefits are a “bigger-the-better” objective, and agricultural carbon
    footprint is a “smaller-the-better” objective, the results suggest that NSGA-II
    outperforms MOPSO in terms of GHG mitigation in the context of this study''s application.

    methods To demonstrate the superiority of two decision making methods for multi-objective
    agricultural GHG reduction study, the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP)
    method was introduced for evaluating and selecting non-dominated solutions. The
    construction of the indicator system and the judgment matrix for FAHP were provided
    in the Supplementary Material. Expert judgments were categorized into three preferences:
    ecology-economy-society, economy-ecology-society, and economy-society-ecology.
    The preference “ecology-economy-society” indicated that experts favored ecology
    indicators. The solutions selected by the maximum harmonic mean, knee points,
    and FAHP methods were compared, as summarized in Table 4. The comprehensive evaluation
    value of the non-dominated solutions was calculated using the FAHP method, as
    shown in Fig. S9. The results showed that the maximum harmonic mean and knee points
    methods used in this study yielded solutions similar to those obtained by the
    FAHP method. This indicates that the two decision making methods utilized in this
    study could successfully identify solutions of potential interest to stakeholders
    without inputting subjective preferences. In practical applications, decision-makers
    may struggle to specify preferences when they have limited knowledge of optimal
    objective values. Therefore, the maximum harmonic mean and knee points methods
    used in this study could provide solutions in a concise and efficient manner,
    confirming the superiority applied to multi-objective agricultural GHG mitigation
    study. Table 4. Selected non-dominated solutions. Empty Cell F1 (billion yuan)

    planting structure optimization model for agricultural GHG mitigation was presented.
    Environmental impacts of crop production were measured using the LCA method. Several
    previous literature have made contributions on GHG emissions from crop production.
    For example, Zhang and Zhang (2016) accounted for the carbon footprints of winter
    wheat and summer corn in China''s primary production regions, revealing carbon
    footprints of 5455 and 4052 kgCO2eq/hm2, respectively. Song and Mu (2016) accounted
    for the carbon footprint of facility vegetables in China, finding it to be approximately
    1197 kgCO2eq/hm2. In this study, the carbon footprints of five major crops in
    Bayan Nur City were accounted for, yielding the following results for crop production:
    wheat (2700 kgCO2eq/hm2), corn (2766 kgCO2eq/hm2), sunflower (1838 kgCO2eq/hm2),
    tomato (2913 kgCO2eq/hm2), and melon (1560 kgCO2eq/hm2). Differences in these
    carbon footprint results can be attributed primarily to variations in the selection
    of life cycle and system boundaries. Many studies have commonly assessed the influencing
    factors of agricultural carbon footprint using methods such as SVAR and LMDI (Balogh,
    2019; Ma et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2019; Zhen et al., 2017). Generally, the level
    of economic development has been identified as a key influencing factor for carbon
    footprint growth and was often a significant contributor (Huang and Gao, 2022;
    Zhen et al., 2017). In this study, the results of the influencing factor assessment
    using Kaya-LMDI also showed that the economic development level factor played
    a crucial role in driving changes in the carbon footprint in Bayan Nur City. This
    factor was found to be a substantial contributor to the increase in carbon footprint
    in the region. Previous MOO models aimed at mitigating agricultural GHG emissions
    often fell short of identifying Pareto optimal solutions (Yue and Guo, 2021; Zhang
    et al., 2021a) due to their transformation into single-objective optimization
    models. Even when studies like Ren et al. (2022) and Wang et al. (2021) utilized
    NSGA-Ⅱ to solve MOO models related to planting structure and obtained PF, they
    still faced challenges in selecting solutions from the PF for decision-makers.
    In contrast to prior research, the integration of LCA, Kaya-LMDI and MOO in this
    study could objectively set carbon footprint influencing factors as optimization
    objective functions and assign their importance according to the degree of impact.
    This approach holds the potential to develop more pertinent and effective technological
    solutions for mitigating the agricultural carbon footprint. Furthermore, the integration
    of LCA, MOO, the maximum harmonic mean and knee points methods could not only
    generate the allocation strategies of agricultural land resources from the PF
    and provide them for decision-makers without inputting subjective preferences,
    but also give the environmental impacts of each allocation scheme. Life cycle
    optimization by integrating value-chain decisions from the LCA domain in optimization
    is equally important for mitigating the agricultural carbon footprint. However,
    the consideration of the complete value-chain makes data acquisition more difficult
    (Thakker and Bakshi, 2021), and the need to reasonably identify alternatives at
    each stage of the cyclic network according to the characteristics of the study
    area (You and Wang, 2011), which makes this method highly complex in practical
    application. In addition, uncertainty representations of meta-heuristic algorithms
    have been available in current research to solve problems where parameters have
    interval (Gong et al., 2013, 2014) or fuzzy (Ghasemi, 2013) characteristics to
    make the solutions more robust. These issues may be considered in future research.
    The carbon footprint coefficients of agricultural production in this study were
    obtained from multiple studies, and the localized carbon footprint coefficients
    should be updated continuously in the future to improve the accuracy and validity
    of the optimization results. Additionally, when applying the systematic framework
    proposed in this study, the time series of the data in the study area must be
    longer to increase the reliability of the results. To obtain efficient and accurate
    solutions for adjusting the crop planting structure and reducing the carbon footprint,
    all the above problems deserve consideration. The proposed approach can provide
    a decision-support tool for the Bayan Nur City and other similar regions to reduce
    GHG emissions from agricultural production to ensure ecological protection. 6.
    Conclusions This study presents a AAODM approach for agricultural GHG mitigation.
    It has two major advantages and improvements, as follows: (i) it successfully
    clarified the spatial and temporal variation of the multi-year agricultural carbon
    footprint of multiple crops and incorporated it into planting structure optimization
    models. (ii) It could objectively determine the optimization objective functions
    by assessing the influencing factors of the carbon footprint and provide decision
    making methods after identifying the PF to obtain the optimal planting structure.
    The proposed approach was applied to a case study of agricultural cropping management
    in Bayan Nur City of China to demonstrate its applicability and the main conclusions
    were as follows: The carbon footprint of Bayan Nur City had an overall increasing
    trend, with an average annual growth rate of 3% over the past 20 years. The assessment
    of influencing factors showed that the level of economic development was the key
    factor contributing to the increase in the carbon footprint. With the development
    of Bayan Nur City, the main factor promoting the increase in carbon footprint
    would transition from energy intensity to the level of economic development factors,
    and the main factor inhibiting the increase in carbon footprint would transition
    from the level of economic development to energy structure and energy intensity
    factors. The regulation of the level of economic development would significantly
    influence the agricultural carbon footprint in Bayan Nur City. An efficient reduction
    in carbon footprint could be achieved by adjusting the crop planting structure
    to regulate the economic benefits. Compared with the current cropping structure,
    the optimized Pareto solution set shows that the economic benefits and carbon
    footprint would change in the ranges of −3.6 to 8.7% and −17.1 to −0.4%. Decision
    making methods were used to select solutions from the PF to provide decision-makers
    with two optimal crop cultivation patterns. Solution KP showed that the economic
    benefits and carbon footprint would be decreased by 3.6 and 16.8%, respectively.
    Solution HM showed that the economic benefits would be increased by 2.4% and the
    carbon footprint would be decreased by 10.2%. To evaluate the performance of the
    proposed approach, the comparison with other MOO methods and decision making methods
    were employed. MOPSO was also used to solve the MOO problem in this study. Welch''s
    t-test and Bayesian Mann-Whitney U test were used to compare whether there were
    differences between the results of NSGA-II and MOPSO. The results showed that
    the solutions obtained by NSGA-II was superior to MOPSO in terms of carbon reduction
    in the application of this paper. The FAHP method was introduced to evaluate and
    select the non-dominated solutions. The results showed that the maximum harmonic
    mean and knee points methods were superior to FAHP and could provide solutions
    in a concise and efficient manner without inputting subjective preferences. The
    model''s performance have demonstrated the effectiveness of the methodology proposed
    in this study. In conclusion, by incorporating LCA, Kaya-LMDI, MOO and decision
    making methods into a unified framework, a AAODM approach was developed to provide
    solutions for mitigating agricultural GHG emissions. The effectiveness of the
    proposed approach in addressing GHG emissions problems of the agricultural systems
    has been verified, which also serves as a paradigm for solving other complex systems’
    GHG emissions issues. CRediT authorship contribution statement Yuhan Han: Software,

    conference paper PDF 1 Introduction Agriculture consumes the freshest water globally
    and is arguably the most mismanaged in its use. A nation’s capability to sustain
    its social and economic systems depends on its ability to utilise water for irrigation
    effectively. Maximizing yield per unit of supplied water is the goal of efficient
    water use. Irrigation water management’s primary goal is to increase agricultural
    production per unit of water. This is crucial to India’s ability to sustain its
    social, economic, and environmental systems. In India, rainfall and river runoff
    have a fairly irregular relationship; most rivers have seasonal runoff. Additionally,
    the discrepancy between supply and demand shows marked variation. As a result,
    reservoirs on the rivers are required to close the supply–demand mismatch. In
    India, many reservoirs have been commissioned and put into service. These reservoirs
    are multipurpose projects and are used for hydropower production, irrigation,
    municipal drinking water supply etc. However, most of the reservoirs were built
    exclusively for irrigation. The mainstays of water management systems are reservoirs,
    but they demand significant investments in terms of money, land, and the environment
    planning. Benefits from reservoir are realised only if the reservoir is planned
    and operated in an optimal way. In the last three decades, the focus of researches
    on evolutionary algorithms that imitate the animal genetics or flocking behaviour
    of animals has increased significantly. A conventional optimisation technique
    has been obsolete since decades. Numerous studies have been published and Adeyemo
    [1], Ahmad et al. [2], and Neboh et al. have examined the methodologies [16].
    Genetic algorithms (GA) have been used as a key tool in this category for reservoir
    operation and management. All of the GA’s features are compiled in Goldberg’s
    [12] textbook. The GA is a search heuristic tool that mimics natural evolutionary
    processes including inheritance, mutation, selection, and crossover. Numerous
    studies have helped to improve GA, particularly by merging it with other methods
    (hybrid) and evaluating performance [3, 11, 15] first applied GA to a four-reservoir
    problem in their paper. Nicklow et al. [17] have presented a state of the art
    paper on GA and applied its tool extensions to the water resources management
    problems. The problems of reservoir systems have been dealt extensively by many
    researchers [4]. Reddy and Kumar [18], Jotiprakash and Ganeshsan [13], Azamathulla
    et al. [7], Chen et al. [9], Mathur and Nikam [14], Scola et al. [20], Anand et
    al. [6]. The current study uses a GA model to develop a release programme that
    optimally distributes the reservoir’s water storage across various crops over
    a range of fortnights. The Samrat Ashok Sagar Reservoir on the River Halali in
    the Madhya Pradesh districts of Vidisha and Raisen is the case study. The reservoir’s
    command area is also known as the “bowl of wheat” which means that the wheat is
    produced in abundance in the command area. It produces Sharbati Wheat of the highest
    grade, which is well-known both in India and abroad. 2 Method In the present work,
    the water management problem is optimised using the GA technique. The study’s
    precise goals are to maximise yield and allocate water in a scenario with many
    crops and harvesting scenario. The issue is resolved in three steps. The initial
    step entails acquiring information on the cropping patterns and local meteorological
    data in the command area. The second stage involves calculating the fortnightly
    crop water requirements using the Penman Monteith method [5] and evaluating the
    relative yield ratios using [10] and other sources. The third stage consists of
    data preparation and solving the models to produce results, which are presented
    in the following section. 3 Computation of Demand The CROPWAT-8.0 Software, which
    is an open access freeware, is used to estimate the evapotranspiration of the
    reference crop. The Reference Evapotranspiration (RET), also known as ETo, is
    the rate of evapotranspiration from a reference surface with a hypothetical grass
    crop sown without any water scarcity. It makes use of a variety of inputs pertaining
    to the local area’s climate, geography, soil types, and water quality. The software
    has the required tools to automatically relate the many existing formulae utilising
    the various inputs to generate the water requirements and maximum yield for each
    crop of interest. The software makes the assumption that all other agricultural
    production input elements (such as pesticides, knowledge, seeds, etc.) are maintained
    at their optimum levels. The equation used is the FAO Penman–Monteith Equation.
    The reference evapotranspiration value in ith season (ETo) is calculated as per
    the Eq. 1) (1998) $$ET_{o} = \\frac{{0.408 \\Delta \\left( {R_{n} - G} \\right)
    + \\Upsilon \\frac{900}{{T + 273}} u_{2} \\left( {e_{s} - e_{a} } \\right)}}{{\\Delta
    + \\Upsilon \\left( {1 + 0.34 u_{2} } \\right)}}$$ (1) where: ETo = the reference
    evapotranspiration [mm/day], Rn = net radiation received at the crop surface [MJ
    m−2 day−1], G = the soil heat flux density [MJ m−2 day−1], T = the mean daily
    air temperature at 2 m height [°C], u2 = wind speed at 2 m height [m s−1], es
    =  saturation vapour pressure [kPa] at T [°C], ea = actual vapour pressure [kPa],
    Δ = slope of vapour pressure curve [kPa °C−1], γ = the psychrometric constant
    [kPa °C−1]. The crop evapotranspiration for the various crops sown in an area
    is necessary to determine each crop’s seasonal water needs. The reference evapotranspiration
    (\\(ET_{o}^{i}\\)) values computed for different fortnights i were multiplied
    by the crop coefficient (\\({k}_{c}^{i})\\) to get the crop evapotranspiration
    (\\({ET}_{c}^{i}\\)) (Eq. 2). $$ET_{c}^{i} = k_{c}^{i} * ET_{o}^{i} .$$ (2) 4
    Development of Model The formulation and optimisation of the Samrat Ashok Sagar
    Reservoir’s operation problem is described below along with the constraints of
    the objective function. 4.1 Objective Function In the present study, the two different
    problems with different objective functions were solved. 4.1.1 Additive Model:
    Objective Function 1 The GA model’s Objective function is to minimise the sum
    of the squared deviations of the mass balance equation and the irrigation demand
    deficit. (Eq. 1) The name “additive function” refers to this objective function.
    Reddy and Kumar [18, 19], Azamathulla et al. [7], Mathur and Nikam [14] are only
    a few researchers who have used this type of objective function in the past. The
    objective function was not weighed by the crop sensitivity factor to the water
    deficiency in different growth stages in the works of Reddy and Kumar [18], Mathur
    and Nikam [14]. The objective function in the current study is the squared deficit
    between the releases and demand of each crop in each season (Eq. 3). $$\\begin{aligned}
    {\\text{min}}\\;f\\left( x \\right) & = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{nc = 1}^{NC}
    \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{t = 1}^{N} ky_{t}^{nc} \\left( {R_{t,nc} - D_{t,nc} }
    \\right)^{2} \\\\ & \\quad + \\;\\mathop \\sum \\limits_{t = 1}^{N} \\left( {S_{t}
    \\left( {1 - B*e_{t} } \\right) - S_{t + 1} \\left( {1 + B*e_{t} } \\right) +
    I_{t} - \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{nc = 1}^{NC} R_{t,nc} - A_{o} *e_{t} } \\right)^{2}
    \\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ (3) Rt,nc = release in the period t = 1, 2…, N for crop
    nc  = 1, 2, …, NC (MCM), Dt,nc = demand to sustain the crop nc  = 1, 2,…, NC in
    the period t  = 1, 2…, T (MCM), \\({ky}_{t}^{nc}\\) = yield response factor for
    time period t = 1, 2…, N of crop nc  = 1, 2…, NC, St  = Storage at time period
    t =  1, 2…, N (MCM), St+1 = Storage at time period t + 1 (MCM), It = Inflow at
    time period t =  1, 2…, N (MCM), Ao and B  =  Regression constant correlating
    surface area (Ha) and storage value, \\({e}_{t}\\) = Rate of evaporation at each
    fortnight in (mm). 4.1.2 Multiplicative Model: Objective Function 2 The multiplicative
    model (Eq. 4) is more realistic and takes into account the effect of deficits
    to other seasons. In contrast, the additive model discussed in the previous paragraph
    has the limitation that it works in local time and the optimisation model does
    not have the effect of the deficits that occurred in other time periods. $$\\begin{aligned}

    \\\\ \\end{aligned}$$ (4) 4.2 Constraints Constraints of the Objective functions
    are two; Demand constraint and Capacity Constraint which are based on maximum
    irrigation demand and live storage capacity of the reservoir. 4.2.1 Demand/Release
    Constraints (Irrigation Demand) To sustain the crops, irrigation releases must
    be more than or equal to zero. However, they must not exceed the maximum irrigation
    demand in order to achieve the desired yield. $${0} \\le R_{t,nc} \\le D_{t,nc}$$
    (5) 4.2.2 Capacity Constraints (Reservoir Storage) Each fortnight, the reservoir’s
    storage should not be more or less than its live storage or less than its dead
    storage. $${\\text{S}}_{\\min } \\le {\\text{S}}_{{\\text{t}}} \\le {\\text{S}}_{\\max
    }$$ (6) Reservoir data were subjected to a reservoir operation study based on
    the models discussed in the text. The results show that, even in situations with
    insufficient storage, the optimisation strategy can improve the annual net benefits.
    Under a multi-crop scenario there is a competition for the available water whenever
    the water available is less than the irrigation demands. The reservoir operation
    component releases water from the reservoir optimally, while the multi-crop water
    allocation component distributes water to various crops by evaluating how sensitive
    crop production is to moisture stress at various plant physiological growth phases.
    For operation throughout the Rabi (dry weather) Season, a single reservoir with
    multiple crop irrigation is taken into consideration in the current study. The
    evaluation and model formulation of various components of the study are presented
    in following paragraphs. 5 Data Collection and Discussion The data used in the
    analysis was gathered from a number of sources including The Central Water Commission
    [8] and various state level offices of the M.P. The information regarding the
    cropping pattern and physical characteristics of the reservoir was provided by
    Water Resources Departments in Bhopal, the IMD website, the Water Portal website,
    and other sources. The irrigation during the Rabi Season is taken into account
    in the current issue, and in Table 1 the cropping pattern is displayed. The uncertainty
    of the monsoon season in India directly affects the runoff to the reservoir, which
    could cause variations in the reservoirs’ filling levels. To investigate the issue
    in the current study, 6 alternative beginning storage levels in the reservoir
    were used. These are 204.2, 181.52, 158.53, 136.14, 113.45, 226.9 (full storage),
    181.52, and the rest. The total command area is 37419 Ha, of which 32292 Ha, or
    86.30%, will be covered by the reservoir system. Table 2 displays the crop duration
    used for the present study. Table 3 displays the evapotranspiration values for
    the chosen reference crop. Table 1 Rabi season (cropping patterns) Full size table

    Evapo-Transpiration (ETo) values for the command area have been calculated for
    various growth seasons of Rabi Season (Dry Weather) crops using the local meteorological
    data and the CROPWAT 8.0 Software. The crop evapotranspiration coefficients were
    multiplied by the ETo values to create the crop evapo-transpiration (ETc) values
    for various crops (Eq. 2). Eventually, after the correct conversion and application
    of efficiency factors, the demands for the various seasons were calculated using
    the net sown area. In Table 4, sample findings for the Wheat crop are displayed.
    The demands for other crops have been calculated along similar lines. Table 4

    at Various Initial Storages The problem was approached using both the Additive
    and Multiplicative Models, according to the formulation described in the preceding
    discussions (Eqs. 3–6). For the Wheat crop, Fig. 1 calculates and displays the
    real demands, computed releases from the Additive Model and the Multiplicative
    Models in each week for various levels of beginning reservoir storage values.

    image Both models estimated the releases for various crops in the command area
    in a similar way. The objective of the present study is to increase all crops’
    yield ratios in order to increase production. By dividing the total volume by
    the crop area and using the proper conversion factor, the releases calculated
    from the optimisation model for various crops in various fortnights at various
    levels of initial storage values in the reservoir are used to determine the amount
    of water to be supplied to the crop. The procedure comprises of solving three
    equations (Eqs. 7–9) at each time step to solve for the Actual Evapo-transpiration
    and the soil moisture storage in the root zone of each crop in various time periods.
    The relative yield is computed as per Eq. (10). $${\\mathrm{SM}}_{t+1}*{Z}_{t+1}={\\mathrm{SM}}_{t}*{Z}_{t}+{R}_{t}+{X}_{t}+{S}_{o}\\left({Z}_{t+1}-{Z}_{t}\\right)-{\\mathrm{AET}}_{t}$$

    reservoir namely the Samrat Ashok Sagar Reservoir (Halali Project) in Vidisha
    and Raisen Districts of Madhya Pradesh. The study is focussed on optimising irrigation
    water use for five crops in the command area during the Rabi season of arid weather.
    A Genetic Algorithm is used as the optimisation technique on the MATLAB platform.
    Two optimisation problems were formulated and solved using GA. The first is an
    additive model in which minimisation function is used and the weighted squared
    deviation of the demands/actual releases for all crops in all seasons is added.
    The weights represent the relative crop yield factors for the various time periods.
    The second is a multiplicative model that aims to minimise the weighted squared
    deviation addition for all crops during a season when they are multiplied together
    during the whole cropping season. Different levels of the reservoirs’ initial
    storage values were applied to the models. The study’s findings show that the
    model can be applied to optimally operate reservoirs for irrigation planning.
    The water is distributed among the various crops in various time periods in an
    optimal manner by the model created in the current study. There is competition
    among the crops at a reservoir storage level of 113.45 MCM inspite of all of the
    crops’ demands for higher storage values having met fully. At this level, supply
    deficits and deficit allocations are made in order to maximise potential relative
    yields. The findings for the additive model show that the principal crop wheat
    receives all the required water at this initial storage level. Water shortages
    affect the other crops. When the multiplicative model is solved, the other crops
    benefit at the expense of a production shortfall of wheat. Even under deficit
    situations, the multiplicative model typically produces better relative yield
    figures than the additive model. References Adeyemo JA (2011) Reservoir operation

  description: Greywater, with limited content of pathogens, makes up more than half
    of the produced wastewater in urban areas. Given the high cost of wastewater management
    and treatment, it causes sense to collect greywater separately at the source and
    employ an on-site treatment system to increase opportunities for on-site water
    reuse. For this purpose, this paper aims to propose a multilayer granular filter
    as an inexpensive and simple on-site treatment method for greywater reuse. Furthermore,
    as determining the optimal structure of multilayer filters is a serious challenge,
    a simulation-optimization model is developed for determining the best filter configuration.
    An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is trained based on experimental results to
    simulate the filter performance with different combinations of layers and the
    Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used to find the optimal thickness of different layers
    based on ANN simulation results. The proposed filter in this paper for greywater
    treatment consists of silica sand (in three different gradings) and activated
    carbon (with fixed grading) and treatment measures for evaluation of filter performance
    are considered as Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD) and Electrical Conductivity (EC).
    Due to difficulties in collecting, transferring, and storing the real greywater,
    synthetic greywater was used in this study. 49 experiments with different combinations
    of filter media thicknesses were performed and the performance of the filter was
    analyzed. Generally, three-layer filters perform better in COD and EC reduction,
    however, the average COD and EC elimination equals 36.3% and 15.1%, respectively,
    which indicates more efficiency of filter in COD reduction in comparison with
    EC. Based on the optimization-simulation model and experimental results, a filter
    consisting of 33 cm of fine sand, 20 cm of activated carbon, and 7 cm of medium
    sand results in the maximum efficiency and can reduce the COD and EC of greywater
    by 72% and 30%, simultaneously. According to the optimization outputs, the ideal
    filter can treat greywater up to having EC of 1000 μS/cm and COD of 321 mg/L,
    which is generally suitable for irrigation purposes.

    GreywaterSand filterCODECOn-site treatmentOptimization 1. Introduction One of
    the unconventional sources of water is greywater. Greywater is the water coming
    out of the kitchen, dishwasher, bathroom, and washing machine; in fact, the water
    comes out of all sources in a house except toilets (Boyjoo et al., 2013; Abdel-shafy
    et al., 2015; Boano et al., 2020). Greywater could be used for aims that do not
    require drinking water quality, such as irrigation, heating and cooling, car washing,
    firefighting, flash tank system, recreational uses, and industrial usage (WHO
    Guidelines, 2013; Boyjoo et al., 2013; Al-Jayyousi, 2003; Vuppaladadiyam et al.,
    2019). Greywater includes, on average, 65%–70% (depending on the characteristics
    of the study area) of domestic wastewater (Morel and Diener, 2006; Oh et al.,
    2017; Boyjoo et al., 2013; Vuppaladadiyam et al., 2019). Greywater quantity and
    greywater quality correspond to diverse aspects, like living conditions, climatic
    and geographical conditions, water consumption, water price, population characteristics
    (age and gender), personal and social habits, water distribution and wastewater
    collection facilities, accessibility to water resources and type and amount of
    chemical materials used in household (Vuppaladadiyam et al., 2019; Oteng-Peprah
    et al., 2018; Boyjoo et al., 2013; Tsoumachidou et al., 2017). Fig. 1a and b display
    the percentage of greywater production from various resources in a residential

    Contribution of different resources in greywater production of (a) high-income
    and (b) low-income households (prepared based on data from Shaikh and Ahammed,
    2020). The quality of greywater generally is higher than sewage. So, it can be
    used as a primary treatment (Oron et al., 2014; Maimon and Gross, 2018). From
    an economic point of view, when the water price increases and available water
    decreases, the benefit of greywater reuse is justified (Maimon and Gross, 2018).
    Furthermore, greywater usage has economic benefits for both the consumer and producer.
    It will preserve water resources and reduce the volume of wastewater (Al-Jayyousi,
    2003). Acceptability and cost are two main aspects of greywater reuse (Rodríguez
    et al., 2020). Collecting and transporting real greywater to the laboratory for
    testing, especially in high volumes, is challenging. Anaerobic conditions will
    form, and the greywater will become highly pathogenic in case of non-standard
    storage for a long period. Dixon et al. (2000) demonstrated that storing greywater
    for up to 24 h helps to improve the water quality, while if the storage time exceeds
    48 h, dissolved oxygen will decrease, and the anaerobic process will generate
    an unpleasant odor in the water. On the other side, it has been stated that storing
    greywater for 24–48 h can improve water quality due to the settling of suspended
    solids (Boyjoo et al., 2013; Abed et al., 2020). Furthermore, storage of synthetic
    greywater has been reported for up to 7 days without any concerns (Abed and Scholz,
    2016). The characteristics of real greywater samples are not constant during the
    test. However, greywater with almost constant quality is required to evaluate
    and compare the performance of different treatment methods. For this reason, in
    many recent studies in the field of greywater, the required wastewater has been
    synthetically produced in a laboratory. Table 1 represents an overview of studies
    conducted on the production of synthetic greywater. In some studies, chemical
    substances are directly used for greywater generation which looks far from the
    reality of greywater composition. According to Tables 1 and in other group of
    studies, different amounts of common materials in a home are used to produce greywater
    based on different formulas, but the reason for each product selection is not
    described. Moreover, the formulation used for synthetic greywater production and
    storage details are not well presented. The target variables in producing greywater
    are also different. Therefore, in this study, synthetic greywater will be used
    for lab experiments while its formulation will be developed based on the defined
    treatment goal that is reduction of TDS and COD of greywater. Table 1. A summary
    of method and materials used for preparation of synthetic greywater in the literature.

    al. (2013) (adding oil, shampoo, washing machine powder, dishwashing liquid, and

    to the method of Praveena et al. (2020) • low-cost treatment of greywater using
    activated carbon. Nitrate and phosphate were the basis of grey water production
    and considered as 3.8 and 1.4 mg/L, respectively. Shahsavani et al. (2022) Similar
    to Babaei et al. (2018) • Investigating ozonation, filtration, and activated carbon

    was determined according to different studies) • Treating the synthetic greywater
    with lab-scale procedures • The synthetic greywater was produced based on the
    COD and Total Nitrogen and stored at cold area. COD = 504 mg/L Total Nitrogen
    = 23 mg/L Greywater treatment methods are divided into chemical, physical, biological,
    natural, or combination processes (Khalil and Liu, 2021; Albalawneh et al., 2017;
    Awasthi et al., 2023). The preference of a treatment method relies on various
    points, such as its cost, needed facilities, technical limitations, energy consumption,
    and the purpose of treatment (Devotta et al., 2007; Albalawneh et al., 2017).
    Developed greywater treatment strategies like sequencing batch reactors or membrane
    bioreactors require professional operators and have high investment and energy
    costs, so they cannot be used in any region and for any purpose (Rakesh et al.,
    2020; Khalil and Liu, 2021). On the other hand, filtration is a good choice for
    eliminating turbidity which can result in a reduction of mineral and volatile
    substances in water through screening and adsorption processes (Boano et al.,
    2020; Rakesh et al., 2020). Besides this, it is a cheap treatment method with
    the minimum operational demands (Gupta et al., 2023). As a result, filtration
    was a commonly utilized treatment of greywater in different scales. Considering
    these issues, filtration is used in this study for onsite greywater treatment
    (Gupta et al., 2023). In comparison to other methods, filtration can efficiently
    remove the majority of pollutants that are available in greywater (Ghaitidak and
    Yadav, 2013). According to Boano et al. (2020) and Ghaitidak and Yadav (2013),
    filtration systems typically remove COD and EC by 37–94% and 7–11%, respectively.
    Different kinds of materials, such as rice husk, activated carbon, sawdust, charcoal,
    and sand, are also utilized in greywater filtration to improve its treatment efficiency
    (Rakesh et al., 2020). Shrestha et al. (2001) proposed a greywater treatment system
    for kitchen, bathroom, and laundry wastewater. This filter included a 20 cm thickness
    of gravel particles with a diameter of 20–40 mm at the base, a 10 cm thickness
    of gravel particles with a diameter of 10 mm in the middle, and a 60 cm layer
    of coarse sand in the top layer. In this filter, ammonia and total nitrogen have
    been removed up to 90% and 70%, respectively. The influent COD was 100–400 mg/L,
    which decreased to 7–72 mg/L after treatment. No specific information about the
    optimal thickness and different types of materials (like activated carbon) were
    stated in this study. A guideline for greywater treatment in rural schools has
    been provided by the Environmental Engineering Research Institute of India (Devotta
    et al., 2007). This guideline recommends an on-site up flow–down flow filter consisting
    of gravel (with two-grain sizes of 40–50 mm), sand (1.0–1.4 mm), burnt bricks
    (15–30 mm), and fine sand (0.07–1 mm) with a total thickness of 0.75–1 m. This
    filter is able to reduce turbidity, suspended solids, and BOD5.3 The treated greywater
    could be used for flush tanks, irrigation, and ground washing. The cost and maintenance
    process of the filter were mentioned in this study, but how different configurations
    of the filter could affect its performance is not discussed. Rolland et al. (2009)
    mentioned that particle size and the compaction degree of particles are the most
    significant factors on its performance. The particle size determines the reliability
    and durability of the filtration system. The compaction of sand might cause filtration
    clogging as a practical or harmful effect during filter operation. In this research,
    there is no discussion on the optimal thickness of layers. Parjane and Sane (2011)
    indicated that an affordable and simple filter with a 20 cm coconut shell, 15
    cm sawdust (coarse), 20 cm charcoal, 10 cm bricks, and 15 cm sand layers could
    remove COD up to 82%. The reason of selecting materials and depth were not mentioned.
    Dalameh et al. (2012) investigated the ability of filters consisting of pine bark,
    activated carbon, polyurethane foam, and sand with an effective particle size
    (D104) of 0.4 mm and uniformity coefficient (Cu5) of 2.2 in reducing BOD5, surfactant,
    phosphorus, nitrogen, and microbial content of greywater. The filter had a cylindrical
    body with a diameter of 20 cm and four different materials, but the thickness
    of each material was constant (60 cm). In this study, pine bark and activated
    carbon could reduce the surfactant as well as the organic load of greywater. Moreover,
    EC removal was stated at 7% with pine bark and 11% with activated carbon. Saad
    et al. (2016) investigated the best filter structure consisting of various types
    of sands and activated carbon in COD reduction. They found that a filter with
    a total thickness of 200 cm and containing coarse sand (50 cm at the top and 20
    cm at the bottom), fine sand (70 cm), and rice husk (60 cm) could reduce COD up
    to 84%, but the optimal depth of materials was not evaluated. Albalawneh et al.
    (2017) analyzed tuff and gravel for greywater filtration. The filter was a cube
    with a height of 0.6 m and an area of 4 m2 with a slope of 1%. The removal rate
    of BOD, COD, and TSS6 when using gravel was 49, 51, and 76%, respectively, and
    when using volcanic tuff with a diameter of 7–14 mm the removal rates were 73,
    65, and 85%, respectively. The effect of particle size and layers depth on the
    filter performance were not considered in this study. Spychała et al. (2019) evaluated
    the efficacy of three sand filters in removing volatile solids and organic matters
    of synthetic greywater. Synthetic greywater was produced by adding washing powder,
    shampoo, shower gel, and liquid soap to potable water. In this investigation,
    50 cm of medium sand with D10 of 0.55 mm and D60 of 0.8 mm were employed as a
    filtering media. They achieved an average removal effectiveness of 26.8% for COD,
    while the EC increased slightly by 2%. Spychała et al. (2019) investigated a sand
    filtration performance in greywater treatment. In this filter the only material
    was sand and COD and EC removal rate of the filter was not satisfactory. (Khezri
    and Roshan Abkenar, 2019) investigated the turbidity removal efficiency of a granular
    filter consisting of granite and basalt construction waste. Three types of single-column
    cylindrical filters of sand/anthracite, granite/anthracite, and basalt/anthracite
    were used. The depths of sand, granite, and basalt were fixed and equal to 35
    cm; while the height of anthracite was variable (15, 30, and 45 cm) in three filters.
    The Cu, D10, and density of sand were measured as 1.45, 0.65 mm, and 2.11 gr/cm3,
    respectively. The average percentages of turbidity removal in sand/anthracite,
    granite/anthracite, and basalt/anthracite filters were 91.4, 92.1, and 92.9, respectively.
    In general, by increasing the depth of media, size of materials, and sharpness
    of aggregates, the efficiency of turbidity removal increases. The effectiveness
    of the filter in improving the other water quality measures should also be investigated.
    Tusiime et al. (2022) explored the effect of adding activated carbon in a multilayer
    filter at greywater treatment. Two filters were prepared. The first one consisted
    of gravel (20 cm), coarse sand (30 cm), and fine sand (70 cm), and in the second
    filter fine aggregate (50 cm), and granular activated carbon (20 cm) were also
    added to the first filter structure. Before filtration, sedimentation and screening
    have been done to increase filtration efficiency. COD removal of the first filter
    in 12, 24, and 36 h of retention times were 95.9%, 98.9%, and 96.2%, respectively.
    COD removal of the second filter with the same operation condition was 98.5%,
    99.4%, and 98.7%. Consequently, treated greywater can be utilized for irrigation
    purposes due to the its high quality. Gupta et al. (2023) analyzed the efficiency
    of different sands plus 6, 4, and 2 kg iron particle filter in turbidity reduction.
    The depth of the filter contained 5 cm gravel, 5 cm coarse sand, 15 cm fine sand,
    10 cm iron particle, and 15 cm fine sand from bottom to top (a total depth of
    50 cm). The filter with 6 kg iron particles and 66.5% COD reduction showed the
    best efficiency among others, which illustrates the direct relation between filter
    efficiency and iron depth. Additionally, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) was
    used to stimulate the filter performance in removing turbidity. The correlation
    coefficient between experimental and ANN simulation results showed a significant
    relationship with determination coefficient of 0.99 and an error percentage of
    ±1. Based on the recent studies in granular filtration, it could be stated that
    no optimum procedure has been introduced for achieving the maximum treatment of
    greywater. The greywater quality, especially COD, can be considerably improved
    through filtration utilizing low-cost materials such as sand, activated carbon,
    and wastes of different activities based on previous investigations. However,
    the important question of “what is the optimal percentage or thickness of different
    materials in a filter for maximum removal efficiency?” is not answered yet based
    on authors investigations. The thickness of each layer in a multilayer filter
    can affect the filter efficiency. In addition, as usually a variety of water quality
    measures are considered in treatment, it is critical to develop a structure for
    a filter that is able to efficiently remove all of the considered pollutants to
    the desired level. For example, when greywater is going to be used for irrigation,
    EC and COD are both important and should be at a specified level. Even though,
    the particle size of the filter significantly affects its reliability and durability;
    nevertheless, the main concentration of majority of researches is materials selection
    without paying attention to how material sizes could affect the filter performance.
    In addition, some studies have analyzed the greywater from special sources, for
    example, bath or kitchen basin, while it seems that a successful treatment process
    should be effective for all greywater sources. This research examines the removal
    rate of COD and EC (as main measures for irrigation purposes) using multilayer
    granular filters with a total thickness of 60 cm and different grading materials.
    Three kinds of sand as well as activated carbon in different configurations varying
    from one to four-layer have been used for developing the filter through 49 experiments.
    As the main innovation of this research, the performance of developed filters
    is simulated using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Then, Genetic Algorithm
    (GA) is used to determine the optimal thickness of different layers to achieve
    the maximum efficiency of the filter in greywater treatment. In this way, the
    high costs of developing physical and experimental models, are considerably reduced.
    2. Materials and methods The main goal of the research is to detect the optimal
    composition of a multilayer granular filter for achieving the maximum treatment
    level of greywater. Fig. 2 displays the proposed scheme for this purpose. The
    main steps of research include filter construction, defining investigation scenarios,
    choosing target variables for greywater treatment, producing synthetic greywater
    in the laboratory, selecting measuring methods, developing a simulation model
    using ANN, and finally, determining the optimal structure of the filter using
    GA. First, according to the available facilities, an on-site multilayer filter
    was made with low-cost materials. Then synthetic greywater, with almost a constant
    quality, representing the common characteristics of real greywater, was prepared.
    Different configurations are considered for filters development and their performance
    in greywater treatment are analyzed. In the next step, the collected data is used
    to develop an ANN model for simulation of filters’ treatment efficiency. Finally,
    a GA model is applied to determine the optimal thickness of each material in the
    multilayer filter for the maximum removal of COD and EC. Download : Download high-res

    for determining the optimal configuration of a multilayer filter for greywater
    treatment. 2.1. Pilot assembling The laboratory pilot of this study for greywater
    treatment includes a multilayer filter and a storage tank with a volume of 100
    L for greywater storage. The filter efficiency depends on size, weight, and thickness
    of filter layers as well as flow regime. The considered filter includes a maximum
    of three layers with an up flow–down flow regime based on Devotta et al. (2007)
    recommendation. Silica sand, garnet, and anthracite have been presented as ideal,
    available, and economical materials for water treatment in multilayer filters
    in the literature (Reynolds and Richards, 1996; Shaikh and Ahammed, 2022; Tusiime
    et al., 2022). Due to the non-accessibilitya of garnet and anthracite with a grain
    size of more than 1 mm, silica sand in three-grain sizes (coarse, medium, and
    fine aggregate) and activated carbon were selected as filter materials in this
    study considering their availability and being low cost. Materials grading based
    on ASTM7-C136, was measured using 3.8-inch, no.16, no.8, no.4, no.30, no.50, and
    no.100 sieves (ASTM international, 2006). Table 2 gives sieves analysis results
    for the used aggregate. In the literature, filters’ depths for greywater treatment
    range from 30 cm to 90 cm (Shaikh and Ahammed, 2022); therefore, the total thickness
    of the filter in this study is considered to be 60 cm, a common depth for a filter
    (Morel and Diener, 2006; Dalameh et al., 2012; Lalander et al., 2013). Table 2.

    The flow regime in the filter is up flow-down flow. The greywater enters from
    the top of the first column. After passing through the first layer as a downward
    flow, it enters the second column as an upward flow. Then, the flow passes through
    the third layer again as a downward flow, and finally, the treated greywater leaves
    the filter (Fig. 3). The filter contains three 47 30 cm plates and two 15 30 cm
    plates for the pilot walls and floor. The middle walls are formed by a 30 29 cm
    plate and a 26 30 cm plate. The first middle plate was connected to the walls
    with a 1 cm gap with the floor to permit flow from the first column to the second
    one. The second middle plate has a shorter length and is connected to the pilot
    floor to let water pass from the top of the second column to the third one. This
    space was created to conduct the water to the third column before overflowing
    the filter when the water was collected at the bottom of the first column. After
    assembling the filter, for a more uniform flow through the filter bed in the third
    column, a perforated aluminum plate was placed on top of the third column. One
    side of the aluminum plate was attached to the filter with glue so the water would
    enter the third column through the midpoint. Each filter can accommodate a 60
    cm thickness of material. Download : Download high-res image (351KB) Download

    depth of the filter (60 cm), 49 experiments with various thicknesses of three
    types of sand and activated carbon were considered to provide adequate data for
    the simulation model development. The experiments were divided into four categories.
    In the first group, which consists of four tests, the filter is made of just one
    material with a thickness of 60 cm. The second group includes 11 experiments and
    considers all four materials in filter development. In the same way, the third
    and fourth groups consider three and two materials in filter development, resulting
    in 16 and 18 tests, respectively. Table 3 shows the details of different designed
    experiments in each group. The total depth of the filter has been kept fixed at
    60 cm in all experiments. The greywater temperature is supposed to be 20 °C. The
    inflow rate of greywater was assumed to be fixed at 0.04 lit/s. Table 3. Layers’

    Synthetic greywater production Due to the unstable quality of greywater in households
    and the difficulty of collecting and transporting real samples of greywater, it
    was decided to prepare greywater synthetically in a volume of 80 L in the laboratory.
    The average greywater quality based on different studies is shown in Table 4.
    According to Table 4, the greywater quality is very variable, depending on its
    production resource characteristics. As this study aims to use treated greywater
    for irrigation, COD and EC were selected as target variables of greywater treatment.
    The data in Table 4, along with Morel and Diener (2006), are the basis for measuring
    greywater characteristics in this research. When reusing greywater for irrigation,
    pH should be between 6.5 and 4.8 (EPA, 2012)8, which is commonly satisfied with
    even untreated greywater, according to Table 4. Therefore, pH measurement is not
    necessary. Due to the diversity of greywater quality, synthetic greywater was
    made to represent the average COD in low-income and medium-income regions. The
    greywater COD in these zones ranges between 212 and 1270 mg/L based on Morel and
    Diener (2006), while it is reported to be between 60 and 1340 mg/L by Vuppaladadiyam
    et al. (2019). Therefore, in this research for producing synthetic greywater,
    the average of the suggested ranges, COD equivalent to 750 mg/L, has been considered.

    Morel and Diener (2006) To produce synthetic greywater, according to Gross et
    al. (2007) and Travis et al. (2010), the method of mixing commonly used products
    as representatives of three fundamental resources of household greywater (washing
    machine, bathroom, and kitchen) with drinking water has been used. Sugar, liquid
    oil, and dishwashing liquid were chosen as representatives of the products used
    in the kitchen. Shampoo and toothpaste were chosen as representatives of the products
    used in the bathroom and hand basin. Washing machine powder was chosen as the
    representative of the products used for laundry. One gram of each product was
    dissolved in 1 L of drinking water to determine how these products affect COD
    of water, and the consequent COD was measured. It helps to find the required amount
    of each product to produce synthetic greywater with a desired COD of 750 mg/L.
    The COD of 1 g of each product with the amount of them used to produce 80 L of
    greywater is shown in Table 5. The third column shows the composition ratio. Due
    to the lack of information, the composition ratio was determined based on the
    expert''s judgment. For example, the amount of washing machine powder is twice
    the amount of sugar. A small amount of oil is utilized in synthetic greywater
    production because the oil and fat should be removed, as much as possible, before
    entering the wastewater filtration operation. Table 5. Analysis of resulting COD

    to Table 5, was tested by the USEPA10 reactor (spectrophotometer) digestion method
    and with the DR/890 colorimeter (ASTM International, 2020; DR/890 Colorimeter,
    2013). The COD of the prepared greywater was 747 mg/L, which well matches with
    the desired value for the experiment. After producing greywater synthetically,
    EC was measured using a Hach HQ30d to be 850 S/cm, which is within the EC range
    of greywater in low-income and medium-income areas, between 300 and 1500 S/cm,
    based on Morel and Diener (2006). 2.4. Treatment process The filter flow through
    is set as 0.045 lit/s. The filter area equals 0.0225 m2, resulting in a hydraulic
    loading rate (HLR) of 2 lit/s.m2 (0.002 m/s). This rate is determined based on
    the suggested rate for multilayer filters for advanced wastewater treatment by
    Reynolds and Richards (1996), Shaikh and Ahammed (2022), and Albalawneh et al.
    (2017). For instance, Reynolds and Richards (1996) suggested HLR between 1.36
    and 6.79 lit/s.m2. 2.5. Artificial neural network Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)
    are intelligent procedures that establish a good relationship between input and
    output data with pattern recognition (Shahin et al., 2004). An Artificial Neural
    Network is formed of interconnected neurons, which take inputs, multiply them
    by weights, and then add a fixed number (bias). Next, the result is entered via
    a non-linear operation to create an outcome (Ding et al., 2013; Juan and Valdecantos,
    2022; Esmaeeli varaki et al., 2005). Eq. (1) shows the relationship between the
    output and inputs of a neuron (Esmaeeli varaki et al., 2005). (1) where the weights
    are displayed by w, b contains the setting of the network parameters, f is the
    activation operator, and a is the final outcome of the neuron. The training data
    are employed to modify the weights and biases of the ANN model. On the other hand,
    validation data are utilized to assess the model behavior and determine if it
    is suitable for the intended purpose. Testing data is utilized to define the accuracy
    of model in dealing with new data that was not used in the previous phases of
    model development (Ding et al., 2013; Adeli, 2001; Esmaeeli varaki et al., 2005).
    The purpose of modeling in this research is to simulate filter performance in
    terms of COD and EC removal efficiency using two separate ANN models. For this
    purpose, four inputs, including coarse sand thickness (x1), medium sand thickness
    (x2), fine sand thickness (x3), activated carbon thickness (x4), and an output
    (y), are selected. Fig. 4 displays the general structure of the developed ANN
    models. An input, a hidden, and an output layers feed-forward neural network,
    which consists of a sigmoid activation process in hidden and linear process in
    final layer neurons, is considered in this study, as based on the previous investigations,
    it can deliver the best results for the majority of cases (Gupta et al., 2023).
    The network was trained with different neurons (one to eight neurons) to achieve
    the best neural network structure for simulating the filter performance in removing
    COD and EC. Download : Download high-res image (195KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Schematic structure of inputs and output of artificial neural network
    in this research. The numerical criteria of coefficient of determination (R2)
    and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) are applied to estimate the accuracy of neural
    network patterns (Juan and Valdecantos, 2022; Adeli, 2001). The coefficient of
    determination is the square of the correlation coefficient (R), which exists between
    zero and one. The closer the value is to one, the better the model performance.
    The correlation coefficient obtained from Eq. (2) indicates the correlation between
    the estimated values and observed values. (2) where, yobs is the observed value
    of COD or EC reduction percentage, and yest is the estimated value of COD or EC
    reduction percentage with the model. ȳest is the mean of the evaluated values,
    and n is the data series number. The RMSE assesses the precision of the model
    based on the discrepancy through the observed and evaluated values. The lower
    RMSE (closer to zero) indicates the better performance of the model. RMSE was
    obtained from Eq. (3). (3) 2.6. Optimization of filter structure The goal is to
    find the optimal thicknesses of the filter layers to reach the maximum COD and
    EC removal. Based on this, the decision variables are the thicknesses of fine
    sand (x1), activated carbon (x2), medium sand (x3), and coarse sand (x4). Since
    the thickness of filter layers cannot be less than zero, and the total thickness
    should always be 60 cm, the following constraints (Eq. (4) and Eq. (5)) are considered:
    (4) (5) In the considered optimization goal, both COD and EC variables have the
    same importance, so by giving equal weight to COD and EC reduction (0.5 to each),
    a single-objective is developed in Eq. (6). Beside this optimization model, two
    separate optimizations are also developed considering just COD or EC reduction
    in their objective function (Eq. (7) or Eq. (8)). (6) (7) (8) In Eq. (7) and Eq.
    (8), f1 and f2 are the developed ANNs for simulating COD and EC reduction percentages,
    respectively. The genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to solve the developed optimization
    models. In GA, an initial population of solutions (chromosomes) is selected randomly.
    Then, several superior chromosomes are chosen as parent chromosomes to produce
    the next generation (selection operator). Then, chromosomes are randomly placed
    in couples to create the next generation (Adeli, 2001; Mirjalili, 2019). In the
    reproduction process, parts of the genetic information of two chromosomes are
    exchanged (Crossover operator) (Lambora et al., 2019; Mirjalili, 2019). The crossover
    factor, with a likelihood of 0.9 (the most suggested value), is applied to two
    genes of the chromosomes. The mutation factor, with a likelihood of 0.1, is applied
    to the genes resulting from the crossover process. Two genes were selected randomly
    from a single chromosome. After that, their sum was calculated in order to apply
    the mutation operator while maintaining a filter thickness of 60 cm. A percentage
    of the gene sum was used to replace the first gene, while the remainder was used
    to replace the second gene. By repeating these steps, a new generation replaces
    the old one. This process stops when further repetition does not cause considerable
    improvement in the best solution (superior chromosome of the last generation).
    3. Results and discussion 49 tests were performed with multilayer filters filled
    with various thicknesses of materials. The total thickness was equal to 60 cm
    in all tests. Synthetic greywater was produced to achieve a COD of about 750 mg/L.
    Then, EC was measured as 850 S/cm, which was within its common range for greywater,
    according to Table 4. Table 6 summarizes the results of the greywater treatment
    with the filter considering different thicknesses for layers. In Table 6, COD1
    and EC1 correspond to the raw greywater, while COD2 and EC2 refer to the treated
    greywater characteristics. The maximum reduction of both variables is achieved
    in test number 29, in which the filter is made of 15 cm of medium sand, 15 cm
    of fine sand, and 30 cm of activated carbon, with a COD reduction of 67% and an
    EC reduction of 32.0%. COD reduction of 67% is approximately equal to the study
    of Gupta et al. (2023). Based on the literature, 50% of COD reduction happens
    just at the top 10 cm of the filter material (Shaikh and Ahammed, 2022). Therefore,
    it is reasonable to put material of small size, like fine sand and activated carbon,
    at the top of the greywater filter instead of coarse sand (Patel et al., 2019).
    The minimum reduction in COD was observed in test 6 b y 8.1%, while the minimum
    reduction in EC was observed in test 25 b y 0.4%. One of the key processes to
    reduce COD in the filters is adsorption, especially by activated carbon (Shaikh
    and Ahammed, 2022). For each test category (single, two, three, and four-layer
    filter), the average, minimum, and maximum removal rates of COD and EC are shown
    in Table 7. Table 7 demonstrates that the filter has the most efficiency in removing
    COD and EC in three and four-layer structures due to the diversity of particle
    size in filter media. Also, three-layer filters perform better in COD reduction
    than four-layer ones. The reason can be the insufficient thickness of the finer-grained
    particles in the four-layer tests. The maximum EC removal was related to the filters
    with four layers, with a slight difference from the filters with three layers.

    The average COD and EC removal for all considered tests were equal to 36.3% and
    15.1%, respectively, which indicates greater efficiency of the filter to reduce
    COD compared to EC, which matches with the findings of Tusiime et al. (2022) and
    Gupta et al. (2023). Furthermore, Shaikh and Ahammed (2022), Spychała et al. (2019),
    and Gupta et al. (2023) mentioned that filter media leaching and availability
    of free hydrogen ions in the filter material are reasons for little uprise in
    EC of greywater after treatment. According to Table 4, EC represents the ionic
    capacity of a solution to transfer electricity. The main sources of EC in greywater
    are sodium chloride, sodium soaps, nitrates, and phosphates (Morel and Diener,
    2006). Most of these ions are soluble in water and cannot be removed by filtration;
    on the other hand, COD defines the oxygen required to oxidize chemically all substances
    in greywater. A substantial part of these substances is not soluble, which can
    be removed from greywater using the filtration treatment (Peavey et al., 1985;
    Morel and Diener, 2006). In the single-layer tests, the reduction rate of COD
    and EC for fine sand with a thickness of 60 cm was higher than other materials
    due to the smaller D10 (1.28 mm). Reynolds and Richards (1996), Rakesh et al.
    (2020), and Patel et al. (2019) stated that activated carbon can remove dissolved
    organic matter. Nevertheless, in this research, the impact of the D10 was higher
    than the internal surface and porosity in treating COD and EC. Smaller pores improve
    the treatment efficiency (Peavey et al., 1985). The efficiency of sand filters
    in removing suspended solids, particularly those smaller than the pores, is primarily
    due to adhesion, flocculation, and sedimentation. As greywater passes through
    the filter pores, small flocculated suspended solids adhere to the sand surfaces
    and particles. Some particles join together through van der Waals force, leading
    to coagulation and settling. Consequently, suspended solids removal results from
    surface removal above the layer and depth removal inside the layer (Reynolds and
    Richards, 1996). However, the physical trapping of particles in the pores and
    surface absorption are the primary mechanisms by which the filter achieves its
    performance. 3.1. Neural network modeling Two separate ANN models were developed
    to simulate filter performance in COD and EC removal. The four considered inputs
    include coarse sand thickness (x1), medium sand thickness (x2), fine sand thickness
    (x3), and activated carbon thickness (x4), while the output (y) shows the removal
    percentage of EC or COD. Based on Shahin et al. (2004), 75% of data are used for
    model training, 10% of data for validation, and 15% for testing the model accuracy
    assessment. Fig. 5a–b show the resulting RMSE for training data against the number
    of hidden layer neurons for both ANN models developed for COD and EC removal,
    respectively. Based on these results, seven and eight neurons are used to model
    the COD and EC results, respectively, as they provide the minimum RMSE, according
    to Fig. 5. Download : Download high-res image (303KB) Download : Download full-size

    layer for training, (a) COD and (b) EC. The detailed performance criteria for
    the selected ANN simulation models for COD and EC removal are shown in Table 8.
    This table reveals that the model performance in training and testing are too
    close to each other, and this shows the developed model''s capability to deal
    with new data and provide reliable results. Fig. 6a–b compare the observed values
    (yobs) and simulated values (yest) using ANNs in both COD and EC removal. The
    minimum percentages of COD removal often are overestimated, while the maximum
    values are under evaluated. In EC removal, the obstacle in maximum values is the
    same as COD, while the minimum values are underrated. In EC and COD removal ANN
    simulation, the general behavior is simulated well, as mentioned in Gupta et al.
    (2023) in removing turbidity. Table 8. Summary of COD and EC removal for four

    (estimation values in orange) in (a) COD and (b) EC modeling with ANNs. (For interpretation
    of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the
    Web version of this article.) As illustrated in Table 6, the performance of fine
    silica sand in reducing the COD and EC is higher than the other materials. Activated
    carbon also performs better than medium and coarse silica sand. Moreover, to define
    the material behavior, a three-dimensional diagram of the COD reduction against
    different thicknesses of fine silica sand and activated carbon has been drawn
    (Fig. 7a–b). Fig. 7 reveals that when the thickness of fine sand is between 0
    and 15 cm, the COD reduction is too low, and as the thickness of this material
    increases, the COD removal percentage also increases. Likewise, the maximum COD
    reduction efficiency of the filter is about 65% and belongs to the 30–40 cm of
    fine sand and 17–25 cm of activated carbon, as indicated by Patel et al. (2019).
    EC reduction graph also was drawn with the same situations in Fig. 8a–b. Fig.
    8 displays that the maximum efficiency of the filter in EC removal is about 30%
    and corresponds to the time when the filter is filled with 25–35 cm of fine sand
    and 20–30 cm of activated carbon. Download : Download high-res image (680KB) Download

    the population at each generation is considered as ten chromosomes. The initial
    population, whose genes consist of thicknesses of four materials based on the
    developed filters, is developed, and the total thickness of 60 cm for the entire
    filter is met. The termination criterion is set as a fixed optimal solution in
    100 generations. Fig. 9a–b show the evolution of the objective functions (the
    maximum COD and EC reduction) during the optimization process and using GA. Based
    on the results, if the filter is filled with 33 cm of fine sand, 19 cm of activated
    carbon, and 8 cm of medium sand, COD can be reduced by 72.22% as the maximum achievable
    value through filtration. The maximum EC reduction is 33.17%, which can be obtained
    if the filter is filled with 20 cm of fine sand, 26 cm of activated carbon, and
    14 cm of medium sand. Tusiime et al. (2022) and Saad et al. (2016) also reported
    that filters based on sand and activated carbon filtration are the best choice

    (b) EC (objective function: Z3) reduction evolution through GA. The final optimization
    based on the Z1 objective function (the summation of COD and EC) reveals that
    the maximum COD and EC reductions can be achieved simultaneously by using 33 cm
    of fine sand, 20 cm of activated carbon, and 7 cm of medium sand. This results
    in COD and EC reduction equal to 72.08% and 29.32%, respectively. These removal
    percentages are much more than average removal efficiencies of 65.5% (between
    37 and 94%) and 9% (between 7 and 11%) for COD and EC, respectively (Ghaitidak
    and Yadav, 2013; Boano et al., 2020); however, the greater reductions were represented
    by Parjane and Sane (2011), Patel et al. (2019), and Tusiime et al. (2022),while
    their considered total thickness of filter was more than 60 cm. Also, coarse sand
    does not affect the COD and EC reduction of greywater, so its thickness is set
    to zero in the optimal filter. The objective function evolution of the maximum
    simultaneous reduction of COD and EC during the optimization by GA is displayed

    Z3 were through experimental models to validate the simulation-optimization model
    outputs. For each case, experiments are done to ensure the results. Table 9 indicates
    that experimental outputs match the optimization outputs well. Hence, as shown
    in Table 9, the optimum filtration thickness in diminishing COD and EC at the
    same time contains 33 cm of fine sand, 20 cm of activated carbon and 7 cm of medium
    sand while coarse sand is removed from filter structure. It conveys that experimental
    and optimization results generally accept each other. Table 9. The results of

    to Grattan (2002), the acceptable EC for irrigation is less than 1300 μS/cm. Morel
    and Diener (2006) reported 750 μS/cm, and (EPA, 2012) noted 700 μS/cm. Also, various
    COD ranges from 90 mg/L (all soils) to 300 mg/L (dry soils) have been suggested
    for irrigarion water in an Iranian standard (Vice Presidency for Strategic Planning
    and Supervision, 2010). The optimal structure of the proposed filter in this study
    can produce water with a maximum EC of 1000 μS/cm and COD of 321 mg/L, which can
    be acceptable for irrigation purpose. 4. Summary and conclusion This research
    goal was to provide a new data-driven model to optimize the thickness of a multilayer
    granular filter developed for greywater treatment using an ANN for simulation
    of filter performance and GA for optimization. Treated water frequently is used
    for irrigation, so COD and EC were selected as the desired water quality measures.
    Because of limitations for real greywater storing and transporting, synthetic
    greywater was made in the laboratory by adding oil, shampoo, sugar, toothpaste,
    dishwashing liquid, and washing machine powder (as representatives of the general
    products used in households) to the drinking water. The resulting greywater had
    a COD of 750 mg/L and EC of 850 S/cm. An up flow–down flow pilot filter was developed
    with fine, medium, and coarse sand as well as activated carbon. These materials
    selected based on their ease of accessibility and low cost. The total depth of
    filter was considered fix, equal to 60 cm and 49 tests designed to investigate
    filters with different configurations. Based on experimental tests results, three
    and four-layer filters show higher efficiency in removal of COD and EC due to
    diversity of particle size in filter media. Moreover, the average COD and EC removal
    percentage equaled to 36.3% and 15.1%, respectively, which demonstrated greater
    efficiency of the filter in reducing COD compared to EC. ANN models were developed
    to simulate filters performance in COD and EC removal. After that, the GA was
    employed to find the optimal filter structure with three different objectives
    of maximum COD and/or EC removal. Based on the simulation-optimization model results
    to maximize COD and EC removal simultaneously, a multilayer filter with 33 cm
    of fine sand, 20 cm of activated carbon, and 7 cm of medium sand is the best choice
    which can reduce COD and EC of greywater by 72.08% and 29.32%, respectively. The
    validation of simulation-optimization model results was conducted by doing experimental
    tests which confirmed the results of simulation-optimization model. Fine sand
    and activated carbon with a D10 of 1.28 mm and 1.49 mm are determined as the most
    effective materials in reducing COD and EC of greywater. Finally, the optimal
    filter can treat greywater up to reaching an EC of 1000 μS/cm and COD of 321 mg/L
    which is appropriate to be used for irrigation purpose according to EPA and Iranian
    standard even though other water quality measures should also be considered to
    ensure all of the quality thresholds for irrigation purpose are satisfied. The
    findings of this study confirm the high efficiency of granular filters in on-site
    treatment of greywater with the minimum cost and using the easily accessible materials.
    Furthermore, usage of data driven models like ANN for simulation of different
    filters performance highly reduces the costs of physical tests and provides a
    helpful guide toward the best filter structure which is of high value comparing
    the common trial and error methods. It can be beneficial to perform experiments
    with different gradings, total layers thickness, hydraulic loading rate, and materials
    to check if the further treatment can be achieved through the proposed filter.
    Also, as variety of factors are considered in standards for irrigation water,
    it is indeed needed to further investigate the performance of these filters in
    improving other water quality measures such as salinity. Even it might be needed
    to use some additional treatment steps to achieve the desired water quality based
    on the other water quality measures which should be considered in future studies.
    On the other hand, the usage of these filters has some consequences from different
    aspects. As the on-site treatment facilities are hard to monitor and control,
    the usage of greywater might have some risks to human health and environment health
    as sometimes harmful pathogens or substances might be available in even treated
    greywater that are not recognized before the usage. Furthermore, as greywater
    is treated on-site; considering the variation of the produced greywater and limited
    capacity of treatment facilities, a storage tank might be needed for greywater
    storage before treatment. Furthermore, another storage tank for the treated greywater
    storage is needed. Beside the cost of these systems, especial attention should
    be paid to the maintenance of these storage and greywater detention time as it
    can decrease the quality of treated greywater and/or provide an appropriate space
    for growth of microorganisms which results in serious health risks. In addition,
    the improper maintenance and operation of treatment systems increases the risks
    of on-site treated greywater usage. It worth also to mention that before development
    of greywater treatment systems, the user should be well educated with the possible
    usages and risks of improper usage of the treated water to avoid the health risks
    as much as possible. Finally, it should also be emphasized that the successful
    implementation of the proposed method requires the development of guidelines and
    policies at the governmental level. Moreover, the potential side impacts of these
    systems, particularly environmental issues, should be taken into account before
    their implementation. CRediT authorship contribution statement Sara Nazif: Methodology,

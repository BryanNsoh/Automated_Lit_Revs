    reforms in the irrigation sector for sustainable agricultural water management
    (AWM) undertaken in 14 countries and regions, including Australia, China, India,
    Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, South Korea, Sudan, Chinese Taipei,
    Turkey and Ukraine. These regions represent a vast diversity of geography, climate,
    governance, socio-economic conditions and level of development. In those countries
    with smaller land areas and high-technology manufacturing, such as Japan and Korea,
    agriculture is now being viewed as technology-driven food factories of the future.
    Meanwhile, for countries with a significant base population and increasing growth
    rates, such as China, India and Indonesia, agriculture seems to dominate the development
    debate. The comparative evaluation analyses the issues regarding institutional
    and organizational reforms focusing on the legal and organizational framework
    structure including water users'' associations (WUAs) for water supply services,
    participatory irrigation management (PIM) and management transfer, and public–private
    partnership (PPP) towards sustainable irrigation and drainage (I&D) and agricultural
    water management (AWM). Despite the diverse geography and institutional frameworks,
    food security remains a major concern in all the countries and regions reviewed
    in this paper. The formation and functioning of WUAs, ageing I&D infrastructure
    and its operation and management (O&M) appear to be the major institutional and
    PPP challenges for sustainable AWM in the immediate future. © 2018 John Wiley
    & Sons, Ltd. Background To secure the functional sustainability of irrigation
    and drainage (I&D), development and maintenance of infrastructure must be carried
    out in a timely and effective manner. Other aspects which need integration and
    management include: (i) human resources; (ii) institutions and organization; (iii)
    technology for sustainable operation and maintenance (O&M); (iv) sustainable O&M
    budget; and (v) effective regulatory instruments and enforcement. These aspects
    are interdependent and, hence, should not be seen in isolation from each other.
    The absence or imbalance of an integrated relationship among any of these five
    aspects could cause ineffectiveness and inefficiency of infrastructural functions.
    During the operational phase of I&D infrastructure, human resources in conjunction
    with appropriate institutional and organizational settings are of particular importance.
    It has been observed that institutional arrangements for I&D development and management
    vary across countries, especially with respect to the reforms pertaining to organizational
    arrangement, approaches for successful participatory irrigation and drainage management
    (PIDM), working mechanisms and involvement in the public–private partnership (PPP),
    mechanisms of charging for I&D services as well as determination of the level
    of cost recovery, etc. In an attempt to grasp the global perspective of the vast
    interdisciplinary area of institutional and organizational aspects of irrigation
    and drainage, and to deliberate on the issues related to institutional reforms
    needed for sustainable AWM, the ICID Working Group on Institutional and Organizational
    Aspects (WG-IOA) organized an international symposium with the theme ‘Global Review
    of Institutional Reforms in the Irrigation Sector for Sustainable Agricultural
    Water Management’, including WUAs, during the 23rd ICID Congress in Mexico City.
    The symposium provided a platform for irrigation and drainage professionals and
    other stakeholders to share their knowledge and experience of sustainable agricultural
    water management (AWM), focusing on institutional and organizational reforms in
    the irrigation sector, participatory irrigation management (PIM), water users''
    associations (WUAs) and other related issues. During the symposium the following
    topics were deliberated upon: Legal framework and organizational structure including
    WUAs for water supply services; Participatory irrigation management and management
    transfer—approaches and conditions for successful PIDM; Public–private partnership
    (PPP) in I&D operation and maintenance towards sustainable irrigated AWM. Given
    the large scope of interdisciplinary interconnectivity, for efficiency and effectiveness
    of the symposium the number of papers were limited to ICID National Committees
    representing geographical regions of small, medium and large landholdings; and
    I&D practices including technology and modernization aspects. This paper attempts
    to provide a global comparative review, including: (i) basic information about
    the development of irrigation and drainage in the country or region; (ii) legal
    frameworks covering a review of institutional and organizational aspects of the
    I&D sector for sustainable AWM and the need for institutional reforms; (iii) challenges,
    including water measurement; mechanisms for determination of cost recovery and
    water charges, engineering aspects, possibility of PPP for financing and improved
    service delivery, issues in upscaling of PIM, capacity development, and so on;
    (iv) participatory irrigation management (PIM) and irrigation management transfer
    (IMT), elaborating the approach of PIM, status of PIM—water users associations
    (WUAs),1 their roles and responsibilities, conditions that are required for successful
    PIDM and so on; (v) observed impacts of PIM, including water allocation and service
    delivery, cost recovery aspects, water productivity; (vi) the way forward and
    recommendations elaborating on and giving examples of the best practices for replication;
    and future plans. Overview of Legal Frameworks in Study Areas For the symposium,
    14 National Committees/Committee submitted their country papers and case studies.
    The country papers and case studies have been compiled into a compendium and published
    on the ICID website (ICID, 2017). Their general characteristics relevant to AWM
    are illustrated in Table 1. The success of the irrigation sector largely depends
    on the legal and institutional framework of the country, which is unique for each
    country. Successful economies such as Australia and Japan have established the
    legal and institutional framework considering water and consequently I&D systems
    as valuable national assets, albeit via different approaches. In Australia, water
    is traded and a water access licence is required by the state and territory governments
    to use water from rainfall runoff, flood flows or any other water bodies for individual
    farms or commercial purposes. On the other hand, water and irrigation systems
    in Japan are considered a common social capital, and farmers (beneficiaries) voluntarily
    organize land improvement districts (LIDs), submit applications for projects,
    and maintain and manage the land improvement facilities for AWM. Table 1. General

    FAO AQUASTAT, Papers submitted for the symposium and government websites, and
    may represent indicative figures for different years. They are simply presented
    here to demonstrate the diversity of cases included in the symposium. Authors
    have no means of verifying their actual estimates at present. In Australia, water
    is traded via transferable water entitlements (TWEs) through which irrigators
    transfer water to and between different states and sectors, facilitated by a service
    sector maintaining trade records. At present, water allocation is allowed only
    for consumptive use, providing farmers with a percentage share of an annual sustainable
    yield of surface water or groundwater instead of previously allocated volumes
    of water. Accordingly, irrigators (and other rights holders) have a right to that
    share but the quantum varies annually. The institutional arrangements are different
    in each state, involving the local and state government in the provision of I&D
    services. Japan has its own unique model, called land improvement districts (LIDs),
    which has had significant success in stabilizing the rural water situation, and
    the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) is now testing the success factors
    of LIDs in 16 different developing countries. Several recommendations have emerged
    to make institutions responsible for making water planning more broad-based, multidisciplinary,
    coherent and holistic. Central and local governments play a role in assessing
    the validity of the project applied for and support the applicant in planning,
    designing and constructing the project. When advanced technologies are needed
    for the project, the government may carry out the project for the beneficiary
    by sharing the costs with the latter. The scale of the project decides the lead
    agency which would implement the project and the rate of subsidies from the national
    government. National or prefectural government is responsible for construction
    and management of agricultural I&D facilities as they are the property owners.
    Daily management of the facility, however, is principally commissioned to the
    LID, which is the beneficiary group organized by the farmers. Another successful
    example is the Chinese Taipei institutional framework which is constituted of
    17 irrigation associations (IAs) which govern irrigation. The IAs are parastatal
    organizations collectively owned by farmers, supervised by governments at multiple
    jurisdiction levels, managed by professional managers, led by local politicians
    chosen by farmers, and supported by a network of irrigation groups (IGs) through
    which farmers organize collective action for irrigation operation and maintenance
    (PIM) at the local level. Some emerging economies such as China and India have
    a somewhat similar approach when classifying irrigation schemes; however, in terms
    of financial support, the approaches are different. In China, specialized regulatory
    bodies of professionals manage the large and medium-sized projects whereas the
    general public manages the small and on-farm projects. The cost of construction
    and management is recovered by public finance and agricultural water fees. While,
    in India, all major and medium irrigation (MMI) schemes are supported by public
    investment by the central and state governments, whereas most of the development
    of minor irrigation (MI) schemes are supported through private investment. I&D
    management in China is carried out by a combination of irrigation district authorities
    and rural water cooperation organizations, established by the beneficiaries to
    oversee the projects. Whereas in India, irrigation development is a state subject
    funded by a government bank. Different central government agencies deal with surface
    and groundwater issues, agriculture and farmers'' welfare for micro-irrigation,
    rural development, and land resources to deal with river basin management separately.
    A few countries, such as South Korea, do not encourage irrigation transfer and
    have placed O&M responsibilities with rural development agencies (Korea Rural
    Community Corporation, KRC), departments or private companies. Ageing farmers,
    lack of youth interest in rural livelihoods, unclear water-pricing structures,
    inadequate government support and competition for water from other sectors have
    all contributed to making AWM, and also family-based agriculture, less attractive
    for youth and private investment. Such a social and demographic phenomenon has
    further eroded the self-governance capacity of rural communities. Malaysia has
    reported some efforts to strengthen WUAs, but is still in the development phase.
    The biggest and oldest irrigation project, the Muda Irrigation Project, is the
    basis of irrigation development for the country. The Muda Agricultural Development
    Authority (MADA) is responsible for socio-economic development through agriculture
    in the Muda area. Administratively, MADA serves the functions of three departments
    of the Federal Agency, namely, agriculture, I&D and farmers'' organizations. A
    total of 27 farmers'' organizations (FOs) cater for 53 000 people in the area.
    Coordinating committees have been set up to liaise between FOs and MADA management.
    Mexico ranks seventh globally in terms of availability of hydro-agricultural infrastructure.
    The constitution considers water as a national asset and its use in the hydro-agriculture
    sector has the highest social priority. The federal government serves the hydro-agricultural
    sector through the Secretariat of Agriculture, Livestock, Rural Development, Fisheries
    and Food and the National Water Commission. Successful management has resulted
    in much higher land productivity from irrigated areas compared to rainfed areas.
    The Turkish state agency called the State Hydraulic Works (DSI) is responsible
    for the construction, operation and maintenance of large-scale irrigation infrastructure.
    Currently, irrigation system management is decentralized and management responsibilities
    have been transferred to WUAs to reduce the financial burden of the state. The
    DSI General Directorate is responsible for water allocation from surface and groundwater
    for all purposes. However, some countries such as Indonesia, Iran, Nepal, Sudan
    and Ukraine have not achieved a satisfactory state with respect to the legal and
    institutional set-up for effective water management at different levels. The problem
    is further compounded by the diminishing priority of agricultural development
    in national development plans as it gives way to more remunerative sectors (industry,
    urban and consumers). Consequently, the I&D sector has suffered significantly
    due to frequent changes in the parent ministry of AWM and water resources development,
    in general. This policy blur at the national level has diminished the traditional
    roles of local communities in managing local canals and other irrigation infrastructure.
    While most countries have reported drafting of laws and regulations or guidance
    for the formation of farmers'' groups, under different names, their actual implementation
    at ground level is far less than satisfactory, and even disturbs the traditional
    rural socio-economic fabric. Quantitatively, the reported numbers of such groups
    may be large, but the quality of their capacity has much to achieve. In Indonesia,
    different central/district government agencies are responsible for different irrigation
    functions such as farmers and WUAs, infrastructure development, O&M, and strengthening
    respective agencies for planning. At field level, WUAs are responsible for tertiary
    irrigation scheme units. This fragmented support for irrigated agriculture has
    been unproductive and has worsened the situation. Currently, irrigation commissions,
    established at provincial and district levels, coordinate with government agencies,
    WUAs and other users for management. All these agencies are oriented towards implementing
    participatory irrigation management and development (PPSIP) for irrigation management.
    Despite several irrigation management reforms (IMR) in Iran, the I&D sector faces
    several challenges due to the lack of clear legislation. An autonomous body for
    the O&M of irrigation networks has been established, consisting of central agencies
    of agriculture, energy and management and planning to facilitate the transfer
    of operation, maintenance and administration of the irrigation networks (Inet)
    to local communities. The government faces the challenge of proper implementation
    of IMT at the local community level. The central agency responsible for irrigation
    (Department of Irrigation, DOI) in Nepal underwent several changes in the last
    century. In its latest amendments, the irrigation policy recommends a master plan
    for irrigation based on integrated development and management of river basins
    at national and district level, considering the geographical and political set-up.
    A National Water Plan has been developed considering the short-, medium- and long-term
    objectives for development of the water and irrigation sector. Similarly, in Sudan,
    responsibility for the irrigation sector has shifted from agriculture to the water
    resources agency for monitoring, planning, development and assessment of water
    resources at the national level. Institutional reforms coupled with law enforcement
    bodies are needed to meet challenges such as internal disagreements, institutional
    overlap, unclear mandate, lack of capacity and lack of vertical and horizontal
    coordination. More awareness of the role of the stakeholders'' involvement in
    planning and decision making is required. In Ukraine, the State Water Agency consists
    of several legal entities, including basin, inter-regional and regional water
    resources departments, to implement state policy on the ground. The agency also
    finances the I&D sector using state budget and revenues from the payments for
    water services (including the costs of operation and electricity consumed). However,
    the existing management system of water resources and land reclamation is inefficient,
    not cost-effective and incapable of attracting investment for modernization, reconstruction
    and development. Challenges Globally, the biggest challenge for the irrigation
    sector is climate change and its impact on water and food security. Coupled with
    improper governance and management in several countries, these challenges are
    exacerbated further with more pronounced effects regionally such as water scarcity,
    very low groundwater levels and poor water quality. Other challenges include the
    lack of capacity/resources (technological, financial, human and institutional)
    of the WUAs, lower technological uptake, older infrastructure requiring rejuvenation,
    insufficient water information or accounting, lack of water-pricing mechanisms,
    unavailability of knowledge and skilled professionals in some countries, absence
    of private participation (PPP), and difficulty in upscaling the WUAs. In some
    countries, farmers receive fewer incentives from agriculture which discourages
    them from actively participating in the WUAs. The problem is further worsened
    by a lack of interest of the youth population in agriculture and the ageing of
    farmers. Upscaling of WUAs is another major issue faced by many countries. In
    some regions, there is a gap between demand and supply of irrigation water, i.e.
    higher water usage or a higher water footprint and lower water supply due to physical
    scarcity or other issues. The legal and institutional framework issues affect
    the performance of WUAs to a large extent. Thus, for smoother functioning of WUAs
    to manage water efficiently, apart from technical issues such as social, political,
    economic, environmental and human aspects of Water Resources Management (WRM)
    also need to be considered carefully. Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM)
    and Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) Irrigation management transfer (IMT)
    is the transfer (full or partial) of authority for governance and responsibility
    for finances and management of irrigation systems from government to WUAs. IMT
    is achieved by involving farmers (water users) in different aspects of irrigation
    management such as planning, designing, construction and supervision, policy and
    decision making, operation and maintenance and evaluation of irrigation systems,
    or participatory irrigation management (PIM). A brief description of PIM and IMT
    in the respective regions is given below. Due to the privatization of water rights,
    water management in Australia is decentralized and based on a corporate model.
    The World Bank provided a systematic classification of participatory management
    into privately managed, individually managed, farmer managed, jointly managed
    and agency managed. PIM, in Australia, is primarily called corporatization/privatization.
    In the Murray Darling Basin (MDB), the major irrigation infrastructure is now
    operated/managed by WUAs through various types of ownership, including private
    companies, cooperatives, trusts and state-owned corporations; 30% of the area
    is managed by WUAs and 55% jointly with other agencies and the remainder by agencies.
    Initially, rural water cooperation organizations formed in China for renovation
    projects of irrigation schemes later evolved into self-managed WUAs. Guidelines
    on comprehensive reforms of agricultural water pricing support the orderly establishment
    and innovative development of WUAs in constructing and managing water supply projects,
    managing water use and collecting water fees. At present, 83 000 such WUAs operate
    on 19 Mha (million hectares) covering 60.7 million rural households. The Command
    Area Development and Water Management (CADWM) programme guides PIM in India to
    develop an adequate delivery system of irrigation water up to farmers'' fields
    with the objective of enhancing the water productivity and production of crops
    per unit of land and water in order to improve the socio-economic conditions of
    farmers. So far, 84 779 WUAs have been formed in various states covering an area
    of 17.8 Mha under various commands of irrigation schemes. The activities covered
    under CADWM components of a scheme are broadly categorized as structural (survey,
    planning, design and execution activities) and non-structural (strengthening of
    PIM) interventions. PIM in Indonesia has been formulated to increase farmers''
    sense of belonging and responsibility and enhance their capabilities for efficient
    and sustainable irrigation schemes. To avoid burdening poor farmers, IMT was not
    carried out for the primary and secondary levels. Instead, following the main
    principles of PIM in the new balanced irrigation paradigm, the water users were
    made active partners in the decision-making process. The government has responsibility
    for the main system and the farmers are responsible for the tertiary units of
    the system. The WUA fully finances and manages the village irrigation systems
    and the tertiary-level hydraulic infrastructure in government-managed irrigation
    systems. The irrigation management plans (IMPs) and participatory irrigation management
    agreements (PIMAs) prepared for each scheme include a plan showing the extent
    of involvement of the WUA for particular tasks in actual scheme operation. Several
    irrigation management reforms (IMRs) have been initiated in Iran in the last few
    decades. The IMRs were expected to effect change in the long term. The active
    participation of local communities and government plays a big role in institutional
    capacity building, sustainability of the irrigation management process and consequently
    smoother functioning of PIM. However, there are several constraints such as lack
    of knowledge and skills, institutional capacities and awareness, lack of methodology
    and clarity regarding the IMT which hamper PIM in Iran. The LIDs in Japan are
    the main entities accountable for the maintenance and management activities of
    I&D facilities once the land improvement project is finished. There is a sharing
    mechanism for I&D operation costs. The LIDs may receive subsidies from the government
    and additionally collect membership fees in the form of a I&D management fee from
    the members based on the size of the farmland among other factors. Facilities
    constructed in national projects are efficiently managed by local LIDs, supported
    by the national government, who directly benefit from the use of such facilities
    and can manage them in a way to meet the actual conditions of usage. While the
    development of agricultural I&D facilities enabled the mechanization of rice paddy
    farming and independent I&D systems for each parcel of land, new challenges have
    arisen with the emergence of issues such as part-time farming and the ageing of
    traditional farmers. In South Korea, PIM by farmers has almost disappeared. The
    KRC is financially burdened and has requested more government funds for the maintenance
    cost share among central government : local government : KRC : farmer of 4 : 3
    : 2 : 1. Even with government investment in infrastructure, the lack of PIM results
    in mismanagement of the automated lateral turnouts; the farmers struggle to supply
    water first to their fields which results in a break in the turnout function eventually,
    causing low irrigation efficiency. Some interventions have enhanced efficiency,
    including irrigation canal and drain improvements, increasing the structured canal
    ratio, and use of information and communication technology (ICT) applications
    for sustainable AWM. Irrigation management in the Muda area in Malaysia is a consultative
    process and has been part of the quality management system of Malaysian Standards
    ISO 9001 since 2001. MADA has further encompassed PIM as a mandatory requirement.
    Farmers are encouraged to form group farming (kelompok) in the defined irrigation
    blocks for cooperation among the members to carry out farming activities with
    the provision of secondary-level infrastructure. It is envisaged to have WUAs
    in all the 172 irrigation blocks with definite I&D boundaries. Elected leaders
    in the villages, or small farming units (SFUs), represent the farmers. The WUAs
    have evolved from the previously practised group farming projects. In Mexico,
    the transfer of irrigation districts to users is the most important reform promoted
    in the hydro-agricultural sector, securing the transfer to users, including hydraulic
    infrastructure as well as its integrated management implying the more efficient
    and sustainable use of water. Users take charge of the administration and operation
    of the districts, except for supply sources and headworks. The state, through
    the National Water Commission, maintains control and management of the headworks
    in the irrigation districts, that is, of the supply sources. Thus, dams and other
    bodies of water including wells are managed and operated by the National Water
    Commission. This form of management has made it possible to organize both small
    and large irrigation districts in the country. The National Water Plan (NWP) 2005
    of Nepal lays out a set of physical targets in the irrigation sector for increased
    agricultural production. Agency-managed irrigation systems have poor performance
    because of weaker functioning and lack of coordination between agency personnel
    and WUAs. As a countermeasure, IMT attempts to address these issues of below capacity
    performance, poor O&M, negligible cost recovery, inadequate funds for the management
    of irrigation systems and to provide solutions to increase agricultural production.
    It is estimated that 70% of the irrigated area in Nepal falls into the category
    of farmer-managed irrigation systems (FMISs), which can be improved through better
    techniques such as flood irrigation, construction of field canals, automation
    of regulators, installation of control structures, water distribution based on
    soil-water requirements of the crop regulated by ICT and other such activities.
    Medium-sized FMISs are owned and managed by the farmers themselves and provide
    about 40% of the food requirements of the country. Consequently, they have an
    important role in the food security and economy of Nepal. In Sudan, data on water
    supply and cultivated areas for the period from 1970 to 2014 showed that after
    the adoption of WUAs in 2005, flows increased without any increase in the cultivated
    areas in the irrigation schemes. Ministry of Water Resources, Irrigation and Electricity
    assigned to one of its companies the collection of irrigation water charges and
    it succeeded in collecting almost 80% of them. Irrigation institutions in Chinese
    Taipei provide logistic support to farmers to solve problems at the field level.
    Based on hydraulic boundaries, farmers organize self-managed irrigation groups
    (IGs) which are responsible for irrigation O&M in the field. Farmers elect an
    IG leader, who coordinates and liaises with IG members for all O&M activities.
    For equitable water distribution, duties and functions between canal water distribution
    and farm irrigation are performed separately. Either common irrigators or IGs
    (PIM) carry out farm practices according to the irrigation schedule for each rotation
    unit. Currently, many IGs are not very active even though their role has become
    increasingly important for coordination. The institutional arrangements are very
    flexible, which encourages problem-solving at local level participation for water
    delivery services. In Turkey, the performance of irrigation schemes improved by
    adopting participatory principles. The state provided subsidies in water charges
    for communities who completed their maintenance work of irrigation facilities,
    enabling a successful transition to IMT. Presently, the budget of irrigation unions
    is put into force with the approval of the mayor soon after adoption by the union
    assembly. The state has no legally sanctioned power over decisions required for
    running of the irrigation facility. The Participatory Privatization of Irrigation
    Management and Investments Project (PPIMIP) supports the buying of machinery and
    equipment needed by WUAs taking over the responsibility for O&M services and rehabilitation
    of irrigation facilities developed by the state. The cost of the equipment is
    mainly financed by irrigation organizations (60–80%) and the remainder by the
    project (20–40%). WUAs in Turkey (>300) are non-profit organizations having the
    right to irrigate within their hydraulic boundary over an area of 300–35 000 ha.
    Water is not priced; the water tariffs are financial penalties and donations whereas
    O&M costs are charged to users. DSI provides training and monitors activities
    of WUAs. In Ukraine, I&D infrastructure is divided into inter-farm and on-farm.
    Inter-farm reclamation infrastructure is state property and operated by the State
    Water Agency of Ukraine. On-farm reclamation networks in the Soviet period were
    de jure and still remain the property of the state, in spite of their transfer
    into communal ownership by government decree. WUA formation is under active consideration
    in the country. Observed Impact of PIM and IMT Despite several interventions of
    governments, the functioning of WUAs and PIM has not been effective in various
    regions of the world. Table 2 gives a brief review of the status of PIM, presence
    of PPP, and the main challenges encountered in the selected study areas. A general

    rate of conversion of arable land into dry or very dry zone; poor institutional
    arrangements; outdated market economy Institutional reforms; development to be
    implemented in two phases Australian IMT has been successfully implemented and
    has shown greater decentralization and autonomy with respect to institutional
    arrangements. The key motivations seem to be farmers'' perception of rising costs,
    poor operation of irrigation systems and their own initiative in taking over management,
    while the governments see the renewal of ageing infrastructure as a drain on the
    state treasury. In the post-management transfer scenario, state government investment
    has decreased, and the efficiency of fee collection, quality of maintenance and
    timeliness of water delivery have improved. Enhancements in system efficiencies
    of irrigation infrastructure and water productivity are observed to be due to
    reduced conveyance losses and on farms with the adoption of ‘state of the art’
    micro, spray and surface irrigation systems. Higher efficiency in the measurement
    and supply of irrigation water on a volumetric basis is demonstrated (nearly 98%
    of the irrigation water supply points are metered). As management transfer to
    local customer-owned business organizations progressed in the MDB, several changes
    were observed between the public and privately run schemes such as increased irrigated
    area and very high distribution efficiencies. Not many changes were observed in
    crop yields or farm incomes, and no significant difference in water delivery efficiency
    and no environmental degradation were observed. Consequently, irrigation water
    providers (IWPs) in the MDB have been modernizing irrigation management systems
    with government funds. Rural water cooperation organizations in China play a significant
    role in promoting PIM, maintaining I&D facilities, ensuring facility functioning,
    collecting water bills, saving irrigation water, raising agricultural productivity,
    reducing conflicts over water use, and protecting the irrigation rights of the
    disadvantaged. Some organizations are also assisting the process of land transfer
    for smallholders who are unable to manage the farmland themselves by contracting
    to lease farmland to the organizations. In this way, the service scope of these
    organizations is extended, the efficiency of agricultural production improved,
    and the sustainability of I&D facilities ensured. After foundation of these organizations,
    rules and regulations have been set up, leading to enhanced water use management,
    higher irrigation efficiency, an improved utilization ratio of agricultural means
    of production, and lower farming costs. Specialized staff are assigned to distribute
    water in an orderly manner that avoids conflicts. These organizations support
    water users'' active participation in project construction, operation and management
    and make them more accountable. Surface irrigation is used predominantly and,
    moreover, the irrigation water is priced, which results in increased irrigation
    efficiency. In India, though PIM is expected to bring substantial improvement
    in the overall irrigation system as well as in the economic conditions of farmers,
    its impact is not as yet visible on a large scale due to the unsustainability
    of the WUAs encountered in many of the projects. Despite several local success
    stories of PIM implementation by WUAs, the overall effect on the ground is yet
    to materialize. Sixteen out of 29 states in India have formulated legislation
    for PIM. Capacity building of WUAs through training of farmers and promotion of
    improved and advanced technologies to enhance agricultural production and productivity
    are an important component of the CADWM programme. However, the capacities of
    farmers need to be strengthened for the PIM legislation to bring about the desired
    effects on water productivity and socio-economic conditions of the farmers. In
    Indonesia, water productivity is low at the scheme level because of ineffective
    planning, limited human resources, lack of measurement, incapacity of use of geospatial
    information systems, poor status of embankments, and absence of farmers during
    the entire growing season. Water-use efficiency is quite low. Compared to agriculture,
    industries contribute more to GDP and employment per unit of water used, resulting
    in a lower priority and funding for O&M of agricultural infrastructure. Consequently,
    higher investments are required for rehabilitation of existing or construction
    of new structures. Iran faces the challenge of finding the right model to carry
    out IMT as fast as possible. It is clear that the transfer of irrigation management
    from government to local-level constituents (in both the public and private sectors)
    needs a long-term programme. Irrigation management reforms, if not implemented
    well, can worsen irrigation performance. The results of rapid diagnosis of IMT
    show: (i) during transition, farmers may incur more expenses in carrying out new
    responsibilities and they should be addressed before WUAs are constituted; (ii)
    WUAs should be supported and strengthened, particularly during transitional time,
    wherever it is necessary; (iii) after WUAs are constituted, local government organizations
    should continue to strengthen WUAs; (iv) IMT has its own defined process, which
    should be allowed to take place. Development of agricultural I&D facilities in
    Japan enabled the mechanization of rice paddy farming and independent I&D systems
    for each parcel of land. However, new challenges are part-time farming and ageing
    farmers. Additionally, measures against the concentration of water consumption
    at peak times, automation and labour-saving improvement of management of land
    improvement facilities, and energy-saving measures for agricultural I&D facilities
    are needed. In river basins located in densely populated large cities, where the
    facilities have a great impact on the water supply to meet the water demands unique
    to urban areas in the time of drought, LIDs cooperate with local governments to
    coordinate water usage in the basin. Currently in South Korea, IMT from local
    government to the KRC is an emerging social issue for better I&D services, and
    the concept of PIM is being revived with direct subsidies to be provided to local
    farmers as an incentive for their labour. However, the transfer of assets revealed
    divided opinion on farmers'' contribution to the maintenance of canals, including
    clearing water weeds and dredging of canals. Two different tracks of PIM recovery
    are needed for different irrigation requirements, for example the introduction
    of an incentive granting programme for the rice paddy and the co-utilization of
    groundwater wells for the dry crops, respectively. Additionally, some actions
    have to be implemented to improve management by encouraging farmers'' participation
    under the public irrigation management (PubIM) system. The performance of PIM
    in Malaysia can be assessed by the successful implementation of double cropping
    since the first double cropping in the Muda area pilot project in Kubang Sepat
    in 1974. Double cropping has since been implemented annually except for the incidence
    of drought in 1978. The formation of WUAs in the irrigation blocks with local
    participation from the same and neighbouring villages in small farming units (SFUs)
    is more acceptable to the farming community. The formation of WUAs helps farmers
    to establish irrigation schedules, to reduce conflicts, to inculcate awareness
    (higher incentives with increased yields) and encourages better-optimized water
    consumption. The Mexican state developed ‘Master Plans for Irrigation Districts’
    together with the users, to enhance the technical and administrative management
    of irrigation districts and their sustainable development. Through the Modernization
    and Rehabilitation Programme for Irrigated Areas, the state contributes up to
    50% of the investment for high- and low-pressure irrigation systems, and technification
    of gravity irrigation. Thus, the users are in a better position to carry out maintenance
    and rehabilitation works in canals, drains and roads within irrigation zones.
    The positive effects and impacts of PIM among other reforms are increased water
    availability through construction of new dams, higher conduction efficiency through
    the construction and lining of canals, the opening and piping of drains to drive
    surplus flow outside the irrigation areas, to lower elevated water levels and
    to control salinity, the installation of wells and pumping plants to aid irrigation,
    and the transfer of irrigation technology itself. Agricultural water productivity
    has increased as a result. In Nepal, through the IMT programme, many improvements
    in the performance of agency-managed irrigation systems (AMISs) have been observed.
    However, transfer has not been widely implemented. A number of studies indicate
    that systems with a high level of farmer participation perform much better in
    terms of economic and production efficiency compared to low-level participation
    with better physical conditions. The study also shows clearly that the formation
    of social capital helps towards the self-management of irrigation systems and
    can compensate for weak infrastructure. With such a management approach, the important
    issue of equity, participation of the farmers, accountability and transparency
    can be institutionalized. The Gezira Irrigation Scheme of Sudan witnessed a significant
    decrease in water management performance and agricultural productivity, which
    has led to many institutional changes aimed at putting the system on the right
    path. After the Gezira Scheme Act of 2005 in Sudan was adopted and the WUAs formed
    and given the responsibility of maintaining minor canals and water delivery to
    farms, the situation worsened. Irrigation water charges were introduced to encourage
    farmers to increase their productivity. However, the farmers and agricultural
    boards were reluctant to pay the amount to the government and consequently irrigation
    operations to deliver water were severely affected. Technical renovation of water
    management and heavy investment in the improvement of irrigation facilities have
    attributed to improved water delivery in Chinese Taipei. Some of the best-performing
    irrigation systems in the world are functional there. Irrigation efficiency largely
    benefits by cross-community coordination. Before the establishment of WUAs in
    Turkey, there was a low ratio of billing and collection rates, high water consumption,
    no cost recovery for investment, and no interest shown by local farmers to protect
    infrastructure. IMT to the WUAs has had a positive impact on O&M issues from the
    technical and financial points of view. The participatory approach adopted by
    users has generated a sense of responsibility towards the resources and the facility.
    Water use and distribution is more efficient, equitable and reliable. State expenditure
    for O&M has decreased by 80% over 15 years. With the establishment of WUAs across
    the country, overuse of water in irrigation decreased significantly, resulting
    in protection of water resources, better soil and water quality, improved irrigation
    efficiency and a decrease in energy consumption by pump irrigation. Overall, the
    area of irrigated land has increased for the same volume of water, a consequence
    of better management of the facilities provided by the local O&M staff of the
    WUAs. Summary and Conclusions A brief summary of institutional and organizational
    aspects in terms of issues and challenges, legal frameworks, approaches to PIM
    and their impact in various countries and regions is given below. The countries
    and regions covered in this paper represent a vast diversity of geography, climate,
    governance, socio-economic conditions and level of development. While Australia
    represents a separate continent with its own unique geographical and climatic
    features, other countries and regions are from monsoon-governed East, South East
    and South Asia, and low-precipitation arid Middle Eastern and African regions.
    Turkey and Ukraine characterize to some extent the features of Europe. With regard
    to the main source of fresh water, variation in annual rainfall in spatio-temporal
    dimensions is quite significant among the countries as well as within the large
    countries such as Australia, China, India and Indonesia. Historically, agriculture
    has been a major source of livelihoods or subsistence activity in all countries
    and continues to remain the mainstay of many rural populations. However, its role
    in national economies is gradually declining in most countries; the food security
    issue keeps it as a development priority in the national planning process. In
    countries with smaller land areas and high-technology manufacturing, such as Japan
    and Korea, agriculture is now being viewed as automated food factories of the
    future. In countries with a significant base population and increasing population
    rates, such as China, India and Indonesia, agriculture still continues to dominate
    the development debate. Newly established countries (e.g. Ukraine) have a different
    challenge, i.e. where to place agriculture in an open market economy environment,
    making it a governance issue rather than about natural resources availability.
    Sudan, with a large untapped potential in agriculture, views it as the main national
    development platform. Despite all the variations, national food security remains
    the main consideration in all the countries. Accordingly, the importance of irrigation
    and drainage in maintaining a satisfactory level of food security at present and
    in the foreseeable future is recognized by all the countries. The other main common
    issue is the physical deterioration of national I&D systems in addition to building
    the future water infrastructure. Major infrastructures were developed after the
    Second World War and are rapidly ageing, making repairs and maintenance more expensive
    and challenging in emerging development models. The current status of PIM, the
    major challenges encountered in the successful management transfer and the future
    direction of PIM are summarized in Table 2. PPP in irrigation and drainage systems:
    Major I&D infrastructure has always been the mandate of national governments and
    will continue to be so in the future. Water, as an input for food production,
    has never been an economic or monetary entity in itself, unlike fertilizer or
    seeds or pesticides, skewing the food price calculations in open market systems.
    Even the capital cost of farming family land generally does not figure in such
    calculations. The private sector, being profit-oriented, is involved only when
    the agricultural raw material is harvested and arrives at market for further processing,
    storage, packaging, retailing and value addition. But agricultural inputs such
    as fertilizer or seeds, which are not considered natural resources or a public
    good, are able to draw the attention of the private sector. PPP business models
    in rural infrastructure development including roads and irrigation and/or drainage
    systems have rarely demonstrated success. In the country reports discussed here,
    the private sector is involved in very few countries (generally in O&M) when WUAs
    have failed. Lack of policy clarity across the countries and the social value
    attached to water rather than its economic value are considered major hurdles
    in larger private-sector investment in I&D infrastructure. Although, like electrical
    power distribution, water may incentivize private-sector involvement and eventual
    investment in this rather neglected, yet future critical, sector for sustainable
    development. Recommendations and Way Forward Policy reform in the water sector
    is a work in progress and will continue to be refined over time. Climate change,
    increasing population pressure in some cases, food security, deterioration of
    I&D infrastructure, and declining availability of fresh water for food are some
    of the major determiners of future plans. At the governance level, inclusive planning
    and equitable allocation are major considerations. While some countries have reported
    the intention to have more specific investments in I&D infrastructure, others
    have identified human capacity building at the water use level as a priority.
    Integrated water management plans from nation and province/state to local district/village
    levels seem to be an emerging consensus in all reports. Some of the institutional
    reforms have been more like trial runs or experiments, rather than long-term vision-based
    commitments. Inter-community, inter-sector, inter-state and even international
    cross-boundary water conflicts are rearing their heads and, therefore, international
    networks have much bigger challenges pertaining to AWM. Collaboration, joint deliberation,
    human resource sharing, research cooperation and capacity building are the main
    keywords that will guide the future path of sustainable development in an uncertain
    climate. Moving forward, most of the countries are planning to upscale WUAs and
    strengthen their functioning through better coordination and communication between
    the different stakeholders via participatory mechanisms. In certain regions with
    limited resources, market-level intervention is recommended as a way forward to
    influence farmers’ crop choices. Successful irrigation practices in the MDB in
    Australia such as IMT, water trading, water accounting, modernization of irrigation
    management practices, transferring of water rights to the private sector among
    others will be replicated in other basins as well. Upscaling of water management
    into water distribution, works, engineering, environmental services and financial
    services is required. Water rights of individuals and entities need to be clearly
    defined and enforced effectively. China is focusing on enhancing its inner strength
    for development through comprehensive reforms such as transfer of rights to WUAs,
    developing specialized agencies for professional maintenance of facilities, expanding
    channels of financial support and enhancing regulation of agricultural water consumption
    through purchase subsidies. Future plans include increasing government investment,
    standardizing the management of rural water cooperation organizations and exploring
    development models that suit local conditions, enhancing capacity building and
    formulating policies of government subsidies, organizing training sessions and
    encouraging experience exchange to improve management and introducing private
    capital into the establishment and management of WUAs. India is planning to execute
    irrigation development projects in three different phases: short-term plan (to
    complete ongoing projects by 2020), medium-term plan (prioritize and complete
    pending projects by 2025) and the long-term plan (target new projects at appropriate
    locations by 2035). The irrigation sector needs to be prioritized in the national
    agenda. Constant efforts are being made for sustainable irrigation development
    in India through stakeholders’ (farmers) engagement in irrigation issues and providing
    a holistic approach involving structural and non-structural interventions. PIM
    is continuously promoted by central government under the CADWM programme with
    recommendations such as an integrated approach for AWM, pricing mechanisms for
    irrigation water, better demand–supply management and technological upgrades for
    irrigation to further strengthen PIM in India. In Indonesia, agriculture is the
    main source of income for a large population. The government has nine main development
    goals referred to as the ‘sembilan agenda’ (NAWACITA) programme, including goals
    of food self-sufficiency in 2018, rehabilitation of old and development of new
    irrigated areas, construction of new storage dams, adoption of sustainable approaches
    to farming on rehabilitated upland areas, development of farm roads, and increased
    adoption of environmentally friendly technologies for food crops. To move forward
    and bring improvements in irrigated agriculture in Indonesia, the main recommendations
    are: (i) water resources management; (ii) regional autonomy; (iii) fiscal budgeting;
    (iv) agricultural extension; (v) water resources (SDA) data gathering; (vi) WUA/WAUF
    and Irrigation Commission (KOMIR) empowerment; (vii) I&D system improvement; (viii)
    land consolidation; (ix) single irrigation management; (x) irrigation management
    units. Other recommendations include the introduction of real-time irrigation
    and an increase in routine O&M funding for irrigation systems. The current national
    plan of reforms in Iran (IMR) has no provision for IMT; it is considered a part
    of water resource management reforms. Several efforts have made positive impacts
    on the attitude of front-line decision-makers and local communities to adopt IMT/PIM
    in the future. There are four classified constituents in the PIM process: participatory
    diagnosis, participatory planning and implementing, upscaling and outscaling,
    and participatory monitoring and evaluation. Only a part of the second constituent
    has been taken into the consideration by the IMT/PIM executive teams in Iran.
    It is believed that there is more institutional capacity for IMT in the private
    sector. Japan''s government continues to support the cooperative activities of
    local communities to maintain and manage agricultural I&D facilities. ICT and
    other new technologies may allow remote monitoring of the water level of each
    farmland and irrigation canal and drain on mobile devices, and remotely controlled
    valves or other equipment. Such new technologies should be used to further develop
    energy-efficient water management and advanced usage of water. JICA has been fully
    engaged on technology transfer in farmer participation irrigation management since
    around 2005 to developing countries based on the experience and technologies accumulated
    by LIDs in Japan. In South Korea, ICT infrastructure is now well developed for
    irrigation management applications. Thus, for the future irrigation water management
    of South Korea, it is necessary to build the bi- or multi-directional synchronous
    linkage of shared information for irrigation management. This is the direction
    of the planned fourth industrial revolution in agricultural activities. The smart
    farming and further smart crop production factory would be alternative solutions
    for limited land and water availability problems. ‘Smart’ cultivation can be an
    attractive job market by managing one''s own little water–food–energy nexus. The
    function of PIM and PPP should be recovered by reorganizing WUAs with decision-making
    rights and water price duties for better water sharing and service. The PPPs for
    enhancing irrigation water productivity in supplying and cultivation processes
    are very important. Irrigation water efficiency should be the indicator of the
    amount of water required and used for irrigation purposes. As Malaysia rapidly
    moves towards transformation into a high-income economy, agricultural development,
    specifically paddy production, should be the driving force of the National Agriculture
    Policy by providing sufficient food for the people and a new ‘spin-off’ industry
    for the farming community. Capacity development is crucial for a successful transformation.
    Knowledge generation, management and dissemination are important to ensure the
    success of the capacity development initiative. This will develop farmers who
    are aware of the nation''s environmental endowments. With the increasing importance
    of governance in the water sector the knowledge acquired is expected to equip
    farmers to become high-income rice growers, which will be truly inclusive in nation-building.
    In Mexico, the challenges are not entirely technical in nature and hence irrigation
    organizations need to integrate in order to have a shared vision across the hydro-agricultural
    sector and achieve joint sustainability of irrigation districts, irrigation units,
    technified rainfed areas and normal rainfed areas. A model of integrated management
    and an orderly process in view of the necessary conversion of certain areas from
    rainfed to irrigated areas should be introduced, as well as the introduction of
    changes in economic activities, crop patterns and the application of clear and
    equitable rules for water distribution, all this backed up by the promotion of
    technology adoption. Irrigators in Nepal are being encouraged to take responsibility
    for the management of irrigation systems. With frequent changes in the management
    of state affairs and the diminishing importance of natural resource management,
    the community of irrigators has proved that they can self-manage the systems.
    In order to make self-management effective, active participation of irrigators,
    a polycentric model of governance, effective WUAs and social capital development
    have to take place. Hence, the DOI is implementing WUAs with a view to self-management.
    In view of the meagre financial resources in Sudan, it is recommended that the
    government should make proper policies and adopt the PPP concept and introduce
    it gradually in the irrigation sector. The private sector should also be encouraged
    to invest more in agriculture with government support in the form of tax holidays.
    Water should be charged by volume instead of a flat rate. Moreover, awareness
    campaigns designed to address farmers'' needs should be put in place. A memorandum
    of agreement signed by a group of farmers and a private company from South Africa
    is planned to be implemented. The World Bank is also offering a salvation pilot
    programme: rehabilitation and modernization of the irrigated sector starting with
    the Gezira Scheme. These would serve as good practice and can gradually be expanded
    across the country. In Chinese Taipei, traditional irrigation practices are no
    longer considered capable of the normal operation of water resources distribution
    in the face of climate change. Irrigation associations should not confine themselves
    to the single service of irrigation. Instead, through diversification of businesses
    by making better use of the facilities, land assets and human resources, the financial
    situation of irrigation associations should be significantly improved. The example
    of the Chia-Nan Irrigation Association in southern Chinese Taipei is a successful
    case and should be upscaled in other irrigation schemes. Besides traditional I&D,
    the Chia-Nan Irrigation Association also engages in: (i) power generation by setting
    up a power plant, but under the condition that water conveyance is not affected;
    (ii) renting the canal network to other sectors for water conveyance; (iii) constructing
    business buildings for commercial use; (iv) establishing water-friendly parks
    or entertainment parks beside the waterways. In Turkey, O&M of the state water
    agency is developing a new irrigation management information system (MIS). Generally,
    a WUA would manage irrigation cooperation if it has 5000 ha or more agricultural
    area. For smaller agricultural areas with pump irrigation facilities, WUAs face
    difficulties in paying energy and maintenance costs. Solar panels have been installed
    to overcome this situation. Further, it is absolutely necessary to have storage
    facilities to ensure irrigation, domestic and industrial supply, and to generate
    hydroelectric energy. For improperly managed WUAs, alternative operation models
    are being studied for irrigation, such as transfer of operational rights to municipalities
    or procurement of operational services. In addition to existing projects of capacity
    165 billion cubic metres (BCM), Turkey aims to attain 200 BCM by 2023. For the
    new market economy of Ukraine, reforms are necessary to arrest the decline of
    the I&D sector and to increase its efficiency. Management and operation of local
    agricultural I&D systems will be transferred to WUAs under a new law. The creation
    of WUAs should precede the legislative settlement of issues such as the legal
    form of WUAs, the task of their activities, rights and responsibilities, the procedure
    for the elaboration and adoption of the statute, the order of management and decision-making,
    organizational structure and principles of activity, including budget formation.
    The two functions of managing water resources and operating infrastructure should
    be separated. Phase I would strengthen the Water Resources and Operations Divisions
    within the State Water Agency and Phase II would see the canals and drainage infrastructure
    moved from state to new regional bodies. Acknowledgements We wish to thank the

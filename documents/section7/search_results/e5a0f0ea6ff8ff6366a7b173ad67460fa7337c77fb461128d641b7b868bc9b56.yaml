    Digital twin can be defined as a virtual representation of a physical asset enabled
    through data and simulators for real-time prediction, optimization, monitoring,
    controlling, and improved decision making. Recent advances in computational pipelines,
    multiphysics solvers, artificial intelligence, big data cybernetics, data processing
    and management tools bring the promise of digital twins and their impact on society
    closer to reality. Digital twinning is now an important and emerging trend in
    many applications. Also referred to as a computational megamodel, device shadow,
    mirrored system, avatar or a synchronized virtual prototype, there can be no doubt
    that a digital twin plays a transformative role not only in how we design and
    operate cyber-physical intelligent systems, but also in how we advance the modularity
    of multi-disciplinary systems to tackle fundamental barriers not addressed by
    the current, evolutionary modeling practices. In this work, we review the recent
    status of methodologies and techniques related to the construction of digital
    twins mostly from a modeling perspective. Our aim is to provide a detailed coverage
    of the current challenges and enabling technologies along with recommendations
    and reflections for various stakeholders. A working digital twin of an offshore

    Climate change is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity, and we, as machine
    learning (ML) experts,

    may wonder how we can help. Here we describe how ML can be a powerful tool in
    reducing greenhouse

    gas emissions and helping society adapt to a changing climate. From smart grids
    to disaster management,

    we identify high impact problems where existing gaps can be filled by ML, in collaboration
    with other fields.

    Our recommendations encompass exciting research questions as well as promising
    business opportunities.

    We call on the ML community to join the global effort against climate change.

    INTRODUCTION

    The effects of climate change are increasingly visible.1 Storms, droughts, fires,
    and flooding have

    become stronger and more frequent [239]. Global ecosystems are changing, including
    the natu-

    ral resources and agriculture on which humanity depends. The 2018 intergovernmental
    report on

    climate change estimated that the world will face catastrophic consequences unless
    global green-

    house gas (GHG) emissions are eliminated within 30 years [372]. Yet year after
    year, these emis-

    sions rise.

    Addressing climate change involves mitigation (reducing emissions) and adaptation
    (prepar-

    ing for unavoidable consequences). Both are multifaceted issues. Mitigation of
    GHG emissions

    requires changes to electricity systems, transportation, buildings, industry,
    and land use. Adapta-

    tion requires planning for resilience and disaster management, given an understanding
    of climate

    and extreme events. Such a diversity of problems can be seen as an opportunity:
    there are many

    ways to have an impact.

    In recent years, machine learning (ML) has been recognized as a broadly powerful
    tool for

    technological progress. Despite the growth of movements applying ML and artificial
    intelligence

    (AI) to problems of societal and global good,2 there remains the need for a concerted
    effort to

    identify how these tools may best be applied to tackle climate change. Many ML
    practitioners

    wish to act, but are uncertain how. On the other side, many fields have begun
    actively seeking

    input from the ML community.

    This article aims to provide an overview of where ML can be applied with high
    impact in the fight

    against climate change, through either effective engineering or innovative research.
    The strategies

    Committee on AI Applications to Environ-

    mental Science, and the field of Climate Informatics (www.climateinformatics.org.)
    [548], as well as the relevant survey

    papers [231, 251, 403].

    Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning

    42:3

    we highlight include climate mitigation and adaptation, as well as meta-level
    tools that enable other

    strategies. In order to maximize the relevance of our recommendations, we have
    consulted experts

    across many fields (see Acknowledgments) in the preparation of this article.

    1.1

    Who is this Article Written For?

    We believe that our recommendations will prove valuable to several different audiences
    (detailed

    below). Given the wide diversity of technical areas involved, we do not assume
    any prior famil-

    iarity with application domains (such as agriculture or electric grids) and have
    tried to provide

    relevant keywords and background reading within each section of the article. While
    we use basic

    terminology from ML, knowledge of the specific ML techniques we reference is not
    necessary to

    understand any of our key points. For an overall introduction to ML, see e.g.,
    [78].

    Researchers and engineers: We identify many problems that require conceptual innovation
    and

    can advance the field of ML, as well as being highly impactful. For example, we
    highlight how

    climate models afford an exciting domain for interpretable ML (see Section 8.1).
    We encourage

    researchers and engineers across fields to use their expertise in solving urgent
    problems relevant

    to society.

    Entrepreneurs and investors: We identify many problems where existing ML techniques
    could

    have a major impact without further research, and where the missing piece is deployment.
    We re-

    alize that some of the recommendations we offer here will make valuable startups
    and nonprofits.

    For example, we highlight techniques for providing fine-grained solar forecasts
    for power com-

    panies (see Section 2.1), tools for helping reduce personal energy consumption
    (see Section 11.2),

    and predictions for the financial impacts of climate change (see Section 14).
    We encourage en-

    trepreneurs and investors to fill what is currently a wide-open space.

    Corporate leaders: We identify problems where ML can lead to massive efficiency
    gains if

    adopted at scale by corporate players. For example, we highlight means of optimizing
    supply chains

    to reduce waste (see Section 5.1) and software/hardware tools for precision agriculture
    (see Sec-

    tion 6.2). We encourage corporate leaders to take advantage of opportunities offered
    by ML to

    benefit both the world and the bottom line.

    Local and national governments: We identify problems where ML can improve public
    services,

    help gather data for decision-making, and guide plans for future development.
    For example, we

    highlight intelligent transportation systems (see Section 3.4), techniques for
    automatically assess-

    ing the energy consumption of buildings in cities (see Section 4.2), and tools
    for improving disaster

    management (see Section 9.4). We encourage policymakers to consider opportunities
    for working

    with ML experts and building ML capacity in relevant public sector bodies. We
    further encourage

    public entities to release data that may be relevant to climate change mitigation
    and adaptation

    goals. (For further policy-related recommendations on this topic, see e.g., [406].)

    1.2

    How to Read this Article

    The article is broken into sections according to application domain (see Table
    1). To help the reader,

    we have also included the following flags at the level of individual strategies.

    •

    High Leverage

    denotes bottlenecks that domain experts have identified in climate change

    mitigation or adaptation and that we believe to be particularly well-suited to
    tools from ML.

    These areas may be especially fruitful for ML practitioners wishing to have an
    outsized im-

    pact, though applications not marked with this flag are also valuable and should
    be pursued.

    ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 55, No. 2, Article 42. Publication date: February
    2022.

    42:4

    D. Rolnick et al.

    •

    Long-term

    denotes applications that will have their primary impact after 2040. While

    extremely important, these may in some cases be less pressing than those which
    can help

    act on climate change in the near term.

    •

    Uncertain Impact

    denotes applications where the impact on GHG emissions is uncertain

    (for example, rebound effects may apply3) or where there is potential for undesirable
    side

    effects (negative externalities).

    These flags should not be taken as definitive; they represent our understanding
    of more rigorous

    analyses within the domains we consider, combined with our subjective evaluation
    of the potential

    role of ML in these various applications.

    Despite the length of the article, we cannot cover everything. There will certainly
    be many

    applications that we have not considered, or that we have erroneously dismissed.
    We look forward

    to seeing where future work leads.

    1.3

    A Call for Collaboration

    All of the problems we highlight in this article require collaboration across
    fields. Collaboration

    reduces the chance of failure modes such as working on a problem that is not actually
    impactful,

    overly simplifying a complicated issue, or using advanced computational tools
    when simple tools

    will do the job.

    Collaboration is also essential to ensure that innovations will be deployed with
    the intended

    impact. Relevant stakeholders should be involved in the full pipeline of problem
    scoping and de-

    velopment, so that the final solution is well-tailored to the setting in which
    it will be used. For

    example, code can be written using a language and a platform that are already
    popular with the

    intended users, or can be integrated into an existing, widely used tool.

    We realize that finding partners, as well as relevant resources such as data,
    can often be difficult.

    We encourage readers to visit the website that accompanies this article, www.climatechange.ai,

    where we offer additional resources, as well as opportunities for knowledge-sharing
    and

    networking.

    1.4

    The Broader Picture

    We emphasize that ML is not a silver bullet. The applications we highlight are
    impactful, but no one

    solution will “fix” climate change. There are also many areas of action where
    ML is inapplicable,

    and we omit these entirely. Moreover, while we focus here on ways in which ML
    can help address

    climate change, ML can also be applied in ways that make climate change worse.
    For instance, ML

    is used widely to accelerate activities such as fossil fuel exploration and extraction
    [303, 406, 814],

    while some ML models are themselves energy-intensive to train and run [69, 459,
    720, 764].4

    Finally, technology is not in itself enough to solve climate change, nor is it
    a replacement for

    other aspects of climate action such as policy. Many technological tools useful
    in addressing cli-

    mate change have been available for years but have yet to be adopted at scale
    by society. While we

    hope that ML will be useful in accelerating effective strategies for climate action,
    humanity also

    must decide to act.

    3Rebound effects occur when increased efficiency results in higher demand, partially
    or completely negating the benefits

    of efficiency gains [45]. For example, lowering the energy required to produce
    a product can lead to lower costs, which in

    turn can increase the consumption of the product. In such cases, specific policies,
    such as pricing mechanisms or caps on

    GHG emissions, can help to limit rebound effects. See also the literature on induced
    demand and the Jevons paradox.

    4It is worth noting that many ML methods cited in this article require only minimal
    energy to train and run (e.g., can be

    run on a laptop or phone).

    ELECTRICITY SYSTEMS

    BY PRIYA L. DONTI

    AI has been called the new electricity, given its potential to transform entire
    industries [591]. In-

    terestingly, electricity itself is one of the industries that AI is poised to
    transform. Many electricity

    systems are awash in data, and the industry has begun to envision next-generation
    systems (smart

    grids) driven by AI and ML [559, 623, 661, 814].

    Electricity systems5 are responsible for about a quarter of human-caused GHG emissions
    each

    year [370]. Moreover, as buildings, transportation, and other sectors seek to
    replace GHG-emitting

    fuels (Section 3–4), demand for low-carbon electricity will grow. To reduce emissions
    from elec-

    tricity systems, society must

    • Rapidly transition to low-carbon6 electricity sources (such as solar, wind,
    hydro, and nuclear)

    and phase out carbon-emitting sources (such as coal, natural gas, and other fossil
    fuels).

    • Reduce GHG emissions associated with existing fossil fuel and electricity infrastructure,

    since the transition to low-carbon power will not happen overnight.

    • Implement these changes across all countries and contexts, as electricity systems
    are

    everywhere.

    ML can contribute on all fronts by informing the research, deployment, and operation
    of elec-

    tricity system technologies (Figure 1). Such contributions include accelerating
    the development of

    clean energy technologies, improving forecasts of demand and clean energy, improving
    electricity

    system optimization, and enhancing system monitoring. These contributions require
    a variety of

    ML paradigms and techniques, as well as close collaborations with the electricity
    industry and

    other experts to integrate insights from operations research, electrical engineering,
    physics, chem-

    istry, the social sciences, and other fields.

    2.1

    Enabling Low-Carbon Electricity

    Low-carbon electricity sources are essential to tackling climate change. These
    sources come in

    two forms: variable and controllable. Variable sources fluctuate based on external
    factors; for in-

    stance, solar panels produce power only when the sun is shining, and wind turbines
    only when the

    wind is blowing. On the other hand, controllable sources such as nuclear or geothermal
    plants can

    be turned on and off (though not instantaneously7). These two types of sources
    affect electricity

    systems differently, presenting distinct opportunities for ML techniques.

    2.1.1

    Variable Sources. Most electricity is delivered to consumers using a physical
    network

    called the electric grid, where the power generated must equal the power consumed
    at every mo-

    ment. This means that solar panels, wind turbines, and other variable electricity
    generators are

    supported by some mix of natural gas plants, storage, or other controllable sources
    ready to buffer

    changes in their output (e.g., when unexpected clouds block the sun or the wind
    blows less strongly

    than predicted). Today, this buffer is often provided by coal and natural gas
    plants run in a CO2-

    emitting standby mode called spinning reserve. In the future, this role is expected
    to be played by

    5Throughout this section, we use the term “electricity systems” to refer to the
    procurement of fuels and raw materials for

    electric grid components; the generation and storage of electricity; and the delivery
    of electricity to end-use consumers.

    For primers on these topics, see [96, 141, 437, 817, 848].

    6We use the term “low-carbon” here instead of “renewable” because of this article’s
    explicit focus on climate change goals.

    Renewable energy is produced from inexhaustible or easily replenished energy sources
    such as the sun, wind, or water, but

    need not necessarily be carbon-free (as in the case of some biomass [149]). Similarly,
    not all low-carbon energy is renewable

    (as in the case of nuclear energy).

    7Nuclear power plants are often viewed as inflexible since they can take hours
    or days to turn on or off, and are often left

    on (at full capacity) to operate as baseload. That said, nuclear power plants
    may have some flexibility to change their power

    generation for load-following and other electric grid services, as in the case
    of France [491].

    Fig. 1. Selected opportunities to reduce GHG emissions from electricity systems
    using ML, as described in

    Section 2.

    energy storage technologies such as batteries (Section 3.3), pumped hydro, or
    power-to-gas [226];

    see [27] for an overview.8 ML can both reduce emissions from today’s standby generators
    and

    enable the transition to carbon-free systems by helping improve necessary technologies
    (namely

    forecasting, scheduling, and control) and by helping create advanced electricity
    markets that ac-

    commodate both variable electricity and flexible demand.

    Forecasting supply and demand.

    High Leverage

    Since variable generation and electricity demand both fluctuate, they must be
    forecast ahead of

    time to inform real-time electricity scheduling and longer-term system planning.
    Better short-

    term forecasts can allow system operators to reduce their reliance on polluting
    standby plants

    and to proactively manage increasing amounts of variable sources. Better long-term
    forecasts can

    help system operators (and investors) determine where and when variable plants
    should be built.

    8It is worth noting that in systems with many fossil fuel plants, storage may
    increase emissions depending on how it is

    operated [47, 347].

    D. Rolnick et al.

    While many system operators today use basic forecasting techniques, forecasts
    will need to become

    increasingly accurate, span multiple horizons in time and space, and better quantify
    uncertainty

    to support these use cases. ML can help on all these fronts.

    To date, many ML methods have been used to forecast electricity supply and demand.
    These

    methods have employed historical data, physical model outputs, images, and even
    video data to

    create short- to medium-term forecasts of solar power [9, 19, 161, 478, 524, 771,
    818], wind power

    [216, 285, 450, 512], “run-of-the-river” hydro power [623], demand [351, 429,
    458, 673], or more

    than one of these [402, 857] at aggregate spatial scales. These methods span various
    types of su-

    pervised ML, fuzzy logic, and hybrid physical models, and take different approaches
    to quantifying

    (or not quantifying) uncertainty. At a more spatially granular level, some work
    has attempted to

    understand specific categories of demand, for instance by clustering households
    [63, 421] or by dis-

    aggregating electricity signals using game theory, optimization, regression, and/or
    online learning

    [24, 409, 473].

    While much of this previous work has used domain-agnostic techniques, ML algorithms

    of the future will need to incorporate domain-specific insights. For instance,
    since weather

    fundamentally drives both variable generation and electricity demand, ML algorithms
    forecasting

    these quantities should draw from innovations in climate modeling and weather
    forecasting

    (Section 8) and in hybrid physics-plus-ML modeling techniques [161, 818, 822].
    Such techniques

    can help improve short- to medium-term forecasts, and are also necessary for ML
    to contribute

    to longer-term (e.g., year-scale) forecasts since weather distributions shift
    over time [404]. In

    addition to incorporating system physics, ML models should also directly optimize
    for system

    goals [198, 220, 842]. For instance, the authors of [198] use a deep neural network
    to produce

    demand forecasts that optimize for electricity scheduling costs rather than forecast
    accuracy; this

    notion could be extended to produce forecasts that minimize GHG emissions. In
    non-automated

    settings where power system control engineers (partially) determine how much power
    each

    generator should produce, interpretable ML and automated visualization techniques
    could help

    engineers better understand forecasts and thus improve how they schedule low-carbon
    generators.

    More broadly, understanding the domain value of improved forecasts is an interesting
    challenge.

    For example, previous work has characterized the benefits of specific solar forecast
    improvements

    in a region of the United States [523]; further study in different contexts and
    for different types of

    improvements could help better direct ML work in the forecasting space.

    Improving scheduling and flexible demand.

    High Leverage

    When balancing electricity systems, system operators use a process called scheduling
    and dispatch

    to determine how much power every controllable generator should produce. This
    process is slow

    and complex, as it is governed by NP-hard optimization problems such as unit commitment
    and

    optimal power flow that must be coordinated across multiple time scales (from
    sub-second to days

    ahead). Further, scheduling will become even more complex as electricity systems
    include more

    storage, variable generators, and flexible demand, since operators will need to
    manage even more

    system components while simultaneously solving scheduling problems more quickly
    to account

    for real-time variations in electricity production. Scheduling processes must
    therefore improve

    significantly for operators to manage systems with a high reliance on variable
    sources.

    ML can help improve the existing (centralized) process of scheduling and dispatch
    by speeding

    up power system optimization problems and improving the quality of optimization
    solutions [333,

    608]. For instance, ML can be used to approximate or simplify existing optimization
    problems

    [75, 242, 311, 871], find good starting points for optimization [52, 196, 382],
    identify redundant

    constraints [541], learn from the actions of power system control engineers [197],
    or do some

    combination of these [858]. Dynamic scheduling [225, 546] and (safe) reinforcement

    Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning

    (RL) could also be used to balance the electric grid in real time; in fact, some
    electricity system

    operators have started to pilot similar methods at small, test case-based scales
    [520].

    While many modern electricity systems are centrally coordinated, recent work has
    examined

    how to (at least partially) decentralize scheduling and dispatch using energy
    storage, flexible de-

    mand, low-carbon generators, and other resources connected to the electric grid.
    One strategy

    is to explicitly design local control algorithms; for instance, recent work has
    controlled energy

    storage and solar inverters using supervised learning techniques trained on historical
    optimization

    data [191, 192, 410, 411]. Another strategy is to let storage, demand, and generation
    respond to

    real-time prices9 that reflect (for example) how emissions-intensive electricity
    currently is. In this

    case, ML can help both to design real-time prices and to respond to these prices.
    Previous work has

    used RL and dynamic programming to set real-time electricity prices [30, 90] and
    more broadly

    for power market design [30, 881]. Techniques such as (deep) RL [291, 292, 810,
    881], agent-based

    models [173, 662, 663, 863], online optimization [99], and dynamic programming
    [704] can then

    help maximize profits for decentralized storage, demand, and generation, given
    real-time prices.

    See also [30] for an overview of deep learning techniques for demand response.
    In general, much

    more work is needed to test and scale existing decentralized solutions; barring
    deployment on real

    systems, platforms such as PowerTAC [638] and Grid2Op [519] can provide large-scale
    simulated

    environments on which to perform these tests.

    Accelerating materials science.

    High Leverage Long-term

    Scientists are working to develop new materials that can better store or otherwise
    harness energy

    from variable natural resources. For instance, creating solar fuels (synthetic
    fuels produced from

    sunlight or solar heat) could allow us to capture solar energy when the sun is
    shining and then

    store this energy for later use. However, the process of discovering new materials
    can be slow

    and imprecise; the physics behind materials are not completely understood, so
    human experts of-

    ten manually apply heuristics to understand a proposed material’s physical properties
    [49, 105].

    ML can automate this process by combining existing heuristics with experimental
    data, physics,

    and reasoning to apply and even extend existing physical knowledge. For instance,
    recent work

    has used tools from ML, AI, optimization, and physics to figure out a proposed
    material’s crystal

    structure, with the goal of accelerating materials discovery for solar fuels [49,
    298, 773]. Other

    work seeking to improve battery storage technologies has combined first-principles
    physics calcu-

    lations with support-vector regression to design conducting solids for lithium-ion
    batteries [257].

    (Additional applications of ML to batteries are discussed in Section 3.3.) Recent
    work has also pro-

    posed the use of ML for scalable simulation of electrocatalysts for power-to-gas
    applications [894].

    More generally in materials science, ML techniques including supervised learning,
    active learn-

    ing, and generative models have been used to help synthesize, characterize, model,
    and design

    materials, as described in reviews [105, 490] and more recent work [299]. As discussed
    in [105],

    novel challenges for ML in materials science include coping with moderately sized
    datasets and

    inferring physical principles from trained models [800]. In addition to advancing
    technology, ML

    can inform policy for accelerated materials science; for instance, previous work
    has applied natural

    language processing to patent data to understand the solar panel innovation process
    [813]. We note

    that while our focus here has been on electricity system applications, ML for
    accelerated science

    may also have significant impacts outside electricity systems, e.g., by helping
    design alternatives

    to cement (Section 5.2) or create better CO2 sorbents (Section 7.1).

    Additional applications.

    There are many additional opportunities for ML to advance variable power generation.
    For in-

    stance, it is important to ensure that low-carbon variable generators produce
    energy as efficiently

    and profitably as possible. Prior work has attempted to maximize electricity production
    by con-

    trolling solar panels [1, 3, 678] or wind turbine blades [2, 833] using RL or
    Bayesian optimization.

    Other work has used graphical models to detect faults in rooftop solar panels
    [377] and genetic

    algorithms to optimally place wind turbines within a wind farm [188]. ML can also
    help control

    batteries located at solar and wind farms to increase these farms’ profits, for
    instance by storing

    their electricity when prices are low and then selling it when prices are high;
    prior work has used

    ML to forecast electricity prices [460, 838] or RL to control batteries based
    on current and historical

    prices [825].

    ML can also help integrate rooftop solar panels into the electric grid, particularly
    in the United

    States and Europe. Rooftop solar panels are connected to a part of the electric
    grid called the

    distribution grid, which traditionally did not have many sensors because it was
    only used to de-

    liver electricity “one-way” from centralized power plants to consumers. However,
    rooftop solar

    and other distributed energy resources have created a “two-way” flow of electricity
    on distribution

    grids. Since the locations and sizes of rooftop solar panels are often unknown
    to electricity system

    operators, previous work has used computer vision techniques on satellite imagery
    to generate size

    and location data for rooftop solar panels [165, 514, 868]. Further, to ensure
    that the distribution

    system runs smoothly, recent work has employed techniques such as matrix completion
    and deep

    neural networks to estimate the state of the system when there are few sensors
    [199, 388, 626].

    2.1.2

    Controllable Sources. Controllable low-carbon electricity sources can help achieve
    cli-

    mate change goals while requiring very few changes to how the electric grid is
    run (since today’s

    fossil fuel power plants are also controllable). ML can support existing controllable
    technologies

    while accelerating the development of new technologies such as nuclear fusion
    power plants.

    Managing existing technologies.

    Many controllable low-carbon technologies are already commercially available;
    these technologies

    include geothermal, nuclear fission, and (in some cases10) dam-based hydropower.
    ML can provide

    valuable input in planning where these technologies should be deployed and can
    also help maintain

    already-operating power plants. For instance, recent work has proposed to use
    ML to identify

    and manage sites for geothermal energy, using satellite imagery and seismic data
    [593]. Previous

    work has also used multi-objective optimization to place hydropower dams in a
    way that satisfies

    both energy and ecological objectives [856]. Finally, ML can help maintain nuclear
    fission reactors

    (i.e., nuclear power plants) by detecting cracks and anomalies from image and
    video data [129] or

    by preemptively detecting faults from high-dimensional sensor and simulation data
    [107]. (The

    authors of [794] speculate that ML and high performance computing could also be
    used to help

    simulate nuclear waste disposal options or even design next-generation nuclear
    reactors.)

    Accelerating fusion science.

    High Leverage Long-term

    Nuclear fusion reactors [577] have the potential to produce safe and carbon-free
    electricity using

    a virtually limitless hydrogen fuel supply, but currently consume more energy
    than they produce

    [146]. While considerable scientific and engineering research is still needed,
    ML can help accel-

    erate this work by, e.g., guiding experimental design and monitoring physical
    processes; see also

    [360]. Fusion reactors require intelligent experimental design because they have
    a large number

    10Dam-based hydropower may produce methane, primarily due to biomass that decomposes
    when a hydro reservoir floods,

    but the amount produced varies between power plants [753].

    Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning

    42:11

    of tunable parameters; ML can help prioritize which parameter configurations should
    be explored

    during physical experiments. For instance, Google and TAE Technologies have developed
    a human-

    in-the-loop experimental design algorithm enabling rapid parameter exploration
    for TAE’s reactor

    [53].

    Physically monitoring fusion reactors is also an important application for ML.
    Modern reactors

    attempt to super-heat hydrogen into a plasma state and then stabilize it, but
    during this process, the

    plasma may experience rapid instabilities that damage the reactor. Prior work
    has tried to preemp-

    tively detect disruptions for tokamak reactors, using supervised learning methods
    such as support-

    vector machines, adaptive fuzzy logic, decision trees, and deep learning [110,
    413, 567, 811, 846, 850]

    on previous disruption data. While many of these methods are tuned to work on
    individual reac-

    tors, recent work has shown that deep learning may enable insights that generalize
    to multiple

    reactors [413]. More generally, rather than simply detecting disruptions, scientists
    need to un-

    derstand how plasma’s state evolves over time, e.g., by finding the solutions
    of time-dependent

    magnetohydrodynamic equations [57]; speculatively, ML could help characterize
    this evolution

    and even help steer plasma into safe states through reactor control. ML models
    for such fusion

    applications would likely employ a combination of simulated11 and experimental
    data, and would

    need to account for the different physical characteristics, data volumes, and
    simulator speeds or

    accuracies associated with different reactor types.

    2.2

    Reducing Current-System Impacts

    While switching to low-carbon electricity sources will be essential, in the meantime,
    it will also be

    important to mitigate emissions from the electricity system as it currently stands.
    Some methods

    for mitigating current-system impacts include cutting emissions from fossil fuels,
    reducing waste

    from electricity delivery, and flexibly managing demand to minimize its emissions
    impacts.

    Reducing life-cycle fossil fuel emissions.

    High Leverage Uncertain Impact

    Reducing emissions from fossil fuels is a necessary stopgap while society transitions
    towards

    low-carbon electricity. In particular, ML can help prevent the leakage of methane
    (an extremely

    potent GHG) from natural gas pipelines and compressor stations. Previous and ongoing
    work has

    used sensor and/or satellite data to proactively suggest pipeline maintenance
    [213, 898] or detect

    existing leaks [81, 749, 823, 826], and there is a great deal of opportunity in
    this space to improve

    and scale existing strategies. In addition to leak detection, ML can help reduce
    emissions from

    freight transportation of solid fuels (Section 3), identify and manage storage
    sites for CO2

    sequestered from power plant flue gas (Section 7.2), and optimize power plant
    parameters to

    reduce CO2 emissions. In all these cases, projects should be pursued with great
    care so as not to

    impede or prolong the transition to a low-carbon electricity system; ideally,
    projects should be

    preceded by system impact analyses to ensure that they will indeed decrease GHG
    emissions.

    Reducing system waste.

    As electricity gets transported from generators to consumers, some of it gets
    lost as resistive

    heat on electricity lines. While some of these losses are unavoidable, others
    can be significantly

    mitigated to reduce waste and emissions. ML can help prevent avoidable losses
    through predictive

    maintenance, e.g., by suggesting proactive electricity grid upgrades (see also
    Sections 5.3 and 9.2).

    Prior work has performed predictive maintenance using long short-term memory (LSTM)
    [76],

    bipartite ranking [702], and neural network-plus-clustering techniques [581] on
    electric grid data,

    and future work will need to improve and/or localize these approaches to different
    contexts.

    11Plasma simulation frameworks for tokamak reactors include RAPTOR [236, 237],
    ASTRA [624], CRONOS [35], PTRANSP

    [100], and IPS [250].

    D. Rolnick et al.

    Modeling emissions.

    Flexibly managing household, commercial, industrial, and electric vehicle (EV)
    demand (as well

    as energy storage) can help minimize electricity-based emissions (Sections 3,
    4, 5, and 11), but do-

    ing so involves understanding what the emissions on the electric grid actually
    are at any moment.

    Specifically, marginal emissions factors capture the emissions effects of small
    changes in demand

    at any given time. To inform consumers about marginal emissions factors, initiatives
    such as Watt-

    Time [832] and the electricityMap project [789] have used ML and regression-based
    techniques

    to forecast marginal emissions based on electricity and weather data. Recent work
    has also used

    ML for trend extraction and feature selection within marginal emissions forecasting
    models [476].

    Great Britain’s National Grid ESO uses ensemble models to forecast average emissions
    factors,

    which measure the aggregate emissions intensity of all power plants [576]. There
    is still much

    room to improve the performance of these methods, as well as to forecast related
    quantities such

    as electricity curtailments (i.e., the wasting of usually low-carbon electricity
    for grid balancing pur-

    poses). As most existing methods produce point estimates, it would also be important
    to quantify

    the uncertainty of these estimates to ensure that load-shifting techniques indeed
    decrease (rather

    than increase) emissions.

    2.3

    Ensuring Global Impact

    Much of the discussion around electricity systems often focuses on settings such
    as the United

    States with near universal electricity access and relatively abundant data. However,
    many places

    that do not share these attributes are still integral to tackling climate change
    [370] and warrant se-

    rious consideration. To ensure global impact, ML can help improve electricity
    access and translate

    electricity system insights from high-data to low-data contexts.

    Improving clean energy access.

    Improving access to clean electricity can address climate change while simultaneously
    improving

    social and economic development [430, 431]. Specifically, clean electricity provided
    via electric

    grids, microgrids, or off-grid methods can displace diesel generators, wood-burning
    stoves, and

    other carbon-emitting energy sources. Figuring out what clean electrification
    methods are best

    for different areas can require intensive, on-the-ground surveying work, but ML
    can help provide

    input to this process in a scalable manner. For instance, previous work has used
    image processing,

    clustering, and optimization techniques on satellite imagery to inform electrification
    initiatives

    [219]. ML can also help operate rural microgrids through accurate forecasts of
    demand and power

    production [120, 601] as well as tailored optimization and control schemes [493],
    since small

    microgrids are even harder to balance than country-scale electric grids. Generating
    data to aid

    energy access policy and better managing energy access strategies are therefore
    two areas in

    which ML may have promising applications.

    Approaching low-data settings.

    High Leverage

    While ML methods have often been applied to grids with widespread sensors, system
    operators in

    many countries do not collect or share system data. Although these data availability
    practices may

    evolve, it may meanwhile be beneficial to use ML techniques such as transfer learning
    to trans-

    late insights from high-data to low-data settings (especially since all electric
    grids share the same

    underlying system physics). Developing data-efficient ML techniques will likely
    also be useful in

    low-data settings; for instance, in [680], the authors enforce physical or other
    domain-specific con-

    straints on weakly supervised ML models, allowing these models to learn from very
    little labeled

    data.

    ML can also help generate information within low-data settings. For instance,
    recent work has

    estimated the layout of electricity grids in regions where they are not explicitly
    mapped, using

    ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 55, No. 2, Article 42. Publication date: February
    2022.

    Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning

    42:13

    computer vision and graph search techniques on satellite imagery [278, 359]. Companies
    have

    also used satellite imagery to measure power plant CO2 emissions [114, 301] (also
    see Section 6.1).

    Other recent work has modeled electricity consumption using regression-based techniques
    on cel-

    lular network data [85], which may prove useful in settings with many cellular
    towers but few

    electric grid sensors. Although low-data settings are generally underexplored
    by the ML commu-

    nity, electricity systems research in these settings presents opportunities for
    both innovative ML

    and climate change mitigation.

    2.4

    Discussion

    Data-driven and critical to climate change, electricity systems hold many opportunities
    for ML

    research and practice. At the same time, applications in this space hold many
    potential pitfalls; for

    instance, innovations that seek to reduce GHG emissions in the oil and gas industries
    could actually

    increase emissions by making them cheaper to emit [814]. Given these domain-specific
    nuances,

    working in this area requires close collaborations with electricity system decision-makers
    and with

    practitioners in fields including electrical engineering, the natural sciences,
    and the social sciences.

    Interpretable ML may also enable practitioners to better understand, apply, and
    audit models in

    real-world settings. Similarly, it will be important to develop hybrid ML models
    that explicitly ac-

    count for system physics (see e.g., [132, 164, 304, 680, 843]), directly optimize
    for domain-specific

    goals [198, 220, 842], or otherwise incorporate or scale existing domain knowledge.
    Finally, since

    many modern electric grids are not data-abundant (although they may be data-driven),
    under-

    standing how to apply data-driven insights to these grids may be the next grand
    challenge for ML

    in electricity systems.

    TRANSPORTATION

    BY LYNN H. KAACK

    Transportation systems form a complex web that is fundamental to an active and
    prosperous so-

    ciety. Globally, the transportation sector accounts for about a quarter of energy-related
    CO2 emis-

    sions [372]. In contrast to the electricity sector, however, transportation has
    not made significant

    progress to lower its CO2 emissions [154] and much of the sector is regarded as
    hard to decarbonize

    [162]. This is because of the high energy density of fuels required for many types
    of vehicles, which

    constrains low-carbon alternatives, and because transport policies directly impact
    end-users and

    are thus more likely to be controversial.

    Passenger and freight transportation are each responsible for about half of transport
    GHG emis-

    sions [712]. Both freight and passengers can travel by road, by rail, by water,
    or by air (referred to as

    transport modes). Different modes carry vastly different carbon emission intensities.12
    At present,

    more than two-thirds of transportation emissions are from road travel [712], but
    air travel has the

    highest emission intensity and is responsible for an increasingly large share.
    Strategies to reduce

    GHG emissions13 from transportation consist of [712]:

    • reducing transport activity;

    • improving vehicle efficiency;

    • alternative fuels and electrification; and

    • modal shift (shifting to lower-carbon options, like rail).

    Each of these mitigation strategies offers opportunities for ML (Figure 2). While
    many of us

    probably think of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and ride-sharing when we think of
    transport and

    12Carbon intensity is measured in grams of CO2-equivalent per person-km or per
    ton-km, respectively.

    AR5 chapter on transportation [712], and

    ML, as described in

    Section 3.

    ML, these technologies have uncertain impacts on GHG emissions [820], potentially
    even increas-

    ing them. We discuss these disruptive technologies in Section 3.1 but show that
    ML can play a role

    for decarbonizing transportation that goes much further. ML can improve vehicle
    engineering, en-

    able intelligent infrastructure, and provide policy-relevant information. Many
    interventions that

    reduce GHG emissions in the transportation sector require changes in planning,
    maintenance, and

    operations of transportation systems, even though the GHG reduction potential
    of those measures

    might not be immediately apparent. ML can help in implementing such interventions,
    for example,

    by providing better demand forecasts. Typically, ML strategies are most effective
    in tandem with

    strong public policies. While we do not cover all ML applications in the transportation
    sector, we

    aim to include those areas that can conceivably reduce GHG emissions.

    3.1

    Reducing Transport Activity

    A colossal amount of transport occurs each day across the world, but much of this
    mileage occurs

    inefficiently, resulting in needless GHG emissions. With the help of ML, the number
    of vehicle-

    miles traveled can be reduced by making long trips less necessary, increasing
    loading, and opti-

    mizing vehicle routing. Here, we discuss the first two in depth—for a discussion
    of ML and routing,

    see for example [873].

    Understanding transportation data.

    Many areas of transportation lack data, and decision-makers often design infrastructure
    and policy

    with uncertain information. In recent years, new types of sensors have become
    available, and ML

    can turn this raw data into useful information. Traditionally, traffic is monitored
    with ground-

    based counters that are installed on selected roads. A variety of technologies
    are used, such as

    ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 55, No. 2, Article 42. Publication date: February
    2022.

    Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning

    42:15

    inductive loop detectors or pneumatic tubes. Traffic is sometimes monitored with
    video systems, in

    particular when counting pedestrians and cyclists, which can be automated with
    computer vision

    [870]. Since counts on most roads are often available only over short time frames,
    these roads are

    modeled by looking at known traffic patterns for similar roads. ML methods, such
    as SVMs and

    neural networks, have made it easier to classify roads with similar traffic patterns
    [270, 454, 796].

    As ground-based counters require costly installation and maintenance, many countries
    do not

    have such systems. Vehicles can also be detected in high-resolution satellite
    images with high

    accuracy [177, 390, 566, 747], and image counts can serve to estimate average
    vehicle traffic [405].

    Similarly, ML methods can help with imputing missing data for precise bottom-up
    estimation of

    GHG emissions [583] and they are also applied in simulation models of vehicle
    emissions [46].

    Modeling demand.

    High Leverage

    Modeling demand and planning new infrastructure can significantly shape how long
    trips are and

    which transport modes are chosen by passengers and shippers—for example, discouraging
    sprawl

    and creating new transportation links can both reduce GHG emissions. ML can provide
    informa-

    tion about mobility patterns, which is directly necessary for agent-based travel
    demand models,

    one of the main transport planning tools [864]. For example, ML makes it possible
    to estimate

    origin-destination demand from traffic counts [504], and it offers new methods
    for spatio-temporal

    road traffic forecasting—which do not always outperform other statistical methods
    [223] but may

    transfer well between areas [776]. Also, short-term forecasting of public transit
    ridership can im-

    prove with ML; see for example [158, 586]. ML is particularly relevant for deducing
    information

    from novel data—for example, learning about the behavior of public transit users
    from smart card

    data [280, 515]. Also, mobile phone sensors provide new means to understand personal
    travel de-

    mand and the urban topology, such as walking route choices [795]. Similarly, ML-based
    modeling

    of demand can help mitigate climate change by improving operational efficiency
    of modes that

    emit significant CO2, such as aviation. ML can help predict runway demand and
    aircraft taxi time

    in order to reduce the excess fuel burned in the air and on the ground due to
    congestion in airports

    [379, 474].

    Shared mobility.

    Uncertain Impact

    In the passenger sector, shared mobility (such as on-demand ride services or vehicle-sharing14),
    is

    undoubtedly disrupting the way people travel and think about vehicle ownership,
    and ML plays

    an integral part in running and optimizing these services (e.g., [768, 837]).
    However, it is largely

    unclear what the impact of this development will be on GHG emissions. For example,
    shared cars

    can actually cause more people to travel by car, as opposed to using public transportation.
    Simi-

    larly, on-demand taxi services add mileage when traveling without a customer,
    possibly negating

    any GHG emission savings [765]. On the other hand, shared mobility can lead to
    higher utiliza-

    tion of each vehicle, which means a more efficient use of materials [341]. The
    use of newer and

    more efficient vehicles, ideally electric ones, could increase with vehicle-sharing
    concepts, reduc-

    ing GHG emissions. Some of the issues raised above could also perhaps be overcome
    by making

    taxis autonomous. Such vehicles also might integrate better with public transportation,
    and offer

    new concepts for pooled rides, which substantially reduce the emissions per person-mile.

    ML methods can help to understand the energy impact of shared mobility concepts.
    For example,

    they can be used to predict if a customer decides to share a ride with other passengers
    from an on-

    demand ride service [133]. For decision-makers it is important to have access
    to timely location-

    specific empirical analysis to understand if a ride share service is taking away
    customers from

    14In this section, we discuss shared cars; see Section 3.4 for bike shares and
    electric scooters.

    D. Rolnick et al.

    low-carbon transit modes and increasing the use of cars. Some local governments
    are beginning

    to require data-sharing from these providers (see Section 4.3).

    Car-sharing services using AVs could yield GHG emission savings when they encourage
    people

    to use public transit for part of the journey [552] or with autonomous EVs [408].
    However, using

    autonomous shared vehicles alone could increase the total vehicle-miles traveled
    and therefore do

    not necessarily lead to lower emissions as long as the vehicles have internal
    combustion engines (or

    electrical engines on a “dirty” electrical grid) [131, 495]. We see the intersection
    of shared mobility,

    autonomous and EVs, and smart public transit—prioritizing low-carbon vehicle technologies
    and

    shared transportation—as a path where ML can make a contribution to shaping future
    mobility.

    See also Section 3.2 for more on AVs.

    When designing and promoting new mobility services, it is important that industry
    and public

    policy prioritize lowering GHG emissions. Misaligned incentives in the early stages
    of technolog-

    ical development could result in the lock-in to a service with high GHG emissions
    [36, 44].

    Freight routing and consolidation.

    High Leverage

    Bundling shipments together, which is referred to as freight consolidation, dramatically
    reduces

    the number of trips (and therefore the GHG emissions). The same is true for changing
    routing

    so that trucks do not have to return empty. As rail and water modes require much
    larger loads

    than trucks, consolidation also enables shipments to use these modes for part
    of the journey [407].

    Freight consolidation and routing decisions are often taken by third-party logistics
    service providers

    and other freight forwarders, such as in the less-than-truckload market, which
    deals with ship-

    ments of smaller sizes. ML offers opportunities to optimize this complex interaction
    of shipment

    sizes, modes, origin-destination pairs, and service requirements. Many problem
    settings are ad-

    dressed with methods from the field of operations research. There is evidence
    that ML can improve

    upon these methods, in particular mixed-integer linear programming [70]. Other
    proposed and de-

    ployed applications of ML include predicting arrival times or demand, identifying
    and planning

    around transportation disruptions [279], and clustering suppliers by their geographical
    location

    and common shipping destinations. Proposed planning approaches include designing
    allocation

    algorithms and freight auctions, and ML has for example been shown to help pick
    good algorithms

    and parameters to solve auction markets [708].

    Alternatives to transport.

    Uncertain Impact

    Disruptive technologies that are based on ML could replace or reduce transportation
    demand. For

    example, additive manufacturing (AM) or 3-D printing has (limited) potential to
    reduce freight

    transport by producing lighter goods and enabling production closer to the consumer
    [407]. ML

    can be a valuable tool for improving AM processes [859]. ML can also help to improve
    virtual com-

    munication [733]. If passenger trips are replaced by telepresence, travel demand
    can be reduced,

    as has been shown for example in public agencies [34] and for scientific teams
    [518]. However, it

    is uncertain to what extent virtual meetings replace physical travel, or if they
    may actually give

    rise to more face-to-face meetings [762].

    3.2

    Improving Vehicle Efficiency

    Most vehicles are not very efficient compared to what is technically possible:
    for example, aircraft

    carbon intensity is expected to decline by more than a third with respect to 2012,
    simply by virtue

    of newer models replacing aging jets [713]. Both the design of the vehicle and
    the way it is operated

    can increase the fuel economy. Here, we discuss how ML can help design more efficient
    vehicles

    and the impacts that autonomous driving may have on GHG emissions. Encouraging
    drivers to

    ACM Computing Surveys, Vol. 55, No. 2, Article 42. Publication date: February

    Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning

    42:17

    adopt more efficient vehicles is also a priority; while we do not focus on this
    here, ML plays a role

    in studying consumer preferences in vehicle markets [103].

    Designing for efficiency.

    There are many ways to reduce the energy a vehicle uses—such as more efficient
    engines, improved

    aerodynamics, hybrid electric engines, and reducing the vehicle’s weight or tire
    resistance. These

    different strategies require a broad range of engineering techniques, many of
    which can benefit

    from ML. For example, ML is applied in advanced combustion engine design [384].
    Hybrid EVs,

    which are more efficient than combustion engines alone, rely on power management
    methods that

    can be improved with ML [15]. Aerodynamic efficiency improvements need turbulence
    modeling

    that is often computationally intensive and relies heavily on ML-based surrogate
    models [865].

    Aerodynamic improvements can not only be made by vehicle design but also by rearranging
    load.

    Lai et al. [461] use computer vision to detect aerodynamically inefficient loading
    on freight trains.

    AM (3-D printing) can produce lighter parts in vehicles, such as road vehicles
    and aircraft, that

    reduce energy consumption [341, 407]. ML is applied to improve those processes,
    for example

    through failure detection [722, 730] or material design [309].

    Autonomous vehicles.

    Uncertain Impact

    ML is essential in the development of AVs, including in such basic tasks as following
    the road

    and detecting obstacles [87].15 While AVs could reduce energy consumption—for
    example, by re-

    ducing traffic congestion and inducing efficiency through eco-driving—it is also
    possible that AVs

    will lead to an increase in overall road traffic that nullifies efficiency gains.
    (For an overview of

    possible energy impacts of AVs, see [95, 820], and for broader impacts on mobility,
    see [327].)

    Two advantages of AVs in the freight sector promise to cut GHG emissions: First,
    small AVs, such

    as delivery robots and drones, could reduce the energy consumption of last-mile
    delivery [758],

    though they come with regulatory challenges [517]. Second, trucks can reduce energy
    consump-

    tion by platooning (driving very close together to reduce air resistance), thereby
    alleviating some

    of the challenges that come with electrifying long-distance road freight [318].
    Platooning relies on

    autonomous driving and communication technologies that allow vehicles to brake
    and accelerate

    simultaneously.

    ML can help to develop AV technologies specifically aimed at reducing energy consumption.
    For

    example, Wu et al. [851, 852] develop AV controllers based on RL to smooth out
    traffic involving

    non-AVs. Their studies of emergent behaviors in mixed-autonomy environments aim
    to under-

    stand the impact that varying shares of AVs can have on potentially reducing congestion-related

    energy consumption ML methods can also help to understand driving practices that
    are more en-

    ergy efficient. For example, Jiménez et al. [392] use data from smart phone sensors
    to identify

    driving behavior that leads to higher energy consumption in EVs.

    3.3

    Alternative Fuels and Electrification

    Electric vehicles.

    High Leverage

    EV technologies—using batteries, hydrogen fuel cells, or electrified roads and
    railways—are re-

    garded as a primary means to decarbonize transport. EVs can have very low GHG
    emissions—

    depending, of course, on the carbon intensity of the electricity. ML is vital
    for a range of different

    problems related to EVs. Rigas et al. [684] detail methods by which ML can improve
    charge schedul-

    ing, congestion management, and vehicle-to-grid algorithms. ML methods have also
    been applied

    15Providing details on the general role of ML for AVs is beyond the scope of this
    article.

    42:18

    D. Rolnick et al.

    to battery energy management (for example charge estimation [330] or optimization
    in hybrid EVs

    [15]), and to detect faults and lateral misalignment in wireless charging of EVs
    [780].

    As more people drive EVs, understanding their use patterns will become more important.
    Mod-

    eling charging behavior will be useful for grid operators looking to predict electric
    load. For this

    application, it is possible to analyze residential EV charging behavior from aggregate
    electricity

    load (energy disaggregation, see also Section 4.1) [827]. Also, in-vehicle sensors
    and communica-

    tion data are increasingly becoming available and offer an opportunity to understand
    travel and

    charging behavior of EV owners, which can for example inform the placement of
    charging stations

    [779] or alternatives such as battery swapping stations.

    Battery EVs are typically not used for more than a fraction of the day, allowing
    them to act as en-

    ergy storage for the grid at other times, where charging and discharging is controlled
    for example

    by price signals [265] (see Sections 2.1.1 and 2.2). There is much potential for
    ML (e.g., RL [810])

    to improve such vehicle-to-grid technology, which, like other mechanisms for grid
    energy storage

    (see Section 2.1.1), can help to reduce GHG emissions from electricity generation.
    Vehicle-to-grid

    technology comes with private and social financial benefits. However, consumers
    are expected to

    be reluctant to agree to such services, as they might not want to compromise their
    driving range

    [343].

    Finally, ML can also play a role in the research and development of batteries,
    a decisive technol-

    ogy for EV costs and usability. Work in this area has focused on predicting battery
    state, degra-

    dation, and remaining lifetime using supervised learning techniques, fuzzy logic,
    and clustering

    [42, 104, 218, 358, 414, 725, 735, 819, 854]. However, many models developed in
    academia are based

    on laboratory data that do not account for real-world factors such as environmental
    conditions

    [735, 819, 854]. By contrast, industry lags behind in ML modeling, but real-world
    operational data

    are readily available. Merging these two perspectives could yield significant
    benefits for the field.

    Alternative fuels.

    Long-term

    Much of the transportation sector is highly dependent on liquid fossil fuels.
    Aviation, long-distance

    road transportation, and ocean shipping require fuels with high energy density
    and thus are not

    conducive to electrification [162]. Electrofuels [98], solar fuels (Section 2.1.1),
    biofuels [6], hydro-

    gen [111, 803], and perhaps natural gas [792] offer alternatives, but the use
    of these fuels is con-

    strained by factors such as cost, land-use, and (for hydrogen and natural gas)
    incompatibility with

    current infrastructure [162]. Electrofuels and biofuels have the potential to
    serve as low-carbon

    drop-in fuels that retain the properties of fossil fuels, such as high energy
    density, while retain-

    ing compatibility with the existing fleet of vehicles and the current fuel infrastructure
    [407]. Fuels

    such as electrofuels and hydrogen can be produced using electricity-intensive
    processes and can be

    stored at lower cost than electricity. Thus, as a form of energy storage, these
    fuels could provide

    services to the electricity grid by enabling flexible power use and balancing
    variable electricity

    generators (Section 2.1.1). Given their relative long-term importance and early
    stage of develop-

    ment, they present a critical opportunity to mitigate climate change. ML techniques
    may present

    opportunities for improvement at various stages of research and development of
    alternative fuels

    (similar to applications in Section 2.1.1).

    3.4

    Modal Shift

    Shifting passengers and freight to low carbon-intensity modes is one of the most
    important means

    to decarbonize transport. This modal shift in passenger transportation can for
    example involve

    providing people with public transit, which requires analyzing mode choice and
    travel demand

    data. ML can also make low-carbon freight modes more competitive by helping to
    coordinate

    intermodal transport.

    2022.

    Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning

    42:19

    Passenger preferences.

    ML can improve our understanding about passengers’ travel mode choices, which
    in turn informs

    transportation planning, such as where public transit should be built. Some recent
    studies have

    shown that supervised ML based on survey data can improve passenger mode choice
    models

    [322, 571, 597]. Seo et al. propose to conduct long-term travel surveys with online
    learning, which

    reduces the demand on respondents, while obtaining high data quality [724]. Sun
    et al. [770] use

    SVMs and neural networks for analyzing preferences of customers traveling by high
    speed rail in

    China. There is also work on inferring people’s travel modes and destinations
    from social media

    or various mobile phone sensors such as GPS (transportation mode detection), e.g.,
    [156, 798]. Also

    in the freight sector, ML has been applied to analyze modal trade-offs, for example,
    by imputing

    data on counterfactual mode choices [706].

    Enabling low-carbon options.

    High Leverage

    In order to incentivize more users to choose low-carbon transport modes, their
    costs and service

    quality can be improved. Many low-carbon modes must be integrated with other modes
    of trans-

    portation to deliver the same level of service. For example, when traveling by
    train, the trip to

    and from the station will often be by car, taxi, bus, or bike. There are many
    opportunities for ML

    to facilitate a better integration of modes, both in the passenger and freight
    sectors. ML can also

    help to improve the operation of low-carbon modes, for example, by reducing the
    operations and

    maintenance costs of rail [383] and predicting track degradation [746].

    Bike sharing and electric scooter services can offer low-carbon alternatives for
    urban mobility

    that do not require ownership and integrate well with public transportation. ML
    studies help to

    understand how usage patterns for bike stations depend on their immediate urban
    surroundings

    [364]. ML can also help solve the bike sharing rebalancing problem, where shared
    bikes accumu-

    late in one location and are lacking in other locations, by improving forecasts
    of bike demand

    and inventory [675]. Singla et al. [739] propose a pricing mechanism based on
    online learning

    to provide monetary incentives for bike users to help rebalancing. By producing
    accurate travel

    time estimates, ML can provide tools that help to integrate bike shares with other
    modes of trans-

    portation [281]. Many emerging bike and scooter sharing services are dockless,
    which means that

    they are parked anywhere in public space and can block sidewalks [25]. ML has
    been applied to

    monitor public sentiment about such bike shares via tweets [775]. ML could also
    provide tools and

    information for regulators to ensure that public space can be used by everyone
    [741].

    Coordination between modes resulting in faster and more reliable transit times
    could increase

    the amount of people or goods traveling on low-carbon modes such as rail. ML algorithms
    could be

    applied to make public transportation faster and easier to use. For example, there
    is a rich literature

    exploring ML methods to predict bus arrival times and their uncertainty [18, 526].
    Often freight is

    packaged so that it can switch between different modes of transport easily. Such
    intermodal trans-

    portation relies on low-carbon modes such as rail and water for part of the journey
    [407]. ML can

    contribute by improving predictions of the estimated time of arrival (for example,
    of freight trains

    [56]) or the weight or volume of expected freight (for example, for roll-on/roll-off
    transport—often

    abbreviated as Ro-Ro [560]). Intelligent transport systems of different modes
    could be combined

    and enable more efficient multimodal freight transportation [407].

    Some modes with high GHG emissions, such as trucks, can be particularly cost-competitive
    in

    regions with lax enforcement of regulation, as they can benefit from overloading
    and not obeying

    labor or safety rules [407]. ML can assist public institutions with enforcing
    their regulations. For

    example, image recognition can help law enforcement detect overloading of trucks
    [888].

    Discussion

    Decarbonizing transport is essential to a low-carbon society, and there are numerous
    applica-

    tions where ML can make an impact. This is because transportation causes a large
    share of GHG

    emissions, but reducing them has been slow and complex. Solutions are likely very
    technical, are

    highly dependent on existing infrastructure, and require detailed understanding
    of passengers’ and

    freight companies’ behavior. ML can help decarbonize transportation by providing
    data, gaining

    knowledge from data, planning, and automation. Moreover, ML is fundamental to
    shared mobil-

    ity, AVs, EVs, and smart public transit, which, with the right incentives, can
    be used to enable

    significant reductions in GHG emissions.

    BUILDINGS & CITIES

    BY NIKOLA MILOJEVIC-DUPONT & LYNN H. KAACK

    Buildings offer some of the lowest-hanging fruit when it comes to reducing GHG
    emissions. While

    the energy consumed in buildings is responsible for a quarter of global energy-related
    emissions

    [372], a combination of easy-to-implement fixes and state-of-the-art strategies16
    could reduce emis-

    sions for existing buildings by up to 90% [802]. It is possible today for buildings
    to consume almost

    no energy [595].17 Many of these energy efficiency measures actually result in
    overall cost savings

    [754] and simultaneously yield other benefits, such as cleaner air for occupants.
    This potential

    can be achieved while maintaining the services that buildings provide—and even
    while extending

    them to more people, as climate change will necessitate. For example, with the
    changing climate,

    more people will need access to air conditioning in regions where deadly heat
    waves will become

    common [553, 554].

    Two major challenges are heterogeneity and inertia. Buildings vary according to
    age, con-

    struction, usage, and ownership, so optimal strategies vary widely depending on
    the context. For

    instance, buildings with access to cheap, low-carbon electricity may have less
    need for expensive

    features such as intelligent light bulbs. Buildings also have very long lifespans;
    thus, it is necessary

    both to create new, energy-efficient buildings, and to retrofit old buildings
    to be as efficient as

    possible [150]. Urban planning and public policy can play a major role in reducing
    emissions by

    providing infrastructure, financial incentives, or energy standards for buildings
    [536].18

    ML provides critical tools for supporting both building managers and policymakers
    in their

    efforts to reduce GHG emissions (Figure 3). At the level of building management,
    ML can help

    select strategies that are tailored to individual buildings, and can also contribute
    to implementing

    those strategies via smart control systems (Section 4.1). At the level of urban
    planning, ML can be

    used to gather and make sense of data to inform policymakers (Section 4.2). Finally,
    we consider

    how ML can help cities as a whole to transition to low-carbon futures (Section
    4.3).

    4.1

    Optimizing Buildings

    In designing new buildings and improving existing ones, there are numerous technologies
    that

    can reduce GHG emissions, often saving money in the process [276, 499, 595, 754,
    802]. ML can

    accelerate these strategies by (i) modeling data on energy consumption and (ii)
    optimizing energy

    use (in smart buildings).

    16The IPCC classifies mitigation actions in buildings into four categories: carbon
    efficiency (switching to low-carbon fuels or

    to natural refrigerants); energy efficiency (reducing energy waste through insulation,
    efficient appliances, better heating and

    ventilation, or other similar measures); system and infrastructure efficiency
    (e.g., passive house standards, urban planning,

    and district cooling and heating); and service demand reduction (behavioral and
    lifestyle changes) [499].

    17There are even high-rise buildings, e.g., the Tower Raiffeisen-Holding NÖ-Vienna
    office, or large university buildings,

    e.g., the Technical University also in Vienna, that achieve such performance.

    18For example, see the case of New York City, which mandated that building owners
    collectively reduce their emissions by

    40% by 2040: https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/nyregion/nyc-energy-laws.html.

    Section 4.

    Modeling building energy.

    An essential step towards energy efficiency is making sense of the increasing
    amounts of data

    produced by meters and home energy monitors (see for example [723]). This can
    take the form

    of energy demand forecasts for specific buildings, which are useful for power
    companies (Sec-

    tion 2.1.1) and in evaluating building design and operation strategies [20]. Traditionally,
    energy

    demand forecasts are based on models of the physical structure of a building that
    are essentially

    massive thermodynamics computations. ML has the potential to speed up these computations

    greatly, either by ignoring physical knowledge of the building entirely [452,
    617], by incorporating

    it into the computation [195], or by learning to approximate the physical model
    to reduce the need

    for expensive simulation (surrogate models) [274]. Learning how to transfer the
    knowledge gained

    from modeling one building to another can make it easier to render precise estimations
    of more

    buildings. For instance, Mocanu et al. [544] modeled building load profiles with
    RL and deep belief

    networks using data on commercial and residential buildings; they then used approximate
    RL and

    transfer learning to make predictions about new buildings, enabling the transfer
    of knowledge

    from commercial to residential buildings, and from gas- to power-heated buildings.

    Within a single building, understanding which appliances drive energy use (energy
    disaggrega-

    tion) is crucial for targeting efficiency measures, and can motivate behavioral
    changes. Promising

    ML approaches to this problem include hidden Markov models [445], sparse coding
    algorithms

    for structured prediction [443], harmonic analysis that picks out the “signatures”
    of individual

    appliances [750], and deep neural networks [423].

    To verify the success or failure of energy efficiency interventions, statistical
    ML offers methods

    for causal inference. For example, Burlig et al. [102] used Lasso regression on
    hourly electricity

    consumption data from schools in California to find that energy efficiency interventions
    fall short

    of the expected savings. Such problems could represent a useful application of
    deep learning meth-

    ods for counterfactual prediction [332].

    Smart buildings.

    High Leverage

    Intelligent control systems in buildings can decrease their carbon footprint both
    by reducing the

    energy consumed and by providing means to integrate lower-carbon sources into
    the electricity

    mix [277]. Specifically, ML can reduce energy usage by allowing devices and systems
    to adapt

    to usage patterns. Further, buildings can respond to signals from the electricity
    grid, providing

    flexibility to the grid operator and lowering costs to the consumer (Section 2.1.1).

    Many critical systems inside buildings can be made radically more efficient. While
    this is also

    true for various appliances such as refrigerators and lightbulbs, we focus on
    the example of heat-

    ing, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, both because they are notoriously
    in-

    efficient and because they account for more than half of the energy consumed in
    buildings [499].

    There are several promising ways to enhance HVAC operating performance, each providing
    sub-

    stantial opportunities for using ML: forecasting what temperatures are needed
    throughout the

    system, better control to achieve those temperatures, and fault detection. Forecasting
    tempera-

    tures, as with modeling energy use in buildings, has traditionally been performed
    using detailed

    physical models of the system involved; however, ML approaches such as deep belief
    networks can

    potentially increase accuracy with less computational expense [4, 255] (see also
    Section 5.3). For

    control, Kazmi et al. [417] used deep RL to achieve a scalable 20% reduction of
    energy while requir-

    ing only three sensors: air temperature, water temperature, and energy use (see
    also Section 5.3 for

    similarly substantial gains in datacenter cooling). Finally, ML can automate building
    diagnostics

    and maintenance through fault-detection. For example, the energy efficiency of
    cooling systems

    can degrade if refrigerant levels are low [435]; ML approaches are well-suited
    to detect faults in

    these systems. Wang et al. [829] treated HVAC fault-detection as a one-class classification
    problem,

    using only temperature readings for their predictions. Deep autoencoders can be
    used to simplify

    information about machine operation so that deep neural networks can then more
    easily predict

    multiple kinds of faults [387].

    Many systems within buildings—such as lights and heating—can also adjust how they
    operate

    based on whether a building or room is occupied, thereby improving both occupant
    comfort and

    energy use [614]. ML can help these systems dynamically adapt to changes in occupancy
    patterns

    [669]. Moreover, occupancy detection itself represents an opportunity for ML algorithms,
    ranging

    from decision trees [193, 882] to deep neural networks [896] that take input from
    occupancy

    sensors [193], WiFi signals [896, 897], or appliance power consumption data [882].
    Energy

    game-theoretic frameworks can also incentivize occupants to actively minimize
    their energy

    demand, and ML can help here to develop tailored incentives based on different
    energy usage

    behaviors [159].

    In Section 2.1.1, we discussed how using variable low-carbon energy can mean that
    the supply

    and price of electricity vary over time. Thus, energy flexibility in buildings
    is increasingly useful

    to schedule consumption when supply is high [683]. For this, automated demand-side
    response

    [357] can respond to electricity prices, smart meter signals, or learned user
    preferences [393]. Edge

    computing can be used to process data from distributed sensors and other Internet
    of Things devices,

    and deep RL can then use this data to efficiently schedule energy use [489], at
    the level of single

    or multiple buildings, or at the microgrid and grid level [631].

    While smart building technologies have the capability to significantly increase
    efficiency, we

    should note that there are potential drawbacks [346]. First, smart building devices
    and connection

    networks, like wireless sensor networks, consume energy themselves. Deep neural
    networks

    can be used to monitor and optimize such operations [39]. Second, rebound effects
    are likely

    to happen in certain cases [45], leading to additional building energy consumption
    typically

    ranging between 10 and 20% [671]. Third, if control systems optimize for costs,
    interventions

    do not necessarily translate into energy efficiency measures or GHG reductions.
    Therefore,

    public policies are needed to mandate, support and complement the actions of individual
    building

    managers [499]. Another concern in the case of widespread adoption of smart meters
    is the impact

    on mineral use and embodied energy use arising from their production [736]. Finally,
    smart home

    applications present security and privacy risks [144] that require adequate regulation.

    4.2

    Urban Planning

    For many impactful mitigation strategies—such as district heating and cooling,
    neighborhood plan-

    ning, and large-scale retrofitting of existing buildings—coordination at the district
    and city level is

    essential. Policymakers use instruments such as building codes, retrofitting subsidies,
    investments

    in public utilities, and public–private partnerships in order to reduce GHG emissions
    without com-

    promising equity. Where energy-use data on individual buildings exist, ML can
    be used to derive

    higher-level patterns. However, many regions of the world have almost no energy
    consumption

    data, which can make it difficult to design targeted mitigation strategies. ML
    is uniquely capa-

    ble of predicting energy consumption and GHG mitigation potential at scale from
    other types of

    available data, thereby guiding policy design [536].

    Modeling energy use across buildings.

    Urban Building Energy Models (UBEMs) provide simplified information on the energy
    use of

    all buildings across a city. These are different from individual building models,
    which model energy

    use of only specific buildings, but with finer details and temporal granularity
    (Section 4.1). While

    UBEMs have yet to be adopted at scale, they are expected to become fundamental
    for enabling

    localized action by city planners [677]. UBEMs can for example be used for planning
    and operating

    district heating and cooling, where a central plant supplies many households in
    a district. In turn,

    district heating and cooling reduces HVAC energy consumption and can provide flexible
    load [808],

    but it needs large amounts of data at the district level for implementation and
    operation.

    UBEMs include features such as the location, geometries, and various other attributes
    of

    interest like building footprint, usage, material, roof type, immediate surroundings,
    and the like.

    ML can be used to held predict energy consumption from such features. For example,
    Kolter

    and Ferreira used Gaussian process regression to predict energy use from features
    such as

    property class or the presence of central air conditioning [444]. Based on energy
    data disclosed

    by residents of New York City, Kontokosta and colleagues used various ML methods
    to predict

    the energy use of the city’s 1.1 million buildings [448], analyzed the effect
    of energy disclosure

    on the demand [610], and developed a system for ranking buildings based on energy
    efficiency

    [611]. Zhang et al. [879] matched residential energy consumption survey data with
    public use

    microdata samples to estimate residential energy consumption at the neighborhood
    level. Using

    five commonly accessible features of buildings and climate, Robinson et al. predict
    commercial

    building energy use across large American cities [689].

    Beyond energy prediction, buildings’ features can be used by ML algorithms to
    pinpoint which

    buildings have the highest retrofit potential. Simple building characteristics
    and surrounding en-

    vironmental factors—both potentially available at scale—can be used [83, 432].

    There have also been attempts to upscale individual-building energy models to
    the district scale.

    Using deep neural networks for hybrid ML-physical modelling, Nutkiewicz et al.
    provided precise

    energy demand forecasts that account for inter-building energy dynamics and urban
    microclimate

    factors for all buildings on a campus [589].

    D. Rolnick et al.

    sensing is key to inferring infrastructure data [79, 224, 339, 496, 535, 868]
    as satellite data19 present

    a source of information that is globally available and largely consistent worldwide.
    For example,

    using remote sensing data, Geiß et al. [273] clustered buildings into types to
    assess the potential

    of district heat in a German town.

    The resolution of infrastructure data ranges from coarse localization of all buildings
    at the global

    scale [224], to precise 3D reconstruction of a neighborhood [79]. It is possible
    to produce a global

    map of human settlement footprints at meter-level resolution from satellite radar
    images [224].

    For this, Esch et al. used highly automated learners, which make classification
    at such scale possi-

    ble by retraining locally. Segmentation of high-resolution satellite images can
    now generate exact

    building footprints at a national scale [535]. Energy-relevant building attributes,
    such as the pres-

    ence of photovoltaic panels, can also be retrieved from these images [868] (see
    Section 2.1.1). To

    generate 3D models, LiDAR data are often used to retrieve heights or classify
    buildings at city scale

    [339, 496], but its collection is expensive. Recent research showed that heights
    can be predicted

    even without such elevation data, as demonstrated by [77, 537], who predicted
    these from real

    estate records, census data and features characterizing the neighborhood of each
    building. Studies,

    which for now are small scale, aim for complete 3D reconstruction with class labels
    for different

    components of buildings [79].

    4.3

    The Future of Cities

    Since most of the resources of the world are ultimately channeled into cities,
    municipal govern-

    ments have a unique opportunity to mitigate climate change. City governments regulate
    (and some-

    times operate) transportation, buildings, and economic activity. They handle such
    diverse issues as

    energy, water, waste, crime, health, and noise. Recently, data and ML have become
    more common

    for improving efficiency in such areas, giving rise to the notion of smart city.
    While the phrase

    smart city encompasses a wide array of technologies [579], here we discuss only
    applications that

    are relevant to reducing GHG emissions.

    Data for smart cities.

    High Leverage

    Increasingly, important aspects of city life come with digital information that
    can make the city

    function in a more coordinated way. Habibzadeh et al. [319] differentiate between
    hard-sensing, i.e.,

    fixed-location-dedicated sensors like traffic cameras, and soft-sensing, for example,
    from mobile

    devices. Hard sensing is the primary data collection paradigm in many smart city
    applications,

    as it is adapted to precisely meet the application requirements. However, there
    is a growing

    volume of data coming from soft sensing, due to the widespread adoption of personal
    devices like

    smartphones that can provide movement data and geotagged pictures.20 Urban computing
    [886]

    is an emerging field looking at data analytics in urban spaces, and aiming to
    yield insights for

    data-driven policies. For example, clustering anonymized credit card payments
    makes it possible

    to model different communities and lifestyles—of which the sustainability can
    be assessed [181].

    Jiang et al. provides a review of urban computing from mobile phone traces [391].21
    Relevant

    information on the urban space can also be learned from social media activity,
    e.g., on Twitter, as

    reviewed in [367, 703]. There are, however, numerous challenges in making sense
    of this wealth

    of data (see [558]), and privacy considerations are of paramount importance when
    collecting or

    working with many of these data sources.

    19See [893] for a review of different sources of data and deep learning methods
    for processing them.

    20Note that management of any such private data, even if they are anonymized,
    poses challenges [153].

    21See https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/urban-computing/ for more
    applications of urban computing.

    Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning

    42:25

    First, cities need to obtain relevant data on activities that directly or indirectly
    consume energy,

    and such data are often proprietary. To obtain these data, the city of Los Angeles
    now requires all

    mobility as a service providers, i.e., vehicle-sharing companies, to use an open-source
    application

    programming interface. Data such as location, use, and condition of all those
    vehicles, which can be

    useful in guiding regulation, are thus transmitted to the city [134]. ML can also
    distill information

    on urban issues related to climate change through web-scraping and text-mining,
    e.g., [775]. As

    discussed above (Section 4.2), ML can also be used to infer infrastructure data.

    Second, smart city applications must transmit high volumes of data in real-time.
    ML is key to

    preprocessing large amounts of data in large sensor networks, allowing only what
    is relevant to

    be transmitted, instead of all the raw data that is being collected [480, 672,
    804]. Similar techniques

    also help to reduce the amount of energy consumed during transmission itself [563].

    Third, urban policy-making based on intelligent infrastructure faces major challenges
    with

    data management [286]. Smart cities require the integration of multiple large
    and heterogeneous

    sources of data, for which ML can be a valuable tool, which includes data matching
    [89, 190], data

    fusion [885], and ensemble learning [451].

    Low-emissions infrastructure.

    When smart city projects are properly integrated into urban planning, they can
    make cities more

    sustainable and foster low-carbon lifestyles (see [563, 602, 853] for extensive
    reviews on this topic).

    Different types of infrastructure interact, meaning that planning strategies should
    be coordinated

    to achieve mitigation goals. For instance, urban sprawl influences the energy
    use from transport,

    as wider cities tend to be more car-oriented [151, 189, 228]. ML-based analysis
    has shown that the

    development of efficient public transportation is dependent on both the extent
    of urban sprawl

    and the local development around transportation hubs [547, 737].

    Cities can reduce GHG emissions by coordinating between infrastructure sectors
    and better

    adapting services to the needs of the inhabitants. ML and AI can help, for example,
    to coordinate

    district heating and cooling networks, solar power generation, and charging stations
    for EVs and

    bikes [602], and can improve public lighting systems by regulating light intensity
    based on histor-

    ical patterns of foot traffic [169]. Due to inherent variability in energy demand
    and supply, there

    is a need for uncertainty estimation, e.g., using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods
    or Gaussian

    processes [602].

    Currently, most smart city projects for urban climate change mitigation are implemented
    in

    wealthier regions such as the United States, China, and the European Union.22
    The literature on

    city-scale mitigation strategies is also strongly biased towards the Global North
    [466], while key

    mitigation challenges are expected to arise from the Global South [570]. Infrastructure
    models

    described in Section 4.2 could be used to plan low-carbon neighborhoods without
    relying on ad-

    vanced smart city technologies. To transfer strategies across cities, it is possible
    to cluster similar

    cities based on climate-relevant dimensions [326, 494]. Creutzig et al. [151]
    related the energy use

    of 300 cities worldwide to historical structural factors such as fuel taxes (which
    have a strong im-

    pact on urban sprawl). Other relevant applications include groupings of transportation
    systems

    [326] using a latent class choice model, or of street networks [494] to identify
    common patterns

    in urban development using hierarchical clustering.

    Discussion

    We have shown many different ways that ML can help to reduce GHG emissions from
    buildings

    and cities. A central challenge in this sector is the availability of high-quality
    data for training

    the algorithms, which rarely go beyond main cities or represent the full spectrum
    of building

    types. Techniques for obtaining these data, however, can themselves be an important
    application

    for ML (e.g., via computer vision algorithms to parse satellite imagery). Realizing
    the potential of

    data-driven urban infrastructure can advance mitigation goals while improving
    the well-being of

    citizens [50, 150, 802].

    INDUSTRY

    BY ANNA WALDMAN-BROWN

    Industrial production, logistics, and building materials are leading causes of
    difficult-to-eliminate

    GHG emissions [162]. Fortunately for ML researchers, the global industrial sector
    spends billions

    of dollars annually gathering data on factories and supply chains [310]—aided
    by improvements in

    the cost and accessibility of sensors and other data-gathering mechanisms (such
    as QR codes and

    image recognition). The availability of large quantities of data, combined with
    affordable cloud-

    based storage and computing, indicates that industry may be an excellent place
    for ML to make a

    positive climate impact.

    ML demonstrates considerable potential for reducing industrial GHG emissions under
    the fol-

    lowing circumstances:

    • When there is enough accessible, high-quality data around specific processes
    or transport

    routes.

    • When firms have an incentive to share their proprietary data and/or algorithms
    with re-

    searchers and other firms.

    • When aspects of production or shipping can be readily fine-tuned or adjusted,
    and there are

    clear objective functions.

    • When firms’ incentives align with reducing emissions (for example, through efficiency
    gains,

    regulatory compliance, or high GHG prices).

    In particular, ML can potentially reduce global emissions (Figure 4) by helping
    to streamline supply

    chains, improve production quality, predict machine breakdowns, optimize heating
    and cooling

    systems, and prioritize the use of clean electricity over fossil fuels [74, 227,
    416, 880]. However,

    it is worth noting that greater efficiency may increase the production of goods
    and thus GHG

    emissions (via rebound effects) unless industrial actors have sufficient incentives
    to reduce overall

    emissions [748].

    5.1

    Optimizing Supply Chains

    In 2006, at least two Scottish seafood firms flew hundreds of metric tons of shrimp
    from Scotland

    to China and Thailand for peeling, then back to Scotland for sale—because they
    could save

    on labor costs [147]. This indicates the complexity of today’s globalized supply
    chains, i.e., the

    organizational processes and shipping networks that are required to bring a product
    from

    producer to final consumer. ML can help reduce emissions in supply chains by intelligently

    predicting supply and demand, identifying lower-carbon products, and optimizing
    shipping

    routes. (For details on shipping and delivery optimization, see Section 3.) However,
    for many of

    these applications to reduce emissions, firms’ financial incentives must also
    align with climate

    change mitigation through carbon pricing or other policy mechanisms.

    source of industrial GHG emissions, particularly for time-dependent goods such
    as perishable food

    or retail goods that quickly fall out of fashion [828]. Global excess inventory
    in 2011 amounted

    to about $8 trillion worth of goods, according to the Council of Supply Chain
    Management Pro-

    fessionals [847]. This excess may be in part due to mis-estimation of demand,
    as the same or-

    ganization noted that corporate sales estimates diverged from actual sales by
    an average of 40%

    [847]. ML may be able to mitigate these issues of overproducing and/or overstocking
    goods by

    improving demand forecasting [12, 797]. For example, the clothing industry sells
    an average of

    only 60% of its wares at full price, but some brands can sell up to 85% due to
    just-in-time manufac-

    turing and clever intelligence networks [294]. As online shopping and just-in-time
    manufacturing

    become more prevalent and websites offer more product types than physical storefronts,
    better

    demand forecasts will be needed on a regional level to efficiently distribute
    inventory without

    letting unwanted goods travel long distances only to languish in warehouses [685].
    Nonetheless,

    negative side effects can be significant depending on the type of product and
    regional character-

    istics; just-in-time manufacturing and online shopping are often responsible for
    enabling prod-

    uct fads with shorter lifespans, in addition to smaller and faster shipments of
    goods (mostly by

    road) that lack the energy efficiency of freight aggregation and slower shipping
    methods such as

    rail [685, 799].

    Recommender systems.

    Recommender systems can potentially direct consumers and purchasing firms toward
    climate-

    friendly options, as long as one can obtain information about GHG emissions throughout
    the

    entire life-cycle of some product. The challenge here lies in hunting down usable
    data on every

    relevant material and production process from metal ore extraction through production,
    shipping,

    and eventual use and disposal of a product [336, 674]. One must also convince
    companies to share

    proprietary data to help other firms learn from best practices. If these datasets
    can be acquired,

    ML algorithms could hypothetically assist in identifying the cleanest options.

    Reducing food waste.

    High Leverage

    Globally, society loses or wastes 1.3 billion metric tons of food each year, which
    translates to one-

    third of all food produced for human consumption [316]. In developing countries,
    40% of food

    waste occurs between harvest and processing or retail, while over 40% of food
    waste in industrial-

    ized nations occurs at the end of supply chains, in retail outlets, restaurants,
    and consumers’ homes

    D. Rolnick et al.

    [316]. ML can help reduce food waste by optimizing delivery routes and improving
    demand fore-

    casting at the point of sale (see Section 5.1), as well as improving refrigeration
    systems [532] (see

    Section 5.3). ML can also potentially assist with other issues related to food
    waste, such as helping

    develop sensors to identify when produce is about to spoil, so it can be sold
    faster or removed from

    a storage crate before it ruins the rest of the shipment [256].

    5.2

    Improving Materials

    Climate-friendly construction.

    High Leverage Long-term

    Cement and steel production together account for over 10% of all global GHG emissions
    [243]; the

    cement industry alone emits more GHGs than every country except the USA and China
    [477]. ML

    can help minimize these emissions by reducing the need for carbon-intensive materials,
    by trans-

    forming industrial processes to run on low-carbon energy, and even by redesigning
    the chemistry

    of structural materials. To reduce the use of cement and steel, researchers have
    combined ML with

    generative design to develop structural products that require less raw material,
    thus reducing the

    resulting GHG emissions [416]. Novel manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing
    allow for the

    production of unusual shapes that use less material but may be impossible to produce
    through

    traditional metal-casting or poured concrete; ML and finite element modeling have
    been used to

    simulate the physical processes of 3D printing in order to improve the quality
    of finished products

    [62].

    Assuming future advances in materials science, ML research could potentially draw
    upon open

    databases such as the Materials Project [380] and the UCI Machine Learning Repository
    [271] to

    invent new, climate-friendly materials [830]. Using semi-supervised generative
    models and con-

    crete compression data, for example, Ge et al. proposed novel, low-emission concrete
    formulas

    that could satisfy desired structural characteristics [271].

    Climate-friendly chemicals.

    High Leverage Long-term

    Researchers are also experimenting with supervised learning and thermal imaging
    systems to

    rapidly identify promising catalysts and chemical reactions [140, 686], as described
    in Section 2.1.1.

    Firms are unlikely to adopt new materials or change existing practices without
    financial incentives,

    so widespread adoption might require subsidies for low-carbon alternatives or
    penalties for high

    GHG emissions.

    Ammonia production for fertilizer use relies upon natural gas to heat up and catalyze
    the

    reaction, and accounts for around 2% of global energy consumption [551]. To develop
    cleaner

    ammonia, chemists may be able to invent electrochemical strategies for lower-temperature

    ammonia production [551, 849]. Given the potential of ML for predicting chemical
    reactions

    [140], ML may also be able to help with the discovery of new materials for electrocatalysts
    and/or

    proton conductors to facilitate ammonia production.

    5.3

    Production and Energy

    ML can potentially assist in reducing overall electricity consumption, streamlining
    factories’

    HVAC systems, and developing models for electrifying industrial processes so they
    can be run

    on low-carbon energy instead of coal, oil, or natural gas [305]. Again, the higher
    the incentives

    for reducing carbon emissions, the more likely that firms will optimize for low-carbon
    energy use.

    New factory equipment can be very expensive to purchase and set up, so firms’
    cost–benefit calcu-

    lations may dissuade them from retrofitting existing factories to run using low-carbon
    electricity

    or to save a few kilowatts [288, 633, 778]. Given the heterogeneity across industrial
    sectors and

    the secrecy of industrial data, firms will also need to tailor the requisite sensors
    and data analysis

    systems to their individual processes. ML will become a much more viable option
    for industry

    Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning

    when factory workers can identify, develop, implement, and monitor their own solutions
    inter-

    nally instead of relying upon outside experts [337]. The ML community can assist
    by building

    accessible, customizable industry tools (i.e., “low-code” or “no-code” user interfaces)
    tailored for

    people without a strong background in data science.

    Adaptive control.

    High Leverage

    On the production side, ML can potentially improve the efficiency of HVAC systems
    and other

    industrial control mechanisms—if given necessary data about all relevant processes.
    To reduce

    GHG emissions from HVAC systems, researchers have suggested combining optimization-based

    control algorithms with ML techniques such as image recognition, regression trees,
    and time delay

    neural networks [5, 202] (see also 4.1). DeepMind has used RL to optimize cooling
    centers for

    Google’s internal servers by predicting and optimizing the power usage effectiveness,
    thus lowering

    HFC emissions and reducing cooling costs [227, 268]. Deep neural networks could
    also be used for

    adaptive control in a variety of industrial networking applications [8], enabling
    energy savings

    through self-learning about devices’ surroundings.

    Predictive maintenance.

    ML could also contribute to predictive maintenance (see also Sections 2.2 and
    9.2) by more accu-

    rately modelling the wear and tear of machinery that is currently in use, and
    interpretable ML

    could assist factory owners in developing a better understanding of how best to
    minimize GHG

    emissions for specific equipment and processes. For example, creating a digital
    twin model of some

    industrial equipment or process could enable a manufacturer to virtually experiment
    with a new

    piece of code before uploading it to the factory floor, and to test out scenarios
    for lower GHG emis-

    sions without slowing down production [290, 777]. Digital twins can also reduce
    production waste

    by identifying broken or about-to-break machines before the actual factory equipment
    starts pro-

    ducing damaged products. Industrial systems can employ similar models to predict
    which pipes

    are liable to spring leaks, thus minimizing the direct release of GHGs such as
    HFCs and natural

    gas.

    Using cleaner electricity.

    High Leverage

    ML may be particularly useful for enabling more flexible operation of industrial
    electrical loads,

    through optimizing a firm’s demand response to electricity prices (see also Section
    2). Such opti-

    mization can contribute to cutting GHG emissions as long as firms have a financial
    incentive to

    optimize for minimal emissions, maximal low-carbon energy, or minimum overall
    power usage.

    Demand response optimization algorithms can help firms adjust the timing of energy-intensive

    processes such as cement crushing [880] and powder-coating [43] to take advantage
    of electric-

    ity price fluctuations, although published work on the topic has to date used
    relatively little ML.

    Online algorithms for optimizing demand response can reduce overall power usage
    for computer

    servers by dynamically shifting the internet traffic load of data providers to
    underutilized servers,

    although most of this research, again, has focused on minimizing costs rather
    than GHG emissions

    [99, 352]. Berral et al. proposed a framework that demonstrates how such optimization
    algorithms

    might be combined with RL, digitized controls, and feedback systems to enable
    the autonomous

    control of industrial processes [74].

    5.4

    Discussion

    Given the globalized nature of international trade and the urgency of climate
    change, decarboniz-

    ing the industrial sector is becoming a key priority for both policymakers and
    factory owners

    worldwide. Many companies are now writing decarbonization strategies in response
    to increasing

    pressure from governments, financial institutions, and stockholders (see, e.g.,
    [620, 793]). These

    strategies are evolving rapidly, using ML alongside many approaches not covered
    here.

    As we have seen, there are a number of highly impactful applications where ML
    can help re-

    duce GHG emissions in industry, with several caveats. First, incentives for cleaner
    production and

    distribution are not always aligned with reduced costs, though policies can play
    a role in aligning

    these incentives. Second, despite the proliferation of industrial data, much of
    the information is

    proprietary, low-quality, or very specific to individual machines or processes;
    practitioners esti-

    mate that 60%–70% of collected industrial data goes unused [138, 310]. Before
    investing in exten-

    sive ML research, researchers should be sure that they will be able to eventually
    access and clean

    any data needed for their algorithms. Finally, misjudgments can be very costly
    for manufacturers

    and retailers, leading most managers to adopt risk-averse strategies towards relatively
    untested

    technologies such as ML [337]. For this reason, ML algorithms that determine industrial
    activities

    should be robust enough to guarantee both performance and safety, along with providing
    both

    interpretable and reproducible results [338, 709].

    FARMS & FORESTS

    BY ALEXANDRE LACOSTE

    Plants, microbes, and other organisms have been drawing CO2 from the atmosphere
    for millions

    of years. Most of this carbon is continually broken down and recirculated through
    the carbon

    cycle, and some is stored deep underground, e.g., as fossil fuels, but a large
    amount of carbon is

    sequestered in the biomass of trees, peat bogs, and soil. Our current economy
    encourages practices

    that are freeing much of this sequestered carbon through deforestation and unsustainable
    agricul-

    ture. On top of these effects, cattle and rice farming generate methane, a GHG
    far more potent than

    CO2 itself. Overall, land use by humans is estimated to be responsible for about
    a quarter of global

    GHG emissions [370] (and this may be an underestimate [511]). In addition to this
    direct release

    of carbon through human actions, the permafrost is now melting, peat bogs are
    drying, and forest

    fires are becoming more frequent as a consequence of climate change itself – all
    of which release

    yet more carbon [573].

    The large scale of this problem allows for a similar scale of positive impact.
    According to one es-

    timate [335], about a third of GHG emissions reductions could come from better
    land management

    and agriculture. ML can play an important role in some of these areas. Precision
    agriculture could

    reduce carbon release from the soil and improve crop yield, which in turn could
    reduce the need

    for deforestation. Satellite images make it possible to estimate the amount of
    carbon sequestered

    in a given area of land, as well as track GHG emissions from it. ML can help monitor
    the health

    of forests and peatlands, predict the risk of fire, and contribute to sustainable
    forestry (Figure 5).

    These areas represent highly impactful applications, in particular, of sophisticated
    computer vision

    tools, though care must be taken in some cases to ensure that ML tools are used
    in ways aligned

    with decarbonization.

    6.1

    Remote Sensing of Emissions

    High Leverage

    Having real-time maps of GHGs could help us quantify emissions from agriculture
    and forestry

    practices, which remain relatively uncertain [371], as well as monitor emissions
    from other sectors

    (Section 2.2).

    Such information would be valuable in guiding regulations or incentives that could
    lead to better

    land use practices. For example, data on emissions make it possible to set effective
    targets, and

    pinpointing the sources of emissions makes it possible to enforce regulations.

    While GHGs are invisible to our eyes, they must by definition interact with sunlight.
    This

    means that we can observe these compounds with hyperspectral cameras [428, 711].
    These

    cameras can record up to several hundred different wavelengths (instead of simply
    red, green,

    and blue [RGB]), providing information on the interaction between light and individual
    chemi-

    cals. Many satellites are equipped with such cameras and can perform, to some
    extent, estimations

    of CO2, CH4 (methane), H2O, and N2O (nitrous oxide) emissions [73, 378]. While
    extremely useful

    for studying climate change, most of these satellites have very coarse spatial
    resolution and large

    temporal and spatial gaps, making them unsuitable for precise tracking of emissions.
    Standard

    satellite imagery provides RGB images with much higher resolution, which could
    be used in an

    ML algorithm to fill the gaps in hyperspectral data and obtain more precise information
    about

    emissions.23 Some preliminary work [378] has studied this possibility, but this
    remains largely an

    open problem with high potential impact.

    6.2

    Precision Agriculture

    High Leverage Uncertain Impact

    Crop production is a significant source of GHG emissions. This might come as a
    surprise, since

    plants take up CO2 from the air. However, modern industrial crop production involves
    more than

    just growing plants. First, the land is generally stripped of existing vegetation,
    releasing carbon

    sequestered there. Second, the process of tilling exposes topsoil to the air,
    thereby releasing car-

    bon that had been bound in soil aggregates and disrupting organisms in the soil
    that contribute to

    sequestration. Finally, because such farming practices strip soil of nutrients,
    nitrogen-based fertil-

    izers must be added back to the system. Synthesizing these fertilizers consumes
    massive amounts

    of energy, about 2% of global energy consumption [551] (see Section 5.2). Moreover,
    while some

    of this nitrogen is absorbed by plants or retained in the soil, some is converted
    to nitrous oxide,24

    a GHG that is about 300 times more potent than CO2.

    Such industrial agriculture approaches are ultimately based on making farmland
    more uniform

    and predictable. This allows it to be managed at scale using basic automation
    tools like tractors,

    but can be both more destructive and less productive than approaches that work
    with the natural

    23Satellites with higher resolution hyperspectral cameras are beginning to deploy,
    including GHGSat satellites in already

    orbit and plans by Carbon Mapper, Bluefield Technologies, and the Environmental
    Defense Fund to launch satellites in

    coming years [81, 113, 534]. Even once this technology comes online, ML will remain
    useful to cover gaps and to estimate

    emissions of other GHGs.

    24Some fertilizer additionally often ends up in waterways, which can contaminate
    drinking water and induce blooms of

    toxic algae [687].

    heterogeneity of land and crops. Increasingly, there is demand for sophisticated
    tools which would

    allow farmers to work at scale, but adapt to what the land needs. This approach
    is often known as

    “precision agriculture.”

    Smarter robotic tools can help enable precision agriculture. Robots are under
    development, for

    example, with the ability to perform mechanical weeding, targeted pesticide application,
    and vac-

    uuming of pests [766], as well as the collection of large datasets for continual
    improvement [68].

    Many corporate players now exist in the space of ML-aided robotics for precision
    agriculture

    [80, 212, 742, 788]. There remains significant room for development, since many
    tasks remain

    challenging for robots, and furthermore there are a large number of specific tasks
    and agricultural

    settings to consider.

    There are many additional ways in which ML can contribute to precision agriculture.
    Intelli-

    gent irrigation systems can save large amounts of water while reducing pests that
    thrive under

    excessive moisture [335]. ML can also help in disease detection, weed detection,
    and soil sensing

    [482, 699, 821]. ML can guide crop yield prediction [866] and even macroeconomic
    models that

    help farmers predict crop demand and decide what to plant at the beginning of
    the season [503].

    These problems often have minimal hardware requirements, as devices such as Unmanned
    Aerial

    Vehicles (UAVs) with hyperspectral cameras can be used for all of these tasks.

    Globally, agriculture constitutes a $2.4 trillion industry [785], and there is
    already a signifi-

    cant economic incentive to increase efficiency. However, efficiency gains do not
    necessarily trans-

    late into reduced GHG emissions (e.g., via rebound effects increasing consumption
    of particularly

    emissions-intensive products). Moreover, significantly reducing emissions may
    require a shift in

    agricultural paradigms, for example, widespread adoption of regenerative agriculture,
    silvopasture,

    and tree intercropping [335]. ML tools for policymakers and agronomists [126]
    could potentially

    encourage climate-positive action: for example, remote sensing with UAVs and satellites
    could per-

    form methane detection and carbon stock estimation, which could be used to incentivize
    farmers

    to sequester more carbon and reduce emissions.

    6.3

    Monitoring Peatlands

    High Leverage

    Peatlands (a type of wetland ecosystem) cover only 3% of the Earth’s land area,
    yet hold twice

    the total carbon in all the world’s forests, making peat the largest source of
    sequestered carbon on

    Earth [612]. When peat dries, however, it releases carbon through decomposition
    and also becomes

    susceptible to fire [245, 612]. A single peat fire in Indonesia in 1997 is reported
    to have released

    emissions comparable to 20%–50% of global fossil fuel emissions during the same
    year [606].

    Monitoring peatlands and protecting them from artificial drainage or droughts
    is essential to

    preserve the carbon sequestered in them [349, 400]. In [538], ML was applied to
    features extracted

    from remote sensing data to estimate the thickness of peat and assess the carbon
    stock of tropical

    peatlands. A central database for peatland-monitoring has been established, but
    considerable data

    gaps remain [121]. Advanced ML could potentially help develop precise monitoring
    tools at low

    cost, as well as predicting the risk of fire.

    6.4

    Managing Forests

    Estimating carbon stock.

    High Leverage

    Modeling (and pricing) carbon stored in forests requires us to assess how much
    is being sequestered

    or released across the planet. Since most of a forest’s carbon is stored in above-ground
    biomass

    [693], tree species and heights are a good indicator of the carbon stock.

    The height of trees can be estimated fairly accurately with LiDAR devices mounted
    on UAVs, but

    this technology is not scalable and many areas are closed to UAVs. To address
    this challenge, ML

    2022.

    Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning

    42:33

    can be used to predict the LiDAR’s outcome from satellite imagery [48, 599, 693].
    From there, the

    learned estimator can perform predictions at scale. Despite progress in this area,
    there is still signif-

    icant room for improvement. For example, LiDAR data are often not equally distributed
    across re-

    gions or seasons. Hence domain adaptation and transfer learning techniques may
    help algorithms

    to generalize better.

    Automating afforestation.

    Long-term Uncertain Impact

    Planting trees, also called afforestation, can be a means of sequestering CO2
    over the long term.

    According to one estimate, up to 0.9 billion hectares of extra canopy cover could
    theoretically be

    added [60] globally. However, care must be taken when planting trees to ensure
    a positive impact.

    Afforestation that comes at the expense of farmland (or ecosystems such as peat
    bogs) could result

    in a net increase of GHG emissions. Moreover, planting trees without regard for
    local conditions

    and native species can reduce the climate impact of afforestation as well as negatively
    affecting

    biodiversity.

    ML can be helpful in automating large-scale afforestation by locating appropriate
    planting sites,

    monitoring plant health, assessing weeds, and analyzing trends. For example, startups
    like Den-

    dra Systems and Droneseed are developing UAVs that are capable of planting seed
    packets more

    quickly and cheaply than traditional methods [176, 204], while Restor uses ML
    to learn from past

    afforestation projects about effective strategies for ecosystem restoration [681].

    Managing forest fires.

    Besides their potential for harming people and property, forest fires release
    CO2 into the atmo-

    sphere (which in turn increases the rate of forest fires [839]). On the other
    hand, small forest fires

    are part of natural forest cycles. Preventing them causes biomass to accumulate
    on the ground

    and increases the chances of large fires, which can then burn all trees to the
    ground and erode top

    soil, resulting in high CO2 emissions, biodiversity loss, and a long recovery
    time [550]. Drought

    forecasting [682] is helpful in predicting regions that are more at risk, as is
    estimating the water

    content in the tree canopy [94]. In [266, 267], RL is used to predict the spatial
    progression of fire.

    This helps firefighters decide when to let a fire burn and when to stop it [355].
    With good tools

    to evaluate regions that are more at risk, firefighters can perform controlled
    burns and cut select

    areas to prevent the progression of fires.

    Reducing deforestation.

    High Leverage

    Only 17% of the world’s forests are legally protected [506]. The rest are subject
    to deforestation,

    which contributes to approximately 10% of global GHG emissions [370] as vegetation
    is burned

    or decays. About 80% percent of global deforestation is the result of agriculture
    (clearing land for

    pasture or crop production), while other significant causes include mining, logging,
    and urban

    development [353].

    Tools for tracking deforestation can provide valuable data for informing policymakers,
    as well

    as law enforcement in cases where deforestation may be conducted illegally. ML
    can be used with

    remote sensing imagery to pinpoint changes in forest cover [241, 329, 369], or
    proxies for defor-

    estation such as smoke from fires set to clear vegetation [505], as well as to
    differentiate selective

    cutting from clearcutting [342, 487]. ML can also be used with audio instead of
    visual data; one

    such project installs (old) smartphones powered by solar panels in the forest,
    which enables the

    detection of chainsaw sounds within a one-kilometer radius [657].

    ML can also be used to help build incentive structures for sustainable forest
    management. Some

    companies are using ML-enabled tools to quantify the carbon impact of forestry
    decisions, enabling

    landowners to choose more beneficial actions as well as profit by selling carbon
    offsets [578, 603].

    ML can also help in proving that tracts of forest are indeed being preserved (integrating

    Discussion

    Farms and forests make up a large portion of global GHG emissions, but reducing
    these emissions

    is challenging. The scope of the problem is highly globalized, but the necessary
    actions are highly

    localized. Many applications also involve a diversity of stakeholders. Agriculture,
    for example, in-

    volves a complex mix of large-scale farming interests, small-scale farmers, agricultural
    equipment

    manufacturers, and chemical companies. Each stakeholder has different interests,
    and each often

    has access to a different portion of the data that would be useful for impactful
    ML applications.

    Interfacing between these different stakeholders is a practical challenge for
    meaningful work in

    this area.

    CARBON DIOXIDE REMOVAL

    BY ANDREW S. ROSS & EVAN D. SHERWIN

    Even if we could cut emissions to zero today, we would still face significant
    climate consequences

    from GHGs already in the atmosphere. Eliminating emissions entirely may also be
    tricky, given

    the sheer diversity of sources (such as airplanes and cows). Instead, many experts
    argue that to

    meet critical climate goals, global emissions must become net-negative—that is,
    we must remove

    more CO2 from the atmosphere than we release [259, 269]. Although there has been
    significant

    progress in negative emissions research [260, 540, 575, 580, 707], the actual
    CO2 removal industry

    is still in its infancy. As such, many of the ML applications we outline in this
    section are either

    speculative or in the early stages of development or commercialization.

    Many of the primary candidate technologies for CO2 removal directly harness the
    same nat-

    ural processes which have (pre-)historically shaped our atmosphere. One of the
    most promising

    methods is simply allowing or encouraging more natural uptake of CO2 by plants
    (whose ML

    applications we discuss in Section 6). Other plant-based methods include bioenergy
    with carbon

    capture and biochar, where plants are grown specifically to absorb CO2 and then
    burned in a way

    that sequesters it (while creating energy or fertilizer as a useful byproduct)
    [155, 575, 690]. Finally,

    the way most of Earth’s CO2 has been removed over geologic timescales is the slow
    process of min-

    eral weathering, which also initiates further CO2 absorption in the ocean due
    to alkaline runoff

    [718]. These processes can both be massively accelerated by human activity to
    achieve necessary

    scales of CO2 removal [575]. However, although these biomass, mineral, and ocean-based
    methods

    are all promising enough as techniques to merit mention, they may have drawbacks
    in terms of

    land use and potentially serious environmental impacts, and (more relevantly for
    this article) they

    would not likely benefit significantly from ML.

    7.1

    Direct Air Capture

    Long-term

    Another approach is to build facilities to extract CO2 from power plant exhaust,
    industrial pro-

    cesses, or even ambient air [701]. While this direct air capture (DAC) approach
    faces technical

    hurdles, it requires little land and has, according to current understanding,
    minimal negative envi-

    ronmental impacts [152]. The basic idea behind DAC is to blow air onto CO2 sorbents
    (essentially

    like sponges, but for gas), which are either solid or in solution, then use heat-powered
    chemical

    processes to release the CO2 in purified form for sequestration [575, 707]. Several
    companies have

    recently been started to pilot these methods [112, 136, 293].

    While CO2 sorbents are improving significantly [117, 872], issues still remain
    with efficiency and

    degradation over time, offering potential (though still speculative) opportunities
    for ML. ML could

    be used (as in Section 2.1.1) to accelerate materials discovery and process engineering
    workflows

    [105, 299, 490, 653] to maximize sorbent reusability and CO2 uptake while minimizing
    the energy

    required for CO2 release. ML might also help to develop corrosion-resistant components
    capable of

    withstanding high temperatures, as well as optimize their geometry for air-sorbent
    contact (which

    strongly impacts efficiency [350]).

    7.2

    Sequestering CO2

    High Leverage Long-term Uncertain Impact

    Once CO2 is captured, it must be sequestered or stored, securely and at scale,
    to prevent re-release

    back into the atmosphere. The best-understood form of CO2 sequestration is direct
    injection into

    geologic formations such as saline aquifers, which are generally similar to oil
    and gas reservoirs

    [575]. A Norwegian oil company has successfully sequestered CO2 from an offshore
    natural gas

    field in a saline aquifer for more than twenty years [895]. Another promising
    option is to sequester

    CO2 in volcanic basalt formations, which is being piloted in Iceland [744].

    ML may be able to help with many aspects of CO2 sequestration. First, ML can help
    identify and

    characterize potential storage locations. Oil and gas companies have had promising
    results using

    ML for subsurface imaging based on raw seismograph traces [31]. These models and
    the data be-

    hind them could likely be repurposed to help trap CO2 rather than release it.
    Second, ML can help

    monitor and maintain active sequestration sites. Noisy sensor measurements must
    be translated

    into inferences about subsurface CO2 flow and remaining injection capacity [119];
    recently, [542]

    found success using convolutional image-to-image regression techniques for uncertainty
    quantifi-

    cation in a global CO2 storage simulation study. Deep learning can also help speed
    up simulation

    of carbon dioxide plume migration in sequestration reservoirs [836]. Additionally,
    it is important

    to monitor for CO2 leaks [557]. ML techniques have recently been applied to monitoring
    potential

    CO2 leaks from wells [125]; computer vision approaches for emissions detection
    (see [826] and

    Section 6.1) may also be applicable.

    7.3

    Discussion

    Given limits on how much more CO2 humanity can safely emit and the difficulties
    associated with

    eliminating emissions entirely, CO2 removal may have a critical role to play in
    tackling climate

    change. Promising applications for ML in CO2 removal include informing research
    and develop-

    ment of novel component materials, characterizing geologic resource availability,
    and monitoring

    underground CO2 in sequestration facilities. Although many of these applications
    are speculative,

    the industry is growing, which will create more data and more opportunities for
    ML approaches

    to help.

    CLIMATE PREDICTION

    BY KELLY KOCHANSKI

    The first global warming prediction was made in 1896, when Arrhenius estimated
    that burning fos-

    sil fuels could eventually release enough CO2 to warm the Earth by 5◦C. The fundamental
    physics

    underlying those calculations has not changed, but our predictions have become
    far more detailed

    and precise. The predominant predictive tools are climate models, known as General
    Circulation

    Models or Earth System Models.25 These models inform local and national government
    decisions

    (see IPCC reports [370–372]), help people calculate their climate risks (see Sections
    11 and 9) and

    allow us to estimate the potential impacts of solar geoengineering (see Section
    10).

    Recent trends have created opportunities for ML to advance the state-of-the-art
    in climate pre-

    diction (Figure 6). First, new and cheaper satellites are creating petabytes of
    climate observation

    simulated climate

    data.27 Third, climate forecasts are computationally expensive [115] (the simulations
    in [415] took

    three weeks to run on NCAR supercomputers), while ML methods are becoming increasingly
    fast

    to train and run, especially on next-generation computing hardware. As a result,
    climate scien-

    tists have recently begun to explore ML techniques, and are starting to team up
    with computer

    scientists to build new and exciting applications.

    8.1

    Uniting Data, ML, and Climate Science

    Climate models represent our understanding of Earth and climate physics. We can
    learn about

    the Earth by collecting data. To turn that data into useful predictions, we need
    to condense it

    into coherent, computationally tractable models. ML models are likely to be more
    accurate or less

    expensive than other models where: (1) there are plentiful data, but it is hard
    to model systems

    with traditional statistics, or (2) there are good models, but they are too computationally
    expensive

    to use in production.

    8.1.1

    Data for Climate Models. When data are plentiful, climate scientists build data-driven

    models. In these areas, ML techniques may solve many problems that were previously

    Ensemble [415].

    challenging. These include black box problems, for instance sensor calibration
    [468], and classifi-

    cation of observational data, for instance classifying land cover or identifying
    pollutant sources in

    satellite imagery [457, 469]. More applications like these are likely to appear
    as satellite databases

    grow. The authors of [548] describe many opportunities for data scientists to
    assimilate data from

    diverse field and remote sensing sources, many of which have since been explored
    by climate

    informatics researchers.

    Numerous authors, such as [287], have identified geoscience problems that would
    be aided by

    the development of benchmark datasets. Efforts to develop such datasets include
    EnviroNet [565],

    the IS-GEO benchmark datasets [211], and ExtremeWeather [652]. We expect the collection
    of

    curated geoscience datasets to continue to grow; this process might even be accelerated
    by ML

    optimizations in data collection systems [287]. We strongly encourage modellers
    to dive into the

    data in collaboration with domain experts. We also recommend that modellers who
    seek to learn

    directly from data see [354] for specific advice on fitting and over-fitting climate
    data.

    8.1.2

    Accelerating Climate Models. Many climate prediction problems are irremediably
    data-

    limited. No matter how many weather stations we construct, how many field campaigns
    we run,

    or how many satellites we deploy, the Earth will generate at most one year of
    new climate data per

    year. Existing climate models deal with this limitation by relying heavily on
    physical laws, such

    as thermodynamics [214, 300]. These models are structured in terms of coupled
    partial differential

    equations that represent physical processes like cloud formation, ice sheet flow,
    and permafrost

    melt. ML models provide new techniques (e.g., [658]) for solving such systems
    efficiently.

    Clouds and aerosols.

    High Leverage

    Recent work has shown how deep neural networks could be combined with existing
    thermody-

    namics knowledge to fix the largest source of uncertainty in current climate models:
    clouds. Bright

    clouds block sunlight and cool the Earth; dark clouds catch outgoing heat and
    keep the Earth warm

    [371, 729]. These effects are controlled by small-scale processes such as cloud
    convection and

    atmospheric aerosols (see uses of aerosols for cloud seeding and solar geoengineering
    in Section

    10). Physical models of these processes are far too computationally expensive
    to include in global

    climate models—but ML models are not. Gentine et al. trained a deep neural network
    to emulate

    the behavior of a high-resolution cloud simulation, and found that the network
    gave similar

    results for a fraction of the cost [275] and was stable in a simplified global
    model [670]. Existing

    scientific model structures do not always offer great trade-offs between cost
    and accuracy. Neural

    networks trained on those scientific models produce similar predictions, but offer
    an entirely

    new set of compromises between training cost, production cost, and accuracy. Replacing
    select

    climate model components with neural network approximators may thus improve both
    the cost

    and the accuracy of global climate models. Additional work is needed to identify
    more climate

    model components that could be replaced by neural networks (we highlight other
    impactful

    components below), to optimize those models, and to automate their training workflows
    (see

    examples in [676]).

    Ice sheets and sea level rise.

    High Leverage

    The next most important targets for climate model improvements are ice sheet dynamics
    and sea

    level rise. The Arctic and Antarctic are warming faster than anywhere else on
    Earth, and their

    climates control the future of global sea level rise and many vulnerable ecosystems
    [370, 372].

    Unfortunately, these regions are dark and cold, and until recently they were difficult
    to observe.

    In the past few years, however, new satellite campaigns have illuminated them
    with hundreds

    of terabytes of data.28 These data could make it possible to use ML to solve some
    of the field’s

    biggest outstanding questions. In particular, models of mass loss from the Antarctic
    ice-sheet are

    highly uncertain [449] and models of the extent of Antarctic sea ice do not match
    reality well [263].

    The most uncertain parts of these models, and thus the best targets for improvement,
    are snow

    reflectivity, sea ice reflectivity, ocean heat mixing, and ice sheet grounding
    line migration rates

    [328, 354, 449]. Computer scientists who wish to work in this area could build
    models that learn

    snow and sea ice properties from satellite data, or use new video prediction techniques
    to predict

    short-term changes in the sea ice extent.

    8.1.3

    Working with Climate Models. ML could also be used to identify and leverage relation-

    ships between climate variables. Pattern recognition and feature extraction techniques
    could al-

    low us to identify more useful connections in the climate system, and regression
    models could

    allow us to quantify non-linear relationships between connected variables. For
    example, Nowack

    et al. demonstrated that ozone concentrations could be computed as a function
    of temperature,

    rather than physical transport laws, which led to considerable computational savings
    [587].

    The best climate predictions are synthesized from ensembles of 20+ climate models
    [782]. Mak-

    ing good ensemble predictions is an excellent ML problem. Monteleoni et al. proposed
    that online

    ML algorithms could create better predictions of one or more target variables
    in a multi-model

    ensemble of climate models [549]; this idea has been refined in [530, 763]. More
    recently, Ander-

    son and Lucas used random forests to make high-resolution predictions from a mix
    of high- and

    low-resolution models, which could reduce the costs of building multi-model ensembles
    [23].

    In the further future, the Climate Modeling Alliance has proposed to build an
    entirely new

    climate model that learns continuously from data and from high-resolution simulations
    [717]. The

    proposed model would be written in Julia, in contrast to existing models which
    are mostly written

    in C++ and Fortran. At the cost of a daunting translation workload, they aim to
    build a model that

    is more accessible to new developers and more compatible with ML libraries.

    8.2

    Forecasting Extreme Events

    For most people, extreme event prediction means the local weather forecast and
    a few days’

    warning to stockpile food, go home, and lock the shutters. Weather forecasts are
    shorter-term

    than climate forecasts, but they produce abundant data. Weather models are optimized
    to track the

    rapid, chaotic changes of the atmosphere; since these changes are fast, tomorrow’s
    weather fore-

    cast is made and tested every day. Climate models, in contrast, are chaotic on
    short time scales, but

    their long-term trends are driven by slow, predictable changes of ocean, land,
    and ice (see [734]).29

    As a result, climate model output can only be tested against long-term observations
    (at the scale

    of years to decades). Intermediate time scales, of weeks to months, are exceptionally
    difficult to

    predict, although Cohen et al. [139] argue that ML could bridge that gap by making
    good predic-

    tions on four to six week timescales [363]. Thus far, however, weather modelers
    have had hundreds

    of times more test data than climate modelers, and began to adopt ML techniques
    earlier. Numer-

    ous ML weather models are already running in production. For example, Gagne et
    al. recently used

    an ensemble of random forests to improve hail predictions within a major weather
    model [262].

    A full review of the applications of ML for extreme weather forecasting is beyond
    the scope of

    this article. Fortunately, that review has already been written, see [529]. The
    authors describe ML

    28See, e.g., icebridge.gsfc.nasa.gov and pgc.umn.edu/data/arcticdem.

    29This is one of several reasons why climate models produce accurate long-term
    predictions in spite of atmospheric chaos.

    systems that correct bias, recognize patterns, and predict storms. Moving forward,
    they envision

    human experts working alongside automated forecasts.

    8.2.1

    Storm Tracking. Climate models cannot predict the specific dates of future events,
    but

    they can predict changes in long-term trends like drought frequency and storm
    intensity. Infor-

    mation about these trends helps individuals, corporations, and towns make informed
    decisions

    about infrastructure, asset valuation and disaster response plans (see also Section
    9.4). Identify-

    ing extreme events in climate model output, however, is a classification problem
    with a twist: all

    of the available datasets are strongly skewed because extreme events are, by definition,
    rare. ML

    has been used successfully to classify some extreme weather events. Researchers
    have used deep

    learning to classify [488], detect [652], and segment [456] cyclones and atmospheric
    rivers, as well

    as tornadoes [463], in historical climate datasets. Tools for more event types
    would be useful, as

    would online tools that work within climate models, labelled datasets for predicting
    future events,

    and statistical tools that quantify the uncertainty in new extreme event forecasts.

    8.2.2

    Local Forecasts.

    High Leverage

    Forecasts are most actionable if they are specific and local. ML is widely used
    to make local fore-

    casts from coarse 10–100 km climate or weather model predictions; various authors
    have attempted

    this using support vector machines, autoencoders, Bayesian deep learning, and
    super-resolution

    convolutional neural networks (e.g., [481]). Several groups are now working to
    translate high-

    resolution climate forecasts into risk scenarios. For example, ML can predict
    localized flooding

    patterns from past data [625], which could inform individuals buying insurance
    or homes. Since

    ML methods like neural networks are effective at predicting local flooding during
    extreme weather

    events [740], these could be used to update local flood risk estimates to benefit
    individuals. The

    start-up Jupiter Intelligence is working to make climate predictions more actionable
    by translating

    climate forecasts into localised flood and temperature risk scores.

    8.3

    Discussion

    ML may change the way that scientific modeling is done. The examples above have
    shown that

    many components of large climate models can be replaced with ML models at lower
    computational

    costs. From an ML standpoint, learning from an existing model has many advantages:
    modelers

    can generate new training and test data on-demand, and the new ML model inherits
    some com-

    munity trust from the old one. This is an area of active ML research. Several
    papers have explored

    data-efficient techniques for learning dynamical systems [658], including physics-informed
    neural

    networks [659] and neural ordinary differential equations [132]; applications
    of physics-informed

    ML in climate science are now maturing rapidly [373, 412]. In the further future,
    researchers are

    developing ML approaches for a wide range of scientific modeling challenges, including
    crash

    prediction [497], adaptive numerical meshing [389], uncertainty quantification
    [464, 486], and per-

    formance optimization [786]. If these strategies are effective, they may solve
    some of the largest

    structural challenges facing current climate models.

    New ML models for climate will be most successful if they are closely integrated
    into existing sci-

    entific models. This has been emphasized, again and again, by authors who have
    laid future paths

    for artificial intelligence within climate science [287, 470, 529, 670, 676, 717].
    New models need to

    leverage existing knowledge to make good predictions with limited data. In 10
    years, we will have

    more satellite data, more interpretable ML techniques [791], hopefully more trust
    from the scien-

    tific community, and possibly a new climate model written in Julia. For now, however,
    ML models

    must be creatively designed to work within existing climate models. The best of
    these models are

    likely to be built by close-knit teams including both climate and computational
    scientists.

    SOCIETAL IMPACTS

    BY KRIS SANKARAN

    Changes in the atmosphere have impacts on the ground. The expected societal impacts
    of climate

    change include prolonged ecological and socioeconomic stresses as well as brief,
    but severe, so-

    cietal disruptions. For example, impacts could include both gradual decreases
    in crop yield and

    localized food shortages. If we can anticipate climate impacts well enough, then
    we can prepare

    for them by asking:

    • How do we reduce vulnerability to climate impacts?

    • How do we support rapid recovery from climate-induced disruptions?

    A wide variety of strategies have been put forward, from robust power grids to
    food shortage

    prediction (Figure 7), and while this is good news for society, it can be overwhelming
    for an ML

    practitioner hoping to contribute. Fortunately, a few critical needs tend to recur
    across strategies—

    it is by meeting these needs that ML has the greatest potential to support societal
    adaptation

    [251, 296, 648]. From a high level, these involve

    • Sounding alarms: Identifying and prioritizing the areas of highest risk, by
    using evidence of

    risk from historical data.

    • Providing annotation: Extracting actionable information or labels from unstructured
    raw

    data.

    • Promoting exchange: Making it easier to share resources and information to pool
    and reduce

    risk.

    These unifying threads will appear repeatedly in the sections below, where we
    review strategies

    to help ecosystems, infrastructure, and societies adapt to climate change, and
    explain how ML

    supports each strategy (Figure 7).

    We note that the projects involved vary in scale from local to global, from infrastructure
    up-

    grades and crisis preparedness planning to international ecosystem monitoring
    and disease surveil-

    lance. Hence, we anticipate valuable contributions by researchers who have the
    flexibility to formu-

    late experimental approaches, by industrial engineers and entrepreneurs who have
    the expertise

    to translate prototypes into wide-reaching systems, and by civil servants who
    lead many existing

    Changes in climate are increasingly affecting the distribution and composition
    of ecosystems. This

    has profound implications for global biodiversity, as well as agriculture, disease,

    To preserve ecosystems, it is important to know which are most at risk. This has
    traditionally been

    done via manual, on-the-ground observation, but the process can be accelerated
    by annotation

    of remote sensing data [91, 92, 513, 637] (see also Section 6.1). For example,
    tree cover can be

    automatically extracted from aerial imagery to characterize deforestation [362,
    528]. At the scale

    of regions or biomes, analysis of large-scale simulations can illuminate the evolution
    of ecosystems

    across potential climate futures [238, 438]. A more direct source of data is offered
    by environmental

    sensor networks, made from densely packed but low-cost devices [184, 331, 361].
    To monitor ocean

    ecosystems, marine robots are useful, because they can be used to survey large
    areas on demand

    [208, 306].

    For a system to have the most real-world impact, regardless of the underlying
    data source, it is

    necessary to “personalize” predictions across a range of ecosystems. A model trained
    on the Sahara

    would almost certainly fail if deployed in the Amazon. Hence, these applications
    may motivate ML

    researchers interested in heterogeneity, data collection, transfer learning, and
    rapid generalization.

    In sensor networks, individual nodes fail frequently, but are redundant by design—this
    is an op-

    portunity for research into anomaly detection and missing data imputation [178,
    345]. In marine

    robotics, improved techniques for sampling regions to explore and automatic summarization
    of

    expedition results would both provide value [160, 246]. Finally, beyond aiding
    adaptation by prior-

    itizing at-risk environments, the design of effective methods for ecosystem monitoring
    will support

    the basic science necessary to shape adaptation in the long-run [231, 297, 521].

    Monitoring biodiversity.

    High Leverage

    Accurate estimates of species populations are the foundation on which conservation
    efforts are

    built. Camera traps and aerial imagery have increased the richness and coverage
    of sampling

    efforts. ML can help infer biodiversity counts from image-based sensors. For instance,
    camera

    traps take photos automatically whenever a motion sensor is activated—computer
    vision can be

    used to classify the species that pass by, supporting a real-time, less labor-intensive
    species count

    [64, 585, 643]. It is also possible to use aerial imagery to estimate the size
    of large herds [805] or

    count birds [282]. In underwater ecosystems, ML has been used to identify plankton
    automatically

    from underwater cameras [232] and to infer fish populations from the structure
    of coral reefs [867].

    Citizen science can also enable dataset collection at a scale impossible in individual
    studies

    [93, 533, 634, 767]. For example, by leveraging public enthusiasm for birdwatching,
    eBird has

    logged more than 140 million observations [767], which have been used for population
    and migra-

    tion studies [424]. Computer vision algorithms that can classify species from
    photographs have

    furthered such citizen science efforts by making identifications easier and more
    accurate [660, 806],

    42:42

    D. Rolnick et al.

    though these face challenges such as class imbalances in training data [807].
    Work with citizen sci-

    ence data poses the additional challenge that researchers have no control over
    where samples come

    from. To incentivize observations from undersampled regions, mechanisms from game
    theory can

    be applied [860], and even when sampling biases persist, estimates of dataset
    shift can minimize

    their influence [128].

    Monitoring biodiversity may be paired with interventions to protect rare species
    or control

    invasive pests. ML is providing new solutions to assess the impact of ecological
    interventions

    [13, 502, 664] and prevent poaching [860].

    9.2

    Infrastructure

    Physical infrastructure is so tightly woven into the fabric of everyday life—like
    the buildings we

    inhabit and lights we switch on—that it is easy to forget that it exists (see
    Section 4). The fact that

    something so basic will have to be rethought in order to adapt to climate change
    can be unsettling,

    but viewed differently, the sheer necessity of radical redesign can inspire creative
    thinking.

    We first consider the impacts of climate change on the built environment. Shifts
    in weather

    patterns are likely to put infrastructure under more persistent stress. Heat and
    wind damage roads,

    buildings, and power lines. Rising water tables near the coast will lead to faults
    in pipelines. Urban

    heat islands will be exacerbated and it is likely that there will be an increased
    risk of flooding caused

    by heavy rain or coastal inundations, resulting in property damage and traffic
    blockages [604].

    A clear target is construction of physical defenses, for example, “climate proofing”
    cities with

    new coastal embankments and increased storm drainage capacity. However, focusing
    solely on

    defending existing structures can stifle proactive thinking about urban and social
    development—

    for example, floating buildings are being tested in Rotterdam—and one may alternatively
    consider

    resilience and recovery more broadly [621, 731]. From this more general perspective
    of improving

    social processes, ML can support two types of activities: design and maintenance.

    Designing infrastructure.

    Long-term

    How can infrastructure be (re)designed to dampen climate impacts? In road networks,
    it is pos-

    sible to incorporate flood hazard and traffic information in order to uncover
    vulnerable stretches

    of road, especially those with few alternative routes [314]. If traffic data are
    not directly available,

    it is possible to construct proxies from mobile phone usage and city-wide CCTV
    streams—these

    are promising in rapidly developing urban centers [252, 381]. Overall flood hazard
    maps can be

    improved using ML [455], and it is also possible to leverage data from real-world
    flooding events

    [616], and to send localized predictions to those at risk [841]. For electrical,
    water, and waste col-

    lection networks, the same principle can guide investments in resilience—using
    proxy or historical

    data about disruptions to anticipate vulnerabilities [564, 574, 600, 609]. Robust
    components can re-

    place those at risk; for example, adaptive islands, parts of an energy grid that
    continue to provide

    power even when disconnected from the network, prevent cascading outages in power
    distribution

    [235].

    Infrastructure is long-lived, but the future is uncertain, and planners must weigh
    immediate

    resource costs against future societal risks [248]. One area that urgently needs
    adaptation strategies

    is the consistent access to drinking water, which can be jeopardized by climate
    variability [174, 366].

    Investments in water infrastructure can be optimized; for example, a larger dam
    might cost more

    up front, but would have a larger storage capacity, giving a stronger buffer against
    drought. To

    delay immediate decisions, infrastructure can be upgraded in phases—the technical
    challenge is

    to discover policies that minimize a combination of long-term resource and societal
    costs under

    plausible climate futures, with forecasts being updated as climates evolve [289,
    651, 727].

    Maintaining infrastructure.

    High Leverage

    What types of systems can keep infrastructure functioning well under increased
    stress? Two

    strategies for efficiently managing limited maintenance resources are predictive
    maintenance and

    anomaly detection; both can be applied to electrical, water, and transportation
    infrastructure (see

    also Sections 2.2 and 5.3). In predictive maintenance, operations are prioritized
    according to the

    predicted probability of a near-term breakdown [201, 581, 702, 751]. For anomaly
    detection, fail-

    ures are discovered as soon as they occur, without having to wait for inspectors
    to show up, or

    complaints to stream in [51, 186].

    The systems referenced here have required the manual curation of data streams,
    structured and

    unstructured. The data are plentiful, just difficult to glue together. Ideas from
    the missing data,

    multimodal data, and AutoML communities have the potential to resolve some of
    these issues.

    9.3

    Social Systems

    While less tangible, the social systems we construct are just as critical to the
    smooth functioning

    of society as any physical infrastructure, and it is important that they adapt
    to changing climate

    conditions. First, consider what changes these systems may encounter. Decreases
    in crop yield,

    due to drought and other factors, will pose a threat to food security, as already
    evidenced by long

    periods of drought in North America, West Africa, and East Asia [157, 636]. More
    generally, com-

    munities dependent on ecosystem resources will find their livelihoods at risk,
    and this may result

    in mass migrations, as people seek out more supportive environments.

    At first, these problems may seem beyond the reach of algorithmic thinking, but
    investments

    in social infrastructure can increase resilience. ML can amplify the reach and
    effectiveness of this

    infrastructure. See also Section 12 for perspective on how ML can support the
    function and analysis

    of complex social environments.

    Food security.

    High Leverage

    Data can be used to monitor the risk of food insecurity in real time, to forecast
    near-term shortages,

    and to identify areas at risk in the long-term, all of which can guide interventions.
    For real-time

    and near-term systems, it is possible to distill relevant signals from mobile
    phones, credit card

    transactions, and social media data [171, 434, 645]. These have emerged as low-cost,
    high-reach

    alternatives to manual surveying. The idea is to train models that link these
    large, but decontextual-

    ized, data with ground truth consumption or survey information, collected on small
    representative

    samples. This process of developing proxies to link small, rich datasets with
    large, coarse ones can

    be viewed as a type of semi-supervised learning, and is fertile ground for research.

    For longer-term warnings, spatially localized crop yield predictions are needed.
    These can be

    generated by aerial imagery or meteorological data (see Section 6.2), if they
    can be linked with

    historical yield data [123, 824]. Automatic crop type mapping can also be a valuable
    tool for yield

    prediction [426, 427]. On the ground, it is possible to perform crop-disease identification
    from plant

    photos—this can alert communities to disease outbreaks, and enhance the capacity
    of agricultural

    inspectors. For even longer-run risk evaluation, it is possible to simulate crop
    yield via biological

    and ecological models [446, 698, 783], presenting another opportunity for blending
    large scale

    simulation with ML [605, 835].

    Beyond sounding alarms, ML can improve resilience of food supply chains. As detailed
    in Sec-

    tion 5, ML can reduce waste along these chains; we emphasize that for adaptation,
    it is important

    that supply chains also be made robust to unexpected disruptions [203, 568, 639,
    665].

    Resilient livelihoods.

    Individuals whose livelihoods depend on one activity, and who have less access
    to community

    resources, are those who are most at risk [7, 692]. Resilient livelihoods can
    be promoted through

    increased diversification, cooperation, and exchange, all of which can be facilitated
    by ML sys-

    tems. For example, they can guide equipment and information sharing in farming
    cooperatives,

    via growers’ social networks [37]. Mobile money efforts can increase access to
    liquid purchasing

    power; they can also be used to monitor economic health [253, 644]. Skill-matching
    programs

    and online training are often driven by data, with some programs specifically
    aiming to benefit

    refugees [54, 516, 646] (see also Section 13).

    Supporting displaced people.

    Long-term Uncertain Impact

    Human populations move in response to threats and opportunities, and ML can be
    used to pre-

    dict large-scale migration patterns. Work in this area has relied on accessible
    proxies, like social

    media, where users’ often self-report location information, or aerial imagery,
    from which the ex-

    tent of informal settlement can be gauged [82, 376, 650, 869]. More than quantifying
    migration

    patterns, there have been efforts directly aimed at protecting refugees, either
    through improving

    rescue operations [492, 628] or monitoring negative public sentiment [647]. It
    is worth cautioning

    that immigrants and refugees are vulnerable groups, and systems that surveil them
    can easily be

    exploited by bad actors. Designing methodology and governance mechanisms that
    allow vulner-

    able populations to benefit from such data, without putting them at additional
    risk, should be a

    research priority.

    Assessing health risks.

    Climate change will affect exposure to health hazards, and ML can play a role
    in measuring

    and mitigating their impacts across subpopulations. Two of the most relevant expected
    shifts are

    (1) heat waves will become more frequent and (2) outdoor and indoor air quality
    will deteriorate

    [324, 710]. These exposures have either direct or indirect effects on health.
    For example, prolonged

    heat episodes both directly cause heat stroke and can trigger acute episodes in
    chronic conditions,

    like heart or respiratory disease [194, 719].

    Careful data collection and analysis have played a leading role in epidemiology
    and public health

    efforts for generations. It should be no surprise that ML has emerged as an important
    tool in

    these disciplines, supporting a variety of research efforts, from increasing the
    efficiency of disease

    simulators to supporting the fine-grained measurement of exposures and their health
    impacts [433,

    705].

    These disciplines are increasingly focused on the risks posed by climate change
    specifically. For

    example, new sources of data have enabled detailed sensing of urban heat islands
    [137, 348, 815],

    water quality [321, 440], and air pollution [130, 180]. Further, data on health
    indicators, which

    are already collected, can quantitatively characterize observed impacts across
    regions as well as

    illuminate which populations are most at risk to climate-change induced health
    hazards [831]. For

    example, it is known that the young, elderly, and socially isolated are especially
    vulnerable during

    heat waves, and finer-grained risk estimates could potentially drive outreach
    [622, 697].

    Across social applications, there are worthwhile research challenges—guiding interventions

    based on purely observational, potentially unrepresentative data poses risks.
    In these contexts,

    transparency is necessary, and ideally, causal effects of interventions could
    be estimated, to prevent

    feedback loops in which certain subgroups are systematically ignored from policy
    interventions.

    9.4

    Crisis

    Perhaps counterintuitively, natural disasters and health crises are not entirely
    unpredictable—they

    can be prepared for, risks can be reduced, and coordination can be streamlined.
    Furthermore, while

    crises may be some of the most distressing consequences of climate change, disaster
    response and

    Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning

    public health are mature disciplines in their own right, and have already benefited
    extensively

    from ML methodology [118, 531, 862].

    Managing epidemics.

    Climate change will increase the range of vector and water-borne diseases, elevating
    the likelihood

    that these new environments experience epidemics [324]. Disease surveillance and
    outbreak fore-

    casting systems can be built from web data and specially-designed apps, in addition
    to traditional

    surveys [394, 467, 627]. While non-survey proxies are observational and self-reported,
    current re-

    search attempts to address these issues [472, 588]. Beyond surveillance, point-of-care
    diagnostics

    have enjoyed a renaissance, thanks in part to ML [598, 648]. These are tools that
    allow health

    workers to make diagnoses when specialized lab equipment is inaccessible. An example
    is malaria

    diagnosis based on photos of prepared pathology slides taken with a mobile phone
    [649]. Ensuring

    that these systems reliably and transparently augment extension workers, guiding
    data collection

    and route planning when appropriate, are active areas of study [97, 688].

    Disaster response.

    High Leverage

    In disaster preparation and response, two types of ML tasks have proven useful:
    creating maps

    from aerial imagery and performing information retrieval on social media data.
    Accurate and well-

    annotated maps can inform evacuation planning, retrofitting campaigns, and delivery
    of relief

    [59, 200]. Further, this imagery can assist damage assessment, by comparing scenes
    immediately

    pre- and post-disaster [315, 816]. Social media data can contain kernels of insight—places
    without

    water, clinics without supplies—which can inform relief efforts. ML can help properly
    surface these

    insights, compressing large volumes of social media data into the key takeaways,
    which can be

    acted upon by disaster managers [118, 368, 596].

    9.5

    Discussion

    Climate change will have profound effects on the planet, and the ML community
    can support

    efforts to minimize the damage it does to ecosystems and the harm it inflicts
    on people. This

    section has suggested areas of research that may help societies adapt more effectively
    to these

    ever changing realities. We have identified a few recurring themes, but also emphasized
    the role

    of understanding domain-specific needs. The use of ML to support societal resilience
    would be

    a noble goal at any time, but the need for tangible progress towards it may never
    have been so

    urgent as it is today, in the face of the wide-reaching consequences of climate
    change.

    SOLAR GEOENGINEERING

    BY ANDREW S. ROSS

    Airships floating through the sky, spraying aerosols; robotic boats crisscrossing
    the ocean,

    firing vertical jets of spray; arrays of mirrors carefully positioned in space,
    micro-adjusted by

    remote control; these images seem like science fiction, but they are actually
    real proposals for

    solar radiation management, commonly called solar geoengineering [375, 418, 419,
    728]. Solar

    geoengineering, much like the GHGs causing climate change, shifts the balance
    between how

    much heat the Earth absorbs and how much it releases. The difference is that it
    is done deliberately,

    and in the opposite direction. The most common umbrella strategy is to make the
    Earth more

    reflective, keeping heat out, though there are also methods of helping heat escape
    (besides

    CO2 removal, which we discuss in Sections 6 and 7).

    Solar geoengineering generally comes with a host of potential side effects and
    governance chal-

    lenges. Moreover, unlike CO2 removal, it cannot simply reverse the effects of
    climate change

    (average temperatures may return to pre-industrial levels, but location-specific
    climates still

    change), and also comes with the risk of termination shock (fast, catastrophic
    warming if humanity

    undertakes solar geoengineering but stops suddenly) [615]. Because of these and
    other issues, it

    is not within the scope of this article to evaluate or recommend any particular
    technique. How-

    ever, the potential for solar geoengineering to moderate some of the most catastrophic
    hazards of

    climate change is well-established [374], and it has received increasing attention
    in the wake of so-

    cietal inaction on mitigation. Although [418] argue that the “hardest and most
    important problems

    raised by solar geoengineering are non-technical,” there are still a number of
    important technical

    questions that ML may be able to help us study.

    Overview.

    The primary candidate methods for geoengineering are marine cloud brightening
    [396] (making

    low-lying clouds more reflective), cirrus thinning [759] (making high-flying clouds
    trap less heat),

    and stratospheric aerosol injection [668] (which we discuss below). Other candidates
    (which are

    either less effective or harder to implement) include “white-roof” methods [10]
    and even launching

    sunshades into space [29].

    Injecting sulfate aerosols into the stratosphere is considered a leading candidate
    for solar geo-

    engineering both because of its economic and technological feasibility [527, 743]
    and because of a

    reason that should resonate with the ML community: we have data. (These data are
    largely in the

    form of temperature observations after volcanic eruptions, which release sulfates
    into the strato-

    sphere when sufficiently large [691].) Once injected, sulfates circulate globally
    and remain aloft for

    1 to 2 years. As a result, the process is reversible, but must also be continually
    maintained. Sulfates

    come with a well-studied risk of ozone loss [210], and they make sunlight slightly
    more diffuse,

    which can impact agriculture [642].

    10.1

    Understanding and Improving Aerosols

    Design.

    Long-term

    The effects and side-effects of aerosols in the stratosphere (or at slightly lower
    altitudes for cirrus

    thinning [308]) vary significantly with their optical and chemical properties.
    Although sulfates

    are the best understood due to volcanic eruption data, many others have been studied,
    including

    zirconium dioxide, titanium dioxide, calcite (which preserves ozone), and even
    synthetic diamond

    [209]. However, the design space is far from fully explored. ML has had recent
    success in predicting

    specific chemical, material, and optical properties without the need for expensive
    experimentation

    or brute-force simulation [105, 299, 490, 653], including in aerosols [465, 500].
    Although speculative,

    it is conceivable that ML could accelerate the search for aerosols that are chemically
    nonreactive

    but still reflective, cheap, and easy to keep aloft.

    Modeling.

    One reason that sulfates have been the focus for aerosol research is that atmospheric
    aerosol

    physics is not perfectly captured by current climate models, so having natural
    data is important

    for validation. Furthermore, even if current aerosol models are correct, their
    best-fit parameters

    must still be determined (using historical data), which comes with uncertainty
    and computational

    difficulty. ML may offer tools here, both to help quantify and constrain uncertainty,
    and to man-

    age computational load. As a recent example, [247] use Gaussian processes to emulate
    climate

    model outputs based on nine possible aerosol parameter settings, allowing them
    to establish plau-

    sible parameter ranges (and thus much better calibrated error-bars) with only
    350 climate model

    runs instead of >100,000. Although this is important progress, ideally we want
    uncertainty-aware

    aerosol simulations with a fraction of the cost of one climate model run, rather
    than 350. ML may

    be able to help here too (see Section 8 for more details).

    10.2

    Engineering a Control System

    High Leverage Long-term Uncertain Impact

    Efficient emulations and error-bars will be essential for what MacMartin and Kravitz
    [508] call

    “The Engineering of Climate Engineering.” According to [508], any practical deployment
    of geo-

    engineering would constitute “one of the most critical engineering design and
    control challenges

    ever considered: making real-time decisions for a highly uncertain and nonlinear
    dynamic system

    with many input variables, many measurements, and a vast number of internal degrees
    of freedom,

    the dynamics of which span a wide range of timescales.” Bayesian and neural network-based
    ap-

    proaches could facilitate the fast, uncertainty-aware nonlinear system identification
    this challenge

    might require. Additionally, there has been recent progress in RL for control
    [21, 84, 545], which

    could be useful for fine-tuning geoengineering interventions such as deciding
    where and when to

    release aerosols. For an initial attempt at analyzing stratospheric aerosol injection
    as a RL problem

    (using a neural network climate model emulator), see [170].

    10.3

    Modeling Impacts

    Long-term

    Of course, optimizing interventions requires defining objectives, and the choices
    here are far from

    clear. Although it is possible to stabilize global mean temperature and even regional
    temperatures

    through geoengineering, it is most likely impossible to preserve all relevant
    climate characteristics

    in all locations. Furthermore, climate model outputs do not tell the full story;
    ultimately, the goal of

    climate engineering is to minimize harm to people, ecosystems, and society. It
    is therefore essential

    to develop robust tools for estimating the extent and distribution of these potential
    harms. There

    has been some recent work in applying ML to assess the impacts of geoengineering.
    For example,

    [179] use deep neural networks to estimate the effects of aerosols on human health,
    while [148]

    use them to estimate the effects of solar geoengineering on agriculture. References
    [101, 187] use

    relatively simple local and polynomial regression techniques but applied to extensive
    empirical

    data to estimate the past and future effects of temperature change on economic
    production. More

    generally, the field of Integrated Assessment Modeling [422, 840] aims to map
    the outputs of a

    climate model to societal impacts; for a general discussion of potential opportunities
    for applying

    ML to integrated assessment models (IAMs), see Section 12.2.

    Discussion

    Any consideration of solar geoengineering raises many moral questions. It may
    help certain re-

    gions at the expense of others, introduce risks like termination shock, and serve
    as a “moral haz-

    ard”: widespread awareness of its very possibility may undermine mainstream efforts
    to cut emis-

    sions [485]. Because of these issues, there has been significant debate about
    whether it is ethically

    responsible to research this topic [420, 640]. However, although it creates new
    risks, solar geoengi-

    neering could actually be a moderating force against the terrifying uncertainties
    climate change

    already introduces [374, 509], and ultimately many environmental groups and governmental
    bod-

    ies have come down on the side of supporting further research [145, 258, 592].
    In this section, we

    have attempted to outline some of the technical challenges in implementing and
    evaluating solar

    geoengineering. We hope the ML community can help geoengineering researchers tackle
    these

    challenges.

    INDIVIDUAL ACTION

    BY NATASHA JAQUES

    Individuals may worry that they are powerless to affect climate change, or lack
    clarity on which

    of their behaviors are most important to change. In fact, there are actions which
    can meaningfully

    reduce each person’s carbon footprint, and, if widely adopted, could have a significant
    impact on

    mitigating global emissions [335, 845]. AI can help to identify those behaviors,
    inform individuals,

    and provide constructive opportunities by modeling individual behavior.

    11.1

    Understanding Personal Carbon Footprint

    We as individuals are constantly confronted with decisions that affect our carbon
    footprint, but we

    may lack the data and knowledge to know which decisions are most impactful. Fortunately,
    ML

    can help determine an individual’s carbon footprint from their personal and household
    data [790].

    For example, natural language processing can be used to extract the flights a
    person takes from

    their email, or determine specific grocery items purchased from a bill, making
    it possible to pre-

    dict the associated emissions. Systems that combine this information with data
    obtained from the

    user’s smartphone (e.g., from a ride-sharing app) can then help consumers who
    wish to identify

    which behaviors result in the highest emissions. Given such a ML model, counterfactual
    reasoning

    can potentially be used to demonstrate to consumers how much their emissions would
    be reduced

    for each behavior they changed. As a privacy-conscious alternative, emissions
    estimates could be

    directly incorporated into grocery labels [562] or interfaces for purchasing flights.
    Such informa-

    tion can empower people to understand how they can best help mitigate climate
    change through

    behavior change.

    Residences are responsible for a large share of GHG emissions [372] (see also
    Section 4). A

    large meta-analysis found that significant residential energy savings can be achieved
    [215], by

    targeting the right interventions to the right households [14, 16, 17]. ML can
    predict a household’s

    emissions in transportation, energy, water, waste, foods, goods, and services,
    as a function of its

    characteristics [399]. These predictions can be used to tailor customized interventions
    for high-

    emissions households [398]. Changing behavior both helps mitigate climate change
    and benefits

    individuals; studies have shown that many carbon mitigation strategies also provide
    cost savings

    to consumers [399].

    Household energy disaggregation breaks down overall electricity consumption into
    energy use

    by individual appliances (see also Section 4.1) [33], which can help facilitate
    behavior change [772].

    For example, it can be used to inform consumers of high-energy appliances of which
    they were

    previously unaware. This alone could have a significant impact, since many devices
    consume a

    large amount of electricity even when not in use; standby power consumption accounts
    for roughly

    8% of residential electricity demand [507]. A variety of ML techniques have been
    used to effectively

    disaggregate household energy, such as spectral clustering, Hidden Markov Models,
    and neural

    networks [33].

    ML can also be used to predict the marginal emissions of energy consumption in
    real time, on

    a scale of hours [832], potentially allowing consumers to effectively schedule
    activities such as

    charging an EV when the emissions (and prices [439]) will be lowest [143]. Combining
    these pre-

    dictions with disaggregated energy data allows for the efficient automation of
    household energy

    consumption, ideally through products that present interpretable insights to the
    consumer

    (e.g., [721, 760]). Methods like RL can be used to learn how to optimally schedule
    household ap-

    pliances to consume energy more efficiently and sustainably [543, 679]. Multi-agent
    learning has

    also been applied to this problem, to ensure that groups of homes can coordinate
    to balance energy

    consumption to keep peak demand low [662, 863].

    11.2

    Facilitating Behavior Change

    High Leverage

    ML is highly effective at modeling human preferences, and this can be leveraged
    to help mitigate

    climate change. Using ML, we can model and cluster individuals based on their
    climate knowledge,

    preferences, demographics, and consumption characteristics (e.g., [66, 116, 166,
    261, 861]), and thus

    predict who will be most amenable to new technologies and sustainable behavior
    change. Such

    Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning

    42:49

    techniques have improved the enrollment rate of customers in an energy savings
    program by

    2–3x [14]. Other works have used ML to predict how much consumers are willing
    to pay to avoid

    potential environmental harms of energy consumption [167], finding that some groups
    were totally

    insensitive to cost and would pay the maximum amount to mitigate harm, while other
    groups were

    willing to pay nothing. Given such disparate types of consumers, targeting interventions
    toward

    particular households may be especially worthwhile; all the more so because data
    show that the

    size and composition of household carbon footprints varies dramatically across
    geographic regions

    and demographics [399].

    Citizens who would like to engage with policy decisions, or explore different
    options to reduce

    their personal carbon footprint, can have difficulty understanding existing laws
    and policies due to

    their complexity. They may benefit from tools that make policy information more
    manageable and

    relevant to the individual (e.g., based on where the individual lives). There
    is the potential for natu-

    ral language processing to derive understandable insights from policy texts for
    these applications,

    similar to automated compliance checking [67, 876].

    Understanding individual behavior can help signal how it can be nudged. For example,
    path

    analysis has shown that an individual’s psychological distance to climate change
    (on geographic,

    temporal, social, and uncertainty dimensions) fully mediates their level of climate
    change con-

    cern [397]. This suggests that interventions minimizing psychological distance
    to the effects of

    climate change may be most effective. Similarly, ML has revealed that cross-cultural
    support for

    international climate programs is not reduced, even when individuals are exposed
    to information

    about other countries’ climate behavior [65]. To make the effects of climate change
    more real for

    consumers, and thus help motivate those who wish to act, image generation techniques
    such as

    CycleGANs have been used to visualize the potential consequences of extreme weather
    events on

    houses and cities [716]. Gamification via deep learning has been proposed to further
    allow indi-

    viduals to explore their personal energy usage [447]. All of these programs may
    be an incredibly

    cost-effective way to reduce energy consumption; behavior change programs can
    cost as little as

    3 cents to save a kilowatt hour of electricity, whereas generating one kWh would
    cost 5–6 cents

    with a coal or wind power plant, and 10 cents with solar [207, 313].

    11.3

    Discussion

    While individuals can sometimes feel that their contributions to climate change
    are dwarfed by

    other factors, in reality individual actions can have a significant impact in
    mitigating climate

    change. ML can aid this process by empowering consumers to understand which of
    their behav-

    iors lead to the highest emissions, automatically scheduling energy consumption,
    and providing

    insights into how to facilitate behavior change.

    COLLECTIVE DECISIONS

    BY TEGAN MAHARAJ

    & NIKOLA MILOJEVIC-DUPONT

    Addressing climate change requires swift and effective decision-making by groups
    at multiple

    levels—communities, unions, NGOs, businesses, governments, intergovernmental organizations,

    and many more. Such collective decision-making encompasses many kinds of action—for
    example,

    negotiating international treaties to reduce GHG emissions, designing carbon markets,
    building

    resilient infrastructure, and establishing community-owned solar farms. These
    decisions often in-

    volve multiple stakeholders with different goals and priorities, requiring difficult
    trade-offs. The

    economic and societal systems involved are often extremely complex, and the impacts
    of climate-

    related decisions can play out globally across long time horizons. To address
    some of these chal-

    lenges, researchers are using empirical and mathematical methods from fields such
    as policy anal-

    ysis, operations research, economics, game theory, and computational social science;
    there are

    many opportunities for ML to support and supplement these methods.

    12.1

    Modeling Social Interactions

    When designing climate change strategies, it is critical to understand how organizations
    and in-

    dividuals act and interact in response to different incentives and constraints.
    Agent-based mod-

    els (ABMs) [168, 222] represent one approach used in simulating the actions and
    interactions

    of agents (people, companies, etc.) in their environment. ABMs have been applied
    to a multitude

    of problems relevant to climate change, in particular to study low-carbon technology
    adoption

    [320, 584, 656, 878]. For example, when modeling solar PV adoption [875], agents
    may represent

    individuals who act based on factors such as financial interest and the behavior
    of their peers

    [88, 655]; the goal is then to study how these agents interact in response to
    different conditions,

    such as electricity rates, subsidy programs, and geographical considerations.
    Here, ML can help

    identify the roles of these conditions directly from data [58]. Other applications
    of ABMs include

    modeling how behavior under social norms changes with external pressures [715],
    how the econ-

    omy and climate may evolve given a diversity of political and economic beliefs
    [272], and how

    individuals may migrate in response to environmental changes [787]. While agent
    and environ-

    ment models in ABMs are often hand-designed by experts, ML can help integrate
    data-driven

    insights into these models [874], for example, by learning rules or models for
    agents based on ob-

    servational data [312, 875], or by using unsupervised methods such as variational
    autoencoders

    or generative adversarial networks to discover salient features useful in modeling
    a complex envi-

    ronment. While the hope of learning or tuning behavior from data is promising
    for generalization,

    many data-driven approaches lose the interpretability for which ABMs are valued;
    work in inter-

    pretable ML methods could potentially help with this.

    In addition to ABMs, techniques from game theory can be valuable in modeling behavior,
    e.g., to

    explore cooperation in the face of a depleting resource [344]. Multi-agent RL
    can also be applied to

    understand the behavior of groups of agents who need to cooperate; see [607] for
    an overview and

    [385, 475] for recent examples. Combined with mechanism design,30 such approaches
    can be used

    to design methods for cooperation that lead to mutually beneficial outcomes, for
    example when

    formalizing procedures around international climate agreements [522, 641].

    12.2

    Informing Policy

    The actions required to address climate change, both in mitigation and adaptation,
    require making

    policies31 at the local, national, and international levels [756]. Various institutions
    act as policy

    makers: for instance, governments, international organizations, non-governmental
    organizations,

    standards committees, and professional institutions. Tools from policy analysis—the
    process of

    evaluating the outcomes of past policies and assessing future policy alternatives32—can
    help in-

    form the choices these institutions make. Policy analysis uses quantitative tools
    from statistics,

    economics, and operations research such as cost–benefit analysis, uncertainty
    analysis, and multi-

    criteria decision-making to inform the policymaking process; see [555, 618] for
    an introduction.

    ML can provide data for policy analysis, help improve existing tools for assessing
    policy options,

    and provide new tools for evaluating the effects of policies.

    30Mechanism design is often called “inverse game theory”—rather than determining
    optimal strategies for players, mech-

    anism design seeks to design games such that certain strategies are incentivized.

    31Policy can refer, for example, to laws, measures, standards, or best practices.

    32The former is often referred to as ex-post policy analysis and the latter as
    ex-ante policy analysis.

    Gathering data.

    High Leverage

    When creating policies, decision-makers must often negotiate fundamental uncertainties
    in the

    underlying data. ML can help alleviate some of this uncertainty by providing data.
    For instance, as

    detailed elsewhere in this article, ML can help pinpoint sources of emissions
    (Sections 2.2 and 6.1),

    approximate traffic patterns (Section 3.1), identify infrastructure at risk (Section
    9.2), and mine

    information from companies’ financial disclosures (Section 14). Natural language
    processing, net-

    work analysis, and clustering techniques can also be used to analyze social media
    data to under-

    stand public opinions and discourse around climate change [436, 812, 844]. These
    data can then be

    used to identify areas of intervention, compute the benefits and costs of a project,
    or evaluate the

    effectiveness of a policy after it has been implemented.

    Assessing policy options.

    Decision-makers often construct mathematical models to help them assess or tradeoff
    between dif-

    ferent policy alternatives. ML is particularly relevant to approaches that model
    large and complex

    socio-economic systems to assess outcomes of particular strategies, as well as
    optimization-based

    tools that help with navigating the decision.

    Policy-makers often wish to analyze how different policy alternatives may contribute
    to achiev-

    ing a particular objective. Computational approaches such as simulation and (partial)
    equilibrium

    models can be used to compare different policy options, assess the effects of
    underlying assump-

    tions, or propose strategies that are consistent with the objectives of decision-makers.
    Of particu-

    lar relevance to climate change mitigation are IAMs, which incorporate economic
    models, climate

    models, and policy information (see [840] for an overview). IAMs are used to explore
    future societal

    pathways that are consistent with climate goals (e.g., 1.5◦C mean global temperature
    increase), and

    play a prominent role in the IPCC assessments [561]. While these models can simulate
    interactions

    between many variables in great detail, this comes at the cost of computational
    complexity and

    presents opportunities for ML. Much as with Earth system models (Section 8), ML
    can be applied

    within any of the various sub-models that make up an IAM. One set of applications
    involves deriv-

    ing results at the appropriate spatial resolution, since different components
    of an IAM operate at

    different scales. Outputs with high resolution may be aggregated via clustering
    methods to provide

    insights [183], while at coarser resolution, statistical downscaling can help
    to disaggregate data to

    an appropriate spatial resolution, as seen in applications such as crop yield
    [249], wind speed [479]

    or surface temperature [481]. ML also has the potential to help with sensitivity
    and uncertainty

    analysis [386], with finding numerical solutions for computational expensive submodels
    [206, 714],

    and assessing the validity of the models [556].

    In addition to assessing the outcomes of various policies, policymakers may also
    employ

    optimization-based tools to figure out what decisions to make. For example, combinatorial
    op-

    timization is a powerful tool used widely for decision-making in operations research.
    See [70] for

    a survey of how ML can be employed to help solve combinatorial optimization problems.

    Tools from the field of multi-criteria decision-making can also help policymakers
    manage trade-

    offs between different policies by reconciling competing objectives and minimizing
    negative side-

    effects; in particular, in cases where policy objectives and constraints can be
    mathematically for-

    malized, multi-objective optimization can provide a pragmatic approach to making
    decisions. Here,

    a decision-maker would formulate their decision-making process as an optimization
    problem by

    combining multiple optimization objectives subject to physical or other types
    of constraints; the

    goal is to then find a solution (or set of solutions) that is Pareto-optimal with
    respect to all of the

    objective functions. However, finding these solutions is often computationally
    expensive. Prac-

    titioners have applied bio-inspired algorithms such as particle swarm, genetic,
    or evolutionary

    algorithms to search for or compute Pareto-optimal solutions that satisfy the
    constraints. This

    approach has been applied in a number of climate change-related fields, including
    energy and in-

    frastructure planning [38, 325, 525, 635, 732, 856], industry [122, 334], land
    use [462, 809], and more

    [127, 317, 539, 761]. Previous work has also employed parallel surrogate search,
    assisted by ML, to

    efficiently solve multi-objective optimization problems [11]. Optimization algorithms
    which have

    been successful in the context of hyperparameter tuning (e.g., Bayesian optimization
    [726, 745])

    or guided search algorithms (e.g., tree search algorithms [738]) could also potentially
    be applied

    to this problem.

    Evaluating policy effects.

    High Leverage

    When creating new policies, decision-makers may wish to understand previous policies
    (e.g., from

    other jurisdictions) and how these policies performed. ML can help analyze previous
    policy ac-

    tions automatically and at scale by improving computational text analysis. In
    particular, natural

    language processing methods are already used in the field of political science
    to analyze political

    texts and legislation [307]; these approaches could be promising for systematically
    studying cli-

    mate change policies. Causal inference techniques can also help assess the effect
    of a particular

    policy or climate-related event from observed outcomes. ML can play a role in
    causal inference

    [41, 340, 619], including in the context of policy problems [40, 453] and in climate-relevant
    sce-

    narios such as estimating the effects of temperature on human mortality [356]
    and the effects of

    World Bank projects on vegetative cover [883].

    12.3

    Designing Markets

    In economics, GHG emissions can be seen as a negative externality: while a changing
    climate results

    in a cost for society, this cost is often not reflected in the market price of
    goods or services that

    cause GHG emissions. This is problematic, since organizations and individuals
    making decisions

    solely on the basis of market prices will tend to favor cheaper goods, even if
    those goods emit a

    large amount of GHGs. Market-based tools33 such as cap-and-trade aim to enforce
    prices reflecting

    the societal cost of GHGs and thus encourage socially beneficial behavior through
    market forces.

    ML can help in understanding the impacts of market instruments; assessing their
    effectiveness at

    reducing emissions; and supporting a swift, effective and fair implementation.34

    Predicting carbon prices.

    There are several approaches to pricing GHG emissions. Carbon taxes and quotas
    aim to influence

    the behavior of organizations by shaping supply and demand within an existing
    market. By con-

    trast, cap-and-trade approaches such as those within the European Union involve
    a completely

    new market, an Emissions Trading Scheme, within which companies can buy and sell
    a limited

    number of GHG emissions permits. Prices within such cap-and-trade markets are
    highly sensi-

    tive to control elements such as the number of permits released at a given time.
    ML can be used

    to analyze prices within these markets, for example by predicting prices via supervised
    learning

    [769, 834, 890, 892] or analyzing the main drivers of prices via hierarchical
    clustering [891].

    Non-carbon markets.

    Market design can influence GHG emissions even in settings where such emissions
    are not directly

    penalized. For instance, dynamic pricing in electricity markets—varying the price
    of electricity to

    consumers based on, e.g., how much wind power is available—can shape demand for
    low-carbon

    energy sources (see Section 2.1.1). Following seminal research on modeling pricing
    in markets as

    a bandit problem [700], many works have applied bandit and other RL algorithms
    to determine

    33For background on market-based strategies, see [217, 755, 757].

    34For a review on ML for energy economics and finance, see [283].

    Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning

    42:53

    prices or other market values. For example, RL has been applied to predict bids
    [654] and market

    power [572] in electricity markets, and to set dynamic prices in more general
    settings [510]. ML

    can also help solve auctions in supply chains [708].

    Assessing market effects.

    When designing market-based strategies, it is necessary to understand how effectively
    each strat-

    egy will reduce emissions, as well as how the underlying socio-technical system
    may be af-

    fected. Studies have considered effects of carbon pricing on economic growth and
    energy intensity

    [233, 234], or on electricity prices [569]. Effects of pricing mechanisms can
    also be indirect, as com-

    panies’ strategic decisions can have longer-term effects. ML can be useful in
    analyzing these effects.

    For example, self-organizing maps have been used to analyze how R&D investment
    in green tech-

    nologies changes in response to fuel prices [55], while a game theoretical framework
    using neural

    networks has been used to study the optimal production strategies for companies
    under carbon

    quotas [884].

    To ensure that market-based strategies are effective and equitable, it is important
    to understand

    their distributional effects, as certain social groups or classes of stakeholders
    may be affected more

    than others. For example, a flat carbon tax on gasoline will have a larger effect
    on lower-income

    populations, as fuel expenses are a bigger share of their total budget. Here,
    clustering can help

    identify permit allocation schemes that maximize social welfare [855], and supervised
    learning

    has been used to predict winners and losers from changing electricity tariff schemes
    [302]. He-

    donic pricing can also help identify how much different consumers may be willing
    to pay for a

    environmental good or a service, which is a noisy measure for the monetary value
    of that good or

    service; these values are typically inferred using regression or ML techniques
    on historical mar-

    ket data [175, 594, 613, 629]. It is also important to analyze which organizations
    or individuals

    can actually participate in a given market. For example, carbon markets can be
    more flexible if

    viable offsets exist, including those offered by landowners who sequester carbon
    through forest

    conservation and management; ML has been used to examine the factors influencing
    the financial

    viability of such projects [425].

    12.4

    Discussion

    The complexity, scale, and fundamental uncertainty inherent in the problems of
    climate change

    can pose challenges for collective decision-making. ML can help supplement existing
    mathematical

    frameworks that are employed to alleviate some of these challenges, including
    agent-based models,

    IAMs, multi-objective optimization, and market design tools. Interpretable and
    fair ML techniques

    may be of particular importance in this context, as they may enable decision-makers
    to more

    effectively and equitably employ insights from ML models. While these quantitative
    assessment

    tools can provide useful input to the decision-making process, it is worth noting
    that decisions

    regarding climate change may ultimately depend on qualitative discussions around
    norms, values,

    or equity considerations that may not be captured in quantitative models.

    EDUCATION

    Access to quality education is a key part of sustainable development, with significant
    benefits for

    climate and society at large. Education contributes to improving quality of life,
    helps individuals

    make informed decisions, and trains the next generation of innovators. Education
    is also para-

    mount in helping people across societies understand and address the causes and
    consequences

    of climate change and provides the skills and tools necessary for adapting to
    its impacts. For in-

    stance, education can both improve the resilience of communities, particularly
    in developing coun-

    tries that will be disproportionately affected by climate change [801], and empower

    especially from developed countries, to adopt more sustainable lifestyles [244].
    As climate change

    itself may diminish educational outcomes for some populations, due to its negative
    effects on

    agricultural productivity and household income [666, 667], this makes providing
    high-quality ed-

    ucational interventions globally all the more important.

    AI in Education.

    Long-term

    There are a number of ways that AI and ML can contribute to education and teaching—for
    instance,

    by improving access to educational opportunities, helping personalize the teaching
    process, and

    stepping in when teachers have limited time. The field of Artificial Intelligence
    in EDucation

    (AIED) has existed for over 30 years, and until recently relied on explicitly
    modeling content,

    learners, and tutoring strategies based on psychological theories of learning.
    However, AIED is

    increasingly incorporating data-driven insights derived from ML techniques.

    One important area of AIED research has been Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs),
    which

    can adapt their behavior in real time according to the needs of individuals or
    to support collabo-

    rative learning [124]. While ITSs have traditionally been defined and constructed
    by hand, recent

    approaches have applied ML techniques such as multi-armed bandit techniques to
    adaptively per-

    sonalize sequences of learning activities [135], LSTMs to generate questions to
    evaluate language

    comprehension [205], and RL to improve the strategies used within the ITS [365,
    441]. However,

    there remains much work to be done to bridge the performance gap between digital
    and human

    tutors, and ML-based approaches have an important role to play in this endeavor—for
    example,

    via natural language processing techniques for creating conversational agents
    [295], learner ana-

    lytics for classifying student profiles, [695], and adaptive learning approaches
    to propose relevant

    educational activities and exercises [774].35

    While ITSs generally focus on individualized or small-group instruction, AIED
    can also help

    provide tools that improve educational outcomes at scale for larger groups of
    learners. For instance,

    scalable, adaptive online courses could give hundreds of thousands of learners
    access to learning

    resources that they would not usually have in their local educational facilities
    [694]. Furthermore,

    giving teachers guidance derived from computational teaching algorithms or heuristics
    could help

    them design better educational curricula and improve student learning outcomes
    [172]. In this

    context, AIED applications can be used either as a standalone tool for independent
    learners or as

    an educational resource that frees up teachers to have more one-on-one time with
    students. Key

    considerations for creating AIED tools that can be applied across the globe include
    adapting to local

    technological and cultural needs, addressing barriers such as access to electricity
    and internet [430,

    431], and taking into account students’ computing skills, language, and culture
    [106, 590].

    Learning about climate.

    Research has shown that educational activities centered on climate change and
    carbon footprints

    can engage learners in understanding the connection between personal and collective
    actions and

    their impact on global climate, and can enable individuals to make climate-friendly
    lifestyle choices

    such as reducing energy use [142]. There have also been proposals for interactive
    websites explain-

    ing climate science as well as educational interventions focusing on local and
    actionable aspects

    of sustainable development [22]. In these contexts, ML can help create personalized
    educational

    tools, for instance by generating images of potential future impacts of extreme
    weather events

    based on a learner’s address [716] or by anchoring an individual’s learning experience
    in a digital

    replica of their real-life location and allowing them to explore the way that
    climate change will

    impact a specific location [28].

    Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning

    FINANCE

    BY ALEXANDRA LUCCIONI

    The rise and fall of financial markets is linked to many events, both sporadic
    (e.g., the 2008 global

    financial crisis) and cyclical (e.g., the price of gas over the years), with profits
    and losses that can

    be measured in the billions of dollars and can have global consequences. Climate
    change poses a

    substantial financial risks to global assets measured in the trillions of dollars
    [185], and it is hard

    to forecast where, how, or when climate change will impact the stock price of
    a given company, or

    even the debt of an entire nation. While financial analysts and investors focus
    on pricing risk and

    forecasting potential earnings, the majority of the current financial system is
    based on quarterly or

    yearly performance. This fails to incentivize the prediction of medium or long-term
    risks, which

    include most climate change-related exposures such as physical impacts on assets
    or distribution

    chains, legislative impacts on profit generation, and indirect market consequences
    such as supply

    and demand.36

    Climate investment.

    Climate investment, the current dominant approach in climate finance, involves
    investing money

    in low-carbon assets [229]. The dominant ways in which major financial institutions
    take this

    approach are by creating “green” financial indexes that focus on low-carbon energy,
    clean tech-

    nology, and/or environmental services [182] or by designing carbon-neutral investment
    portfolios

    that remove or under-weight companies with relatively high carbon footprints [284].
    This invest-

    ment strategy is creating major shifts in certain sectors of the market (e.g.,
    utilities and energy)

    towards renewable energy alternatives, which are seen as having a greater growth
    potential than

    traditional energy sources such as oil and gas [72]. While this approach currently
    does not utilize

    ML directly, we see the potential in applying deep learning both for portfolio
    selection (based on

    features of the stocks involved) and investment timing (using historical patterns
    to predict future

    demand), to maximize both the impact and scope of climate investment strategies.

    Climate analytics.

    High Leverage

    The other main approach to climate finance is climate analytics, which aims to
    predict the finan-

    cial effects of climate change, and is still gaining momentum in the mainstream
    financial com-

    munity [229]. Since this is a predictive approach to addressing climate change
    from a financial

    perspective, it is one where ML can potentially have greater impact. Climate analytics
    involves

    analyzing investment portfolios, funds, and companies in order to pinpoint areas
    with heightened

    risk due to climate change, such as timber companies that could be bankrupted
    by wildfires or wa-

    ter extraction initiatives that could see their sources polluted by shifting landscapes.
    Approaches

    used in this field include: natural language processing techniques for identifying
    climate risks

    and investment opportunities in disclosures made by companies [254, 442, 498,
    752] as well as for

    analyzing the evolution of climate coverage in the media to dynamically hedge
    climate change

    risk [221]; econometric approaches for developing arbitrage strategies that take
    advantage of the

    carbon risk factor in financial markets [26]; and ML approaches for forecasting
    the price of carbon

    in emission exchanges37 [887, 889].

    To date, the field of climate finance has been largely neglected within the larger
    scope of financial

    research and analysis. This leaves many directions for improvement, such as (1)
    improving existing

    traditional portfolio optimization approaches; (2) in-depth modeling of variables
    linked to climate

    risk; (3) designing a statistical climate factor that can be used to project the
    variation of stock prices

    36For further reading regarding the impact of climate change on financial markets,
    see [61, 86, 108].

    37Carbon pricing, e.g., via CO2 cap-and-trade or a carbon tax, is a commonly-suggested
    policy approach for getting firms

    to price future climate change impacts into their financial calculations. For
    an introduction to these topics, see [632] and

    also Section 12.3.

    given a compound set of events; and (4) identifying direct and indirect climate
    risk exposure in

    annual company reports. ML plays a central role in these strategies, and can be
    a powerful tool in

    leveraging the financial sector to mitigate climate change and in reducing the
    financial impacts of

    climate change on society.

    CONCLUSION

    ML, like any technology, does not always make the world a better place—but it
    can. In the fight

    against climate change, ML has significant contributions to offer across domain
    areas. ML can en-

    able automatic monitoring through remote sensing (e.g., by pinpointing deforestation,
    gathering

    data on buildings, and assessing damage after disasters). It can accelerate the
    process of scien-

    tific discovery (e.g., by suggesting new materials for batteries, construction,
    and carbon capture).

    ML can optimize systems to improve efficiency (e.g., by consolidating freight,
    designing carbon

    markets, and reducing food waste). And it can accelerate computationally expensive
    physical sim-

    ulations through hybrid modeling (e.g., climate models and energy scheduling models).
    These and

    other cross-cutting themes are shown in Table 2. We emphasize that in each application,
    ML is

    only one part of the solution; it is a tool that enables other tools across fields.

    Applying ML to tackle climate change has the potential both to benefit society
    and to advance

    the field of ML. Many of the problems we have discussed here highlight cutting-edge
    areas of ML,

    such as interpretability, causality, and uncertainty quantification. Moreover,
    meaningful action

    on climate problems requires dialogue with fields within and outside computer
    science and can

    lead to interdisciplinary methodological innovations, such as improved physics-constrained
    ML

    techniques.

    The nature of climate-relevant data poses challenges and opportunities. For many
    of the applica-

    tions we identify, data can be proprietary or include sensitive personal information.
    Where datasets

    exist, they may not be organized with a specific task in mind, unlike typical
    ML benchmarks that

    have a clear objective. Datasets may include information from heterogeneous sources,
    which must

    be integrated using domain knowledge. Moreover, the available data may not be
    representative of

    global use cases. For example, forecasts of electricity demand based on a dataset
    from the US will

    not necessarily generalize to India, where patterns of demand may be different.
    Tools from transfer

    learning and domain adaptation will likely prove essential in low-data settings.
    For some tasks, it

    may also be feasible to augment learning with carefully simulated data. Of course,
    the best option

    if possible is always more real data; we strongly encourage public and private
    entities to release

    datasets and to solicit involvement from the ML community.

    For those looking to use ML to help tackle climate change, we provide further
    resources via the

    Climate Change AI initiative (www.climatechange.ai), and we offer the following
    roadmap:

    • Learn. Identify how your skills may be useful—we hope this article is a starting
    point. Re-

    member that often the most impactful work lies in solving well-defined, domain-specific

    bottlenecks, and is not always flashy.

    • Collaborate. Find collaborators, who may be researchers, entrepreneurs, established
    com-

    panies, or policy makers. Every domain discussed here has experts who understand
    its op-

    portunities and pitfalls, even if they are not experts in ML.

    • Listen. Listen to what your collaborators and other stakeholders say is needed
    for addressing

    the problem effectively. Keep in mind that complex methodologies are not always
    needed.

    • Deploy. Work with deployment partners to ensure a pathway to impact for your
    work, and

    incorporate deployment-related considerations during development.

    We call upon the ML community to use its skills as part of the global effort against
    climate change.

    In recent years, underwater visible light communication (UVLC) has become a potential
    wireless carrier candidate for signal transmission in highly critical, unknown,
    and acrimonious water mediums such as oceans. Unfortunately, the oceans are the
    least explored reservoirs in oceanogeographical history. However, natural disasters
    have aroused significant interest in observing and monitoring oceanic environments
    for the last couple of decades. Therefore, UVLC has drawn attention as a reliable
    digital carrier and claims a futuristic optical media in the wireless communication
    domain. Counterparts of traditional communications, the green, clean, and safe
    UVLC support high capacity data-rate and bandwidth with minimal delay. Nevertheless,
    the deployment of UVLC is challenging rather than terrestrial basis communication
    over long ranges. In addition, UVLC systems have severe signal attenuation and
    strong turbulence channel conditions. Due to the fact that, this study provides
    an exhaustive and comprehensive survey of recent advancements in UVLC implementations
    to cope with the optical signal propagation issues. In this regard, a wide detailed
    summary and future perspectives of underwater optical signaling towards 5G and
    beyond (5GB) networks along with the current project schemes, channel impairments,
    various optical signal modulation techniques, underwater sensor network (UWSN)
    architectures with energy harvesting approaches, hybrid communication possibilities,
    and advancements of Internet of underwater things (IoUTs) are concluded in this
    research. An overview of RF-VLC hybrid communication system where the oceanographic
    data collects by distinct types of underwater sensor network nodes architecture

    evolution of underwater visible light communication (UVLC) towards the next-generation
    wireless network 5G and 5G beyond (5GB) vision would have an enhancement in overall
    system performance while satisfying the current requirements. From the perspective
    of VLC, data transmission is highly secure with very minimal interception. The
    5GB is an advanced wireless communication networking approach that provides a
    downlink data rate of more than 1Gbps. Moreover, the drawback in 5GB is the high
    cost of infrastructural development [1]. On the other hand, the ongoing transition
    of VLC across the 6G wireless network has more eminence over 5G network such as
    enhanced machine-type communication (mMTC) and ultra-reliable & low-latency communication
    (uRLLC) [2]. However, a promising VLC technology has no interference as RF communication
    system does. Therefore, VLC has acceptability of benefits to deploy, where the
    RF wireless networks are less implemented such as medical fields, oil rigs and
    gas plants, nuclear power plants (NPPs), underwater communication and further
    numerous applications [3]. As the oceans are mysterious water reservoirs that
    need to be explored through various signal processing techniques and applications
    such as undersea monitoring, observing marine life, detecting oil and natural
    gas sources, early warning of tsunamis, floods, and underwater location coordinates
    for navigation purposes [4]. Under these conditions, underwater wireless communication
    (UWC) has become an essential approach to exploring undersea sectors and plays
    a significant role in order to provide the natural phenomenal underwater activities.
    The state-of-the-art UWC in coastal securities, fishing farms, marine transportation,
    and pollution control have been implemented for several decades [5]. UWC networks
    are necessarily vital approaches in inaccessible and unmanageable regions of the
    deep ocean, which are highly sought-after research areas among scientists, researchers,
    and academics. A comprehensive and detailed discussion on UWC as a potential method
    of wireless signal transmission is recorded as in [5]–[9]. In addition, the proposed
    deployable underwater communication technologies in existing surveys support the
    collection of the oceanographic data, observation of water pollution, undersea
    monitoring, immediate warning of floods & natural disasters, and the phenomena
    of melting ice sheets due to global warming caused by rising ocean levels are
    also discussed in [9]. Recent studies encourage exploring the oceanic environment
    by deploying UWC technologies such as electromagnetic waves (EM) in terms of RF,
    acoustic, and optical waves propagation. As RF waves highly attenuate by the seawater
    and change the properties conductor to dielectric at 250GHz frequency ranges [10].
    Therefore, RF carriers are not feasible and cover short ranges of communication
    in an aquatic medium. As claimed by the existing underwater architectural system
    in literature, the frequency ranges of EM waves in underwater propagation is extremely
    low between 30−300Hz for military applications [11]. A large sized antenna is
    required in UWRF signaling for better performance in underwater mediums [12].
    Similarly, RF waves are also operated as ultra-low frequencies (ULF) to proceed
    with low attenuation but at a very high budget and at a low data rate. it provides
    low data rates [13]. Most recently, a joint technical WMO-IOC Commission for Oceanography
    and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) as an observing network of the Global Ocean Observing
    System (GOOS) has proposed a high-frequency radar network (HFR) in 2017s [14].
    In [14], the proposed communication system has drawn an attention of HFR system,
    that is continuously observed and map of ocean currents up to 200km offshore site
    in the coastal area. It supports detecting the floating objects on the sea surface,
    such as fishing ships, buoys, floating nodes, boats, yachts, etc., and extremely
    helpful for rescue operations. In the HFR networking system, the signal propagation
    is held from the radar and the signal reception by the conduction ocean waves,
    measuring the Doppler shift and giving direction and velocity. A pictorial view
    is depicted the function of HFR by Fig.16. FIGURE 1. An overview of RF-VLC hybrid

    for further analysis. In this type of scenario, the different internet of underwater
    things (IoUT) are included to communicate with each other by utilizing the latest
    wireless network or beyond. As depicted, the floating nodes collect the information

    16. A hieroglyphic overview of the Internet of Underwater Things (IoUTs) in diversified
    possible underwater applications. Each Internet-connected tool functioned differently
    for a specific purpose. As floating nodes, sea gliders, Unmanned underwater vehicles
    (UUVs), Remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) are used for long-range communication,
    localization, bathymetric data-collection, and real-time monitoring. On the other
    hand, the high-frequency radar, a floating drifter, geographical satellite, surface
    floating gliders, and Tsunami buoy are used for continuously observation and mapping
    ocean currents, oceanographic imaging and geographical mapping, and early detection
    warning of the tsunami and tectonic plates movement. Moreover, the clod cards
    and animal telemetry are usable for studying the underwater flow pattern and observation
    of the marine environment. Show All At a glance, EM waves were initially used
    as low-frequency ranges to transmit signals on terrestrial-based communication
    for reliable communication to achieve high bandwidth. Though, in an underwater
    environment, RF waves propagate differently compared to terrestrial-based signaling
    and totally depend on water mediums. The advantageous feature of RF waves propagate
    with high velocity (similar to the optical waves) provide efficient communication
    among the network nodes. Underwater wireless RF (UWRF) experiences signal fading
    and easily attenuates over very short distances in underwater. It is challenging
    to transmit signals through RF waves in a highly turbid water medium. An impressive
    survey work is proposed on UWRF based communication in seawater, where the authors
    widely discussed the recent advances of RF waves for coastal and military applications
    [11]. Besides UWRF, the acoustic waves are received the utmost interest in signal
    propagation over long distances in underwater medium with the limited bandwidth
    [15]. The traditional acoustic wireless carriers propagate over long distances
    with a low speed of approximately 1500m/s , and a meager data rate [12]. Generally,
    acoustic waves propagation speed is influenced by channel impairments. Conversely,
    the speed of acoustic waves increases tremendously due to fluctuation of the temperature
    and salinity of the water [8]. The affecting factors such as scattering, reflection,
    and absorption by suspended particles corrupt acoustic signals. Therefore, the
    main concern of UWC is the establishment and architectural design of underwater
    sensor networks (UWSNs) for obtaining proper communication among nodes. An exhaustively
    detailed review study of UWSN is summarized in [16]. Additionally, the shipbuilding
    industries are also increasingly interested in widespread communication through
    sensor network architectures. The possible UWSNs applications are over-viewed
    in various underwater applications such as observing strong influences of the
    aqueous medium, undersea nutrient production, natural oil retrieval, underwater
    transportation, and the impact of water climate regulation on ecological system
    [17]. In these corresponding applications, the sensor nodes such as autonomous
    underwater vehicles (AUVs), remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs) support
    the data collection with the onshore nodes (sub-station) [18]. The cluster of
    underwater sensor networks is depicted in Fig.1, Fig.14 and sensor network architecture
    in Fig.16. Due to the limited data rate and bandwidth of UWRF and acoustic waves,
    an alternative optical signaling approach has become the most significant and
    reliable wireless carrier candidate for digital signaling in underwater [19].
    For instance, in the first stage of optical signaling, fire, fire-smoke, fire
    beacons, torches, and reflecting sunlight were introduced. In the starting phase
    of optical signaling about 800 BC, the ancient Romans and Greeks used to transmit
    optical signals for communication purposes over long ranges [20]. During 1880s,
    the optical wave-based telephone (photophone) was invented by the famous scientist
    Alexander Graham Bell for signal transmission over 210m [21]. In this photophone,
    a parabolic mirror with a selenium cell was used as an optical signal receiver.
    In the end of the 19 th century, the continuous development of optical signaling,
    Heliographs were firstly proposed to deliver messages through optical waves in
    the battlefield for military applications [22]. Generally, the heliographs were
    assembled with a dual-layer of mirrors and directly used to control the light
    beam propagation. For further development of optical communication, lasers were
    introduced as an alternative for signal transmission to serve wireless carrier
    over long distances [12]. On the other hand, the demand for ocean exploration
    is hiking up for a couple of decades. For instance, a real-time data streaming
    fiber optics signaling is applicable for several underwater applications and proposed
    during 1970s [23]. However, the main drawback of fiber optics is highly cost setups
    and unpleasant for undersea species. Moreover, in connection with the limited
    propagation coverage and high attenuation, underwater signaling is highly challenging
    to fill the gap of the desired communication. For consistent development of optical
    signaling, He-Ne laser ( λ =632.8nm) was investigated as an optical signal carrier
    over the 30 – 40km range during 1960s [23]. In the early ages of laser development,
    the very initial foundational laser link was established to control commercial
    traffic in Japan by Nippon Electric Company during 1970s [21]. This deployed laser
    link was firstly used for signal transmission over 14 km. Later on, full-duplex
    communication Free Space Optics (FSO) enabled He-Ne laser at 0.6325μm was introduced
    for communication between the cities of Yokohama and Tamagawa in Japan [21], [23].
    To keep evolution going, FSO communication technology was proposed to transmit
    high data-rate signals with minimal delay over long distances among communication
    nodes, which is extensively discussed in [12] and [24]. Later, in the end of the
    20 th century, the numerous developments have been documented for optical signaling.
    Kahn and Barry extended Gfeller and Bapst’s work, where they demonstrated a laser
    of wavelength 780 – 950nm with high data rates 50 – 70Mbps [21], [25] [26]. In
    laser counterparts, the implementation of Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) in VLC
    are widely used as transmitters through an illumination nature that provides an
    ultrahigh bandwidth to achieve a high data rate. For optical signal transmission
    and receiving, LDs and LEDs are the potential tools and widely use in optical
    communication over very short, short, medium and long ranges as per the requirement
    of the applications [27]. Therefore, these LEDs are considered the main sources
    of optical signal contributors. Moreover, the various light sources, photosensors
    transmit and receive optical signals such as a laser diode (LDs), Avalanche photodiode
    (APD), p-n diode, etc. The consumption of LED seems to be a novel approach cause
    of its dual nature. LED turn-on and turn-off ability turns a new communication
    paradigm formally known as the visible light communication system. Although, the
    invention of LEDs received a remarkable extent of research for high data transmission
    of its dual nature as illumination and signal carrier [28]. The illumination phenomenon
    occurs based on the visible light wave spectrum at the wavelength 380 – 750nm,
    which is used as a transmitter and an image sensor at the receiver end [29]. Historically,
    VLC was proposed by the Visible Light Communications Consortium Japan (VLCCJ),
    Japan Electronics & Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA) CP-1221,
    and CP-1222 during 2003s to 2007s [21]. For continuous development of VLC, the
    Visible Light Communications Associations (VLCA) was established in Japan for
    further standardization [30]. As Japan Traffic Management Technology Association
    (JTMTA) and VLCC conducted an experiment where they achieved 4800 kbps data rate
    over a distance of 300m. Overall, Japan had contributed the initiatives for the
    development of products based on VLC signal modulated technologies. Additionally,
    in 2012s, Casio Japan developed the new Apple application “Picapicamera” for users
    where the images could be sent instantly through VLC technology [27]. In contrast,
    the modulation schemes and dimming phenomenon supports possible VLC communication
    that has been widely investigated by IEEE 802.15.7 standard [31]. The optical
    wireless communication (OWC) IEEE 802.15.7r1 standardization is used for short-range
    communication as VLC implementation [32]. The new era of optical communication
    has become a more significant trade for digital wireless signaling media with
    the integration of different techniques, which are mentioned in Table 1. Subsequently,
    the optical camera communications (OCC) system is used as image sensors at the
    receiver end to provide triple functions simultaneously, i.e., illumination, data
    transmission, and wireless energy transfer [20]. TABLE 1 An Overview of the Different
    Optical Communication Technologies Along With the Description of Transceivers
    are Used. In Addition, the Distinct Characteristics and the Possible Applications
    of an Individual Technique are Also Summarized TABLE 2 The Description of Acronyms
    and Notations are Used in This Study TABLE 3 Nomenclature and Description of Acronyms
    are Used in This Research All the above matter facts for real-time data streaming
    and high bandwidth signal propagation approaches are needed. Therefore, underwater
    optical wireless communication (UWOC) in terms of visible light, particularly
    the blue-green spectrum of wavelength (450–532)nm [20], has been chosen and is
    widely used for high data transmission underwater communication. In the UWOC,
    the hydrological optical beam experiences signal absorption due to electron transition
    and converted into another form of energy. It is noticeable that water offers
    transparency with blue-green light spectrum [20] rather than with other light
    spectrum wavelengths. Moreover, the ocean water offers less attenuation for the
    blue light spectrum while the green light spectrum is attenuated by coastal water
    [33]. The optical signal attenuation depends on the inherent optical properties
    (IOPs), and apparent optical properties (AOPs) of water medium [34]. Additionally,
    the physio-chemical properties of the water channel supports fading contribution
    due to absorption, optical scattering, and reflection caused by turbidity, pressure,
    temperature, and existing suspended material within the water environment [35].
    As a result, underwater visible light communication (UVLC) has become a complementary
    approach compared to traditional acoustic communication in high data rates ranging
    from hundred Mbps to Gbps over short range applications. Even UVLC has received
    superiority over traditional underwater acoustic and EM signaling. As compared
    to the existing traditional UWC techniques, UVLC technology has advantages in
    harsh environments as it is handy to use, easy to deploy with low cost, and highly
    qualitative communication media [36]. A broad detailed scenario of UVLC and connecting
    nodes optically in an underwater environment is depicted in Fig.1. Underwater
    signaling is entirely different from the terrestrial radio environment due to
    its energy costs and signal propagation phenomena. As a result, it is challenging
    to provide energy to power-hungry devices in underwater mediums. To cope with
    the energy harvesting (EH) issues, Simultaneously Wireless Information and Power
    Transfer (SWIPT) [37] and Simultaneously Light-Wave Information and Power Transfer
    (SLIPT) techniques [38], [39] are proposed in the literature in preference to
    powered up UWSNs. SWITP, wireless power transfer (WPT), and SLIPT will be widely
    discussed in further sections in this study. At a glance, EH is an optimum solution
    for power supply to activate the internet-enabled devices. Although, very few
    existing EH techniques are capable of supplying energy to the internet of underwater
    things (IoUTs). Several EH techniques are proposed in the open literature to power
    up underwater-based sensor nodes through RF and acoustic waves, which are mentioned
    in section IX. Considering the EH scheme in acoustic communication, the Microbial
    Fuel Cell (MFC) and Acoustic Piezo-Electric (APE) techniques are the key enabling
    solutions for self-energizing nodes [40]. WPT and SWIPT techniques are investigated
    and introduced to provide energy with information transmission simultaneously
    over the wireless network [37]. Similarly, SLIPT has been announced as a futuristic
    wireless carrier candidate for EH and information transmission through light wave
    [41]. A more detailed summary and comparison between SWIPT and SLIPT is recorded
    in the literature in [42]. Furthermore, enabling the next-generation wireless
    network proliferates the communication system quality and efficiency. 5G enabled
    underwater wireless communication system will be the futuristic communication
    networking system that has been introduced recently in [35]. The authors in [43]
    and [44] are investigated the Filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC) and generalized
    frequency division multiplexing (GFDM) schemes which are considered as the latest
    reliable networking techniques for 5G applications in underwater. Improving the
    system quality of communication setup within the higher signal modulation techniques
    also significantly achieves a high data rate. The higher modulation techniques
    support a high degree of signal transmission between transceivers with minimum
    delay. The different types of optical signal modulation techniques are summarized
    in [45] and [21]. The hybrid links established for the long ranges of communication
    in different channel environmental conditions are used to deploy according to
    the requirement. A hybrid RF-UWOC system is investigated in [46]–[52]. Therefore,
    throughout this study, we present the various optical signal modulations, demodulations
    techniques, and their implementations in various wireless systems with recent
    trends in the underwater environment. A. Related Survey Literature The various
    existing works are recorded based on UWC techniques and investigated with numerous
    emerging development methods in this domain. The existing related works are summarized
    by Table 4. For several decades, accelerating UWC to explore the underwater environment
    has become an alternative communication media that attracts human activities in
    an aqueous medium. Plenty of underwater wireless applications based on acoustic
    waves are investigated in existing works to explore the oceanic environment. However,
    the limited signal propagation speed and bandwidth recorded in underwater sound
    waves caused communication delay among nodes [12]. Therefore, the requirement
    for underwater acoustic communication setups for real-time monitoring and to access
    underwater applications are typically challenging. Based on underwater acoustic
    communication (UWAC), the most promptly military applications, especially in underwater
    acoustic communications among nodes such as submarine to the base station, submarine
    to ship, and submarine with military divers, are widely summarized in [53]. On
    the other hand, underwater optical signaling propagation reliably supports high
    bandwidth and high data-rate with minimal delay and latency. This is particularly
    appealing for real-time underwater applications [54]. To mitigate of its limitations,
    a hybrid mixed communication system design and evaluation of underwater optical-acoustic
    networks are investigated as in [55]–[59]. Similarly, for real-time scenarios,
    the performance of RF underwater communications operating system at frequency
    ranges 433MHz to 2.4GHz is investigated [60]. A range of existing hybrid underwater
    links are summarized in Table 4. Due to high signal propagation delay and very
    few kbps data rate in UWAC, counterparts of UWRF could be a complementary solution
    to receive high data rate and bandwidth range. For short distances, the RF conduction-based
    system design for voice communication in an aqueous medium has been recorded in
    [61]. TABLE 4 The Table is Summarized the Most Recent Existing Similar Works Along
    With the Related Contributions From the Perspective of Future Directions. Furthermore,
    it has Also Mentioned the Channel Modeling, Impairments, Signal Affecting Factors,
    and the Most Widely Deployable Underwater Applications Prior works are designed
    on theoretical propositions as a function of the physical properties of channels
    such as pressure, temperature, salinity, etc. A recent survey on UWOC is widely
    discussed about signal propagation-related issues based on the physical layer
    and localization technique in [13]. The authors in [62] investigated the path
    loss performance of a vertical UVLC link with the physical properties of the water
    channel considering n th water layers. A UVLC system model considering LOS & non-LOS
    vertical configurations and the variation of refractive index is also presented
    in [63]. The survey [12] is exhaustively enlisted the critical factors of optical
    signals propagation in an underwater medium where the authors modeled the UWOC
    channels. However, the survey is provided a detailed summary of optical signal
    modulation and demodulation techniques according to the experimental setup of
    the system. UWOC wireless carriers as FSO and UVLC technology have been compared
    and widely discussed in [64]. The higher modulation techniques of UVLC have become
    attention for developing optical signals in the underwater environment. Due to
    this, a 16-QAM modulation scheme for underwater signaling was proposed in [65].
    The authors in [65] are investigated the four types of different geometrical shaped
    16-QAM constellation experimental approaches for improving the system efficiency.
    The most recent work based on the MIMO-OFDM scheme utilizing VLC in underwater
    is proposed as in [66] and [67], where the authors proposed the BER performance
    of the system under consideration of weak turbulence channel conditions. Another
    study is observed the BER performance over NOMA-based assisted UVLC link as in
    [68]. In hybrid communication, EH is an issue concerning nodes in active modes.
    An EH hybrid acoustic-optical underwater sensor networking system was investigated
    in [69]. The authors in [70], are introduced the possible underwater applications
    and the differences between the terrestrial-based wireless network (TWSNs) with
    the underwater sensor network nodes (UWSNs). In the previous work [4], we reviewed
    the comparison among the three most significant UWC technologies and concluded
    the various advantages of UWOC over traditional wireless carriers. In this presented
    survey, we studied the recent advent of UVLC within different channel conditions.
    The following complementary sub-topics are widely summarized in this research
    as follows; UVLC channel model is considered within the combined influence of
    weak to strong turbulence channel conditions along with the pointing error between
    transceivers; The performance of underwater hybrid communication is obtained in
    different water types along with the simulation results; The distinctive VLC higher

    applications in marine industries all around the world; A diverse study of IoUTs
    and implementation in different underwater locations for required applications
    are also summarized; Integration of UVLC towards 5G and 5GB networking in UWC
    domain is concluded; A SLIPT assisted scheme, based on time-switching and power
    switching methods to powered up UWSNs is highlighted in this research. B. Motivations
    and Contributions Since humans footed on earth, oceanic reservoirs are least explored
    and are far-fetched to envisage the undersea environments. We tend to know more
    about the moon and mars rather than oceans existed on our earth. The interest
    growth of human activities in underwater is proposed the new research advances
    become familiarization with the natural oceanic phenomenal activities. Numerous
    UWC systems demand plenty of underwater applications for new research perspectives
    in this particular domain due to the immense development of industrialization.
    Traditional acoustic signaling is widely used for various underwater applications
    over long ranges. Nevertheless, a novel optical communication wireless media has
    been proposed recently to fulfill the requirement of desired data rate. Therefore,
    optical wireless signaling has become a potential wireless candidate for information
    transmission, and energy harvesting technology. However, UVLC is in its early
    age to cope with signal transmission and energy harvesting issues wirelessly in
    highly turbid water mediums. This study carries an exhaustive survey of UVLC towards
    5GB futuristic networking system, the latest and current projects are running
    through the globe, channel modeling, UWSNs architectures, IoUTs enabled applications,
    and their contributions are perspectives. The main contributions and recent trends
    of UVLC through this study are as follows; The main purpose of this research is
    to provide a clear understanding of the main characteristic features of UVLC terminology
    towards future 5GB networking systems. In addition, the study also discusses signal
    processing extraction methodology with the possible solutions to the current factual
    challenges of improving the efficiency and potential wireless carriers of data
    communication in the underwater environment; An essential goal of this study includes
    a clear viewpoint of technical aspects of underwater networking architectural
    communication applicable for various applications and different higher modulation
    optical signal processing techniques among students, young scientists, and researchers
    to understand challenges and future directions in the corresponding domain; An
    extensive range of underwater applications requires communication techniques with
    high performance and reliability. Due to this, most of the significant channel
    impairments and challenges are widely studied. However, absorption, scattering,
    misalignment of transceivers (Pointing Error), and turbidity are the main influencing
    factors overlooked in single-hop, dual-hop, and hybrid multi-hop wireless communications;
    A wide detailed summary of VLC modulation, and demodulation techniques towards
    5G enabled FBMC, and GFDM techniques are briefly summarized. UVLC enabled 5GB
    supports a proper connection among underwater-based internet-connected elements
    with the satellites or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for the sake of expanding
    human activities [1]; This study is visualized the most distinctive type of UWSN
    architectures to power up the nodes through SWIPT and SLIPT schemes; the UWSNs
    architecture in both academic and industrial perspectives are majorly discussed;
    The discussion of this survey study provides a forum among the students, researchers,
    and engineers. In addition, the key fundamentals of this proposed survey are associated
    with professionals communication academics. C. Paper Structure The remainder of
    the paper is organized into XV sections. An underwater wireless communication
    overview enabled with different communication media is presented in section II.
    We are discussing the fundamentals and propagation terminology of UVLC along with
    the types of waters, channel impairments in section III. The necessity of signal
    transmitter and receivers are summarized by section IV. Further, an exhaustive
    survey relating to the current project schemes and future deployments are widely
    summarized in section V. In section VI, there are plenty of computational methods
    discussed to provide a problematic solution of bulk data in optical signal processing.
    To cope with the channel impairments and signal fading factors have taken into
    account. Therefore the various UVLC system models are proposed and their overview
    is given in VII. The modulation schemes are the most practical terms to propagate
    digital signals. Due to this, the optical modulation and demodulation techniques
    are introduced in section VIII. Furthermore, deploying UVLC systems in critical
    environmental conditions is challenging and far-fetched to transfer energy to
    underwater-based sensor nodes. The SLIPT, SWIPT, and WPT wireless energy transfer
    and simultaneous information decoding schemes are broadly discussed in section
    IX. The aim of this study is to improve the performance and coverage range of
    UVLC by integrating with traditional UWC technologies. The various possible dual,
    triple, and multi-hop hybrid communication link system models are also presented
    in section X. For long-ranges communication coverage, the distinctive UWSNs architecture
    beneficial for various underwater applications is tabulated and introduced by
    section XI. Recent advancements of internet-connected devices underwater according
    to the requirements and advantages are also over-viewed in section XII. The implementation
    and future trends in UVLC towards 5G and 5GB are investigated in section XIII.
    Underwater optical wireless applications and recent advances are the impressive
    features of this study are summarized by section XIV. Finally, Section XV concludes
    the paper. SECTION II. Underwater Wireless Communication as an Overview UWC networks
    are challenging and become a significant approach to exploring an inaccessible
    unguided sector in the deep ocean with a wired and wireless connection. The deployable
    technologies allow to get familiar with the oceanic environment. Therefore, UWC
    accommodates an opportunity for oceanographic data collection and analysis, water
    pollution, underwater environmental monitoring, changes in currents, early warning
    of flood or tsunami, and observing the phenomena of ice sheet melting due to global
    warming cause of rising water level of oceans [4]. Nowadays in UWC, the three
    most significant distinctive technologies are employable for transmitting the
    information. These wireless carrier candidates are based on optical, sound, and
    electromagnetic waves based [5], [13]. The signal transmission is dependent on
    signal strength which is affected by the brutally chemical properties of the channel.
    The optical signal could be absorbed, scattered, and reflected caused by the chemical
    vitality of the channel, and suspended particles in a water environment [10].
    Considering UWRF, which is used for short ranges, the signal decay happens by
    the hydrological properties and water channel. These water channel properties
    known as permittivity, conductivity, and permeability are directly responsible
    for the contribution of RF signal attenuation while increasing frequency ranges
    [37]. Since the saline seawater allows to propagate RF waves in few meters at
    extra low-frequency range of (30–300Hz), which is enabled to the transmission
    of few characters per minute to submarine [11]. Moreover, RF waves at the frequency
    range MHz to GHz accomplishes work efficiently in hybrid scenarios [4]. However,
    for shallow water scenarios, RF-enabled communication is called buoyant communication
    [5]. The UWRF system requires a costly and large sized information transmission
    antenna along with high energy-consuming transceivers [71]. In hybrid UWRF signaling,
    it offers a significant platform for the connection between underwater and terrestrial-based
    nodes. It also permits the exploration of the forbidden field of ocean and underwater
    environment. Extremely low frequencies (ELF) are used for long ranges underwater
    communication while the high frequencies (HF) strongly attenuate the cause of
    signal losses [72]. On the other hand, the frequency ranges as ultra-high frequency
    (ULF) to medium frequency (MF) are mainly used for a variety of underwater environments
    [73]. As far as long ranges in underwater signaling, acoustic waves are widely
    used and challenging communication technology to deploy in an underwater environment
    [74]. Nevertheless, in UWAC propagation, the speed of sounds deficient with high
    delay over long ranges [75]. According to [9] and [76], an impressive feature
    of UWAC offers an incremental speed propagation on raising the temperature of
    the water. An impressive increment (approximately 4m/s) has been recorded on rising
    1°C of water temperature. Moreover, the salinity is also another cause of signal
    fading, and acoustic waves speed in enhanced by 1.4m/s while rising salinity 1
    practical salinity unit (PSU). In respect to receiving signals over long distances
    under consideration of plane wave model or spherical wave model, emerging technology
    is widely known as UWSNs, which is alternative and a complimentary communication
    media solution, especially for military and naval tactical, operational applications
    [77]. SECTION III. Fundamentals of Underwater Visible Light Communications UVLC
    has become a unique advantageous technology in the new era of wireless signaling
    that has drawn attention as a dominant signal propagation over short ranges in
    the harsh underwater medium. Towards the next generation of 5GB wireless networking
    system, UVLC will be applicable for numerous undersea applications such as geographical
    mapping, underwater navigation, naval operations, data-retrieving among nodes,
    and high quality of UWSNs are also considered [119]. Additionally, UVLC has superiority
    including high data-rate, real-time steaming data transfer with high security
    compared with its counterpart traditional underwater signaling acoustic and RF
    signaling. Despite all of these advantages, several factors affect the signal
    propagation, such as absorption, scattering, and turbulence due to the IOPs and
    AOPs properties of water channel and nature of light [5], [9], [12], [34], [79].
    The affecting factors cause signal fading, limiting a limited communication range
    for UVLC systems. Another degradation of signal fading is multi-path propagation
    that generates an inter-symbol interference (ISI). In this context, the fading-free
    impulse response (FFIR) of UVLC channel, which is a MIMO-UVLC system, has been
    recently investigated in [105]. In [105], the authors presented a thorough approach
    to UVLC channel characterization, performance analysis, and effective transmission
    along with the reception methods of the proposed system model. Moreover, in another
    study [120], the authors proposed a CDMA-UVLC approach based on assigning unique
    Optical Orthogonal Codes (OOC) for each underwater mobile user. An underwater
    cellular optical CDMA network and related applications of serial relaying mechanism
    has been recently proposed in [121] and [122]. The wireless signal transmission
    underwater is challenging, especially when optical transceivers are deployed.
    Acoustic and VLC are complementary deployable communication technologies to fulfill
    the desired communication gap in the wireless communication domain. However, acoustic
    link suffers signal attenuation and high signal propagation latency. The implantation
    of acoustic transceivers is expensive, bulky (highly challenging to deploy rather
    than optical setup), and high power consumption. The VLC link is considered as
    an alternative viable underwater signaling technology over moderate distances
    compared with acoustic and EM waves. To mitigate all the above facts, optical
    communication systems are defined as horizontal and vertical or slant links according
    to their implementation direction [123]. The horizontal links are proposed to
    improve the system performance and minimize the turbulence effects [63]. On the
    other hand, in the underwater vertical or slant link scenario, the transceivers
    are arranged in LOS link configuration [100]. A. Underwater VLC Configuration
    Links UWC is expected to achieve desirable receiving information in the underwater
    environment significantly. The design of a VLC link can be classified into three
    most significant categories such as i) UVLC Line of sight (LOS) link, ii) Retro-reflector
    assisted LOS link, and iii) Non-LOS configuration link. UVLC Line of Sight Communication
    (LOS) Link:- Generally, in optical communication LOS links are widely used; the
    LOS scenario is depicted by Fig.2. In this scenario, the deployable transceivers
    should be aligned and directly linked to one another in the line of direction
    of signal propagation. This type of combination supports and enhances the power
    efficiency, as well as immunity of the environmental distorting effects such as
    ambient and artificial light source [124]. Additionally, the LOS scenario is the
    most reliable approach for an underwater wireless communication system in terms
    of high data rate, better BER performance, improving system efficiency, and system
    performance. However, the drawback of LOS links is the mobility of transceivers
    due to water currents and the random flow of water waves. Even the received optical
    signals depend on the physical parameters of the experimental setup. According
    to [124], the LOS communication link by using laser diode wavelength 470nm is
    capable of covering 200m distance in the deep ocean that allowed 5Mbps data-rate
    transmission. On the other hand, in coastal ocean water, yellow-green LEDs are
    the optimal solution to deal with the signal scattering, and field of view (FOV)
    a wide-angle of beam causes increased attenuation. The propagation loss under
    Beer Lmabert’s law can be defined as follows [125], h pl ij (λ, d ij )=exp{−c(λ)
    d ij }, (1) View Source where i , j are denoted the transmitter and receiver nodes,
    the euclidean distance between the transceivers and the total sum of absorption
    and scattering as extinction coefficient are defined as d ij and c(λ) , respectively.
    The propagation losses depend on the path loss component as well as the geometrical
    parameters of the setup. Generally, the geometrical gain in optical LOS scenario
    can be written as [79], h gl ij = A i cos( ϕ ij ) 2π(1−cos( θ i ) d 2 ij , (2)
    View Source where the receiver aperture area of nodes and the beam divergence
    angle of i th transmitters are represented as A i and θ i , respectively. Furthermore,
    the channel conditions, which are the contribution of the path-loss and geometrical
    losses, are defined as follows [101], h ij = h pl ij + h gl ij . (3) View Source
    The channel conditions h ij is modified by replacing (1) and (2) into (3) given
    as follows, h ij = 2π(1−cos( θ i ) d 2 ij ) e {−c(λ) d ij } + A i cos( ϕ ij )
    2π(1−cos( θ i ) d 2 ij ) . (4) View Source Furthermore, for approximation of the
    maximum achievable distance to achieve a specified bit-error-rate is investigated
    in [101], which can be defined as, d ij = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ W( c(λ) 2 (1−T)( D r
    θ F ) h ( T−1 2 ) ij ) c(λ) 2 (1−T) ( D r θ F ) T ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ 1 1−T (5) View
    Source where W , D r , T , and θ F represent the Lambert-W function, the aperture
    diameter, the correction coefficient for data fitting with the simulation results,
    and divergence angle for full-width transmitted beam, respectively. For the LOS
    of laser diode, the divergence angle is generally planned for few milliradians,
    whereas LEDs fixed a divergence angle below 140 milliradians for diffusing light
    to a wide-angle [13]. At the receiver end, the received power ( P j t ) describes
    the product of transmission power efficiency, channel gain, propagation loss,
    and geometrical loss [79] of setup i.e. P j t = P i t η i t η j r h gl ij χ( ψ
    j i ) h pl ij (c(λ), d ij cos( ϕ j i ) ), (6) View Source where P j t , P j r
    , η i t , η j r , χ( ψ j i ) and ψ j i are denoted as the transmission and received
    signal powers, transceivers efficiencies, concentrator gain, and the incident
    angle concerning the receiver axis, respectively. UVLC Retro-reflector-assisted
    LOS Link: Optical retro-reflector type links are based on the back-scatter phenomenon
    principle consisting of a light source with an optical reflector. In this scenario,
    the capacity of the source is more powerful than the receiver node [125]. Although,
    the reflector is considered an interrogator with a basic anatomical design with
    minimal power availability. Consequently, the optical beam propagation source
    continuously emits a light beam during propagation of the light signal modulated
    and reflected by a local reflector then received by the destination. A UVLC retro-reflector
    LOS link is depicted by Fig.3. In more contrast, the retro-reflector scenario
    is sub-divided into two significant categories known as photon-limited and contrast-limited
    retro-reflector [5]. The photon-limited retro-reflector phenomena occurs in shallow
    waters such as lakes, deltas, and rivers either clear sea waters. In this scenario,
    the link range and the system capacity depends on the received falling photons
    at the detector end due to absorption phenomena. Although, the retro-reflector
    link is most widely used in turbid harbor water mediums, where signal scattering
    is considered an influential factor for system range and capacity. A contrast
    limitation for more specific uses underwater imaging applications is reducing
    the number of photons responsible for reducing the image contrast and quality.
    The reflector is capable of amplifying the modulated signal or light beam for
    the sake of better system performance in both scenarios as photon and contrast
    limited retro-reflectors [13]. Even, the retro-reflectors reflect the modulated
    beam and signals to the interrogator when the modulated signals are received on
    it [125]. In this retro-reflector design, if η t , η r , and η Ret are the optical
    transmitter efficiency, receiver efficiency and retro-reflector efficiency, then
    the received power in retro-reflector link is given as follows [13], [125], P
    j r = P i t η t η r η Ret h ij χ( ψ j i ) h j i (λ, 2 d ij cos( ϕ i ) ) ×[ A j
    cos( ϕ j i ) 2π d 2 ij (1−cos( θ i )) ][ A r cos( ϕ ij ) π d ij tan( θ r ) 2 ],
    (7) View Source where the aperture receiver area of reflector, the divergence
    angle of the reflector, and the angle between the receiver trajectory of the source
    are denoted by A r , θ r , and ϕ j i , respectively. UVLC Non-LOS Configuration
    Link:- Non-line of sight (NLOS) optical signal propagation happens due to existing
    or suspended large scale particles or obstructions, even misalignment of the transceivers,
    and random orientation of the transceivers in underwater mediums. In this aspect,
    the reflected light from the sea surface or the bottom of water reservoirs (in
    shallow regions) could be beneficial to facilitate multi-point communication as
    depicted in Fig.4. In the NLOS scenario, the cone of light is emitted by the source
    with inner and outer angles θ min and θ max in an upward direction. This upward
    optical beam strikes with the water surface with an annular area A nn , either
    a reflection of the light beam strikes with the ocean surface and reached the
    desired nodes. In contrast, if the transceivers are designed vertically upward,
    then the propagated beam partially refracts and partially reflects with the water
    surface. The reflected light beam propagates from the transmitter, which locates
    x distance apart water surface as depicted in Fig.4, where A nn is defined as
    equal power density while apart at a distance x 0 . The annular surface area can
    be written as follows [125], A ann =2π(x+ x 0 ) 2 [cos( θ min )−cos( θ max )],
    (8) View Source where (x+ x 0 ) is defined as the radius of the spherical geometry,
    which means the uniform power density in free space. The received power at the
    specified destination in the NLOS scenario is expressed as [126], P j r = P i
    t η i t η r j h NLOS ij χ( ψ j i ) h pl ij (c(λ), x+ x 0 cos( ϕ j i ) ). (9) View
    Source B. The Necessities and Advantages of UVLC UVLC has become a potential wireless
    candidate (transmission standard IEEE 802.15.7) for signal transmission in an
    underwater environment without any interference as in RF signaling. There are
    plenty of benefits to deploying VLC over traditional acoustic waves as very cost-effective,
    easy to install, high data transmission 3Gbit/s, real-time monitoring [105], and
    the collection of bathymetric data [127]. Under consideration of UVLC the blue-green
    colored optical wavelengths have been chosen for no-radiation and non-harmful
    for underwater species [128]. Numerous applications are deployed underwater where
    channel conditions emerge with a high-power LED-based VLC system. For real-time
    communication scenarios the underwater sensor network nodes (UWSNs) are connected
    with visible light sources and further communicate with the base station (BS)
    [129]. The sensors positioning system and localization in the UVLC system have
    been drawn attention in the literature in supporting and improving the system
    capacity and efficiency. For instance in the initial stage of VLC, it was deployed
    intensively in mining sectors and further used as a wireless candidate in underground
    areas [130]. The electromagnetic waves as VLC counterparts, are absorbed and effortlessly
    attenuated by underground channels. Therefore, the evolution of VLC technology
    to bridge the gap in such complex applications as mining sectors, tunnel operations,
    and underwater communication. Due to this, most organizations are seeking further
    developments in the VLC communication systems. It turns the clock back as Disney
    Research had developed an in-light lightning system for their theme parks [131].
    Huawei just recently signed an agreement with a German company Schnell Li-Fi to
    build optical hospitals that make the hospitals smarter and remotely operation
    could be possible through the wireless connected medical equipment [132]. These
    applications will support safer operations because visible light is free of interference
    compared to electromagnetic carriers. Another key driver is that the VLC (enabled
    LEDs) can deploy and make the oceans smarter, supporting an urgent need for efficient
    and highly secure communication. The micro-LEDs are being used for high data transmission
    in VLC systems. However, LEDs are tiny in size, and transmission power is relatively
    low compared to the laser. At a glance, lasers are not associated with the efficiency
    Doppler effect, which means they can reach higher power and higher power density
    even a very tiny device. Also, the laser operation in the stimulated emission
    regime has a much higher modulation bandwidth compared with LEDs. The requirement
    is to move from LED to laser source because lasers have more advantages over LEDs.
    A recently developed narrow bandwidth blue lasers-based distributed feedback laser
    (DFB) wave-guide structure has been proposed [133]. The DFB laser structure with
    III-layer nitride is still under development. An experimented wave-guide structure
    builds a high-speed DFB blue laser with enormous potential for future speed Li-Fi
    applications. C. The Characterization of Oceanic Layers Generally, the deep oceans
    are categorized into three distinct zones for optical signaling, i.e., Euphotic,
    Disphotic, and Aphotic zones widely known as sunlight zone, twilight zone, and
    midnight zone, respectively, depicted in Fig.5. The range of the visible light
    signal, living organisms, and the variation of pressure concerning the depth is
    also summarized in Fig.5. Euphotic zone: The sunlight zone is the top layer of
    the water surface; enough amount of sunlight penetrates this zone. The green algae
    can survive due to the primary source of sunlight, and photosynthesis happens
    [134]. Moreover, the living creatures can be found in this zone [135]. The typical
    depth of this zone depends on water quality, such as the clarity or murkiness
    of the water. The depth of this zone varies in different in water types of waters.
    Euphotic zone can be quite deep up to hundreds of meters while it can be 15m meters
    in coastal ocean water in vertical column [5], [136]. Generally, the depth of
    the sunlight zone is approximated up to 200m from the water level. In this zone,
    the temperature fluctuates approximately 28 0 C to freezing point − 2 0 C [137].
    Twilight Zone: The twilight zone is formally known as the Disphotic zone, which
    is beneath the Euphotic zone. The expected depth of this zone varies from 200m
    to typically 1km in the ocean [138]. At this level, a small amount of light visualize
    and rarely the algae alive in this zone. The very dim light falls and the dim
    blue light could penetrate this zone. There is not sufficient light to sustain
    the photosynthesis process in the disphotic zone. Some adaptable creatures can
    be found in the Twilight zone. The pressure increases and the temperature falls
    due to increasing depth. Mid-Night zone: A vast portion of the ocean belongs to
    this layer, known as the Aphotic zone. Approximately 90% of the ocean consists
    in the Midnight zone. It is entirely dark; there is no light extent this massive
    unguided water sector. The water pressure extremely low and below the freezing
    point. The depth of the midnight zone varies more than 1000m to 11km where is
    no light has taken place. The temperature fluctuates far from a chilling temperature
    of 40C to −150C or below. Rarely or more specific living organisms and creatures
    can be found in this zone [139]. D. Different Water Types, Challenges & Affecting
    Factors in UVLC Systems Considering the channel conditions which affect optical
    signal propagation, the water has been categorized into different categories.
    According to [10], the three main types of waters exist and are classified for
    optical signaling as clearest water, intermediate water, and murkiest water. The
    geographical location of the clearest ocean water is located in the Mid-Pacific
    and Atlantic oceans, whereas intermediate water is possibly found in the Northern
    Pacific ocean. The North Sea and Eastern Atlantic oceans are the major water reservoirs
    of the murkiest water. Furthermore, another classification is commonly discussed
    in the open literature, which has been sub-divided into four distinctive categories:
    i) Pure seawater, ii) Clear ocean water, iii) Coastal ocean water, and finally,
    iv) Turbid harbor & estuary water. The light beam attenuates in these water differently.
    As in pure seawater the optical signals absorb because of the chemical composition,
    while the scattering loss occurs widely in clear ocean water due to its higher
    concentration of particles than pure seawater. A higher amount of particle concentration
    is founded in coastal ocean water rather than clear ocean water, which causes
    a higher rate of scattering and absorption of the light beam. Moreover, turbid
    harbor and estuary water has the highest concentration of particles. The deployment
    of UWOC is more challenging as per channel condition requirements. The channel
    properties vary with distinct water types and geographical conditions [10]. Additionally,
    another classification while the propagation of light beam based on the environmental,
    geographical conditions, and the chemical vitality of the water is categorized.
    The subcategories are called as IOPs, and AOPs [140]. The IOPs are only medium
    dependents on existing substances and the composition of the medium [140], while
    AOPs depend on both the mediums and nature of the light beam. The AOPs are used
    to evaluate the ambient light levels for communication near the water surface.
    AOPs contribute radiance, irradiance, and reluctance. In more contrast, the spectral
    absorptive coefficient and volume scattering function are the two main factors
    that are considered in IOPs [141]. The transmission of the light beam experiences
    the absorption of photons by water and further converts them into another form
    of energy to increase the temperature of water molecules. In absorption phenomena
    the signal path-loss occurs where the beam intensity does weaken and the propagated
    photons absorb by the channel. The absorption occurs by chlorophyll in phytoplankton
    at colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM), by water molecules and existing salt
    contents [140]. Moreover, the CDOM matters are the combinations of the two components
    known as fulvic and humic acid as mentioned in [142]. In more detail, the absorption
    and scattering phenomena in different waters have been discussed in further subsections.
    The absorption effect is calculated in terms of wavelength and represented by
    α(λ) . Though, scattering is defined as the randomness of photons with the direction
    of beam propagation. The optical signal scattering phenomena occur by the vitality
    of salt ions in pure water and collimated with particle matters. The scattering
    coefficient measurement per meter is denoted by β(λ) . Due to scattering and absorption,
    the energy of the optical beam falls and occurs the overall attenuation. The typical
    values of α(λ) , β(λ) , and extinction coefficients c(λ) in different water mediums
    are summarized in Table 5. Absorption & Scattering Phenomenon in UWC:- Signal
    scattering in UVLC is the function that changes signal path, direction, and distance
    covered by photons in the underwater medium. The energy loss of optical beam by
    water (interaction between photon and water molecules) cause absorption, while
    the collision happens with suspended particles in UWOC. The optical signal absorption
    is an irreversible process where the photons lose their energy and improve the
    water temperature of water molecules. In more detail, if the photons strike with
    suspended particles and change their direction of propagation, scattering happens.
    The total energy loss of propagated optical beam due to absorption and scattering
    can be defined as the energy loss per meter. In addition to that an another cause
    of energy loss is inter-symbol interference (ISI), where the receiver aperture
    captures fewer incoming photons on its cross-sectional area. The extinction coefficient
    (summation absorption and scattering) is the signal loss phenomenon and directly
    affects the signal intensity and changes the direction of an optical beam. Concerning
    the physio-chemical properties of the channel and the geometrical model of absorption
    and scattering coefficient are proposed in [5] and [13]. Due to the harsh water
    channel conditions, the best way to understand the signal attenuation mechanism
    through a geometrical model of a water element is depicted by Fig.6. The optical
    beam energy is either absorbed by dangle particles or is transformed into heat
    energy, or raises water molecules thermal energy. Therefore, signal absorption
    affects signal strength, while the scattering phenomenon occurs the spreading
    photons randomly and strikes with the suspended particle. As a result, signals
    are partially received by detecting aperture or delayed to reach the destination.
    Thus, multi-path fading, time-jitter, and ISI occur in UWOC. To reduce ISI, the
    optimal multiple-symbol detection (MSD), as well as sub-optimal generalized MSD
    (GMSD) algorithms, are further investigated as in [105]. TABLE 5 The Typical Values
    of the Contribution Underwater Absorption, Scattering, and Extinction Coefficients.
    The Data is Applicable for Different Waters Mediums [5], [82] The recent surveys
    are detailed severe attenuation in optical signaling in harsh water cause absorption
    and scattering. Absorption and scattering are the two phenomenons responsible
    for signal fading caused by the suspended particles, the quality, and nature of
    water, dissolved organic matters affecting the signal strength, phase, and arrival
    angle of the received beam. The blue-green wavelength spectrum of visible light
    severs the minimum amount of absorption in pure seawater rather than coastal and
    turbid harbor water [143]. Moreover, light scattering is the cause of organic
    and inorganic matters due to the strong spatial and temporal dispersion of photons,
    which may affect photon strength and intensity [144]. E. Affecting Factors in
    UVLC Signaling In the UWOC system, the absorption and scattering effects light
    pulses by existing suspended particles leading to photons path loss and intensity
    deviation. Both of these signal fading factors are wavelength-dependent per meter
    of signal propagation distances. Generally, these factors occur due to the interaction
    of the light beam with micro and macromolecules of water, algal sediments, and
    color division organic materials. In general, the organic particles are responsible
    for absorbing photons while inorganic particles are creditworthy for scattering
    [143]. Further, the CDOM strongly absorbs the light photons in the ultra-violate
    (UV) spectrum [144]. The total signal fading contribution by absorption α(λ) and
    scattering β(λ) of optical beam energy loss describes in terms of extinction coefficient
    c(λ) known as signal attenuation as c(λ)=α(λ)+β(λ) . The extinction coefficient
    depends on the different water types. To formulate the expression for absorption
    and scattering, an elemental unit volume of water δ(V) with thickness δ(r) is
    considered and depicted by Fig.6. If the intensity of incident light-beam is denoted
    by P i (λ) with fixed wavelength λ collides with unitary elemental water volume.
    The incident beam is passing through the elemental volume and experiences absorption
    & scattering. The outcome beam is split into three fractions; as a certain amount
    of power, an incident beams P a (λ) absorbed and some extent of incident power
    P si (λ) will scatter at an angle ψ i . The remaining apparent beam P ri (λ) passed
    through the element and detected by receiver. Thus, the energy conservation law
    and total incident power is calculated as the addition of all above fractions,
    i.e., P i (λ)= P a (λ)+ P si (λ)+ P ri (λ) . Furthermore, the absorbed signal
    power ratio A(λ) and B(λ) scattered signal power ratio are defined as, A(λ)≡ P
    a (λ) P i (λ)  and  B(λ)≡ P s (λ) P i (λ) . (10) View Source In (10), the absorption
    and scattering ratios with the radius δr of an elemental water volume are infinitesimally
    small. Then taking the limits by an elemental water volume, the absorption and
    scattering coefficients can be written as [117], α(λ)= β(λ)= lim δ(r)→0 [δA(λ)/δ(r)]=dA(λ)/dr,
    lim δ(r)→0 [δB(λ)/δ(r)]=dB(λ)/dr, (11) (12) View Source Apart from the absorption
    and scattering, the seawater acts as a conductor medium for electromagnetic waves
    and offers dielectric properties for optical signaling [9]. In more precise terms,
    the seawater dramatically serves conductivity to dielectric at 250GHz frequency
    range [10]. However, underwater optical signals experience several extreme challenges
    and might be affected by fluctuation of scintillation index, scattering, absorption,
    dispersion, and temperature fluctuation due to the physio-chemical properties
    of the channel. Optical waves do not propagate simultaneously in water such as
    on a terrestrial basis, but accelerate exponentially in the water medium due to
    attenuation. The attenuation is the total contribution of signal fading, absorption,
    and scattering. In UWOC, scattering losses occur cause of discontinuity of the
    water molecules, while absorption occurs by the physical properties of channel
    conditions. In coastal ocean water, the optical signals are extremely corrupted
    by noise and path loss due to more scattering; the scattering event happens by
    the collision of the optical beam with the existing suspended particles and multiple
    reflections of angles [145]. The phenomena of absorption in UOWC have to be firmly
    taken into account cause several photons could reach the photo-detector or receiver
    end by passing harsh channel conditions. Absorption is a high wavelength-dependent
    process where the transmitted photons are absorbed and converted into chemical
    or heat energy of the water. For instance, in [142] the authors have modeled absorption
    coefficient under consideration of absorptivity by pure seawater in terms of chlorophyll
    as a function of wavelength. The absorption by chlorophyll is defined as the change
    in light beam intensity per meter of path length. The total contribution of absorption
    is the chlorophyll and the color dissolved organic components (CDOMs) i.e., [146]–[148]
    α(λ)= α w (λ)+ α cl (λ)+ α f (λ)+ α h (λ). (13) View Source In (13), the absorption
    coefficient of water, chlorophyll absorption coefficient are represented by α
    w (λ) and α cl (λ) . Moreover, the two CDOM components fulvic acid absorption
    coefficient α f (λ) , and humic acid absorption coefficient α h (λ) are defined,
    respectively. The individual absorption and scattering components for different
    water mediums are calculated in (14) and (15) to model. As a result, we consider
    transmitting the blue-colored spectrum wavelength (450nm) of visible light. The
    absorption coefficient by water types with respect to water concentration of ranges
    0≤ w c ≤15 mg/ m 3 , is calculated as follows, α w (λ)= α 0 w (λ) [ w c w 0 c
    ] a 0 w , (14) View Source where w 0 c =1mg/ m 3 is the reference water concentration.
    For the different types of water the a 0 w (λ) differentiate accordingly [142].
    The water concentration for different water types such as for pure sea water,
    clear ocean water, coastal ocean water and turbid harbor water varies 0.0405λ
    , 0.114λ , 0.179λ and 0.266λ , respectively. According to [145], the absorption
    component due to chlorophyll a cl (λ) with respect to the chlorophyll concentration
    C 0 c varies 0≤ C c ≤12mg/ m 3 , and can be written as, α cl (λ)= α 0 c (λ) [
    C c C 0 c ] 0.0602 , (15) View Source where the reference concentration of chlorophyll
    C 0 c =1mg/ m 3 , and α 0 c is equalized to 0.0602λ . Furthermore considering
    the CDOM components as, fulvic and humic acid absorption coefficients also formulated
    with respect to the chlorophyll concentration [146], α f (λ)= α h (λ)= α 0 f C
    f exp(− k f λ), α 0 h C h exp(− k h λ), (16) (17) View Source where the specific
    absorption coefficient for fulvic and humic acid component are a 0 f and a 0 h
    respectively. The concentrations of fulvic acid C f and humic acid C h in mg/
    m 3 can be expressed as follows [147], C f = C h = 1.74098 C c exp[0.12317( C
    c C 0 c )], 0.193348 C c exp[0.12343( C c C 0 c )]. (18) (19) View Source Due
    to suspended large and small scale particles underwater, the scattering phenomena
    occurs. The scattering coefficient β(λ) defines the total signal loss due to the
    redirection of the photons. In contrast, the total scattering is the sum of scattering
    coefficient of water β w (λ) , small particles β s (λ) , and large particle β
    l (λ) , respectively. The scattering function is wavelength and concentration-dependent.
    Therefore, total scattering can be calculated as [142], [146]–[148], β(λ)= β w
    (λ)+ β s (λ) C s + β l (λ) C l , (20) View Source where the small scale concentration
    C s and C l the concentration of large scale in g/ m 3 can be calculated as [145]
    C s = C l = 0.01739 C c exp[0.11631( C c C 0 c )]g/ m 3 , 0.76284 C c exp[0.03092(
    C c C 0 c )]g/ m 3 . (21) (22) View Source Another noticeable optical property
    concerning signal scattering is known as albedo scattering, which is the ratio
    of scattering signal loss to the total signal losses [144]. The albedo scattering
    number is formed as, ω 0 = (Scattering signals β(λ) )/(Total signal scattering
    c(λ) ). The albedo number shows a significant scale factor to measure absorptivity
    or scattering of water medium, which varies from 0.25 to 0.8 for clear ocean water
    to turbid coastal water. The scattering phenomenon is stated as the detected optical
    information in terms of angular, temporal, and polarization which causes the degradation
    in the number of photons at the receiver end. The cause of suspended CDOM and
    inorganic particles, the scattering coefficient may be termed as the function
    of the volumetric scattering function β v (VSF) over total angles (θ) as follows
    [149], β(λ)=2π ∫ π 0 β vsf (λ;θ)sin(θ)dθ. (23) View Source Moreover, the VSF is
    prescribed the normalization of β(λ) by the scattering phase function. Therefore,
    the spectral VSF coefficient β ¯ v (θ,λ ) is defined as follows, β ¯ v (θ,λ)=
    β v (λ,θ) β . (24) View Source Simultaneously, the optical beam propagated through
    the water channel and lost some fraction of its propagation energy in interaction
    with water molecules, number of biological substances, CDOM, etc. The are two
    signal-affecting mechanisms widely considered as absorption and scattering. The
    optical signals are severely affected by the channel turbidity due to the random
    fluctuation of the refraction index. F. Turbulence Turbulence is another cause
    of optical signal fading resulting from the random fluctuation in the refractive
    index. Plenty of valuable experimental results have recently been recorded in
    the open literature on characterizing underwater optical turbulence (UOT). In
    other words, turbidity is described as the varying changes in refractive index
    due to fluctuation of density, salinity, and pressure of underwater environment
    that affects optical signal propagation. It means the random variation in scintillation
    index induced turbidity in the channel environment. The consistency of oceanic
    turbulence occurs by wave current, physio-chemical properties of water, large,
    and small suspended particles. The wave currents are defined as weak to strong
    turbulence conditions based on Reynolds number. If Reynolds number ρ≤1000 , then
    water flow is considered laminar or steady flow, with the minimal fluctuation
    in scintillation index. Whether, if it is 1000 ≤ρ≤2000 , then the flow has shown
    uncertainty, which means weak turbulence channel conditions. In the case where
    Reynolds number 2000≤ρ exceeds 4000, then it is considered as heavy turbulence
    channel conditions. G. Affect of Noise in UWOC Noise is the factor that corrupts
    the signals, which directly affects the signal efficiency during communication.
    In UWOC, the noise occurs due to the reception of a random variation of photons
    propagation by transceivers. Different background noise sources are widely studied,
    such as quantum shot noise, optical-excess noise, optical background noise, photo-detector
    dark current noise, diffused extended background noise, background noise from
    sunlight, or other objects in the optical communication systems received at the
    receiver end. There are different types of noises in UWOC are recorded in existing
    literature [4], [5], [9], [150]. Optical Excess Noise: The communication setup
    should be more accurate and reliable for information transmission purposes. However,
    some irregularities or faults in the experimental setup causes falling transmission
    accuracy. Due to inaccuracy of the transceivers noise occurrence, the glitches
    happen and corrupt the received signals defined as excess optical noise. Background
    Noise: In contrast to this noise, background noise is considered black-body radiation;
    the refracted sunlight is responsible as the main source of background noise.
    This type of noise majorly interfered by the sunlight, limiting the optical system
    performance for tens of meters (mostly in the Euphotic zone). The noise contribution
    of total background environment in the literature is recorded as in [4], [5],
    [9], and [150]. The total background noise power in optical signal propagation
    is defined as follows [150], P BG = P B G sol + P B G black−body . (25) View Source
    For channel modeling, the background noise variance σ 2 BG =2qR P BG B , depends
    on electronic signal bandwidth B , power of solar background P B G sol , and electron
    charge q , respectively. Furthermore, P B G sol is expressed as, P B G sol = A
    R (πFOV ) 2 δλ T F L sol . (26) View Source In (26), the receiver aperture area,
    the optical filter transmissivity is presented by A R , and T F , respectively.
    However, the solar radiance also depends on down-welling irradiance E , underwater
    reflectance of down-welling irradiance R , the directional dependence of underwater
    radiance L f , diffuse attenuation coefficient K , and the underwater depth d
    . Therefore, the solar radiance L sol is expressed by (27) as follows, L sol =
    ER L f exp(−Kd) π . (27) View Source Furthermore, the noise power of a black-body
    irradiance expressed as P BG = 2h c 2 γ A R (πFOV ) 2 δλ T A T F (λ ) 5 [ e (hc/λkT)
    −1] , (28) View Source where c , h , k , and γ are described as the speed of light,
    the Plank constant, the Boltzmann constant and the radiant factor. Moreover, the
    signal transmission factor in underwater is defined as T A =exp(− τ 0 ) . Photo-Detector
    Dark Current Noise: The dark current noise is described and related to the photo-diode
    [35]. This type of noise occurs due to electrical current leakage from the photodetector.
    The variance of the dark current noise can be defined by (29), which is the function
    of electron charge q , the DC intensity I DC , and electronic bandwidth [150],
    σ 2 DC =2q I DC B. (29) View Source Current Shot Noise: This type of noise is
    generated while receiving the signals at the receiver end. If the signal power
    symbolized by P s , then the shot noise variance can be written as [10], σ 2 ss
    =2qr P s B. (30) View Source Thermal Noise: The random motion of electrons generates
    noise within the conductor medium due to a temperature rise. To model the thermal
    noise, if it considers The noise figure parameters F=4 , load resistance R l =100Ω
    , and equivalent temperature T e =290K are taken, then thermal noise variance
    given as [10], [150] σ 2 TH = 4k T e FB R l . (31) View Source In the UWOC system
    model, the sum of total noise variances is responsible for the system noise. Therefore,
    without any interference of optical signal, the noise variances of electrical
    current at the detector end is given as, σ 2 I = σ 2 TH + σ 2 DC + σ 2 BG + σ
    2 ss . (32) View Source SECTION IV. Transceivers for UVLC A. Transmitter and Transducer
    The function of optical transducers is to transform the modulated information
    into an optical or electrical or vice-versa signal pattern. The transducers are
    mounted on transceivers and fixed on a well-defined path for smooth signal propagation
    in an underwater medium. In another words, the transducers are designed to generate
    an optical signal from an electrical signal made from optical transmitters during
    optical beam propagation. On the other hand, an actuator can be used in UWOC [9]
    to generate the pulse of optical signal in electrical format at the receiver end.
    With the rapidly increasing interest in exploring aquatic media, UWOC plays a
    vital role in realizing a wide range of scientific, commercial, and coastal security
    applications. VLC is an alternative communication media as a UWOC implementation
    in the range of LEDs illuminating light sources. In UVLC, the transmitter transforms
    digital information into analog format over channel conditions. Generally, LEDs
    and LDs are used for signal transmission over high data rates and bandwidth. Another
    adhesive advantage is LED structure, where the photons are emitted spontaneously
    at different phases. In coherent radiation, the photons are stimulate by another
    photon that is radiated with phase correlation [151]. More precisely, LEDs excel
    as incandescent reliable light sources, power consumption devices, and efficient
    luminous tools. The LEDs efficiency operate 210 m/W more than the incandescent
    lamps efficiency [45]. The multi-functional transmitter-enabled LEDs emit light
    and information simultaneously with the optical dimming power this is most widely
    used; for efficient signal propagation while the optical transmitters do not use
    flickering phenomena. In a general aspect, the LEDs are designed for white-light
    emission sources and divided into two categories: blue and red-green-blue (RGB)
    emitting types of LEDs. Both types of LEDs emit different colors of light, as
    yellow-white light causes phosphorus polishing. Blue LEDs are considered more
    energy-efficient and widely use for light illuminating systems rather than blue
    LEDs. The blue-LEDs could achieve reliability for optical signal transmission
    by combining yellow color (RGBY). In optical beam propagation, the VLC link depends
    on the dimming or switching nature of LEDs. The optical sources are categorized
    as laser transmitter type or an LED type optical transmitter. Consequently, the
    laser type of technological sources quiet different and are used according to
    the application requirement. An argon-ion laser is a well-known laser transmitter
    suitable for converting electrical signals into an optical format [10]. A transducer
    assists in converting and then transmitting all maximum quantities of photons
    toward the receiver or other nodes. For optical signal modulation, different types
    of laser modulators are being used. In general, the laser modulator is designed
    for low data rates over long-distance signal propagation, [9]. Compared to laser
    modulators, LEDs are cheaper though they cover very short ranges. The arrangement
    of an LED array is designed in a hexagonal type pyramidal shape for high-intensity
    and long-distance optical beam propagation, as proposed in [148]. In this type
    of pyramidal LED array structure, a single lens is used to illuminate the LED.
    This structure must be very compact for the output signals. For the sake of a
    signal, the direction can be created by switching an intense beam towards the
    destination. B. Optical Receiver Optical receivers are the collection arrangements
    of all-optical signal transmission within a medium. In other words, receivers
    could be defined as the process of optical signal entities absorbed by the photodetector
    and the photons detection on its surface to generate an electrical signal called
    an optical receiver. The conversion process of photons energy into an electrical
    signal is performed through photoelectric effect. Otherwise stated, the received
    photons at the semiconductor junction diodes release either an electron or a hole.
    Subsequently, these released entities moved to the conductance and release their
    excessive energies [21]. The propagated optics are collected by a lens for the
    detection and demodulation process at the receiver end. A photo-sensor is used
    to convert optical signals for further analysis. Taking into account improving
    system performance, a photo-sensor is characterized as easily accessible, very
    cost-effective, robust, and small in size, along with the low current consumption
    [152]. To cope with these advantages, plenty of different types of photo-sensors
    are being used and summarized in recent surveys as [9], [152]. These photo-sensors
    are photo-resistors, phototransistors, photomultiplier tubes, avalanche photodiode
    (APD), p-n photodiodes, and a photon detector semiconductor, photo-sensors, and
    biologically-inspired quantum photo-sensors (BQP). PIN and avalanche photodiode
    (APD) are widely used as a photodetectors in optical communication [153]. SECTION
    V. Current Project Schemes on UVLC In this section, we provide the details of
    the most recent current project in underwater medium currently running worldwide.
    A wide detailed description are summarized in Table 6. Most recently, UNEXMIN
    project scheme [154] was launched and funded by the European Commission (EU) for
    3D mapping and more widely autonomous exploration of European flooded mines (AUEFM)
    during the period of 2016 – 2019. The main purpose of this project scheme was
    to develop a novel underwater robotic system for bathymetric, oceanographic, oceanic
    bathyscaphical data collection, and ocean exploration in 3D geographical imaging
    in real-time monitoring and video streaming. The Robotics Explorer is made by
    three robots named UX-1a, UX-1b, and UX-1c to adjoining for the purpose of valuable
    geological and mineralogical information collection. UX-1 is the first prototype
    was proposed to open the new technological lines and uncover mysterious challenges
    in this research project development. The first prototype was finished in April
    2018 and has been tested at the Kaatiala mine (Finnland), Idrija mine (Slovenia),
    during 2018, and later in Urgeirca mine (Portugal), Ecton mine (England), Molnar
    Janos cave (Hungary) during 2019. The Surf3DSLAM project [155] was coordinated
    by the University de Girona, Spain, and proposed an innovative research proposal
    for Probabilistic 3D Surface Matching for Bathymetry based Simultaneous Localization
    and Mapping (Surf3DSLAM) by deploying aquatic vehicles. The main challenges of
    this research project were navigation and detection of the exact position of the
    underwater vehicles. Further development of this project scheme proposed a remotely
    operated underwater vehicle (ROV) instead of AUV that supports low operational
    cost. The main objective of Surf3DSLAM was to accurately localize the ROVs and
    AUVs in 3D environmental space under the concept of simultaneous localization
    and mapping (SLAM). To associate SLAM within the 3D environment, the whole investigation
    was addressed as Surf3DSLAM. Surf3DSLAM framework mainly aimed to deploy AUVs
    for navigation purposes, replace other economical, efficient robotics vehicles,
    and further deploy for safe and precise surveys in an unguided aqueous environment.
    Most recently underwater activities are unveiling the mystery of occupied water
    territories and exploring natural mineral sources. Due to this, project scheme
    as Submarine Cultures Perform Long-Term Robotic Exploration of Unconventional
    Environmental (subCULTron) [156] was proposed and coordinated by the University
    Graz, Austria. This project was launched and aimed to achieve a long-lasting self-determination
    learning device, a self-configurable, self-maintainable underwater robotic tool
    in very high-impact-modified application areas in Italy. The main perspectives
    of this project are to develop a better quality of communication and energy harvesting
    among the underwater sensor nodes. The subCULTron is subdivided into few sections
    as the entitled project. The upper layer of sea surface in the proposed system,
    and the artificial objectives are introduced as the information collective robotic
    tools for long-run system exploration capabilities. The artificial robotic tool
    allows monitoring the marine environment, and the incredible natural oceanic environments,
    including biological materials such as algae, bacterium, and aquatic species.
    In contrast through subCULTron, a deployed artificial lily-pad on water surface
    communicates with human-culture and transmit energy along with the collected information
    from ship traffic. Apart from that, the artificial fish floats and exchanges information
    with mussels and lily-pad. The subCULTron is aimed to propose the real world for
    humans and animals in cohabitants of high impact such as venice canals and lagoon.
    Thus, the cultural evolution promotes a sub-culture development and an artificial
    society underwater along with the cultural services of human society over the
    water reservoir. The TRIDENT project scheme [157] formally known as Marine Robots,
    and Dexterous Manipulation for Enabling Autonomous Underwater Multipurpose Intervention
    Missions (MRDME-AUMIM) was proposed for multipurpose underwater challenges in
    highly turbid and complexity channel conditions. In other words, the development
    of novel methodology for marine robotics systems accommodates versatile dexterous
    adaption and the capabilities for operational activities in unguided underwater
    environments. This project scheme also has drawn attention to various specific
    skills in marine environments: navigation, bathymetric data, geographical mapping,
    vehicle-manipulator systems, dexterous manipulation, and the development of a
    wide range of intelligent control UWSNs architectural techniques. The project
    has been classified into two phases. In its first phase, the autonomous surface
    craft (ASC) is carried AUV towards the sector to be surveyed, while in the second
    phase, the assembly of ASC and AUV navigate the underwater targeted position.
    The latest project scheme [158] entitled Smart and Networking Under Water Robots
    in Cooperation Meshes (SWARMs) was funded by the EU and also coordinated by Universidad
    Politechnica de Madrid, succeeded to forward the extensive research of AUVs/ROVs
    to the next level. The further development of AUVs/ROVs research provides a solution
    to the threat of offshore industries. SWARM project aimed to expand a better utilization
    of robotics in underwater, various marine applications and offshore operations,
    which affects the assigned safety patterns and operational costs. The main attraction
    of the project research is to improve AUVs’ autonomy and enhance the usability
    of ROVs in the underwater environment. Moreover, no specialized underwater vehicles
    are required; instead of AUVs/ROVs work in a cooperative network; as a result,
    it opens the doors for new futuristic underwater applications. At a glance, the
    achievements of SWARM could be demonstrated in several testing sites and numerous
    applications such as inspection and water pollution monitoring. Oceans and seas
    are the source of life on earth and the most significant water source for humankind.
    Nevertheless, these water reservoirs are affected by human interactive activities.
    Therefore, exploring these massive water mediums are necessary by deploying artificial
    devices or robots, called marine robots. In general, the vitality of marine robotics
    technology is an enormous significance in an extensive range of functional underwater
    applications. These applications are mostly utilized to observe and monitor purpose
    and the life beneath the water surface, observation of water pollution, oil and
    gas rig observations, surveillance and coastal securities, fish farming, and early
    detection warning of natural disasters. Given this, an innovation of the project
    scheme Sibiu-HCEV [159], is introduced as the resolution of an intelligent hybrid
    high capacity electric underwater ROVs. The Sibiu-HCEV is an underwater floatable
    robot at different depths in an unguided water environment that is an innovative
    invention in underwater robotics technology to reduce risk to the capital expenditure
    (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX). Marine robotics industries are rapidly
    growing up to uncover the complexity of harsh oceanic environments. The marine
    robots have pulled back the curtains of the mysterious thesaurus of the deepest
    oceans. This underwater robotics industrial sector is a crucial, significantly
    cost-effective domain with considerable entry barriers to resources and developments.
    The project EUMarineRobots [160] is aimed to extend the underwater challenges
    into more depth, remotely operations, and in the very hostile marine environment.
    Additionally, the aim of EUMarineRobots are deploying for a full range of air
    and open international access to Europe. EUMarineRobots has an impressive research
    group from ten countries in marine robotics research infrastructure network. This
    network distinguishes the various technical infrastructures for diverse navigation
    beyond marine and in the marine robotic sectors. Since the early ages, underwater
    applications are based on acoustic links for long range communications. However,
    RF and optical waves are capable of supporting large bandwidth and high data rates
    but efficiently attenuated due to the physio-chemical vitality of the marine environment.
    The primary objectives of the project were recently proposed as UNDERWORLD [161]
    to re-evaluate the electromagnetic communication through UWSNs deployment for
    various underwater applications such as navigation, localization, natural disaster,
    detection of coral reefs, and coastal security purposes in real-time scenarios.
    This project aims to enhance industrialization in marine observatory systems,
    naval tactical operations, seaport management infrastructures, and underwater
    environmental monitoring. Moreover, underwater environmental monitoring in an
    aqueous medium is widely deployed with acoustic waves, but these applications
    apply in shallow waters such as rivers, dams, lakes, and remotely coastal areas.
    Throughout this project scheme. Another main contribution of this project is to
    improve the characteristics of antennas for two ways of communication among transceivers.
    Earthquakes, Tsunami, and floods are sudden natural events which occur due to
    an imbalance of water reservoirs and waves (water currents). These events are
    entirely impossible to control or prevent but can be detected earlier by deploying
    the sensors nodes or anchored architecture of UWSNs with the sea bottoms. The
    seismometers are used to sense the unacceptable seismic frequency at a standardized
    scale. These seismometers are highly detectable sensor nodes those capable for
    detecting and recording waves emitted by the most miniature earthquakes. It is
    far expensive to deploy seismometers at the ocean bottom to investigate water
    currents and seismic waves detection. Due to these issues, the novel project scheme
    funded by the EU entitled Ocean-DAS had recently proposed new tools for underwater
    seismology through ocean-bottom distributed acoustic sensors [162]. The main aim
    of Ocean-DAS is to develop a low-cost deployable alternatives for monitoring seismicity
    in remote areas of the oceans. The Ocean-DAS are enabled with the fiber optical
    wires for telecommunication which transforms the data into powerful seismic sensing
    arrays. Through the support of this opto-electronic unit, more than a 50km span
    could be monitored. The most recent project scheme is proposed entitled as Cooperative
    Underwater Surveillance Networks (COUSIN) funded by Engineering and Physical Sciences
    Research Council (EPSRC) [163] during 2021s to 2023s. The project scheme focuses
    on the underwater surveillance system for a specific country or region. The surveillance
    system is investigated for more precise benefits in various underwater applications
    in numerous fields such as pollution monitoring, coastal or harbor securities,
    import and export duties, human trafficking, smuggling, maintaining integrity,
    and detecting attacks on underwater infrastructure. The main expected contribution
    of this project scheme is to track, target and search for suspicious objects,
    and convey information to the base station for further investigation. The detectable
    target through this project scheme could be an artificial object such as UUV,
    surface vehicle, submarine, source of pollution, underwater species, active volcanos,
    oil & gas pipeline repaitment, ice objects, or divers, etc. Furthermore, surveillance
    and underwater monitoring are the main functions through the long-range acoustic
    link. For underwater geographical mapping and target detection, the SONAR waves
    are the key beneficial technologies while over the sea-surface detection, radio
    detection and ranging (RADAR) are the most widely used. The main objective of
    COUSIN is to design a low-cost underwater acoustic network to improve the underwater
    monitoring and surveillance system capabilities. The current ongoing project scheme
    entitled Technologies for Ocean Sensing (TechOceanS) [164] funded by the European
    Commission (EC) and coordinated by the National Oceanography Center, UK. TechOceanS
    is organized by the research group of ten universities in Europe. The oceans are
    affected by human beings by flushing and trashing unwanted decomposable materials
    such as plastics that are threatening to harm underwater species. Due to human
    activities direct and indirect involvement in the underwater environment, the
    ice caps melt, and the water level rises. Therefore, an urgent need to deploy
    an advanced ocean observational technology through resistance to extract the decompose
    plastic materials. At first glance, the project has developed the scheme to monitor
    and observe ocean biology, chemical composition changes, and plastic monitoring
    through underwater vehicles nine pioneering technologies. The proposed novel solution
    by TechnOceanS is comprised of a group of five sensors; the two sensors are used
    for imaging data collection of the specified seabed, marine biology, and plastics.
    A sampler is used to collect thousands of particle samples for further analysis
    and the rest of use for a new artificial intelligence (AI)- based image processing
    method for data compression and information transmission. The most recent proceeding
    project scheme established for Long Distance Underwater Wireless Optical Communication
    System using Visible Light Laser Array with Directivity Control Function (LD-UWC-VLC-LADCF)
    [165], and funded by Japan Society for the Promotion Science (JSPS). The purpose
    of this scheme is to improve the quality of visible light signaling over long
    ranges in the underwater environment. In this research perspective, the main two
    challenges are extending the transmission distance in gigabit-class with high-speed
    UWOC. The first point is the verification of the effect of distance extension
    while multiple visible light laser are propagated propagating in a high turbid
    water medium. Secondly, the construction of a light beam in a particular direction
    through evaluating the experimental data available. TABLE 6 The Latest Underwater

    the Future Directions and the Most Significant Contribution in the Scientific
    Community, Underwater Applications, and the Results of the Corresponding Project
    Schemes are Summarized SECTION VI. Computational Methods Nowadays, solving complex
    and huge data-based problems are typically possible without a real experimental
    setups. This is achieved through simulation-enabled computer science and engineering
    methodologies. Moreover, computational engineering methods support automaticity,
    design, and optimization of the complex problems. Therefore, the computational
    research methods provide the new advancements investigating the mythologies in
    computing such as algorithms, models, simulations, and system performances in
    order to understand the complexity of social, biological, technological, and everlasting
    patterns and their behaviors [166]. These computational research methodologies
    provide a solution for better understanding of random behavior of the system as
    follows: Automatically categorization and information extraction of the selected
    data-sets; Differentiate a bulk data into a specific group and particular level
    for the analysis; The system design and model of the emergence of new behaviors
    from individual-level interactions; A detailed explanation of emergence of a system
    network; Recognizes and refrigerates the thresholds within a complex system; Classifies
    and finds a the pattern within the massive data-sets for further analysis by using
    other techniques; Identify meaningful structural patterns within the webs of relationships.
    In more detail, computational engineering methodologies are defined as the development
    and exploitation of more realistic computational models. As a result, the computational
    engineering methodology opens new perspectives and challenges of more sophisticated
    key problems of huge data structures. Additionally, computational methodologies
    are numerically mathematical and depends heavily on computer architectural system.
    It means that the numerical efficiency should be achieved by extracting the maximum
    amount of correct information from the minimum number of grid points, as well
    as establishing a linear proportionality between the incoming time and the unknown
    number. Due to this, several computational approaches are studied in this study
    as follows. A. Monte-Carlo Computational Method The probabilistic format of the
    computational method is widely known as the Monte-Carlo simulation. In UWOC, this
    computational method is used to track the number of photons emitted by an optical
    source within the underwater medium. A high bandwidth underwater optical communication
    channel by utilizing Monte-Carlo simulation is widely discussed in [167]. The
    simulation approach of photons propagation is rigorous within turbid medium, in
    a more detailed description, Monte-Carlo simulation computational methods are
    used to provide the specific details of the propagated photons geometry as mentioned
    in [168] and [169]. Generally, the optical signals propagation depends on the
    medium waves. This is an alternative computational approach to eliminate the unbounded
    error growth in co-variance equation computationally as described in [170]. B.
    Numerical Modeling of Wave Propagation As aforementioned, that the optical beam
    spreads in an underwater medium and depends on the water flow (channel conditions).
    The different types of water flow have been categorized and summarized according
    to the flow pattern in [171]. Laminar flow is defined as where the fluid particles
    move along in a well-defined path and each water layer slides smoothly over the
    adjacent layer. While the turbulent flow is defined as the zig-zag flow pattern
    of water particles. The laminar flow changes into turbulent flow if the Reynold’s
    number is more than that 4000. The Reynold’s condition satisfies as laminar flow
    below 2000, otherwise turbulent flow [172]. Due to this, the optical beam propagation
    experiences a huge loss due to turbulence, signal absorption, and scattering by
    the suspended particles within the medium. Therefore, the necessity is to model
    the turbulence channel. Moreover, a numerical method for free surface flow that
    builds for nonlinear shallow water equation and utilizes a non-hydro-static pressure
    term to describe short waves are presented in [173]. C. Beer Lambert’s Law Computational
    methods are employed as the most significant solution for optical signaling in
    underwater mediums. An ordinary simulation method is widely employs for optical
    signaling in an aqueous medium known as Beer Lambert’s law. This law is described
    the optical signal attenuation due to the existence of suspended particles underwater.
    It is mathematically defined as the function of optical received signal power,
    the Euclidean distance apart from the transceivers, and the extinction coefficient
    of the medium. This type of channel model is used for optical signaling for any
    type of water availability, especially, for path loss fading. The mathematical
    expression of Beer Lambert’s law is shown below: P r (λ,d)= P t exp−c(λ)d, (33)
    View Source where P r and P t are denoted as the received and transmitted optical
    signal strength at the receiver and transmitter ends. Also, the extinction coefficient
    c(λ) is the sum of total optical signal absorption and scattering which are the
    optical wavelength dependents. The experimental values of extinction coefficient,
    for the readers references are widely discussed in [5], [82], [84], [86], and
    [174]. Additionally, due to transceivers physical parameters, geometrical losses
    are also considered for diffused LDs and semi-collimated light sources LEDs. Therefore,
    the modified Beer-Lambert law is the function of path loss ( h pl ) and geometrical
    losses ( h gl ) are given as [101], h l ≈ = h pl + h gl , ( D r θ F ) 2 d −2 t
    exp(−c ( D r θ F ) τ d 1−τ t ). (34) View Source The contributed channel condition
    coefficient h l in terms of path loss and geometrical losses are presented in
    (34). In (34), the receiver aperture diameter D r , full-width transmitter beam
    divergence angle θ F , and correction coefficient τ are defined. According to
    [101], the maximum achievable distance between communication nodes to obtain the
    BER performance of the vertically point-point system is given as follows, d= ⎡
    ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ W( c 2 (1−T))( D R θ 1/e ) ( 1 Q(BER) 2 σ 2 n P t r 2 η 2 − − − −
    − √ ) ( T−1 2 ) c 2 (1−T) ( D R θ 1/e ) T ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ 1 1−T . (35) View Source
    where W , Q , η , and T are defined as the Lambert-W function, error function,
    electrical to optical conversion efficiency, and correction coefficient. D. Radiative
    Transfer Differential Theory and Computational Method Radiative transfer theory
    (RTE) deals with computing derivatives of radiometric measures with respect to
    desired visual of geometrical parametrization, and facilitates the gradient-based
    optimization in various applications [175]. Additionally, the RTE is deployable
    in neutron transportation, astrophysics, and biomedical image analysis [175],
    [176]. Furthermore, the energy conservation-based radio transfer theory is used
    to model the optical waves in participating media. For better RTE understanding
    the assumptions are made, if considers the test volume V⊆ R 3 with the corresponding
    boundary ∂V , and the interior radiance field L(s,ω) is defined over the position
    s∈V/∂V , and light-transport directions ω∈ S 2 . Then, the RTE equation given
    as follows [175], L=( K T K C + K S )L+ L (0) , (36) View Source where, K T ,
    K C , and K S are denoted as the transport operator, collision operator, and interfacial
    scattering operator, respectively. Additionally, the Reynolds transport theorem
    is also an alternative method to solve computational problems. The Reynolds theorem
    for f scalar value function is defined for n -dimensional manifold ω parameterized
    with some π∈R as (37). If it is an assumption that Γ(π)⊂V(π) be an (n−1) dimensional
    manifold given by the union of the external boundary ∂V(π) and the internal one
    containing the discontinuous locations of f . Then, Reynold’s theorem could be
    specified as follows [177], ∂ π ( ∫ V(π) fdV(π)) = ∫ V(π) f ˙ dV(π)+ ∫ Γ(π) <n,
    x ˙ >Γ(π). (37) View Source Furthermore, f ˙ := ∂ π , x ˙ := ∂ π x , dV and dΓ
    denotes the standard measures associated with V and Γ0 ; Moreover <⋅,⋅> indicated
    the dot (inner product between two vectors.) Furthermore, n is the normal direction
    at each x∈Γ(π) . E. The Data Assimilation Algorithms for Numerical Models The
    data assimilation refers to the procedure of incorporating data into a model simulation
    to improve the upcoming predictions. The predictions of the system behavior can
    be defined by the measurement of the physically numerical based model. More specifically,
    the system should be more simplified for a better understanding of computational
    methods. In many applications, the data assimilation approaches are accurate to
    describe the dynamic behavior of the system. Utilizing the data assimilation techniques
    the measurement and model outcomes are used to obtain an optimal estimation of
    the state of the system. However, the main hurdles in advanced data assimilation
    schemes are the bulky computational load that is required for solving a real problem.
    On the other hand, the assimilation algorithm is an essential tool to obtain efficient
    variational data for further analysis. Due to this, More accurate data assimilation
    methods are variational data assimilation and Kalman filtering computational method
    is widely used. Data assimilation for minimization computational method widely
    discussed in [178] as follows, X k+1 =f( X k ,p,k)+B(k,p) u k , X 0 = x 0 (38)
    View Source where X k is the system state, u k is the input of the system, f is
    a nonlinear function, p is a vector containing the uncertain parameters, and B(k)
    is an input matrix. Besides, the Kalman filter assimilation computational method
    could be written as, X k+1 =F(k) X k +B(k) u k +G(k) W k , (39) View Source where
    the Gaussian noise process is denoted by W k with zero mean and covariance matrix
    Q(k) and G(k) is the noise input matrix. SECTION VII. UVLC Channel Modelling Modeling
    of UWOC channel leads to a better understanding of optical signal propagation
    and supports exploring aqueous mediums. UVLC is considered an alternative communication
    media to meet the requirements in high data rate, large bandwidth, and high communication
    speed to deploy in various underwater applications. Moreover, for long ranges
    UVLC communication, the necessity is to design a system for efficient signal transmission.
    Generally, the signal absorption reduces the signal strength that is attenuated
    in the transmitted signal. Despite that, the scattering phenomena is responsible
    for the optical beam deflection from its initial position, this contributes to
    signal fading. As a result, Monte-Carlo simulation is being used, which is an
    alternative approach to deal with the statistical methodology for the evaluation
    of channel characteristics by generating a number of random photons and further
    obtained the simulation performance interaction of each photon within the medium
    [179]. Optical signal propagation is categorized into two main streams based on
    the type of detection techniques. They are: non-coherent intensity modulation
    and direct detection (IM/DD) signal modulation technique. However, the IM/DD is
    generally used as an optical signal modulation scheme to decode information at
    the receiver. In non-coherent systems, the detector directly detects information
    through emitted light. Another aspect of the signal detection technique is the
    coherent detection, where a local oscillator (LO) is being used to mix optical
    signals before detection which improves the receiver sensitivity [180]. In more
    contrast, coherent and heterodyne detection techniques are widely discussed as
    in [29]. A local oscillator uses incoherent detection scheme which comprises of
    the received signal to the carrier beam detected by the photodetector. Furthermore,
    the coherent detection scheme is also sub-categorized into two main classes as
    heterodyne and homodyne detection [21]. The LO operates as the same frequency
    with the optical signal in the homodyne detection scheme, while the frequency
    could be different in the heterodyne detection scheme. In the VLC setup, the system
    consists of an optical transmitter for signal modulation by LED illumination phenomena.
    On the other hand, a receiver enables a photosensitive diode for the decoding
    process from the detected light power. The block diagram consists of a transmitter
    and a receiving system depicted by Fig. 8. The different approaches use to model
    the undersea VLC system. A. Oceanic Turbulence Channel Modeling The most influential
    optical signal phenomenon is channel turbidity. Turbulence occurs due to random
    fluctuation in the refractive index of the water medium caused by the variation
    in temperature and salinity. Therefore, turbulence phenomena affects the performance
    of optical signal propagation in an aqueous medium. The affecting performance
    and channel modeling of highly turbid water mediums are presented in existing
    literature [100], [102], [181]–[183]. The fluctuation in the refractive index
    is directly related to the nature of the water channel as a function of temperature,
    salinity, pressure, and density. Due to increasing underwater depth, the temperature
    decreases and pressure increases; nevertheless, the water is slightly compressible
    affecting highly pressurized and dense water environments. Taking into account
    underwater turbulence, the scintillation index ( σ 2 I ) leads turbidity which
    is the main cause of optical signal fading. In more detail, the broad study of
    modified underwater optical turbulence (UOT) model is investigated mathematically
    by (40), as shown at the bottom of the next page, Show All [184]. As stated UOT
    spectrum model in (40), where κ , ϵ and C 0 , C 1 is defined the magnitude of
    the spatial frequency, dissipation rate of turbulent kinetic energy per unit mass
    of fluid and fluid constants, respectively. Moreover, Kolmogorov micro-scale length
    η is represented ratio of kinematic viscosity ( ν ) and ϵ . The dissipation rate
    of mean-squared refractive index χ n , the thermal expansion coefficient α , and
    saline contraction coefficients are given as, χ n = α 2 χ T + β 2 χ S −2αβ χ TS
    . (41) View Source Considering plane and spherical wave models of scintillation
    index ( σ 2 I ) for different Gaussian beams are widely discussed in [185]–[187].
    However, the scintillation index is defined as the variance of the received signal
    normalized intensity I , which is expressed in [8], σ 2 I = ⟨ I 2 ⟩− ⟨I⟩ 2 ⟨I
    ⟩ 2 . (42) View Source As varying scintillation index causes heavy turbulence,
    that can be highly affect of optical signal propagation. It means the more unsatisfactory
    performance of the system and degrades the system efficiency. Various existing
    works are recorded to channel models in weak and heavy turbidity channel conditions.
    In existing research, plenty of statistical channel models under weak turbulence
    intensity fluctuation and mathematically are defined PDFs for turbulence. The
    experimental model under lognormal distribution is mentioned as in [100], [188]–[190].
    Therefore, the probability density function (PDF) of turbulence channel condition
    under lognormal distribution is given as follows, f I (I)= exp(− (ln(I)−2 μ n
    ) 2 8 χ 2 n ) 8π χ 2 n h 2 − − − − − − √ . (43) View Source In spite of strong
    turbulence channel conditions, UVLC channel model into successive j th number
    of water layers, and following Gamma-Gamma (GG) distribution model is proposed
    as in [33] and [114], f I j ( I j )=2 ( α j β j ) ( α j + β j ) 2 Γ( α j )Γ( β

    kind are denoted by Γ(⋅) and K ( α j − β j ) (⋅) , respectively. The PDF in (44),
    for normalization conditions it satisfies the equality of turbulence channel coefficient
    as E{ I J } 2 =1. Besides of it, the scintillation index for GG distribution is
    given as [191], σ 2 I j = 1 α j + 1 β j + 1 α j β j . (45) View Source Furthermore,
    under-consideration of j th vertical water layers, the large and small scale factors
    for the plane wave model are defined by α j and β j respectively. The α j and
    β j can be written as follows [33], [183], α j = β j = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ exp ⎛ ⎝ ⎜
    ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 0.49 χ 2 I j (1+1.11 χ 12 5 I j ) 7 6 ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ −1 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ −1

    the scintillation index which is known as Rytov variance [102]. Consequently,

    β k = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ exp ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ 0.49 χ 2 I k (1+0.18 d 2 +0.56 χ 12 5 I

    ≫1 depends for large scale cells for plane wave model while χ 2 I k ≪1 for small
    scale cells. However, in (46) and (47) the Rytov variance is modeled [184, Eq.

    dependent along with δ = 1.5 C 2 1 (κη ) 45 + C 3 1 (κη ) 2 , respectively. B.
    Pointing Errors and Non-LOS Communication Link Pointing error is another issue
    in optical signal propagation that contributes to the signal fading in the underwater
    environment. Due to the random water current flow and movement of floating nodes,
    a uniform constant tracking pointing system necessary to maintain for a reliable
    communication link. Generally, the pointing error is defined and considered with
    the two essential categories as bore-sight and jitter [195]. For more detail,
    in [195] the authors are defined the bore-sight determines on a stable displacement
    transceiver (between detector center and the beam center), whereas jitter is the
    random displacement process between of beam center at the detector plane [196].
    Under consideration of Gaussian beam model for jitter phenomenon, if the optical
    beam propagates through the distance z between the source and destination along
    with the collected beam at the detector end with beam radius a . Then, the collected
    power at the receiver is given as [100], [195] [197], h p (R;z)≈ A p exp(− 2 R

    of the collected power is denoted by A p at R=0 . The fraction of the collected

    h ζ 2 −1 p ,0≤ h p ≤ A p (52) View Source where the ratio of equivalent beam radius
    with pointing error displacement standard deviation at the receiver end is presented
    by ζ= Ω 2 σ s . On the other hand, if neglecting the pointing error, then the
    observation the misalignment of the transceivers is modeled by utilizing the beam
    spread function (BSF) as [85]. SECTION VIII. Modulation, Demodulation, and Channel
    Coding Techniques for UVLC VLC signal modulation is totally different from terrestrial-based
    communication cause of non-encoding features in phase, and amplitude [198]. In
    general, the accomplishment of LEDs in the VLC system has triple features as illumination,
    high-speed data communication, and energy harvesting simultaneously [27]. The
    Maximum Flickering Time-Period (MFTP) of the light should be minimized for the
    minimal flickering phenomena [31]. On the other hand, the dimming process control
    of light supports the potential energy conservation purposes [31]. Generally,
    VLC modulation techniques deploy under IM/DD, and coherent modulation (CM) based
    scheme, which is further classified as a single carrier modulation (SCM), multi-carrier
    modulation (MCM), and color domain-based modulation (CDBM) schemes [3]. The various
    type of VLC modulation schemes are summarized by the Table 7. Moreover, the pictorial
    classification of VLC modulation techniques is depicted by Fig. 9. It is noteworthy
    that IM/DD modulation schemes are less suitable for high-data-rate applications
    [21]. For that reason, there is an alternative option Mach-Zehnder Modulator (MZM)
    which is used to modulate the intensity of the continuous optical waves and widely
    use for laser beams propagation [199]. Although the CM scheme offers more advantages
    over IM/DD enabled system in detection performance and minimize the background
    noise, the better sensitivity of the receiver, low cost, and complexity to install
    setup [200]. Modulation schemes are the most critical ways to expand bandwidth,
    such as OOK, pulse position modulation (PPM), and pulse width modulation (PMW)
    have advantages regarding system complexity when using to enhance the performance
    of the VLC system. However, the Discrete Multitone (DMT) modulation, OFDM modulation,
    and Carrier-less Amplitude Phase (CAP) modulation have better spectral efficiency
    [27]. TABLE 7 Consider the Underwater Optical Modulation Techniques, the Single
    Carrier Modulation Scheme (SCM), and Color Shift Keying (CSK) are Summarized in
    This Table. The Research Objectives, Design System Model, and Future Directions
    are Also Briefly Described A. Single Carrier Modulation Scheme In SCM, the communication
    setup leads to improve channel capacity. Nevertheless, the system complexity is
    increased due to the cost factor. The IM/DD setups have several benefits as easy
    to install, very cost-effective, and less complex as compared with the coherent
    system. The photo-detectors are used to convert optical signals into electrical
    signals under IM/DD technique. As the dimming process is widely noticed in optical
    signaling consequently, several dimming processes have been proposed in [201].
    Furthermore, the PPM, DMT, and OOK are also proposed to accommodate dimming phenomena
    [202]. Generally, for regular system model design, signal carrier modulation (SCM)
    schemes are widely used. In consideration of SCM- IM/DD, several modulation techniques
    are investigated such as OOK, PAM, variable pulse position modulation (VPPM) and
    differential pulse position modulation (DPPM) pulse position modulation (PPM),
    pulse width modulation (PWM) and color shift keying (CSK), etc., [21], [27] and
    are mentioned in Table 7. B. OOK Modulation Scheme Under Consideration IM/DD IM/DD
    scheme is well known and easy to install, and a cost-effective signal propagation
    scheme. In this scheme, the signals have to propagate through the source directly
    or by the external modulator. Despite the receiver side, the signal information
    is demodulated through the direct detection process; therefore, the whole system
    is named as intensity-modulation & direct-detection. An ordinary process to modulate
    optical signal information through light and the intensity regulated by the OOK
    scheme. The illumination of LEDs are turned “off” and “on” phenomena according
    to the bit-stream as the digital numbers “0” and “1” [27]. Such as the presence
    and absence pulse phenomena of light intensity depending on the bit duration.
    The LEDs are not completely turned off in the “off states”; nevertheless, the
    signal intensity level decreases in this state. The OOK scheme uses and is divided
    into the pulse format with a return to zero (RZ) and without a return to zero
    (NRZ), [29]. In a more vast discussion, the format contains the digital bits “1”
    in NRZ while the RZ format occupies the remaining parts of the bits represented
    by “0”. The performance of the OOK modulation technique severely degrades and
    can be improved by updating the higher modulation schemes as followed in Table
    7. C. Pulse Modulation Schemes Aforementioned, the OOK modulation technique is
    an essential signal modulation scheme that supports low data rates with low performances.
    Pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) is more tolerant of the effect of the multi-path
    channel as mentioned in [27]. PAM modulation scheme is the process where the message
    is encoded in terms of amplitude of the optical pulse. Despite the PAM scheme,
    OOK is recorded as widely used under consideration of IM/DD optical communication
    scheme because of its simplicity and resilience to the intrinsic nonlinearities
    of laser origin. Even, in pulse position modulation (PPM) scheme, the division
    of symbol k is transmitted into an equal time slot within the 2 M constellation
    symbol M . A single pulse in PPM scheme during each symbol period suffers from
    low data-rate [45]. To cope up with this issue in PPM, a pulse width modulation
    (PWM) scheme is investigated as in [231], where it deals with dimming control
    cause of lower intensity control and varies with the pulse width proportion of
    the instantaneous values of the signals. Therefore, for multi-pulse in each symbol-time
    transmission the multi-pulse modulation (M-PPM) scheme was proposed [29]. On the
    other hand, in [3], authors comprised as PAM required more power for large bandwidth
    while PPM suffers low spectral efficiency. Continuously developing of optical
    pulse modulation schemes, a differential pulse position modulation (DPPM) scheme
    is introduced to improve the overall throughput spectral efficiency of PPM [232].
    However, the DPPM is based on a very short pulse duration width for an alternative
    signal propagation. Due to this, the combination of DPPM and PWM in the form of
    DPWM has achieved a higher bandwidth efficiency than PPM and OOK. The most significant
    advantage of DPWM is that it solves the narrow pulse problem and has low power
    efficiency. To control the brightness of the LED in the PPM scheme, a Variable
    PPM (VPPM) is proposed as in [233]. However, the VPPM combines PWM and 2-PPM,
    which control the brightness and data transmission along with the controlling
    dimming level to flickering position. As a result, the multiple Pulse Position
    Modulation (MPPM) has gained a more power-efficient scheme than OOK, PAM, and
    PPM. Taken into an account of optimum power and bandwidth efficiency, a hybrid
    Multiple Pulse Amplitude and Position Modulation (MPAPM) signal propagation scheme
    is proposed in [234]. However, an Overlapping Pulse Position Modulation (OPPM)
    [235] is proposed for improving bandwidth efficiency and high data-rate in MPPM.
    Utilizing VPPM for data transmission, the system offers complexity; an alternative
    approach, a Variable Rate Multi-pulse Modulation (VR-MPPM) [233], is investigated
    to cope with the complex issues to achieve both data rate and brightness control
    simultaneously. Furthermore, an expurgated PPM (E-PPM) modulation scheme is proposed
    to improve the performance of a peak-power limited M-ary communication system
    mentioned in Table 7. D. Color Domain Based Shift Keying (CSK) Modulation Color
    Phase Shift Keying (CSK) is defined by VLC IEEE 802.15.7 standard to improve system
    performance compared with other modulation schemes [45]. The IEEE standards for
    the CSK scheme are categorized into three sub-categories based on data rates known
    as PHY-I operates 11.67 to 266.6 kb/s, PHY-II operates on 1.25 to 96 Mb/s and
    PHY-III that is operated on 12 to 96 Mb/s [31]. CSK modulation is the color space
    chromaticity dependent on utilizing the three colors intensities as Green, Red,
    and Blue LED of the source. The main principle of multi-color LED is the color
    shift keying where the VLC beam implemented as 4-CSK, 8-CSK, and 16-CSK modulation
    schemes light sources. The 3-Color CSK [210] and 4-CSK modulation schemes are
    proposed based on IEEE 802.15.7 standard [211]. The different CSK modulation schemes
    have been proposed in [236]–[238] and Table 7. E. Coherent & Multi-Carrier Modulation
    Techniques Despite IM/DD modulation scheme, the coherent scheme employs both phase
    and amplitude signals to modulate corresponding information. A local oscillator
    is used to convert the optical signals at the receiver end, which are referred
    to homodyne and hetrodyne detection mechanism. As a result, the coherent modulation
    scheme supports a high spectral efficiency and background noise resistivity but
    more channel complexity. However, multi-carrier modulation schemes are followed
    OFDM, where orthogonal sub-carriers are used as data transmission. A particular
    fading channel is converted into a flat fading channel as in the OFDM technique
    and using as a single tap equalizer. The different types of OFDM-based optical
    modulation schemes are proposed in open literature [239], [240]. The various multi-carrier
    modulation schemes are summarized in Table 7. The signals are converted from parallel
    format into serial ones for demodulation by using IFFT and then further transmitting
    to the LED transmitter. At the receiver end, the signal demodulation process happens
    by photo-diode (PD). Several multi-carrier modulation techniques are discussed
    in further Tables and subsections. DCO-OFDM:- Generally, OFDM uses RF communication
    which cannot be directly accessible to use in VLC because of the real and unipolar
    values of optical signals [241]. Therefore the conversion is needed; firstly,
    the bipolar signals are transformed into unipolar format and then the non-positive
    integers should be clipped. Generally, the RF-OFDM signals are converted into
    optical-OFDM by the Hermitian symmetry method. In contrast, the DC-bias converts
    into bipolar OFDM, which is known as DCO-OFDM. The mathematical expression of
    DC bias is given as [241], B DC =μ E{x(t ) 2 } − − − − − − − √ , (53) View Source
    where DC bias is defined by B DC of 10 log 10 ( μ 2 +1) dB. The proportionality
    constant and standard deviation of unclipped signals are represented by μ and
    E{x(t ) 2 } − − − − − − − √ , respectively. On the other hand, the expression
    for clipping operation can be written as follows [241], x(t)={ x 0 (t), 0, if  x
    0 (t)>0 if  x 0 (t)≤0. View Source The continuous development of LED carries new
    trends in optical communication. It is obvious that in DCO-OFDM, the power efficiency
    decreases while the modulation sequence increases. This makes it less compatible
    with several VLC applications. Therefore, a substitutional modulation technique
    is required. The novel substitutional technique is investigated only heterogeneous
    subcarriers for operation and also removes subcarriers known as ACO-OFDM [213].
    In contrast, the drawback of ACO-OFDM spectral efficiency is that half of DCO-OFDM
    causes half of the subcarriers rejection. PAM-DMT [221] has become an alternative
    methodology based on Fourier transform properties. In PAM-DMT, the real part of
    the signals is ignored while considering the imaginary values of the received
    signals. Moreover, for unipolar OFDM, the Flip-OFDM was also proposed [230]. The
    recently proposed Flip-OFDM technique is classified into two classes. In this
    classification, the second class is the replica of the original one. It means
    both of the classes contain the equivalency under DC bias-based modulation techniques.
    Therefore, in DCO-OFDM, the spectral efficiency falls up to half rather than ACO-OFDM.
    F. Hybrid Modulation Techniques In optical signaling, long distances coverage
    is challenging. For covering, long-range communication hybrid links are the key
    solution approaches for further wireless communication and mentioned in Table
    4 and Table 4. A single LED is used to transmit the signal in the further development
    of hybrid links instead of multiple arrays of LEDs. To deal with the issues in
    hybrid communication, spatial optical OFDM (SO-OFDM) is proposed. The SO-OFDM
    has received better BER performance than DCO-OFDM [241]. On the contrary, the
    reverse polarity optical OFDM (RPO-OFDM) is also introduced to control LED illumination
    in the VLC system [227]. The combined PWM technique deals with the real values
    in optical OFDM to control dimming phenomena in the VLC system. SECTION IX. Optical
    Energy Harvesting (OEH) The integration of IoTs, is a novel approach for wireless
    signaling in an underwater environment through IoUTs [70]. Optical waves can carry
    information and transfer energy simultaneously to power up the batteries of communication
    nodes. Even, to deploy an underwater communication setup is much more challenging
    than terrestrial-based communication. Therefore, the UVLC techniques are the potential
    wireless candidates for communication and energy transmitting media within the
    communication networks. Due to this, simultaneously, light-wave information and
    power transfer (SLIPT) has been proposed as a potential wireless candidate for
    communication and power transmission through optical link connectivity [242].
    Compared with simultaneous wireless information and power transmission (SWIPT),
    SLIPT performs better in specific channel condition requirements. This section
    provides an overview of SLIPT methodology through time, power, and spatial space
    dependency. Moreover, the LEDs are capable of transmitting signals in underwater
    environments with conveniently low-cost rather than RF signaling [20]. Internet-connected
    devices are the power-hungry tools those need to harvest energy being in an active
    mode. WPT is quite challenging among wireless nodes, specifically underwater.
    Although this, WPT has gained research attention in the most recent years [41],
    [243]–[245]. Initially, the idea of WPT came up during the 1890s [246]. Later
    on, the integration of WPT was triggered by SWIPT, where only electromagnetic
    waves carry information and power in different required application scenarios.
    SWIPT has become a futuristic digital energy transmitting technology in the wireless
    communication domain. However, RF-energy harvesting (RF-EH) systems experienced
    major technical problems due to transceiver circuits and suffered from relatively
    low efficiency. It is noteworthy that EM waves propagate over few meters in the
    underwater environment. Consequently, to get rid of the radiation rate of EM waves,
    it is replaced by VLC enabled light sources such as laser diode and LEDs. A hybrid
    RF and light-wave power transfer scheme with the color diversity of optical beam
    has been recorded in [247]. The authors in [247], are proposed a novel RF-VLC
    ultra-small cell network and the proposed system model consists of multiple terminal
    devices along with an optical angle-diversity transmitter with a multi-antenna
    RF access point. For shallow water communication, the fading of the optical signal
    due to the limited sunlight or background light effect is the leading cause of
    EH harvesting efficiency. SLIPT methodology can be a complementary energy harvesting
    (EH) approach to transfer energy via visible light in IoUT networking system.
    For instance, the RF/VCL hybrid communication and EH scheme is proposed in [248],
    where the authors designed a VLC link to harvest energy at the relay and furthered
    this harvested energy by transferring it with the base station through an RF link.
    However, a more sophisticated optical transceivers setup is required in the SLIPT
    scenario based on modulation and demodulation schemes, including the time, power,
    and space splitting format. A. Switching Technologies As the main concern of the
    SLIPT scenario, the switching technique has played the most significant role in
    transmission power and simultaneously information transmission. Generally, time,
    power, and space switching schemes are proposed in the open literature [249].
    In the time switching aspect, the receiver acts to decode information in the time
    slot t , whether the reaming time slot (1−t) is assigned for the harvesting energy.
    Furthermore, the received signals split into photo-voltaic and photo-conductive
    modes of receiving as well as decoding the signals. In addition, the low-power
    hybrid system can perform the function of switching between two solar cell modes
    in the cooperative communication aspect. While in power splitting mode, the receiving
    terminal self charges and detects the incident light beam information. The light
    beam splits into dual power factors as α and ( 1−α ), respectively. The power
    factor Pα is responsible for EH; else remaining power fraction P(1−α) is assigned
    for information decoding. In this power splitting scenario, the power splitting
    component could function passively; the reason is splitting the incident beam
    divides into two portions. Nevertheless, in this scenario, it is considering n
    th number of transceivers in a communication system and functioning for energy
    harvesting capabilities and information decoding. In this type of system architecture,
    the spatial splitting approach applicable. In this anticipated system design,
    each transmitter node is independent of each others and could transmit the signal
    and energy received by each receiving node. Furthermore, the time switching SPLIT
    approach could be utilized within this scenario for the same receiver, which acts
    as “Energy Harvester” and “Signal Decoder” over different periods. These two switching
    techniques would be beneficial to deploy in critical environments such as undersea
    and underground communication and wireless energy transfer. For long-range communication,
    the UWSNs are deployed within a particular depth in an undersea environment. Being
    in an active mode of sensor networks to replace the batteries and transfer energy
    wirelessly is quite challenging. To cope up with this issue, a novel hybrid SWIPT
    and SLIPT wireless power transfer techniques are investigated [247]. RF and light-wave
    power transfers are complement to each other in their relative profits and losses
    during signal propagation. An alternatively switchable process towards the 5GB
    wireless network to transfer power in shallow waters over moderate depth in underwater
    mediums is summarized in this section. SWIPT and SLIPT are the EH utility process
    where signal energy is converted into usable electric energy. An EH-system harvests
    the energy from nature such as solar energy, wind, rising temperature, and vibrational
    EH approaches are recorded in [250]. As, we are surrounded by an electronic world,
    embedded devices, remote sensors, and low-power electronic devices are necessarily
    required for power transfer and batteries to store the electrical capacity. Due
    to the limitations of the battery lifespan, they should be replaced as per requirement.
    In underwater SLIPT, the signal recognition and simultaneously receiving energy
    is a novel approach amongst researchers. The most significant advantage of the
    EH scheme is the applicability for remote locations and harsh water channel conditions.
    This type of EH technology is cost-effective, improves safety and reliability
    [251]. In the SLIPT scenario, it offers high bandwidth, extremely high speed,
    and energy efficiency. Furthermore, the movement of the renewal traditional EH
    technologies towards to SLIPT is the solution for environmentally friendly technology,
    which belongs to the class of green communication [252]. B. SLIPT in Underwater
    Communication An underwater SLIPT scenario is depicted by Fig. 10. Throughout
    the proposed system model, the received signal splits into two chunks simultaneously,
    which are responsible for energy harvesting and information decoding. At the receiver
    end the received signals are converted into AC and DC components. The AC component
    is responsible for the signal decoding while the DC component uses for the EH
    purposes [253]. According to Fig. 10, in the SLIPT system model, if m(t) represents
    the modulated electrical signal and A denotes the peak amplitude. If, + A I assigns
    for a bit “1” while − A I for “0” in modulation and demodulation of VLC signal.
    In consideration of modulation process to control the optical intensity of LED
    with the DC bias ψ , the peak amplitude for each bit is given as [41], A I ≤min(ψ−
    I L , I H −ψ), (54) View Source where I L and I H are denoted the minimum and
    maximum input bias current. Furthermore, in the point-to-point communication scenario,
    the harvested energy is modified and given by [41], [254], E EH = = f I DC V t
    fTrI P t B V t ln(1+ rIh P t ψ I 0 ), (55) View Source where f , I DC , V t ,
    T , r , P t , and I 0 are defined as the fill factor of solar panel, the DC component
    I DC =rI P t ψ , the thermal voltage, time duration during energy harvesting,
    the photo-detector resistivity, the power component, and the dark saturation current
    of solar panel, respectively. Time-Switching (TS) SLIPT Receiver Architecture
    The TS receiver architecture is a disjoint scheme as well as the splitting factors
    t and (1−t) denoted for the optimization in the SLIPT system. According to the
    splitting factor, the ability to gain the idea of exploit harvested energy with
    adequate BER performance. Moreover, the TS mechanism represents separate two-time
    frames for EH and information decoding (ID). Furthermore, TS can use for only
    one function at a time, energy transfer or receiving signal [253]. The TS-SLIPT
    block diagram architecture under the SPLIT system is depicted by Fig.11. Power-Switching
    (PS) SLIPT Receiver Architecture The PS receiver architecture is another combined
    scheme as received current distributed into two phases. The DC component of the
    current phase uses for EH, while the AC component of the current phase uses for
    information decoding purposes. Compared with the TS-SLIPT scheme, the PS design
    could reach high efficiency in EH at the receiver end. Additionally, the PS-SLIPT
    mechanism works at the same time with different power domains for EH and ID [42].
    Fig.12 shows the block diagram of the PS-SLIPT receiver architecture. C. SLIPT
    and SWIPT Schemes The authors in [42] widely discussed which comprised both of
    futuristic SLIPT and SWIPT schemes. In both schemes, the authors obtained the
    behavior of system BER & outage performances along with amount of harvested energy.
    Therefore, the BER and outage performances in the SLIPT scheme perform better
    than the SWIPT scheme at the consecutive photodetector sensitivity and power splitting
    factors. On the contrary case according to [42], the EH in SWIPT shows superior
    performance rather than indoor enabled SLIPT technology. SECTION X. Hybrid Underwater
    Wireless Communication Optical communication as VLC is a promising complementary
    approach instead of RF and acoustic waves signal transmission in the underwater
    medium over short distances. Enabling next generation of wireless network 5GB
    optical communication technique allows the massive number of connectivity of IoUTs.
    In recent years there is a growing interest in deploying VLC as a communication
    link in underwater integrated with existing RF and acoustic waves. Therefore,
    hybrid RF-VLC and FSO-VLC wireless communication links are proposed and showed
    impressive system performances expect to deploy individual point-to-point or point-to-multi-point
    communication links. A wide detailed summary of various hybrid communication techniques
    are depicted by Fig.1 and Fig.13. In RF-UWOC hybrid communication system [48]
    an electromagnetic link combines with an optical link, while in underwater FSO-VLC
    system [255] enables both of optical links for signal propagation. Additionally,
    a dual-hop acoustic-optical link is widely used for signal propagation in the
    underwater medium over long-ranges [256]. In hybrid underwater communication aspect
    various signal transmission techniques are developed and use to enable with FSO,
    VLC, sonar, and underwater acoustic waves. It is challenging to deploy an optical
    communication hybrid network system towards to 5GB and connecting IoUTs. Optical
    wireless communication link supports highly secure signal propagation media under
    visible light (VL), infra-red (IR), and ultraviolet (UV) frequency bands. Nowadays,
    numerous optical wireless communication systems are being developed under consideration
    above three optical frequency bands. In a hybrid link scenario, RF and acoustic
    waves are not required line-of-sight (LOS) nor short ranges but support high mobility
    and better performance in NLOS conditions. The hybrid approaches are integrated
    with two multi-hops different wireless communication technologies such as RF-VLC
    [257], [258], RF-FSO [47], [48], and PLC-VLC [259], [260] are investigated in
    the open literature to provide various advantages as per requirement and deployment.
    Additionally, a hybrid wireless communication system facilitates the integration
    of multiple wireless carrier candidates to cover long-ranges communication along
    with better system performance that overcome the limitation of an individual technology.
    A. RF/FSO Dual-Hop Hybrid Communication Link FSO has become an alternative solution
    for a wireless communication system with high bandwidth over long distances. Terrestrial
    FSO is most widely used as a LOS wireless communication approach that operates
    within 850–1550 nm of optical spectrum wavelength. Due to strong channel conditions,
    the FSO links are attenuated by atmospheric conditions, especially atmospheric
    turbulence, fog, snow, and dust limiting channels. Plenty of FSO based applications
    are recorded in open literature as in [171]. Mostly, in the FSO system the channel
    turbulence phenomenon is a highly noticeable event of the fluctuation of the scintillation
    index. The turbulence effect occurs due to the flexibility of refractive index
    variation inhomogeneities in an atmosphere where the temperature and pressure
    fluctuates. RF waves attenuate easily in an underwater environment and propagate
    over short distances. In hybrid communication over long ranges RF waves signify
    as a promising signal transmission technique. Therefore, RF-FSO underwater is
    a potential solution for acquiring high bandwidth over long distances. In this
    section, an RF-FSO hybrid communication system model is proposed to obtain the
    system performance. A source node S communicates with an underwater-based destination
    D through a floating buoy. The floating buoy works as a decode-and-forward (DF)
    relay protocol R and depicted by Fig.13. The source node transmits the RF signals
    with an average signal power P s . Further, the relay receives the transmitted
    signals re-generates then forwards to the destination D through FSO link. In another
    aspect, if we use the AF relay protocol, the relay received a signal copy from
    S and amplifies then forward to D . Additionally, we consider the RF-FSO combination
    follows Rayleigh flat fading and FSO link is experienced by strong turbulence
    channel conditions for communication between R and D . For strong turbulent channel
    conditions, the fading is modeled through Gamma-Gamma distribution. In hybrid
    communication relaying technique has been widely promoted for signal transmission
    over long ranges. Due to the limitation of FSO signaling on terrestrial based
    communication, the channel impairments have to be taken into account. As turbulence
    and pointing errors are the main cause of optical signal fading, the hybrid communication
    link is widely studied in literature and the performance investigated through
    different modulation and demodulation techniques. In an underwater communication
    scenario, optical communication is a permissible communication media for signal
    transmission. Thus, a number of RF-Optical [46]–[48], [50], [51] and acoustic-optical
    [69], [256], [261], [262] hybrid communication systems are investigated. B. RF/VLC
    Dual-Hop Hybrid Communication Link In optical communication aspect VLC shows an
    impressive performance for signal transmission over short distances. VLC uses
    LED luminaries, which are very cost-effective, easy to install, and 100 Gbps data
    can be achieved. Similarly, VLC also affects by strong channel conditions, especially
    sunlight. VLC integrated with RF and a hybrid RF-VLC combination shows better
    performance in different waters. A dual-hop hybrid RF-VLC underwater communication
    link proposed in [114]. The system model consists of three or more nodes for signal
    transmission where a relay function re-generates or amplifies signal information
    and further communicates with the underwater-based destination. In [114], the
    system model is assumed in half-duplex mode with a single antenna at relay, while
    the nodes are fixed. Moreover, the relay should mount two directional antennas
    in full-duplex mode, where one antenna receives the transmitted signals from source
    and the other antenna towards to the destination for further communication with
    the destination. The BER performance of RF-VLC dual-hop hybrid cooperative communication
    system [257] in different water types under strong channel conditions are depicted
    by Fig.14. C. FSO/VLC Dual-Hop Hybrid Communication Link The traditional underwater
    communication media is modeled by acoustic waves that supports low data rate and
    bandwidth with high delayed signal propagation. FSO-VLC combination full-fill
    the acceptability of desired communication requirements with a highly achievable
    data rate. This hybrid communication could be operating in half and full-duplex
    mode as both are optical links and sever almost the same channel impairments.
    The high turbulence channel conditions, current water waves, misalignment, and
    physio-chemical properties such as pressure, temperature, and salinity affects
    FSO and VLC links. A hybrid FSO-VLC combination is proposed in the open literature,
    where an AUV communicates with terrestrial based station through a floating buoy
    that functions as a relay to assist received information from the source-based
    station. The BER performance of an investigate FSO/VLC dual-hop hybrid communication
    system [257] in different water types is depicted by Fig.15. D. PLC/VLC Dual-Hop
    Hybrid Communication Link Another approach of hybrid underwater communication
    VLC link combined with power line communication (PLC) technology. A telecommunication
    technology PLC is based on the use of power grids for high-speed information transmission.
    The low transmission speed and poor noise immunity are the bottlenecks of this
    technology. Rather than this, the advent of PLC strengthens digital signal processors
    (DSP), making it possible to use more complex signal modulation methods such as
    OFDM modulation. PLC can be used to create a small base station where the main
    requirements for the network are ease of implementation, device mobility, and
    easy scalability. The small cell base station (CBS), e.g., femtocell access point
    (FAP) are used as a small cellular base station that serves 6–8 users. In hybrid
    PLC-VLC combined communication link a small power grid antenna connects with the
    small base station (SBS) through line cable. The signal is transmitted from SBS
    to the antenna via cable and further this antenna mounts by LEDs for further signal
    transmission to divers or UWSNs in shallow water. E. Optical-Acoustic and RF-Acoustic
    Dual-Hop Hybrid Communication Link The study of acoustic waves involves the discovery
    and deployment of sound waves transmission in fluid media. Acoustic waves are
    generally defined as mechanical and longitudinal vibrational ripples that can
    travel through solid, liquid, or gas mediums in a wave patterns. Underwater acoustic
    is an alternative signal propagation method of sound in water, especially over
    long ranges undersea. Sound waves are the most effective energy transmission wireless
    carriers that propagate over long distances in the ocean. Moreover, acoustic waves
    can tolerate the pressure and the temperature of the deep oceans. Neither RF nor
    optical waves are suitable for long-range transmissions in an underwater environment
    as acoustic waves [263]. Usually, the speed of acoustic waves is comparably low
    (Approximately 1500 m/s) [74]. Although, according to the layer clarification
    the speed varies in cold water and lower than normal water. Acoustic waves are
    used for long-ranges transmissions approximately up to 15 – 20 km, but these waves
    cannot achieve high bandwidth signals undersea. Due to low frequency, bandwidth,
    speed, and additionally the received signals are delayed at the destination [264],
    [265]. However, the sound waves depend on the compressibility and density of the
    medium. In [266], an acoustic sound speed profile (SSP) system model has been
    proposed for 1 km as follows, c= 1448.96+4.591T−0.591 T 2 +0.00029 T 3 +(1.340−0.01T)(S−35)+0.0163z,
    (56) View Source where the temperature in 0C, salinity in PSU, depth in meters,
    and speed of sound in m/s are denoted by T , S , z , and c , respectively. Sound
    waves propagate according to water current concerning every instant of time. An
    empirical model is described as a function of physical water properties such as
    temperature, salinity, and pressure varies with depth. Stratification of these
    parameters lead to stratification of wave motion, which entails the existence
    of specific profiles. Mackenzie has developed a mathematical formula in applied
    science during 1981s [267]. As already discussed, underwater optical communication
    is an alternative approach that refers to transmit signals in an aqueous medium.
    VLC communication has more superiority in comparison to acoustic waves but over
    short distances. To fulfill the gap of long-range communication, a hybrid optical-acoustic
    communication system is considerable. In this type of system model, the underwater-based
    mobile station transmits the acoustic signals and further convert into optical
    format for decoding purposes at the targeted node. SECTION XI. Underwater Sensor
    Networks Architecture Recently, there have been growing interests in underwater
    wireless sensor networks (UWSNs). The fundamental source of ocean exploration
    underwater sensor architecture is defined as a group of sensor nodes that are
    established undersea to exchange information wirelessly with the base station
    (BS) and floating vehicles (nodes). The growing interest of UWSNs for a wide variety
    of purposes about oceanography, monitoring marine life, seismic surveillance,
    oil-fields exploration, military applications, and deep-sea activities. In this
    regard, the necessity of UWSNs contributes a significant role in UWC. Generally,
    UWSN nodes are enabled with acoustic and optical links for data transmission within
    various applications. Energy conservation and self battery powered is a critical
    issue in UWSN technology. This survey estimates the target position and improves
    energy efficiency in hibernating and an active mode of underwater sensor nodes
    (USNs). The network of underwater sensors fixed with a certain depth or with the
    bottom of the deep ocean for early detection warning of an earthquake, tectonic
    plate movements, and active volcanos before striking the coastal and residential
    areas. The floating nodes are used to detect ice sheet melting and rising water
    level phenomenon, coral reef, water pollution, and physio-chemical properties
    of water. The development of floating nodes AUV supports to improve the quality
    of geographical mapping and navigation systems in underwater sectors. Localization
    is another significant application of UWSNs for tracking location or Global Positioning
    System (GPS) in harsh water mediums [268]. The integration of sensor nodes architecture
    has permitted to allow communication, localization, and GPS. In an underwater
    environment, navigation and localization are the two most significant challenges
    for mobile robots, floating nodes, and different underwater applications. Aforementioned,
    acoustic and optical signal-based sensor networking systems are the most widely
    used for various underwater applications. Through the proposed underwater applications
    the acoustic and optical transponders are used to navigate an AUV. The sound navigation
    and ranging (SONAR) enabled AUV methodology has been proposed with the two basic
    configurations introduced as side-scan SONAR (SSS) and Forward-Looking SONAR (FLS)
    in [269] and [270]. The above SSS and FLS are used for monitoring marine life
    and detection for underwater environmental changes [271]. While an array of sensor
    nodes with a camera or without a camera can be implemented for long ranges navigation
    and imaging systems [272]. A. Simultaneous Location and Mapping (SLAM) SLAM is
    an AUV-enabled imaging technique and an essential solution for mapping unknown
    locations within the unknown environment to develop a consistent geographical
    mapping of an underwater environment [271]. In contrast, the SLAM imaging AUV-based
    technology that supports constructing a 3D image in different color frames is
    widely discussed in [273]. The authors in the above-proposed work defined a color-coding
    representation for the reconstruction of unknown mapping sectors, where each color
    code has its specified distance measurement between AUV and obstacles. The various
    methods are presented in the literature of SLAM to the reconstruction of the unknown
    sectors in underwater environment [271], [274]–[277]. Each method has its inadequacies
    and strengths according to the desired interaction, inspection, and navigation
    implementation. Furthermore, underwater SLAM is differentiated into acoustic-based,
    and vision-based categories [278]. The acoustic-based underwater SLAM is used
    for intense unknown segments, while the vision-based SLAM is suffered from limited
    visibility and background noise by natural sources in shallow waters. Therefore,
    a high-definition FLS SLAM could be a promising alternative solution in geographical
    mapping to mitigate the problematic solution. B. Underwater Acoustic Sensor Network
    UASNs is an approach that supports the exploration of extremely dark and highly
    deep oceans. UASNs deploy for various underwater applications such as for detection
    submarines and unmanned operations for military purposes. The UWSNs architecture
    is categorized into fixed 2D and mobility 3D sensors. In the 3D type of architectural
    sensor system, the motion of nodes controls the internal navigation system. The
    floating nodes are free to move underwater with the drift and unpropelled type
    of portable devices such as unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), AUVs, ROVs, drifters,
    and gliders. The main function of these devices is to collect oceanographic data
    from an aqueous medium. The various types of UWSNs are summarized by Table 8.
    The drifter operates mostly through the ground, which drifts with wind and surface
    waves to acquire the possible measurement of marine sectors, further sharing the
    collected data with the base station through satellite. Moreover, the gliders
    are driven by the buoyant force and connected with the floating buoy or the cluster
    head for sharing collected data. In existing work, there are the two main groups
    of UASNs known as content-based and scheduled-based protocols proposed in [279].
    UASNs are classified into two categories as content-based and scheduled-based
    nodes. The Content-based nodes exchange signals to each other, while scheduled-based
    nodes eliminate the exchange of aggregated data between transmission nodes. Alternatively
    stated content-based nodes do not meet the desired gap and are critically suitable
    for UWC. In contrast, due to high propagation latency and narrow bandwidth, the
    scheduled-based nodes such as TDMA and FDMA are less suitable. However, CDMA is
    a more suitable approach for UAN to be deployed in underwater medium [268]. TABLE
    8 The Various Types of Underwater Sensor Network Nodes (UWSNs) Architectures Established
    in the Open Literature to Cope With Issues of Highly Delay, Low Bandwidth, Heavy
    Turbulence Channel Conditions. The Architectures are Enabled for the Required
    Underwater Applications From Short to Long Ranges C. Architecture of Underwater
    Sensor Network Nodes (UWSNs) UASN is commonly used for underwater exploration
    but quite adequate to meet the demand for real-time streaming and high data rate
    scenario. RF wave-based underwater sensor network nodes (UWRFSNs) are the potential
    approachable technique TO full-fill the requirement of various underwater applications.
    In this section, the discussion is carried out of the different types UWSNs along
    with their deployment challenges. 1D-UWSNs Architecture: The single dimension
    (1D) UWSNs are the self-employed types of deployable networks underwater. In this
    type of sensor network, the individual node is self-configured by itself. In this
    type of architecture, each node has the capability of sensing and it is responsible
    for processing collection data within the remote area [281]. The sensor node could
    be fixed with a seabed or a floating buoy responsible for collecting the useful
    oceanographic data and further shared with the BS. In another scenario, the floating
    buoy could be the buoyant type of node that floats a certain depth underwater
    and then float towards the BS for information transmission. AUVs also function
    as self-configured individual nodes; they can floats at any horizontal and vertical
    depth to sense the data and share it with the onshore data center. The 1D-UWSNs
    type of architecture enables acoustic, EM, and optical communication-based wireless
    signaling technology. The 1D-UWSNs are widely deployable for single-hop communication
    where the nodes directly communicate with the BS; in VLC scenario 1D type of UWSNs
    usable for plenty of underwater applications in shallow waters such as rivers,
    dams, lakes, etc. 2D-UWSNs Architecture: The 2D type of UWSN is referred as a
    group of sensor networks (cluster) where the nodes communicate with the cluster
    head. The fixed or anchored cluster head collects the sensed data from each node
    and further transmits it to the vertical buoyant transceiver of the BS. In 2D-UWSN
    architecture, it is considered that each node communicates with the cluster head
    horizontally and communicates with the vertical buoyant node as well. Thus, this
    type of node architecture is called 2D-UWSNs, based on acoustic, EM, and optical
    waves-based wireless signaling technology for long ranges in an underwater environment.
    In the UVLC scenario, all local and cluster head nodes link and transmit the information
    with the remote station. The 2D type of UWSNs architecture is proposed in [291]
    for the purpose of short-term aquatic exploration applications and extensively
    discussed. The 2D-type of UWSNs is depicted in Fig.1. 3D-UWSN Architecture: The
    3D type of UWSN describes the network architecture where the sensor cluster nodes
    are deployed in different depths in underwater medium. Due to different depths,
    the clusters communication links established are variable in 3D space geometry
    in undersea. The communication link among the sensor nodes would be in three dimensions
    space for the mobility of data transmission. Additionally, in 3D-UWSNs, the cluster
    communicates among the neighboring clusters at varying depths, and the cluster
    network nodes communicate with their cluster head. All the cluster heads collect
    the sensed data by their local sensors and further transmit it to the buoyant
    node or with the BS. The 3D type of UWSNs can be deployed for underwater applications
    requirement based on acoustic, EM, and optical communication [281]. Moreover,
    the 3D underwater sensor network localization has been widely discussed in [282].
    In UVLC enabled sensor network communication, the high probability of real-time
    monitoring and achieving high data rate. The 3D-type of UWSNs is depicted in Fig.1.
    4D-UWSN Architecture: The 4D type of sensor network architectural system is designed
    by combining anchored sensor nodes with the floating or mobile UWSNs nodes at
    different underwater depths. The 4D-UWSN architecture is deployable for long ranges
    communication among the nodes. Mostly, the mobile UWSNs consist of ROVs for the
    data collection from an anchored or fixed nodes at the seabed in varying depth.
    The ROVs can be submersible robots, vehicles, ships, and even submarines. Each
    node can relay information with ROV and depending on the distance between the
    node and ROV. Furthermore, the signal transmission is the distance-dependent between
    underwater sensor nodes and ROV [292]. The 2D-type of UWSNs is depicted in Fig.16.
    SECTION XII. Recent Development of Internet of Underwater Things (IoUTs) The network
    of the internet of underwater things (IoUTs) is a potential novel approach for
    data collection within the underwater environment that has to be transferred with
    the BS for further analysis. IoUTs is a group of wireless network-enabled smart
    devices and could be a wide range of underwater sensor nodes architecture. The
    different types of UWSNs architectures are discussed in the earlier sections for
    various underwater application purposes. The system architecture of IoUT has received
    attention for developing smart ocean and innovative business surrounded by smart
    interconnected underwater water objects [70]. The most widely deployable IoUTs
    are discussed as follow and depicted by Fig.16. A. Sea Gliders and Autonomous
    Underwater Vehicles The Internet-connected devices structure provides a pretty
    reasonable communication bridge among the nodes. For underwater communication
    purposes, wirelessly connected devices are recognized as the internet of underwater
    things (IoUTs). These devices could be identified as network nodes, AUVs, moving
    gliders, ROVs and floating buoys, etc. Whereas sea gliders and AUVs provide the
    measurement of oceanic environment over long-ranges especially for bathymetric
    data collection. The thrust and movement of the sea-gliders are used as an electrically
    driven propellers and are operated by an installed battery that provides upthrust
    with buoyancy for forwarding or upward motion. The AUVs and sea-gliders are designed
    to cover thousands of miles for several months within underwater mediums. These
    devices sink up to 1km from the sea surface due to their energy capacity limits.
    Furthermore, these types of nodes are deployed for oceanographic data collection
    and GPS purposes. An architecture of IoUTs that involves the multiple wave gliders
    for acoustical observation is proposed [293]. The internal sensors of sea-gliders
    determine the direction of vehicle when it dives underwater. The external sensor
    scans the ocean to collect the data. The movement of sea-gliders, AUV, UUV, and
    ROVs, is shown in Fig.16. B. Underwater Animal Telemetry Animal telemetry is another
    effective approach for ocean exploration and uses to observe the marine environment.
    This tagging technology enables us to get to know about the marine life inhabitants
    and their interaction with coastal shelf ecosystem to polar seas and the open
    oceans [294]. Animal telemetry supports observing the exploration summary of the
    vast oceans, underwater environmental changes, and marine pollution. The air-sea
    interface is necessary to understand the observation and oceanic exploration of
    daily water conditions, driving global climate changes, biogeochemical cycle process,
    heavy wind and water currents to exchange the momentum and other micro-particles
    [294]. The various IoUTs such as HFR, satellites, drifters, and autonomous surface
    vehicles (ASVs) are widely used to observe the air-sea interface. To mitigate
    such challenges, the development of a small communicating device that can be mounted
    on the floating seabird back that contained a sensing data unit with a battery
    is capable of measuring the water surface, water currents, and winds over the
    sea [294]–[297]. For more details about animal telemetry, a pictorial view is
    referred to for this approach in Fig.16. C. A Deep Detectable Tsunami Buoy Tsunamis
    and earthquakes are sudden events and highly impossible to control. Nevertheless,
    these events are predictabled by deploying an early detectable device called a
    tsunami buoy. The primary function of a tsunami buoy is the detection and monitoring
    of the high level ocean water waves (Tides). The tsunami events are generated
    by undersea earthquakes that bureau of meteorology confirms. The tsunami buoys
    are deployed for observation and recorded the changes in sea level and bottomless
    oceans. It enhances the capability for early detection warning of tsunamis and
    floods before hitting the land. The buoy splits into two major components: the
    pressure sensor anchored with the sea bead and a surface buoy that floats on the
    water surface. The anchored sensors at the sea-bed are used to measure the changes
    in the height of the water column (the height h of the water column is the function
    of water pressure p as p=ρgh ). In more contrast, the measured water column height
    utilized for communication purposes with the floating buoy (works as a relay)
    through sound waves and further relayed via satellite to the tsunami warning center
    [298]. The function of the tsunami buoy is depicted in Fig.16. D. Underwater Floating
    Drifters Through the immense development of drifters, observing the global ocean
    currents and their effects are the main concerns. Recent advancements of drifters
    support the ocean circulation patterns in real-time monitoring the deployment
    of the drifters possibly in shallow water by a ship or another source. On the
    deployment of the drifter when it floats, the transmitter is activated and starts
    to share the collected oceanographic data with the satellite, this collected data
    is further to transmitted with the offshore BS for analysis. Other inbuilt sensors
    at drifters are responsible for collecting the various types of data such as water
    surface temperature, wind, ocean color, pressure, and salinity [299]. The data
    synchronization with the satellite has been depicted in Fig.16. E. Underwater
    Hydrophones Generally, the signal propagation effects by channel impairments;
    noise is one of signal corrupting factors. The array of hydrophones are designed
    to be deployed for noise detection in an aqueous medium. Also, the hydrophones
    produce a limited voltage signal over high-frequency ranges while receiving the
    underwater sound from any direction. Deployment of an array of hydrophones amplifies
    and records the received noise more precisely. Omni-directional and Hemi-directional
    hydrophones support to collect the sound from a particular direction; it is also
    to track underwater the movement of underwater species. Therefore, hydrophones
    are the fundamental tools for plenty of undersea acoustic applications such as
    Sono-buoys, wired hydrophones, and autonomous hydrophones [287]. In addition,
    the NOAA’s Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL) under NOAA’s National
    Marine Sanctuaries also frequently uses hydrophones [300]. In addition to that
    NOAA’s PMEL derives a long-term datasets for the global ocean acoustic environment.
    It has been utilized to identify and evaluate acoustic influences of human activities
    and natural disasters such as the eruption of an underwater volcano and glacial
    earthquakes in the marine environment [301]. The deployment of hydrophones in
    the underwater scenario has shown in Fig.16. F. Clod Cards Use the Measurement
    of Water Flow The clod cards are ice-shaped identical trapezoidal geometries and
    made by alabaster or plaster of Paris (gypsum blocks) and utilize to analyze underwater
    flow patterns. The ingredients of clod cards or made by the combination of the
    100ml of freshwater with 80gm plaster of Paris powder manufactured by the Hobby
    Craft Trading limited, Dorest UK [302]. In [302], the clod cards were sanded at
    the bottom of the water bodies to accomplish a consistent weight of 12.5 ± 1.5
    gm. Every individual plaster cube must be glued with the plastic plate size 3×8
    cm with silicone cement in this strategy. To measure the exact water flows analysis,
    the four clod cards established in four cardinal directions in front of their
    faces are fixed to a straight pole for at least 24 hours. The requirement of clod
    cards deployment in predetermined sites for various underwater applications such
    as divers, ROVs, and floating nodes. After a limited and fixed time duration (approximately
    1 to 2 days), the clod cards have to be retrieved, dried at 40 0 C , and reweighed
    to calculate the decay and the strong water flow. Conversely, the exact weight
    loss of the plaster of Paris is determined from each card and sent to the laboratory
    for further analysis. As a result, it can be concluded that the clods who lost
    more weight are exposed to greater water flow than those who lost less weight.
    Accordingly, the cloud card can be used to measure several other essential parameters
    from the ocean. An implementation of a clod card has been depicted in Fig.16.
    G. Satellite Oceanography The weather observational satellite is the most significant
    tool to share constructive information with the base station. Additionally, the
    satellite plays a vital role in ocean observation research and functions as an
    intermediate communication node for information transmission between the underwater
    and offshore base stations. For oceanographic data collection, environmental satellites
    are widely used to capture images and calculate the surface temperature of oceans.
    It is also used to know the water patterns and further shared the collected data
    with the terrestrial-based stations for analysis. For real-time video, steaming
    could be possible by utilizing satellites in different color coding techniques
    for water flow analysis. It supports determining the impact of floods and tsunami
    along the coastal area along with the detection of algal blooms. In the most recent
    years, remote sensing technology-enabled with the satellite that has boosted for
    data synchronization with altimetry (study to measures the height of sea surface),
    scatterometry (study to measures wind speed and direction), as well as the bathymetric
    (study of the ocean floor) approaches. These are the technologies that make the
    smart satellite for ocean observation, monitoring, and GPS. Additionally, to monitor
    early detection warnings to evacuate the coastal area and develop major storms,
    such as hurricanes and tornadoes, geosynchronous environmental satellites are
    being used. The most important information of coral reefs, coastal habitats, and
    similar environments can be analyzed by the satellite photography [303]. In Fig.16,
    an environmental satellite is depicted for ocean mapping. H. Remotely Operated
    Vehicles (ROVs) ROVs are accessed remotely and functioned similarly as a robot.
    This type of node has been designed for underwater exploration and deployment
    for various underwater applications to find the lost ships, repair and monitor
    gas pipelines, habitat mapping, etc. Specifically, the ROVs are equipped with
    sensors and sampling tools for data collection at variable distances from the
    oceans. A network cable is used to detect and observing the objects by illuminating
    the light, establishes a communication link between the base station and floating
    node to controls commands of the proper node movement. The ROV is a well-equipped
    floating vehicle enabled with advanced features that contain a lighting system
    with a camera at the frontal portion for videography to record a better sub-aquatic
    panorama. It is especially utilized in the aquatic medium for the contribution
    of geology education and sea life learning [304]. The exploration and functioning
    of ROV in an underwater medium have shown in Fig.16. SECTION XIII. Integration
    of Advance and Next Generation Communication Technology Currently, with the immense
    enhancement of data traffic in telecommunication industries, a large number of
    regular users have been observed. An alternative communication media has an essential
    role in the wireless networking era to fulfill the requirements of further innovations,
    research, and further development of new emerging communication technologies.
    The development of optical communication applications in visible light has become
    an immense growth in different fields. Nowadays, the trade of VLC applications
    became more reliable and highly efficient in acquiring indoor and outdoor scenarios.
    VLC uses the limited frequency ranges about 430 – 790 THz at the wavelength ranges
    380 – 750 nm. The benefit of this frequency range is the compatibility with the
    human eye with no effect on an electrical circuit. The basic concept in VLC signaling
    is the information modulation happens at the receiver end while demodulation is
    held by a photo-detector and decodes the signal from received information under
    fluctuation of the light intensity. The communication link is enabled with a lighting
    system as LED, which offers a considerable bandwidth with a desirable high data
    rate. Cellular technologies have changed and support improving the system qualities
    and performances. To proliferate smart internet-connected devices, emerging advanced
    future wireless networks play an ample role for an efficient and reliable communication
    link among the network architectural nodes as 5G networks have shown superior
    performances as a key enabling wireless technology. Also, the 5GB and 6G would
    be offered an immense performance while linked with the multiple nodes. The latest
    5GB wireless network would significantly impact various wireless connected applications
    such as intelligent transportation, device-to-device (D2D) communication, underwater
    optical communication, and internet-connected devices. The most recent survey
    on 6G wireless network carried out an outperform study about VLC enabling communication
    signaling through laser and LEDs [305]. A. 5G Networking System in Underwater
    5G wireless communication system has been designed to offer a significant improvement,
    especially for enhancing the system capacity, spectral efficiency, and energy
    efficiency of the communication system. For efficient and reliable wireless communication,
    5G is widely accepted to combine the small cell, picocells, and macrocells [306].
    The commercial use of 5G during 2019s established a collaborative communication
    system on a terrestrial basis, excluding the underwater environmental communication.
    The deployment of a 5G wireless network underwater will be an innovative step
    to improve data extraction from an aqueous medium for further analysis. As being
    improving the system capacity and essential assets of high data rate underwater
    wireless communication technology, optical communication towards 5G is the key
    solution that attracts the scientific community. Although, the most recent experimental
    study and the performance evaluation of 520nm wavelength laser-diode towards 5G
    is presented as [307]. In [307], the authors analyzed the performance of an underwater
    optical system under consideration of varying salinity conditions in pure water.
    Facing these issues, the Generalized Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM) is
    proposed as a novel underwater wireless network candidate towards the next generation
    standard based on multi-branch multi-carrier filter bank in [43]. It is presented
    and generalized the traditional OFDM technique with several advantages as minimal
    peak to average power ratio (PAPR). Minimizing PAPR is one of the key advantage
    features in GFDM over OFDM and a significant parameter to analyze the performance
    characteristics of the communication system [308]. As recorded the limited bandwidth
    in underwater acoustic, OFDM suits for communication purposes. In contrast, OFDM
    offers a profitable integration over single-carrier modulations against the frequency
    selective fading [309]. Therefore, to come up for all these issues, the requirement
    to deploy multi-carrier transmission schemes. GFDM [310] and filter bank multi-carrier
    (FBMC) [311] are proposed the new promising emerging communication techniques
    towards 5G applications. B. Predictable 5G and Beyond (5GB) Networking System
    in Underwater The forthcoming next-generation 5G and beyond (5GB) communication
    will indeed offer numerous advanced services with ultra-high capabilities, an
    extensive number of device connectivity, very ultra-low energy consumption, and
    latency along with ultra-high security, extremely high quality of services (QoS),
    and high-resolution experience (HRE) [312]. The 6G networks are anticipated to
    accommodate and exceeded performance in comparison with 5G. Thus, the exceptionally
    high data will greatly impact networking users and the critical factor for more
    complex future challenges in various sectors such as in healthcare, long-range
    communication, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, underwater communication,
    etc. Though, the prediction to launch the 6G communication system is anticipated
    till 2030s [313]. Indeed, the 6G wireless communication network will provide the
    next level of signal transmission qualitative performance compared with 5G communication.
    The recent advances of and application of optical communication technologies towards
    5G/6G are summarized in detail [314]. An extremely high data rate up to 100Gbps
    by deploying VLC has been confirmed in [315] and [316]. Internet of underwater
    things (IoUTs) is the essential part of an underwater communication system connected
    with a standardized communication network for data extraction in the real-time
    scenario from the underwater environment. The implementation of 6G integrating
    UWC will be a revolutionary step to explore aqueous mediums as IoUTs connected
    with VLC. The most significant aim is predicted to connect underwater-based nodes
    with satellites for global coverage and observation all around the globe. C. Internet
    of Underwater Things (IoUTs) IoUTs refer to internet-connected devices that can
    easily and legitimately retrieve information through cabled or wireless-enabled
    connectivity. UIoTs claims to be an extension and development phase of IoTs, which
    allows the extraction of anonymous information from smart ocean [317]. IoUTs are
    enabled by the most recent developments of AUVs, ROVs, smart underwater sensor
    networks, and routing protocols. The architecture of UIoTs depicted in Fig.1 and
    Fig.13, enable numerous applications in an underwater environment in terms of
    sensing, monitoring, and identify underwater objects. In underwater internet of
    things (UIoTs), the sensor network nodes collect data and communicate with the
    cluster head. Furthermore, the received data has to transmit with a base station
    for subsequent analysis. The IoUTs structure enables the UVLC link to be classified
    into two major categories: horizontal and slant communication systems. Described
    in more detail, the horizontal link has been an extensively focused study on increasing
    data rate and signal propagation length along with reducing underwater turbulence
    effects while slant links formed high depth considering wave height wind speed,
    sea surface slope, and heavy turbulence conditions. On the other hand, in the
    vertical link for high depth, pressure increases up to 10bar for each k th layer
    (each layer for k=10m ) in addition temperature decreases from 250C to freezing
    point, the above matter facts due to varying salinity which affects the refractive
    index. SECTION XIV. Underwater Optical Wireless Network Applications Oceans are
    mysterious and challenging water bodies to explore. Plenty of natural disasters
    such as volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and tsunamis occur by imbalanced water
    phenomena that could be observed and monitored by deploying communication links.
    To address the requirement of current emerging underwater applications which have
    been used in the context of rising water level, environmental monitoring, marine
    life, early detection tsunami, oil and gas rigs exploration, volcanic eruptions,
    coastal securities, and sliding tectonic plates, jointly with various hybrid wireless
    communication systems. Moreover, undersea wireless communication over long distances,
    UWSN plays an essential role in data transmission. The traditional acoustic modems
    are widely used in long-range UWC, whether low speed (approximately 1500 m/s)
    in such complexity of water channel conditions [318]. In more contrast, for high
    depth, the floating nodes AUVs, and UAVs are used to transfer information from
    source to destination. RF waves transmission show poor performance in an underwater
    environment cause the EM waves propagation depend on the intrinsic properties
    of the channel. Contrarily, the water medium has more density, permittivity, and
    higher electrical conductivity than air. Therefore, RF waves easily attenuate
    when propagating over successive distances [94]. For such transmission scenarios,
    a high data rate cooperative dual-hop RF-UVLC and FSO/UVLC systems are needed
    to be deployed [48], [180] [319]. As, VLC provides a high capacity of data rate
    over moderate distances, an acceptable wireless media for underwater mapping,
    and real-time video streaming with high resolution and various UVLC applications
    as follows. A. Ocean Floor Bathymetry The study of exploring the ocean floor is
    referred to the depths and shape of the underwater terrain [320], as stated bathymetry
    is the most significant investigation that deploys in numerous underwater applications.
    Additionally, the collection of geographical and oceanographic data analysis updates
    of weather and natural hazards on our earth. The massive water reservoirs are
    still unmapped, unexplored, and unobserved sectors. Only a very few oceanic portions
    have been mapped systematically by direct measurement [127]. The rest of the unexplored
    fraction of oceans are predicted by the satellite altimeter data, which is the
    approximated estimation structure of the seabed. A newly sounding technique is
    proposed that supports measuring ocean depth over less than 18% of the seafloor
    resolution about 1km [321]. Furthermore, the two most significant seafloor mapping
    techniques are proposed as Single Beam Echo-Sounders (SBES) [127], [322] and Multi-beam
    Echo-Sounders (MBES) [127], [323], respectively. The use of the two-way travel
    time of sound waves methodologies are used for measurement sea depth directly,
    where the sound waves strike with the seabed. On the other hand, in the MBES system,
    the enabled fan generates sound waves for further data collection. These sound
    waves are responsible for re-echoing signals generated in areas of the strait
    perpendicular to that fan, leading to the ocean floor mapping. Therefore, the
    established system receives hundreds of beams capable of mapping the narrow sectors
    up to 150 degrees. B. Underwater Environmental Exploration and Monitoring Most
    of the underwater environmental monitoring applications are related explicitly
    to observing manual and habitable activities in the oceanic environment. By deploying
    the UWSNs, the water pollution, water flows, and lives could be monitored. Additionally,
    the tectonic plate movement, underwater thunderstorms, earthquakes, and new formation
    of lands due to the eruption of volcanoes (the lava plays a significant role in
    forming a chunk of the island, etc.) being monitored. The floating nodes at different
    depths can observe and collect data of the 3D geometry of open oceans and terrains
    as human beings are highly interested in exploring the underwater environment
    since their existence. The scientific community is a witness in the exploration
    of less than 5% of oceans. A vast number of underwater applications are immersed
    by floating nodes as AUVs, ROVs, and UUVs for monitoring and observing the marine
    lives along with the three-dimensional geographical data within real-time scenario
    [283]. The study of monitoring water quality, pollution, impurities underwater
    is more challenging. Various water samples are being used to monitor water quality
    regarding the pH level, oxygen ( O 2 ), and ammonium nitrate ( N H 3 ). Moreover,
    the underwater monitoring also includes water macrophytes or hydrophytes, marine
    species, coral reefs, and algae for further analysis. In more contrast, environmental
    monitoring is also a fundamental approach through IoUT enabled applications which
    include the physio-chemical properties of water such as pressure, temperature,
    and variation in underwater are the main concerns [324]. The continuous monitoring
    of underwater helps to check remotely the pH water level. The water pollution
    monitoring is also substantial for the ecological system, especially for undersea
    species. IoUT provides an opportunity to explore the bottomless underwater reservoirs
    to discover lost human civilizations and lost treasure. Moreover, to identify
    the roughness of the seafloor, natural minerals, oil, and gas treasures. Many
    lost-treasure discoveries were made through the IoUTs. C. Navigation & Surveillance
    Oceans are highly complex and unguided water bodies which are 95% unexplored in
    scientific research. As a result, underwater navigation is more complicated than
    terrestrial basis. UWSNs are appropriate and the most suitable technological approach
    that supports navigation in hulking aqueous mediums. Especially, for navigation
    the 3D underwater sensor network (USN) localization system is investigated in
    [282]. In [282], the authors propose the superiority of 3D Underwater Sensor Positioning
    (USP) systematic planning, which is beneficial for improving localization capabilities
    over existing 3D sensor architectures with predictable, balanced communication
    underwater. An AUV-assisted localization scenario of USNs roaming across the underwater
    sensor fields is presented in [325]. A wide range of localization of acoustic
    network nodes in the underwater medium is summarized in open literature as in
    [326]–[332]. Since optical communication is a novel technique to implement the
    localization and navigation purposes. Therefore, the authors in [333] investigated
    the connectivity of underwater wireless optical sensor networks (UWOSNs) as the
    influential factor to the system performance. Most recently, an extensive study
    based on received signal strength to the centralized localization scheme is proposed
    in [13]. Counterpart surveillance is a more efficient tool for node detection
    for military purposes or coastal securities. AUVs are used as emerging communication
    nodes for surveillance and retrieving information for defense operations. A most
    recent survey summarized the AUV capabilities for underwater communication in
    [271]. The authors in [271] are widely discussed the possible underwater application
    through AUV such as signal transmission, localization, and navigation purposes
    where the RF waves are incapable of retrieving the digital information. D. Naval-Mine
    Reconnaissance As we know that underwater environments are highly deepest and
    massive water reservoirs, countless mines in oceans could be found by deploying
    UWSNs connecting with ships safe voyage or floating and operational activities.
    A recent work is proposed to design an underwater mine detection system in [334].
    The authors have suggested a model minefield that includes the type of mines to
    be detected and mine-clearing operations by deploying the sonar waves in the various
    depth of the oceanic environment. Another impressive work in the open literature,
    where the authors have proposed the detection of underwater mines in real-time
    scenarios [335]. In [335], an AUV floats at different depths with sonar waves
    transmission along with a camera for real-time observation. Naval mines are also
    a real threat to maritime and naval tactical operations. Underwater-based mines
    hide or buried by the high altitude of tides and water currents, even covered
    by muddy soil at the sea bottom [336]. In most of the conditions, the naval mines
    are undetectable by low-frequency ranges. To cope with this issue, the challenge
    is that a high-frequency range of sonar should be mounted through an AUV to detect
    or bathymetric data of naval mines. For instance, the ECA Group deals with the
    issues within an innovative technological solution to perform complex missions
    in hostile or harsh environments [336]. According to SOACYS, the first prototype
    in the form of a 5 to 40m longship is used to collect oceanic data 1 Teabyte within
    2400km of survey lines [337]. This small ship prototype is used for various applications
    such as UneXploded Ordnance (UXO), debris, boulders, pipelines/cables, marine
    archeology, sedimentary studies, etc. E. Border & Coastal Securities The border
    and coastal securities applications are mainly used to observe unwanted activities
    in coastal areas such as entry port security, land border security, and maritime
    border security. Taking account of these issues, USWNs an emerging technique for
    various military operations and are used for military communication purposes.
    These integral networking signals have a key role in providing such facilities
    to the military as surveillance, intelligence, localization, targeting positions,
    and tracking nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons. A high capacity command
    control communication system of ASELSAN is used to enhance situational awareness,
    accurate decision making, and faster response qualities in coastal and border
    security system solutions [338]. F. Seismic Monitoring and Ocean Sampling The
    oceans are extremely large water reservoirs that change over the time. The sensor
    nodes are the main advantageous communication networking tools for sampling and
    observing the underwater environment, collecting oceanographic data, and transmitting
    signals to the source (e.g., base stations, etc.). The floating sensor nodes could
    be deployed at high depth for ocean mapping and underwater sampling activities.
    Furthermore, earthquakes, tsunami, and floods are sudden and unexpected events
    that cause major catastrophy worldwide. Sudden slip of bedrock causes seismic
    waves that shake the ground. UWSNs are dedicated to monitoring seismic activities
    and recording data for early detection warning [339]. G. Future Direction UVLC
    has drawn attention to the futuristic deployment of UWC, which opens the doors
    of advanced wireless communication systems towards 5GB networking system in the
    nearest future. Currently, it is possible to transmit the data at high speed as
    well as the wireless energy transfer through the illumination phenomena of LEDs.
    UVLC has a fruitful future perspectives due to the wide range of popularity of
    LEDs all around the world [42]. Therefore, UVLC has shown potential acceptability
    for next-generation 5GB networking systems for further developments in the digital
    wireless generation of communication phase. LEDs are very cost-effective optical
    signaling elements that have more superiority over traditional wireless communication
    media. The light spectrum of the optical beam visible light and LED illumination
    is a comfortable illusion for aquatic species. Therefore, the essentiality for
    promising extensive research is required for more advanced, very cost-effective
    light-emitting and photon receiving detectors. The less expensive, tiny in size,
    less power consumption, and high compatibility with neighboring optical network
    UVLC claim the most significant wireless carriers. The traditional acoustic and
    RF wireless candidates are lagging behind for underwater signaling with low data-rate
    (few kbps); therefore UVLC fills the gap (Mbps to Gbps data transmission rates)
    of desired communication. In more contrast, the IoUT networks support the mobility
    of the devices in a very divisive medium within 3D channel coverage. Plenty of
    UWC applications enabled with ROVs, UUVs, and AUVs are widely employable with
    VLC format. The hybrid communication systems with 5GB networks are capable of
    connecting an enormous number of devices on terrestrial to underwater-based internet
    connecting things for further exploration of unguided oceanic sectors. The predictable
    scenario is establishing the underwater environment of the satellite becoming
    a universal digital communication sphere. As a substitute, UVLC supports high
    data rates (3Gb/s DMT VLC transmissions) [340] over short distances with low latency.
    SECTION XV. Conclusion UVLC approach builds up a wireless connection between terrestrial
    and floating nodes in an underwater environment. The possible solution to cope
    with the challenges and affecting factors of signal propagation are widely studied
    in this research. UVLC has become the most significant trade for signaling in
    aqueous mediums towards the futuristic 5GB wireless networking systems. The most
    recent advances through the current project schemes all around the globe to enhance
    the interest in marine industries along with various underwater applications are
    the main perspectives. The UVLC technological critics of signal propagation and
    channel impairments are the main issues due to the various types of underwater-based
    hybrid communication scenarios are summarized in this paper. Additionally, the
    architectural design of UWNs with higher modulation techniques is quite challenging
    to deploy over long-range communication in marine industries. Due to this, the
    different types of hybrid communication approaches are investigated according
    to requirements and geographical environments. The IoUTs play an ample role as
    a backbone in communication among transceivers. In the IoUT networks, the modems
    may contain some advanced signal tools for the purpose of achieving reliable high-data
    rates with diminishing influential factors such as noise and channel impairments
    in the correspondence of physical layers. This study contributes the solution
    of various range of channel impairment challenges and provides an overview of
    the latest projects schemes along with the future perspectives towards the 5GB
    networking system in this particular domain. Authors Figures References Citations

    \ walls (VGWs)—growing plants on vertical walls inside or outside\nbuildings—have\
    \ been suggested as a nature-based solution to improve air quality and comfort\n\
    in modern cities. However, as with other greenery systems (e.g., agriculture),\
    \ managing VGW\nsystems requires adequate temporal and spatial monitoring of the\
    \ plants as well as the surrounding\nenvironment. Remote sensing cameras and small,\
    \ low-cost sensors have become increasingly valuable\nfor conventional vegetation\
    \ monitoring; nevertheless, they have rarely been used in VGWs. In this\ndescriptive\
    \ paper, we present a ﬁrst-of-its-kind remote sensing high-throughput monitoring\
    \ system\nin a VGW workplace. The system includes low- and high-cost sensors,\
    \ thermal and hyperspectral\nremote sensing cameras, and in situ gas-exchange\
    \ measurements. In addition, air temperature,\nrelative humidity, and carbon dioxide\
    \ concentrations are constantly monitored in the operating\nworkplace room (scientiﬁc\
    \ computer lab) where the VGW is established, while data are continuously\nstreamed\
    \ online to an analytical and visualization web application. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\
    \ is used to\nautomatically monitor changes across the living wall. Preliminary\
    \ results of our unique monitoring\nsystem are presented under actual working\
    \ room conditions while discussing future directions and\npotential applications\
    \ of such a high-throughput remote sensing VGW system.\nKeywords: artiﬁcial intelligence\

    \ vertical\ngreen living wall (VGW)\n1. Vertical Green Living Walls (VGWs) as\
    \ an Urban Nature-Based Solution (NBS)\nNature-based solutions (NBSs) refer to\
    \ efforts aimed at tackling socio-environmental\nchallenges by the use of nature\
    \ through sustainable management. As part of NBS, the\nconcept of “green” cities\
    \ has been recommended for sustainable urban development [1,2].\nThe idea is to\
    \ introduce vegetation into spaces within the urban fabric to reduce the heat\n\
    island effect and air pollution in the city [3]. Such a solution could also support\
    \ efforts to\nachieve carbon-neutral cities since plants uptake CO2 from the environment.\
    \ The European\nCommission has proposed such a solution, which was recently adopted\
    \ by Horizon 2030\nas one of the potential strategies to meet the goal of carbon-free\
    \ cities [4].\nSince introducing new parks and gardens in the urban fabric is\
    \ not straightforward, as\nfree spaces are rarely found in modern cities, deploying\
    \ vertical greening systems may be\nthe optimal solution. Introducing vertical\
    \ green systems into the city where the vegetation\nis grown on new or existing\
    \ vertical walls has great potential as an NBS. These vertical\ngreen living systems\
    \ (VGSs) are presently found in indoor and outdoor environments\nthrough a plethora\
    \ of growing techniques [5–7]. However, the main challenge of such NBSs\nis understanding\
    \ how these VGSs respond to and affect the urban environment. Another\nRemote\

    \ direction, in this paper, we distinguish\nsuch systems from systems that grow\

    \ \n2 of 16 \n \nsuch NBSs is understanding how these VGSs respond to and affect\
    \ the urban environ-\nment. Another challenge is the management of such systems,\
    \ which requires a different \napproach than the conventional management of horizontal\

    \ vegetation on a vertical wall, where plants \ngrow mostly in the horizontal\
    \ direction (Figure 1a). We name such systems as vertical \ngreen wall (VGW) systems\
    \ and use this term throughout this paper. \n \nFigure 1. Front view of (a) the\
    \ VGW with its six main species and (b) the light intensity conditions \nacross\
    \ the wall (μmol photons m−2 s−1). Light intensity was measured perpendicular\
    \ to the wall in \n120 points (leaves) across the wall, with an average distance\
    \ of 30 cm from each other. The vertical \nmap shown in (b) was generated using\
    \ multilevel b-spline interpolation in QGIS. \nWhile extensive research exists\
    \ on the effects of cooling [8] and humidity regulation \n[9,10], as well as the\
    \ reduction in air pollutants [11–13], carbon dioxide [14], and particu-\nlate\
    \ matter [15,16], of both indoor and outdoor VGSs and VGWs, most of the studies\
    \ are \nfocused on conventional horizontal planting systems and traditional potted\
    \ plants. Since \nthe vertical living wall approaches are a recent innovation,\
    \ little is known about the po-\ntential impacts of such new horticultural living\
    \ walls, known as VGW systems, on indoor \nair quality and comfort [17]. The increased\
    \ plant density of VGW systems, vertical align-\nment, and higher areal and microflora\
    \ exposure likely have distinct environmental im-\npacts compared with the traditional\
    \ potted systems [18,19]. \nThe little-known fact about these systems through\
    \ the few existing studies is that \nindoor VGW systems can reduce formaldehyde\
    \ [20] and efficiently filter indoor particu-\nlate matter [11]. Recent studies\
    \ also showed that VGW systems can reduce indoor carbon \ndioxide [14]. However,\
    \ most of these studies are held in small cells or tiny room spaces \nunder controlled\
    \ conditions. High levels of indoor carbon dioxide are known to affect \nworking\
    \ performance. For example, research conducted at the Harvard T.H. Chan School\
    \ \nof Public Health showed that office workers increased their cognitive performance\
    \ when \nexposed to a more ventilated room with lower carbon dioxide levels [21].\
    \ Thus, indoor \nVGWs can potentially improve indoor air quality in workplaces,\
    \ providing the required \nenvironment for better working conditions. However,\
    \ a major challenge remains the spa-\ntiotemporally continuous monitoring of the\
    \ performance of the VGW and its effect on the \nsurrounding environment. \n10\

    \ showed that ofﬁce workers increased their cognitive performance when\nexposed\
    \ to a more ventilated room with lower carbon dioxide levels [21]. Thus, indoor\n\
    VGWs can potentially improve indoor air quality in workplaces, providing the required\n\
    environment for better working conditions. However, a major challenge remains\
    \ the\nspatiotemporally continuous monitoring of the performance of the VGW and\
    \ its effect on\nthe surrounding environment.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3485\n3\
    \ of 16\n2. Using Remote-Sensing-Based Precision Agriculture Tools in VGWs\nIn\
    \ terms of effect, the spatial dimension of the VGW system is crucial. To provide\n\
    recommendations regarding the total area of the VGW system needed to reduce carbon\n\
    dioxide in a room with a speciﬁc volume, for example, it is necessary to assess\
    \ its spatial\neffect, which includes knowing the response at a given planting\
    \ density as well as the plant\ntype response to ambient and elevated CO2 conditions.\
    \ While most studies explore the\neffects of living systems by measuring air quality\
    \ in the room, how different wall parts react\nto their surrounding environment\
    \ is still unknown. This effect may further change across\nthe wall and through\
    \ time. The same plant, for example, may respond differently due to\nits position\
    \ in the wall because of the different exposure to local environmental conditions\n\
    (e.g., light, ventilation, water supply, etc.). This spatial information is required\
    \ to monitor\nand manage such systems properly.\nToday, VGWs are expected to be\
    \ automatically or semi-automatically maintained to\nbecome efﬁcient systems.\
    \ In that sense, proximal sensing, using cameras that measure\nthe spectral and\
    \ thermal signals reﬂected and emitted by the plants on the wall, can be\nleveraged\
    \ to monitor variations across the VGW as well as to effectively manage such\n\
    systems through smart decision support systems. Using proximal and remote sensing\
    \ to\ntrack the performance of VGWs in carbon dioxide and temperature reduction\
    \ capacity\nwhile associating spatial changes across the wall to variations in\
    \ indoor environmental\nconditions is a promising management solution for these\
    \ innovative NBS systems [22].\nThe general idea is to deploy precision agriculture\
    \ techniques developed and used in\nconventional farming (horizontal vegetation\
    \ systems) in VGW systems. For example, the\nphotochemical reﬂectance index (PRI),\
    \ which is based on spectral data acquired from proxi-\nmal or remote sensing,\
    \ was found to be associated with volatile organic compounds [23], as\nwell as\
    \ photosynthetic traits [24,25]. Thus, using spectral images of the proper wavelength\n\
    bands may allow the generation of the wall’s PRI maps through time. This information\
    \ may\nbe beneﬁcial to monitoring changes in CO2 uptake across the wall, helping\
    \ automatically or\nsemi-automatically manage the VGW system and improving its\
    \ efﬁcacy in reducing indoor\ncarbon dioxide concentrations. Models driven by\
    \ spectral-based vegetation indices [26–28]\ncan be used to provide a spatial\
    \ assessment of the plants’ water use and carbon uptake rates\nacross the VGW.\
    \ Thermal information, commonly used to assess water stress conditions in\ncrops\
    \ and trees [29–31], may also be used to determine transpiration rates across\
    \ the VGW\nsystem for irrigation control purposes.\nThis short descriptive paper\
    \ presents a ﬁrst-of-its-kind high-throughput monitoring\nsystem of an indoor\
    \ VGW that includes low- and high-cost sensors, thermal and hyperspec-\ntral remote\
    \ sensing, and in situ gas-exchange measurements. In addition, air temperature,\n\
    relative humidity, and carbon dioxide concentrations are constantly monitored\
    \ in an oper-\nating workplace room (scientiﬁc computer lab) where the VGW is\
    \ established, while data\nare continuously streamed online to an analytical and\
    \ visualization web application. We\nshow preliminary results of our monitoring\
    \ system under actual working room conditions,\ndiscussing future directions and\
    \ potential applications of such a sensing high-throughput\nmonitoring VGW system.\n\

    \ is directly transplanted\ninto several layers of clothing, which are adhered\
    \ to the wall [32]. Irrigation is applied\ndaily (7 am) from the top of the wall\
    \ via a computer-based drip irrigation system. Water is\ncollected at the bottom\
    \ through a drainage system that streams the water back to a 200 L\ntank placed\

    C3\nNorth and\nSouth America\n15–26\n3.1.1. Peperomia obtusifolia\nUsually called\
    \ “baby rubber plant”, “American rubber plant”, or “pepper face”, this\nplant\
    \ has relatively smooth and thick round leaves. Peperomia is native to Mexico,\
    \ South\nAmerica, and West Indies. The plant can reach a height of 30 cm. It prefers\
    \ bright indirect\nlight conditions. Ideal temperatures for this species range\
    \ from 16 ◦C to 26 ◦C, and\npH from 6 to 8 [33]. According to the American Society\
    \ for the Prevention of Cruelty to\nAnimals, P. obtusifolia is non-toxic for humans\
    \ and animals [34].\n3.1.2. Tradescantia spathacea\nAlso known as “Moses in the\
    \ cradle”, “boat lily”, and “wandering jew”, this plant\nis native to tropical\
    \ areas such as Belize, Guatemala, and southern Mexico. It can be an\nunderstory\
    \ plant in coastal forests, shrublands, pinelands, hammocks, secondary forests,\n\
    cultivated grounds, and disturbed areas from sea level to low elevations [35].\
    \ T. spathacea\nmay reach a maximum height of 30–50 cm. It is a very fast-growing\
    \ species, easy to\nmaintain. T. spathacea preferred conditions are warm and humid,\
    \ with temperatures\nranging from 14 ◦C to 27 ◦C [36]. It can be found in indoor\
    \ and outdoor growing systems.\nT. spathacea can be toxic to animals and humans\
    \ [37].\n3.1.3. Chlorophytum comosum\nUsually known as the “spider plant”, this\
    \ is a perennial ﬂowering plant native to\ntropical and southern Africa but was\
    \ introduced to other parts of the world, such as western\nAustralia [38]. It\
    \ is easy to grow as a houseplant, prospering under various environmental\nconditions.\
    \ C. comosum is well-known for its medicinal characteristics [38]. The ideal\n\
    temperatures in which this species grow and develop range from 15 ◦C to 30 ◦C,\
    \ with pH\nrecommended levels of 6 to 6.5. C. comosum was found by the NASA Clean\
    \ Air Study to\neffectively remove common household air toxins such as formaldehyde\
    \ and xylene [39]. It\nis not toxic to animals and humans [34].\n3.1.4. Spathiphyllum\
    \ wallisii\nUsually called “peace lily”, it is a genus of more than 47 species\
    \ of monocotyledonous\nﬂowering plants from the Araceae family, which are very\
    \ popular as indoor house plants.\nThis species is native to tropical regions\
    \ of the Americas and southeastern Asia. The\nevergreen herbaceous perennial plants\
    \ have large leaves of 12–65 cm long and 3–25 cm\nbroad. The ﬂowers are produced\
    \ in a spadix, surrounded by a white, yellowish, or greenish\nRemote Sens. 2022,\
    \ 14, 3485\n6 of 16\nspathe. Spathiphyllum requires relatively small amounts of\
    \ light and water. It is also known\nto remove household air toxins such as benzene\
    \ and formaldehyde [39]. Recommended\npH levels for this species are 5.6 to 6.5.\
    \ S. wallisii can be toxic to animals and humans [40].\n3.1.5. Aeschynanthus radicans\n\
    This plant is usually named “Monalisa” and “lipstick plant” because of its beautiful,\n\
    red-colored scarlet ﬂowers that open from buds resembling lipstick tubes. It is\
    \ native to\nMalaysia and may grow to a height of 1.5 m. The ideal temperature\
    \ for this species is 15 to\n30 ◦C, with required pH levels of 6–8. The Monalisa\
    \ is non-toxic to animals and humans [34].\nIts best light conditions are bright\
    \ indirect light, best grown indoors.\n3.1.6. Philodendron hederaceum\nPhilodendron\
    \ is an evergreen climber plant native to North and South American tropical\n\
    areas [41]. Taxonomically, the genus Philodendron is still poorly known, with\
    \ many unde-\nscribed species. It can grow to a height of 3–6 m, with a temperature\
    \ requirement of 15 to\n26 ◦C and pH levels ranging between 4.5 and 6. The recommended\
    \ light conditions are\nmoderate-to-bright diffusive light. P. hederaceum can\
    \ be toxic to animals and humans [40].\n3.2. The Working Space and Its Indoor\
    \ Environmental Monitoring System\nThe M&M-VS lab is an Agritech workplace of\
    \ approximately 46 m2, with a total\nvolume of about 140 m3. The lab is equipped\
    \ with desktop workstations, and typically 2 to\n8 students work in the lab simultaneously.\
    \ Typical working hours are from 8 am to 8 pm.\nAir conditioning in the room is\
    \ set at 25 ◦C, and fresh air is supplied through a mixing\nventilation system\
    \ (from the top) with an air exchange rate of 0.25–1.5 h−1.\nThe indoor conditions\
    \ were continuously monitored via a set of sensors, including air\ntemperature\
    \ and relative humidity (RH) sensors (T/RH sensors of Xiaomi, Beijing, China,\n\
    and an HMP155 sensor, Vaisala, Finland) distributed across the room in the horizontal\
    \ and\nvertical directions (Figure 2). In addition, a people-counting sensor was\
    \ placed at the lab\nentrance to monitor the number of people in the room at any\
    \ given time. A series of 10 inlet\ntubes injected air into a gas analyzer (Serinus\
    \ 31, Ecotech Pty Ltd., Sydney, Australia),\nlocated behind the wall, at different\
    \ distances from the VGW (0.1, 0.35, 0.8, 2, and 3 m\nfrom the wall and 0.8 m\
    \ from the top) and to varying heights near the wall (at a distance of\n10 cm\
    \ from the wall and 0.8, 1.2, 1.9, and 2.5 m from the top) in addition to two\
    \ external\ninlet tubes that sample the outdoor air at the northern and southern\
    \ sides of the building\n(Figure 2). The eight internal and two outer tubes provided\
    \ horizontal and vertical CO2\nproﬁles across the transect from the wall towards\
    \ the room’s center and from the top to the\nﬂoor, as well as outdoor CO2 conditions.\n\
    The CO2 sampling was conducted via a microswitch system that injects air from\n\
    10 inlet tubes for 3 min each. The sampled air was streamed from the inlet tube\
    \ to the\ngas analyzer at a constant rate using a 1 L reciprocating vacuum pump.\
    \ To avoid air\ncontamination from the previous tube, we wrote a Python code that\
    \ excludes the ﬁrst\ntwo minutes of data after the valve opens. That way, we could\
    \ investigate the “clean”\nair from the speciﬁc opened tube. This resulted in\
    \ a 30 min cycle of the 10 sampling\ntubes at different distances and heights\
    \ from the VGW (see “CO2 inlet” in Figure 2). Air\ntemperature, RH, and solar\
    \ radiation were also monitored outside the building (Figure 2).\nData were streamed\
    \ to and displayed in, Grafana, a multiplatform, open-source\nanalytics and interactive\
    \ data-visualization web application (https://grafana.com; accessed\non 1 June\
    \ 2022). This enables a continuous, real-time data visualization at a relatively\
    \ high\nfrequency, with some basic, on-the-ﬂy analytical capabilities (Figure\
    \ 3).\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3485\n7 of 16\ndifferent distances and heights from\

    \ \n3.3. Leaf Level Gas Exchange Measurements \nWe used LiCOR devices (LI-6800\
    \ and LI-600, LiCOR, NE, USA; Figure 4a,b) to mon-\nitor level leaf gas-exchange\
    \ rates. Measurements of leaf transpiration, CO2 assimilation, \nand stomatal\
    \ conductance were conducted periodically once every three weeks on aver-\nage\
    \ on each of the six species to characterize their light use efficiencies and\
    \ carbon uptake \ncapacities. A total of three leaves were sampled per species\
    \ per date to maintain a mini-\nmum interval of time between the leaf measurements\
    \ and the images. In addition, the \nactual transpiration was measured with the\
    \ LI-600 porometer on a total of 60 to 90 random \nleaves across the wall (10–15\
    \ leaves per species) every month. \nOur preliminary single leaf results showed\
    \ that the six species grown on the indoor \nVGW had a diverse response to increasing\
    \ ambient CO2 concentrations (Figure 4c).  \nSince intercellular CO2 concentration\
    \ (Ci) can be taken as 70% of the ambient concen-\ntration in C3 plants [42],\
    \ the A–Ci curve can provide information regarding the effective-\nness of the\
    \ species in reducing CO2 levels in the room through the process of carbon as-\n\
    similation. For example, Peperomia seemed to reach a maximum assimilation rate\
    \ of ~7 \nμmol m−2 s−1 at 600 ppmv (light green arrow in Figure 4c). At the same\
    \ time, Philodendron, \nwhich had the lowest response to elevated CO2 with ~5\
    \ μmol m−2 s−1, reached its maxi-\nmum assimilation capacity at a much lower intercellular\
    \ CO2 concentration (Ci) of only \n300 ppmv (dark green arrow in Figure 4c). This\
    \ means that, under light conditions of 300 \nμmol photons m−2 s−1, Peperomia\
    \ was 40% more efficient in reducing indoor CO2 concen-\ntrations, with increased\
    \ assimilation up to 600 ppm. This information can help us design \nFigure 3.\

    \ Measurements\nWe used LiCOR devices (LI-6800 and LI-600, LiCOR, NE, USA; Figure\
    \ 4a,b) to monitor\nlevel leaf gas-exchange rates. Measurements of leaf transpiration,\
    \ CO2 assimilation, and\nstomatal conductance were conducted periodically once\
    \ every three weeks on average\non each of the six species to characterize their\
    \ light use efﬁciencies and carbon uptake\ncapacities. A total of three leaves\
    \ were sampled per species per date to maintain a minimum\ninterval of time between\
    \ the leaf measurements and the images. In addition, the actual\ntranspiration\
    \ was measured with the LI-600 porometer on a total of 60 to 90 random leaves\n\
    across the wall (10–15 leaves per species) every month.\nOur preliminary single\
    \ leaf results showed that the six species grown on the indoor\nVGW had a diverse\
    \ response to increasing ambient CO2 concentrations (Figure 4c).\nSince intercellular\
    \ CO2 concentration (Ci) can be taken as 70% of the ambient concen-\ntration in\
    \ C3 plants [42], the A–Ci curve can provide information regarding the effectiveness\n\
    of the species in reducing CO2 levels in the room through the process of carbon\
    \ assimilation.\nFor example, Peperomia seemed to reach a maximum assimilation\
    \ rate of ~7 µmol m−2 s−1\nat 600 ppmv (light green arrow in Figure 4c). At the\
    \ same time, Philodendron, which had the\nlowest response to elevated CO2 with\
    \ ~5 µmol m−2 s−1, reached its maximum assimilation\ncapacity at a much lower\
    \ intercellular CO2 concentration (Ci) of only 300 ppmv (dark green\narrow in\
    \ Figure 4c). This means that, under light conditions of 300 µmol photons m−2\
    \ s−1,\nPeperomia was 40% more efﬁcient in reducing indoor CO2 concentrations,\
    \ with increased\nassimilation up to 600 ppm. This information can help us design\
    \ VGWs with speciﬁc\nspecies at speciﬁc light conditions and at the required density\

    Merzlyak index 1\n750 nm\n550 nm\nThe GM1 was developed based on the sensitivity\
    \ of the 550 nm band\nto a wide range of chlorophyll variations. It is a useful\
    \ index for\nmonitoring plant chlorophyll content and photosynthetic capacity.\n\
    ZMI [50]\nZarco-Tejada and\nMiller index\n750 nm\n710 nm\nThe ZMI, based on the\
    \ red-edge band, was developed to assess\nchanges in available pigment content\
    \ in leaves and over canopies.\nPRI [51]\nPhotochemical\nreﬂectance index\n531\
    \ nm − 570 nm\n531 nm + 570 nm\nThe PRI uses the 531 nm band, which is sensitive\
    \ to variations\nin the dissipation of light energy via xanthophyll de-epoxidation.\n\
    It is related to the fast transition in the xanthophyll cycle,\nmaking it a good\
    \ proxy of the plant light use efﬁciency,\nan important factor in the photosynthetic\
    \ process.\nCtr1 [52]\nCarter index 1\n695 nm\n420 nm\nThe Ctr1 features the 695\
    \ and 420 nm bands, which are sensitive to\nchanges in total chlorophyll concentrations,\
    \ especially under stress.\nIt has been used for the early detection of stresses\
    \ in plants.\nNDVI [53]\nNormalized difference\nvegetation index\n790 nm − 670\
    \ nm\n790 nm + 670 nm\nThe NDVI is the most commonly used vegetation index in\
    \ proximal\nand remote sensing [46]. It has been used to measure the state of\
    \ plant\nhealth as well as its phenology and leaf area index. It is also a useful\n\
    index for estimating vegetation biomass and productivity [47].\nFigure 6 shows\

    \ serve as a pilot for the automatic (or semi-automatic) moni-\ntoring of indoor/outdoor\

    \ take the unprocessed remote sensing data and produce meaningful information\n\
    that will aid in managing VGWs (e.g., [26,27,62]). However, combining spectral\
    \ indices,\nsuch as those presented in this study, with gas exchange and other\
    \ biophysical parameters\nmay help produce a spatially continuous picture of the\
    \ status of the living wall. Thermal\ninformation may also assist in detecting\
    \ early stresses [22,31] or quantifying the plant’s\nwater use [29]. Such models\
    \ can produce spatially continuous, real-time status maps of\nthe VGW.\nRemote\
    \ Sens. 2022, 14, 3485\n13 of 16\nThe next step is to use this information to\
    \ learn about the functioning of VGWs\nand their feedback and impact on the surrounding\
    \ environment. Such a step is essential\nto improve indoor and outdoor conditions\
    \ more efﬁciently. Artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)\nmay play a critical role in this\
    \ task. AI algorithms are already being used to accurately\nacquire information\
    \ about indoor environmental quality from low-cost sensors [63]. In\nthis context,\
    \ AI can be combined with remote sensing to detect plant disease, which may\n\
    assist in managing VGWs [64]. Hyperspectral data can be leveraged to alert on\
    \ disease\ndevelopment across the living wall even before it is detected by our\
    \ bare eyes or the use of\nRGB images.\nAnomaly detection using AI was also shown\
    \ to support the predictive maintenance of\nVGWs’ indoor environment [65]. The\
    \ core task to achieve VGWs’ predictive maintenance\nis to recognize anomalous\
    \ changes as early as possible across the wall (from time series of\nremote sensing\
    \ images) and in the indoor environment (from low-cost sensors spread across\n\
    the room). A decision support system can then be used to control and manipulate\
    \ the VGW\nconditions through, for example, changing the light conditions, irrigation\
    \ scheme, and room\nventilation rate. This idea of combining low-cost sensors,\
    \ remote sensing imaging, and AI\nin a decision support system is already being\
    \ implemented in conventional agriculture\n(e.g., [66–68]). However, this might\
    \ require special adjustments to indoor VGW systems,\nwhich must be guided through\
    \ further research. In the meantime, more VGW monitoring\nsystems such as the\
    \ one described in this paper may open new opportunities to develop\nsmart techniques\
    \ for managing VGWs and study these systems under different conditions\nand with\
    \ various plant species and monitoring solutions.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization,\

    Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: With the emergence of the Internet-of-Things
    (IoT), artificial intelligence, and communication technologies, cyber-physical
    systems (CPS) have revolutionized the engineering paradigm with profound applications
    in many aspects of society including homes, energy, agriculture, health-care,
    transportation, business, and manufacturing. A CPS uses suitable computational
    techniques such as game theory to enable different entities to interact with one
    another for taking necessary actions to obtain selected objectives. Recent literature
    on CPS has extensively used game theory to approach a variety of technical challenges.
    In order to make these contributions more accessible to a broader audience, there
    is a need for studies that can provide readers with a comprehensive understanding
    of different types of CPS and their attributes, then clearly outline why game
    theory is relevant for modeling different aspects of CPS, and also discuss how
    game theory has been used in relevant literature to date. This paper bridges this
    gap by 1) providing a general discussion of different types of CPS and their characteristics;
    2) giving an overview of different types of game-theoretic approaches; 3) explaining
    why game theory is appropriate for modeling different types of CPS; and 4) finally,
    studying how game theory has been used in different CPS types to address their
    challenges. Further, we also identify some key research challenges for future
    investigation where game theory could be applied as a potential solution. This
    graphical abstract shows how different levels of a cyber-physical system are integrated
    together to collect real-time data from the physical world, construct a cyber...View

    \ key factors inﬂuencing smart building integration into smart cities\nconsidering\
    \ the city as a technological system. This paper begins with an overview of the\
    \ concept of\nsmart buildings, deﬁning their features and discussing the technological\
    \ advancements driving their\ndevelopment. The frameworks for smart buildings\
    \ are presented, emphasizing energy efﬁciency,\nsustainability, automation, and\
    \ data analytics. Then, the concept of a smart city and the role of\ndigitalization\
    \ in its development is explored. The conceptual framework of smart building into\
    \ a\nsmart city is presented, contributing to understanding the complex process\
    \ of integrating smart\nbuildings into smart cities. Further research delves into\
    \ the factors inﬂuencing the integration of\nsmart buildings into smart cities,\
    \ focusing on energy, mobility, water, security systems, and waste\nmanagement\
    \ infrastructure domains. Each thematic area is examined, highlighting the importance\n\
    of integration and the associated challenges and opportunities, based on research\
    \ in the literature\nand the analysis of case studies. This enables the identiﬁcation\
    \ of 26 factors inﬂuencing integration\nand the synthesis of ﬁndings. The ﬁndings\
    \ indicate that the successful integration of smart buildings\ninto smart cities\
    \ requires attention to multiple factors related to smart energy, smart mobility,\
    \ smart\nwater, smart security, and smart waste management infrastructures. The\
    \ results obtained from this\nresearch provide valuable insights into the factors\
    \ inﬂuencing smart building integration into a smart\ncity from a technological\
    \ perspective, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions and develop\n\
    strategies paving the way for sustainable, resilient, and efﬁcient urban environments.\n\

    \ smart energy; smart\nmobility; smart water; smart security systems; smart waste\
    \ management\n1. Introduction\nThe rapid urbanization trend is expected to continue,\
    \ with an estimated 4.6 billion\npeople, accounting for 58% of the global population,\
    \ residing in urban areas by 2025. This\nproportion may reach as high as 81% in\
    \ certain developed regions. This demographic\nshift presents signiﬁcant challenges\
    \ for city planners, who must devise strategies to ensure\nsustainable living\
    \ conditions for the growing urban population [1]. One potential solution\nlies\
    \ in the development of smart cities and smart buildings. However, the lack of\
    \ a\nuniversally accepted deﬁnition for these concepts poses a challenge, making\
    \ it essential to\ngain a comprehensive understanding and establish a consensus\
    \ on the precise meaning of\nsmart cities and smart buildings.\nBy embracing the\
    \ principles of smart cities and integrating smart buildings into urban\ninfrastructure,\
    \ cities can enhance their efﬁciency, sustainability, and quality of life [2].\n\
    The concept of a smart city encompasses various infrastructure domains such as\
    \ energy,\nmobility, water, security, and waste management, where digital technologies\
    \ and data-\ndriven solutions play a crucial role [3]. Similarly, smart buildings\
    \ embody advanced\ntechnologies and systems that optimize resource utilization,\
    \ improve occupant comfort,\nand enable efﬁcient operation and management [4].\n\

    alities proposed by various smart city infrastructure domains and, reciprocally,\
    \ leverage the\nrecommended features of smart building services to beneﬁt the\
    \ surrounding systems [2].\nHowever, in many cases, urban infrastructure components\

    The integration of smart building features suggested by smart city infrastructure\n\
    domains implies that buildings should be designed to facilitate seamless interaction\
    \ with\nexisting and anticipated city infrastructure [7]. Potential strategies\
    \ may involve the inte-\ngration of intelligent infrastructure within urban areas,\

    \ energy consumption [8], establishing con-\nnections between smart buildings\

    \ intelligent waste management systems that align with the\ncity’s existing waste\

    \ Building\nThe concept of a smart building has gained signiﬁcant attention in\
    \ the context of\ncreating sustainable, energy-efﬁcient, and intelligent built\
    \ environments.\nSmart buildings possess several key features that set them apart\
    \ from traditional build-\nings. Firstly, they incorporate automated systems for\
    \ environmental control, including\nheating, ventilation, air conditioning (HVAC),\
    \ lighting, and shading. These systems use\nreal-time data from sensors to adjust\
    \ settings based on occupancy, weather conditions, and\nenergy consumption patterns,\
    \ leading to energy efﬁciency and enhanced occupant com-\nfort [16]. Secondly,\
    \ smart buildings employ advanced building management systems (BMS)\nthat integrate\
    \ various subsystems and devices into a centralized platform. This allows for\n\
    centralized monitoring, control, and analysis of building operations, leading\
    \ to improved\noperational efﬁciency, predictive maintenance, and proactive decision\
    \ making [17].\nMoreover, smart buildings leverage data analytics and machine\
    \ learning algorithms\nto derive insights from collected data. By analyzing patterns,\
    \ trends, and anomalies, these\nbuildings can optimize resource utilization, identify\
    \ energy-saving opportunities, and\nanticipate maintenance needs [18]. The use\
    \ of data-driven insights enables continuous\nimprovement and adaptability within\
    \ smart buildings. The development of smart buildings\nis driven by various technological\
    \ advancements. Firstly, the proliferation of sensing\ntechnologies and IoT devices\
    \ has made it possible to collect real-time data on building\nperformance, occupancy,\
    \ and environmental conditions. These sensors provide valuable\ninputs for monitoring,\
    \ control, and optimization strategies [19].\nFurthermore, advancements in data\
    \ analytics and cloud computing enable the process-\ning and storage of vast amounts\
    \ of data generated by smart buildings. Machine learning\nalgorithms can analyze\
    \ this data to extract meaningful insights and support decision-\nmaking processes\
    \ [20]. Cloud-based platforms also enable remote access, monitoring, and\ncontrol\
    \ of smart building systems, enhancing operational ﬂexibility and scalability\
    \ [21].\nAdditionally, the emergence of edge computing and wireless communication\
    \ technologies\nfacilitates real-time data processing and reduces latency in smart\
    \ building applications [22].\nEdge devices, such as edge servers and gateways,\
    \ enable local data processing and analysis,\nenhancing the responsiveness and\
    \ efﬁciency of smart building systems.\nSmart buildings intelligently control\
    \ internal environments by integrating building\nsystems on a single network and\
    \ adapting characteristics of construction materials and\nfaçade elements to changing\
    \ usage and weather conditions. Furthermore, a crucial feature\nof a smart building\
    \ is the provision of building services that optimize occupant productivity\n\
    while simultaneously reducing costs and minimizing environmental impact. Technological\n\
    advancements in regulating the interior environment have led to the emergence\
    \ of smart\nbuildings as responsive and controlled environments for inhabitants,\
    \ companies, and\nsociety [23]. The objective of smart buildings is to achieve\
    \ a state of self-management,\nlearning, prediction, and adaptation without requiring\
    \ any intervention or awareness\nfrom their occupants. Sensors and monitors can\
    \ expeditiously and autonomously modify\nambient temperatures, illumination, shading,\
    \ energy efﬁciency, and water usage. One of\nthe applications of the IoT in urban\
    \ contexts is the utilization of ICT to enhance the quality\nof life for occupants\
    \ in smart building environments [24].\n2.2. Smart Building Evaluation Frameworks\n\
    Smart buildings are designed to meet speciﬁc requirements and follow established\n\
    frameworks that guide their development and operation. One of the primary requirements\n\
    for smart buildings is energy efﬁciency. Energy consumption in buildings accounts\
    \ for\na signiﬁcant portion of global energy use, making energy efﬁciency a crucial\
    \ consider-\nation in smart building design [8]. Energy-efﬁcient systems, such\
    \ as high-performance\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1835\nHVAC systems, advanced lighting\
    \ controls, and smart metering, are integrated into smart\nbuildings to minimize\
    \ energy consumption and reduce environmental impact [25]. Energy\nperformance\
    \ certiﬁcation (EPC) is a system that rates the energy efﬁciency of buildings.\n\
    Smart building is considered to compile the features of a sustainable building\
    \ as\nwell [15]. In this regard, BREEAM, LEED, DGNB, and other national-level\
    \ frameworks\nare established to guide the design, implementation, and evaluation\
    \ of sustainable build-\nings. The European Commission recently launched LEVEL(s),\
    \ a framework for sustainable\nbuildings that connects the speciﬁc performance\
    \ of the building to European policy objec-\ntives [26].\nAutomation is another\
    \ essential aspect of smart building requirements. Automation\nalso enables the\
    \ implementation of advanced features like adaptive lighting, predictive\nmaintenance,\
    \ and demand response [27]. Building management systems (BMS) and build-\ning\
    \ automation and control systems (BACS) are used for the integration and interoperability\n\
    of various building systems, including HVAC, lighting, security, and ﬁre safety\
    \ [28]. The\nBMS focuses on centralized monitoring, control, and optimization,\
    \ enabling the seamless\noperation of these systems within smart buildings.\n\
    In relation to automation and BMS, some frameworks were developed to assess the\n\
    smartness of buildings, including, for example, the smart readiness indicator\
    \ (SRI) and\nSPIRE. The SRI framework was introduced by the European Commission\
    \ in 2018 and\nused to assess the preparedness of buildings for smart technologies\
    \ [29]. It consists of\nthree pillars: systems integration, real-time data, and\
    \ human-centered design. The SRI\nframework is an extensive methodology for determining\
    \ a building’s readiness to exploit\nsmart technologies. The SPIRE program, which\
    \ has been created by UL Solutions (a\nglobal leader in applied safety science),\
    \ is a certiﬁcation initiative that centers on the\nkey aspects of sustainability,\
    \ performance, innovation, reliability, and user-friendliness in\nthe context\
    \ of smart buildings. The SPIRE technology is instrumental in promoting the\n\
    development of intelligent buildings and safeguarding their advantages for proprietors\n\
    and the ecosystem [30].\nData analytics plays a signiﬁcant role in smart building\
    \ frameworks. By collecting and\nanalyzing data from sensors, meters, and other\
    \ sources, smart buildings can derive valuable\ninsights to improve performance\
    \ and optimize operations. Data analytics techniques,\nincluding machine learning\
    \ and artiﬁcial intelligence, enable advanced functionalities\nsuch as anomaly\
    \ detection, fault diagnostics, and predictive analytics [20]. These insights\n\
    facilitate data-driven decision making and enable proactive maintenance, resulting\
    \ in\nimproved energy efﬁciency and reduced operational costs. Thus, by employing\
    \ data\nanalytics, digital twin platforms have emerged as powerful tools in the\
    \ context of smart\nbuilding frameworks.\nA digital twin is a virtual replica\
    \ of a physical building that is continuously updated\nwith real-time data from\
    \ sensors and other sources. The presented frameworks emphasize\ndifferent DT\
    \ maturity levels of the smart building management and control strategies in-\n\
    cluding reactive strategy (most buildings’ status), real-time based on IoT driven,\
    \ predictive\nstrategy, and proactive strategy [31]. However, certain challenges\
    \ might be faced in adopt-\ning digital twin platforms. First, the implementation\
    \ of digital twin technology requires a\nsigniﬁcant investment in sensor deployment\
    \ and data infrastructure. Additionally, data\nprivacy and security concerns must\
    \ be addressed when collecting and analyzing sensitive\nbuilding data. Safeguarding\
    \ the privacy of occupants and protecting the building’s systems\nfrom cyber threats\
    \ are critical considerations in the adoption of digital twin platforms [32].\n\
    Despite these challenges, the integration of digital twin (DT) platforms with\
    \ data analytics\nholds great potential for optimizing the performance and operations\
    \ of smart buildings, it\nis expected that digital twin platforms will play an\
    \ increasingly signiﬁcant role in shaping\nthe future of smart building frameworks.\n\
    As it was presented above, various assessment schemes might be applicable to evaluate\n\
    certain aspects of smart buildings. However, there is a huge challenge to combine\
    \ all these\naspects into one single framework.\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1836\n\
    3. Smart City\n3.1. Concept of Smart City\nThe concept of a smart city has undergone\
    \ signiﬁcant development and has garnered\nattention in both academic and practical\
    \ spheres. Over the years, various deﬁnitions\nand characteristics have been proposed\
    \ to capture the essence of a smart city. Table 1\nprovides a compilation of several\
    \ studies that conceptualize the smart city deﬁnition\nfrom a functional point\
    \ of view. These deﬁnitions highlight the signiﬁcance of human\ncapital, social\
    \ capital, information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure,\nnetwork\
    \ infrastructure, physical infrastructure, wireless sensor networks (WSNs), Internet\n\
    of things (IoT), technology revolution, and digital technology as integral components\
    \ of\nsmart cities [33].\nTable 1. Smart city deﬁnitions proposed by different\

    Digital solution\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1837\nIn addition, the concept of a smart\
    \ city emphasizes the ability to act proactively and\nadapt to changing circumstances\
    \ [34]. It embraces advanced technologies such as artiﬁcial\nintelligence (AI)\
    \ [42], data analytics, and automation to enable intelligent systems and\nservices.\
    \ The adaptive nature of smart city services, ICT systems, infrastructure, and\n\
    buildings is crucial for providing customized, efﬁcient, and responsive solutions\
    \ to the\nneeds of citizens [35,36].\nThe overarching goal of a smart city paradigm\
    \ is to achieve contemporary urban gov-\nernance by utilizing advanced technical\
    \ instruments and cutting-edge technologies while\nconsidering ecological norms\
    \ and optimizing resource consumption [40]. The integration\nof digital technologies,\
    \ data-driven solutions, and sustainable practices remains at the core\nof smart\
    \ city development. By leveraging these elements, smart cities strive to enhance\n\
    the quality of life, improve efﬁciency in urban operations, and create sustainable\
    \ urban\nenvironments for their residents.\nThe integration of smart and resilient\
    \ city concepts holds great potential for enhancing\nresiliency in numerous ways\
    \ [43]. Smart cities leverage technology to gather and analyze\ndata, which can\
    \ be utilized to identify and mitigate risks. With the large amount of\ndata acquired\
    \ by smart cities, data-driven decision making becomes possible, enabling\nproactive\
    \ risk assessment and resource allocation. Collaboration is essential for efﬁcient\n\
    solution development and implementation among smart and resilient cities, as well\
    \ as with\nvarious stakeholders such as enterprises, academics, and the general\
    \ public. Furthermore,\ninnovation is critical in embracing new technology and\
    \ techniques to handle shifting\ndifﬁculties [44].\n3.2. Role of Digitalization\
    \ in Smart Cities\nDigitalization plays a pivotal role in the development of smart\
    \ cities, revolutionizing\nurban infrastructure and services through the integration\
    \ of digital technologies and con-\nnectivity. This section highlights the importance\
    \ of digitalization and its inﬂuence on urban\ninfrastructure and services in\
    \ the context of smart city development [45].\nThe conventional city system consists\
    \ of two primary layers, namely the infrastructure\nand services layers. The infrastructure\
    \ layer pertains to the tangible constituents of the\nsystem and furnishes fundamental\
    \ services that are integrated within the urban regions. It\nis regarded as the\
    \ intermediary between the city residents and natural resources, thereby\nlaying\
    \ the groundwork for all the crucial aspects associated with the city, such as\
    \ individ-\nuals, ediﬁces, mobility, economy, governance, energy, water, and environment\
    \ [46]. The\nservices layer, commonly known as the “business layer,” is constructed\
    \ on a foundation\nof infrastructure and encompasses a range of activities that\
    \ support the inhabitants of a\ncity. These activities include municipal tasks\
    \ such as water supply, waste management,\nenvironmental management, and energy\
    \ distribution, among others [46]. The fundamental\naspect that can successfully\
    \ transform a City 1.0 into a City 2.0, commonly referred to as a\nsmart city,\
    \ is the incorporation of a data layer, also known as the digital layer.\nThe\
    \ process of digitalization has facilitated the development of intelligent infras-\n\
    tructure and urban areas. The digitization of physical space and energy, information\n\
    transmission, user and asset management, and business operations has been a gradual\n\
    process [45]. The timely capture and sharing of information are crucial value\
    \ propositions\nof ICT in the context of a smart city. Provided that the information\
    \ is delivered promptly\nand with precision, urban areas have the potential to\
    \ proactively address issues before they\nreach a critical level. According to\
    \ a scholarly source, a method of conceptualizing digital\ninfrastructure is through\
    \ the utilization of various digital layers that provide support, as\nshown in\

    \ urban services and infrastructure [50]. This includes the integra-\ntion of\
    \ IoT devices and sensors [24], enhanced connectivity and communication, and the\n\
    development of intelligent systems and platforms. In the energy sector, digital\
    \ technologies\nare being used to integrate renewable energy sources, demand response\
    \ mechanisms, and\nsmart metering systems. This leads to energy efﬁciency and\
    \ sustainability. In the trans-\nportation sector, digitalization facilitates\
    \ the development of intelligent trafﬁc management\nsystems, electric vehicle\
    \ charging infrastructure, and ride-sharing platforms [51]. This\npromotes efﬁcient\
    \ and sustainable mobility. Digitalization is also enhancing urban services\n\
    such as waste management, water management, and public safety. Smart waste manage-\n\
    ment systems, digitalized water management systems, and smart security systems\
    \ are all\nbeing developed to improve these services. Overall, digitalization\
    \ has a positive impact on\nsmart cities by making them more efﬁcient [52], sustainable\
    \ [14], and resilient [43].\n3.3. Impact of Digitalization on Smart City Infrastructure\n\

    \ data and analytics allows for \ninformed decision making and eﬀective energy\
    \ management strategies [53,55]. Transpor-\ntation is another area where digitalization\
    \ plays a critical role. Intelligent transportation \nsystems leverage digital\
    \ technologies, such as traﬃc sensors, real-time data analytics, and \nsmart mobility\
    \ platforms, to optimize traﬃc ﬂow, reduce congestion, and enhance trans-\nportation\
    \ eﬃciency. Digitalization also facilitates the integration of electric vehicles,\
    \ car-\nsharing services, and intelligent parking systems, promoting sustainable\
    \ mobility options \nwithin smart cities [10,56]. Waste management is signiﬁcantly\
    \ inﬂuenced by digitalization \nas well. Smart waste management systems leverage\
    \ sensors, IoT devices, and data analyt-\nics to monitor waste levels, optimize\
    \ collection routes, and improve recycling processes. \nReal-time data enables\
    \ eﬃcient resource allocation and waste reduction strategies, leading \nto a more\
    \ sustainable waste management approach [57]. \nFurthermore, digitalization establishes\
    \ critical linkages between digital technologies \nand the integration of smart\
    \ buildings within the smart city domain. Smart buildings lev-\nerage digital\
    \ technologies, such as building automation systems, sensor networks, and \ndata\

    \ technologies, such as trafﬁc sensors, real-time data analytics, and smart\n\
    mobility platforms, to optimize trafﬁc ﬂow, reduce congestion, and enhance transportation\n\
    efﬁciency. Digitalization also facilitates the integration of electric vehicles,\
    \ car-sharing\nservices, and intelligent parking systems, promoting sustainable\
    \ mobility options within\nsmart cities [10,56]. Waste management is signiﬁcantly\
    \ inﬂuenced by digitalization as well.\nSmart waste management systems leverage\
    \ sensors, IoT devices, and data analytics to\nmonitor waste levels, optimize\
    \ collection routes, and improve recycling processes. Real-\ntime data enables\
    \ efﬁcient resource allocation and waste reduction strategies, leading to a\n\
    more sustainable waste management approach [57].\nFurthermore, digitalization\
    \ establishes critical linkages between digital technologies\nand the integration\
    \ of smart buildings within the smart city domain. Smart buildings lever-\nage\
    \ digital technologies, such as building automation systems, sensor networks,\
    \ and data\nanalytics, to optimize energy consumption [19], enhance occupant comfort,\
    \ and improve\noperational efﬁciency. The integration of these digital systems\

    \ and other urban entities. It involves the alignment of building\nSmart Cities\
    \ 2023, 6\n1841\noperations with city-level objectives, such as energy efﬁciency,\
    \ environmental sustainabil-\nity, and citizen well-being. Functional integration\
    \ enables collective optimization, where\nsmart buildings work together as a system\
    \ to achieve shared goals, such as load balancing,\ndemand response, and environmental\
    \ impact reduction [11,59].\n4.2. Importance of Integration for Efﬁciency, Resilience,\
    \ and Sustainability of City Performance\nThe integration of smart buildings into\
    \ smart cities is crucial for achieving efﬁciency,\nresilience, and sustainability\
    \ in city performance.\nEfﬁciency refers to the use of technology and data-driven\
    \ solutions to improve the\nperformance and quality of municipal services while\
    \ consuming fewer resources and\nspending less money. By integrating energy-efﬁcient\
    \ systems, smart meters, and advanced\ncontrol algorithms, smart buildings contribute\
    \ to overall energy savings and reduced\nenvironmental impact [60]. The integration\
    \ allows for coordinated energy management\nstrategies, such as load shifting,\
    \ peak shaving, and renewable energy utilization [61],\nleading to enhanced energy\
    \ efﬁciency and reduced greenhouse gas emissions [62].\nFurthermore, integration\
    \ enables resource optimization by leveraging the intercon-\nnectedness of smart\
    \ buildings with other urban systems. The integration of smart buildings\nwith\
    \ smart grids facilitates demand response initiatives, whereby buildings adapt\
    \ their\nenergy usage in response to grid conditions and pricing cues [17]. This\
    \ collaboration\nbetween buildings and the grid leads to more efﬁcient energy\
    \ distribution, reduced strain\non the grid, and enhanced overall system reliability.\n\
    Within the framework of integrating the smart building into a smart city, environmen-\n\
    tal sustainability is another important metric in this scenario. It involves the\
    \ implementation\nof an energy-efﬁcient system such as renewable energy, advanced\
    \ control algorithms, ICT,\nand smart meters to curtail energy usage and mitigate\
    \ environmental impact [63]. Integra-\ntion also facilitates the optimization\
    \ of water management and waste management within\nsmart cities. Smart buildings\
    \ can incorporate water-efﬁcient technologies, such as smart\nirrigation [64],\
    \ rainwater harvesting systems, and greywater recycling [65] contributing to\n\
    water conservation at the city level [49]. In waste management, integration enables\
    \ real-\ntime monitoring of waste generation, optimized waste collection routes\
    \ [57], and improved\nrecycling practices, leading to efﬁcient waste management\
    \ and reduced environmental\nimpact [66].\nIn contrast, resilience usually refers\
    \ to the capacity of a system to withstand and recover\nfrom unexpected disturbances\
    \ and pressures while preserving its operational and adaptive\ncapabilities. The\
    \ concept of resilience in the realm of smart cities and buildings pertains to\n\
    the development of structures and urban infrastructures that possess the ability\
    \ to forecast,\nadapt, adjust to, and recuperate from disruptive occurrences [67].\
    \ The integration of\nsmart buildings into smart cities in a resilient manner\
    \ involves implementing strategies to\nstrengthen infrastructure durability, enhance\
    \ emergency response mechanisms, and foster\ncommunity resilience, as indicated\
    \ in [43]. The integration of resilient characteristics in\nsmart buildings can\
    \ effectively enhance the overall resilience of urban areas by minimizing\nthe\
    \ adverse effects of various disruptions, including but not limited to natural\
    \ calamities,\nclimate change, and system breakdowns. The integration in question\
    \ allows for the prompt\nmonitoring of multiple parameters in real time, thereby\
    \ enabling swift responses and\nadaptable measures in emergency situations [68].\n\
    To improve efﬁciency, resilience, and sustainability in city performance, smart\
    \ build-\nings need to be integrated into smart cities. The connectivity of smart\
    \ buildings with\nother urban systems allows for coordinated energy management\
    \ techniques, which in turn\nleads to increased energy efﬁciency, decreased greenhouse\
    \ gas emissions, and resource\noptimization. Energy conservation is achieved through\
    \ the incorporation of water-efﬁcient\ntechnologies and optimized waste management\
    \ practices, while environmental impact\nis lessened by reducing energy consumption\
    \ and using renewable energy sources and\ncutting-edge control algorithms and\
    \ smart meters. Finally, smart cities aim to improve\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1842\n\
    infrastructure longevity, and emergency response mechanisms by integrating security\n\
    systems, and community resilience through the incorporation of smart buildings.\n\
    4.3. Enhanced Urban Living through Smart Services\nThe integration of smart buildings\
    \ into smart cities ultimately aims to enhance urban\nliving experiences. By integrating\
    \ technologies such as Internet of things (IoT) devices, data\nanalytics, and\
    \ personalized services, smart buildings can provide tailored and responsive\n\
    experiences to occupants [59]. This includes adaptive lighting, personalized comfort\n\
    settings, and optimized indoor environmental quality [27]. Integration also enables\
    \ smart\nbuilding services to extend beyond individual buildings, such as smart\
    \ parking, shared\nmobility, and intelligent community services.\nThe implementation\
    \ of ubiquitous computing technology relies on the integration\nand organized\
    \ interconnection of smart service systems that oversee the administration of\n\
    ediﬁces and urban areas [20,40], as well as their engagement with users. The initial\
    \ phase\ninvolved establishing and implementing the IoT [3], which involved linking\
    \ household\nappliances to the network and facilitating communication with the\
    \ building or municipal\ninfrastructure [2], as well as with the user. Subsequently,\
    \ a methodical approach involves the\ninstallation of diverse sensors and devices\
    \ within buildings [59]. This, in conjunction with\nthe IoT, facilitates the gathering,\
    \ transmission, analysis, and reaction to the accumulated\ndata and additional\
    \ engagement with occupants.\nThe optimization of city infrastructure systems,\
    \ including energy, water, and trafﬁc,\nis a signiﬁcant advantage of urban intelligent\
    \ systems and smart building networking.\nUntil recently, the capabilities of\
    \ integration and system interaction have been restricted\nto data transfer technologies.\
    \ However, the emergence of the 5G network has altered\nthis landscape, as its\
    \ data transfer rate is now sufﬁcient to support the implementation of\nautonomous\
    \ vehicle transport and other advanced applications. It is anticipated that the\n\
    current speed standard will be augmented in the near future, thereby facilitating\
    \ additional\nadvancement and interactivity of said systems.\nIt is imperative\
    \ to acknowledge the wider societal and technological ramiﬁcations\nof IoT advancement,\
    \ while also prioritizing the interdependent connection between the\nintelligent\
    \ frameworks of smart cities and smart buildings. The investigation of these\n\
    effects is currently underway in numerous ﬁelds. However, it is important to acknowledge\n\
    that the optimal implementation of such projects requires the synergy of urban\
    \ systems,\nincluding infrastructure, transportation, and administration.\n5.\
    \ Factors Affecting Smart Building Integration into Smart City\nThis part of the\
    \ paper synthesizes the ﬁndings and provides a comprehensive analysis\nof the\
    \ factors inﬂuencing smart building integration into smart cities taking into\
    \ account\nthe technological aspects of the city. Given the multitude of factors\
    \ identiﬁed, the study\nconducted a synthesis to organize and categorize them\
    \ based on thematic areas. This\ncategorization led to the identiﬁcation of ﬁve\
    \ main infrastructure areas: smart energy, smart\nmobility, smart water, smart\
    \ security systems, and smart waste management. Each of these\nthematic areas\
    \ is described in detail in the subsequent subsections. By categorizing the\n\
    factors according to their respective infrastructure, it aimed to provide a comprehensive\n\
    understanding of the different aspects that contribute to the integration of smart\
    \ build-\nings into smart cities. The detailed descriptions of each thematic area\
    \ enabled a deeper\nexploration and analysis of the factors involved in each domain.\n\
    5.1. Factors Related to Smart Energy\nThe smart energy services of a smart building\
    \ are essential for all aspects of both smart\nbuildings and shaping the overall\
    \ performance and sustainability of the smart city, from\npowering homes and businesses\
    \ to providing transportation and lighting. For example, the\nintegration of energy\
    \ storage systems such as batteries of advanced storage technologies in\nsmart\
    \ buildings enhances energy management capabilities [69], which enables the capture\n\
    Smart Cities 2023, 6\n1843\nand utilization of surplus energy generated by renewable\
    \ sources [61], allowing for better\ndemand response management, load balancing,\
    \ and peak shaving. Smart buildings serve\nas key nodes in the integration of\
    \ smart grids, enabling bidirectional communication and\ndynamic energy management\
    \ [8]. Therefore, the impact of smart energy solutions in smart\nbuildings is\
    \ substantial in smart cities as well. Through renewable energy adoption, energy\n\
    efﬁciency measures, energy storage, sharing thermal energy, and integration with\
    \ smart\ngrids, smart buildings contribute to the overall sustainability, resilience,\
    \ and efﬁciency of\nsmart cities. By embracing these technologies and approaches,\

    \ another critical aspect in the context of smart buildings and smart cities,\n\
    it plays a crucial role in enhancing transportation efﬁciency, reducing congestion,\
    \ and\nimproving the overall quality of life. By examining the importance of the\
    \ factors presented\nin Table 4. and their contribution to the performance of\
    \ the city, it could be stated that\nelectric vehicles (EVs) and EV charging points\
    \ contribute to reducing dependence on fossil\nfuels and decreasing carbon emissions\
    \ [79]. Carpooling and ride-sharing services enable\nmultiple individuals to share\
    \ a single vehicle and reduce the number of cars, these services\ncan be facilitated\
    \ through digital platforms that connect passengers and drivers, optimizing\n\
    routes and enhancing transportation efﬁciency [51]. Modern parking solutions such\
    \ as\nshared parking and online video surveillance normally comprise inter alia\

    \ to Smart Waste Management\nWaste management often entails waste monitoring,\

    \ has set a goal of achieving carbon neutrality\non its campus by the year 2030\
    \ [107]. In addition, it has implemented a smart building\nintegration program\
    \ to improve energy efﬁciency, occupant comfort, and operational\nefﬁciency. The\
    \ program includes smart lighting systems with occupancy and daylight\nsensors,\
    \ personalized HVAC systems, and an integrated building management system\n(iBMS).\
    \ Real-time energy monitoring and analytics are employed to provide insights into\n\
    energy consumption patterns and facilitate targeted energy-saving strategies.\
    \ This has led\nto signiﬁcant reductions in energy consumption and carbon emissions,\
    \ improved occupant\ncomfort and productivity, and the successful implementation\
    \ of demand response strategies\nfor peak load management [108].\nOngos Valley,\

    Table 8 presents a summary of the above-mentioned case studies analysis showcasing\n\
    successful smart building integration into smart cities. It provides information\
    \ about key\nintegration factors addressed in the previous chapter of this paper.\n\
    The graphical representation of the technological factors enabling smart services\n\
    implemented in each case study is presented in Figure 3. All of the indicators\
    \ from the list of\n26 were proven. In the energy sector, European cities, particularly\
    \ Amsterdam, demonstrate\na strong focus on sustainability and resilience [115],\
    \ which involves the implementation\nof an energy-efﬁcient system and the ability\
    \ to adapt to disruptive occurrences, such\nas renewable energy, energy storage\
    \ advanced control algorithms, and ICT to curtail\nenergy usage and mitigate environmental\
    \ impact. They lead in energy storage and off-\ngrid potential, indicating a commitment\
    \ to integrating renewable energy sources and\nenhancing energy management. According\
    \ to Figure 3, The Edge in Amsterdam has 5 out\nof 7 services integrated to address\
    \ their smart city goals in the context of energy storage\nand implementing renewable\
    \ energy sources. On the other hand, Asian cities prioritize\nsmart EV infrastructure,\
    \ reﬂecting their goals of promoting electric transportation and\naddressing concerns\
    \ related to rapid motorization. This regional variation highlights the\ndifferent\
    \ approaches taken toward energy transition and sustainability [116]. Two Asian\n\
    projects, i.e., Reliance MET, Gurgaon, India and (NUS) smart buildings, Singapore,\
    \ have\nenergy services 4 and 3 out of 7, respectively.\nWhen it comes to mobility,\
    \ all analyzed case studies are developed to promote smart\nand sustainable mobility.\
    \ European cities stand out in promoting shared mobility services\nand reducing\
    \ private car usage [117]. Both The Edge in Amsterdam and One Angle Square\nin\
    \ the UK integrated 5 mobility services out of 6. This emphasizes their commitment\
    \ to\nsustainable transportation solutions, reducing trafﬁc congestion, and enhancing\
    \ last-mile\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1848\nconnectivity. Asian cities (NUS, Singapore—5\
    \ out of 6 services; Reliance MET, Gurgaon,\nIndia—4 out of 6 services) address\
    \ the challenges of rapid urbanization by placing a stronger\nemphasis on promoting\
    \ sharing mobility, video surveillance, and parking management,\nindicating concerns\
    \ related to motorization and the need for efﬁcient parking solutions [116].\n\
    African cities lag behind in smart mobility, likely due to cost constraints and\
    \ infrastructure\nchallenges they face in implementing advanced mobility systems.\n\

    \ This regional variation highlights the diﬀerent \napproaches taken toward energy\
    \ transition and sustainability [116]. Two Asian projects, \ni.e., Reliance MET,\
    \ Gurgaon, India and (NUS) smart buildings, Singapore, have energy \nservices\

    \ Case studies: key factors related to smart services of different smart cities\
    \ domains.\nIn water and waste management, regional patterns are evident. Water\
    \ conservation\nand recycling initiatives are more prevalent in regions with water\
    \ scarcity, such as in Africa\nand India (4 out of 6 water services). Singapore\
    \ stands out for its comprehensive smart\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1850\nwater management\
    \ initiatives, emphasizing the importance of efﬁcient water use in a water-\n\
    stressed environment [118]. In waste management, European cities lead in automation,\n\
    sensors, and data analytics, reﬂecting their focus on achieving greater efﬁciency\
    \ and\nsustainability goals [49]. Other regions primarily utilize basic smart\
    \ bins due to a lack of\nadequate infrastructure, suggesting the potential for\
    \ further development and utilization\nof waste data.\nThe security domain demonstrates\
    \ high development status within the selected case\nstudies: The Edge, Amsterdam\
    \ and Ongos Valley, Windhoek have security as a ﬁrst priority\n(5 out of 5) while\
    \ the rest of the projects have implemented 4 smart services out of 5. This\n\
    shows that the enhanced smart city initiatives provide the overall measurements\
    \ to increase\nnot only the efﬁciency and sustainability but the resilience of\
    \ smart city performance,\nincluding safety and security services for their inhabitants\
    \ as well.\nBased on the analysis of case studies, several recommendations can\
    \ be made to\nenhance the technological aspects of smart city initiatives. Firstly,\
    \ there is a need to\nexpand renewable energy and storage solutions to increase\
    \ self-sufﬁciency and resilience\nagainst grid disruptions. Technologies such\
    \ as vehicle-to-grid systems and energy trading\nplatforms can facilitate the\
    \ integration of mobility and energy sectors. Furthermore, scaling\nsustainable\
    \ mobility options like shared vehicles, e-buses, and demand-responsive transit\n\
    can improve convenience and reduce congestion. Integration of payment and scheduling\n\
    systems across different modes of transport will enhance usability. Additionally,\
    \ expanding\nenvironmental monitoring by leveraging low-cost sensors can provide\
    \ hyperlocal data\non air and water quality, which can inform evidence-based policies.\
    \ It is also essential\nto invest in cybersecurity measures and develop robust\
    \ data governance frameworks to\naddress privacy concerns and build public trust.\
    \ Finally, pursuing regional partnerships\nand knowledge exchange with other cities\
    \ can facilitate the replication of successful use\ncases and accelerate smart\
    \ city development. Collaborative efforts and a shared vision\nacross sectors\
    \ and stakeholders are essential for the realization of integrated, inclusive,\
    \ and\nsustainable smart cities. By learning from best practices and focusing\
    \ on local priorities,\ncities can drive the realization of technologically optimized\
    \ urban living in a way that best\nserves their communities.\n7. Discussion\n\
    In this chapter, the identiﬁed factors, their interrelationships, and their implications\n\
    for successful integration are discussed. Additionally, common challenges, limitations,\
    \ and\nareas for further research are identiﬁed.\nThe study reveals that 26 key\
    \ factors play a crucial role in the integration of smart\nbuildings into smart\
    \ cities. These factors include smart energy, smart mobility, smart water,\nsmart\
    \ security systems, and smart waste management infrastructure domain. Each of\
    \ these\nthematic areas has unique requirements, frameworks, and technologies\
    \ that contribute to\nthe overall integration process. Despite the progress made\
    \ in smart building integration\ninto smart cities, some common challenges need\
    \ to be addressed. These include data inter-\noperability, privacy and security\
    \ concerns, regulatory barriers, technological complexities,\nand the need for\
    \ scalable and cost-effective solutions.\nIn the context of smart energy integration,\
    \ the adoption of energy-efﬁcient systems,\nrenewable energy integration, and\
    \ demand-side management are essential. However,\nchallenges such as the coordination\
    \ of diverse energy resources and the integration of\nenergy storage systems need\
    \ to be addressed to ensure seamless integration and maximize\nenergy optimization.\n\
    Smart mobility integration requires the integration of smart transportation systems,\n\
    electric vehicles, and intelligent trafﬁc management. This integration enables\
    \ congestion\nreduction, emissions reduction, and enhanced mobility. Nevertheless,\
    \ challenges related to\ndata management, interoperability, and infrastructure\
    \ development must be overcome to\nfully realize the beneﬁts of smart mobility\
    \ integration.\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1851\nThe integration of smart water management\
    \ solutions enables water conservation and\nreuse, real-time leak detection, and\
    \ quality monitoring. It contributes to efﬁciency and\nsustainability in water\
    \ management. However, challenges related to data privacy, system\ninteroperability,\
    \ and infrastructure investment need to be addressed for successful smart\nwater\
    \ integration.\nSmart security systems, including intelligent surveillance, access\
    \ control, and emer-\ngency response systems, enhance safety, crime prevention,\
    \ and resilience in smart buildings\nand cities. However, privacy concerns, cybersecurity\
    \ threats, and the integration of diverse\nsecurity systems pose challenges to\
    \ effective integration.\nThe application of IoT-based waste monitoring, recycling,\
    \ and waste-to-energy systems\nin smart waste management contributes to efﬁcient\
    \ waste management and supports\ncircular economy goals. E-waste management practices,\
    \ on the other hand, should align\nwith the broader goals of sustainability and\
    \ environmental preservation within smart cities.\nThis can involve the use of\
    \ IoT techniques such as radio frequency (RFID) and sensor\ntechnology to track\
    \ and manage e-waste throughout its lifecycle [66]. However, challenges\nrelated\
    \ to data management, infrastructure, and public engagement need to be addressed\n\
    to achieve effective integration.\nThe integration of smart buildings into smart\
    \ cities raises concerns and potential risks.\nData protection becomes increasingly\
    \ important as smart buildings generate and gather\nmassive volumes of personal\
    \ and sensitive data, raising the danger of data breaches and\nillegal access.\
    \ Another concern is over surveillance, as continual monitoring via integrated\n\
    sensors and surveillance technology might intrude on privacy and personal freedom.\n\
    Furthermore, smart buildings may unintentionally contribute to inequality by raising\
    \ costs\nand posing accessibility issues for low-income populations. Finally,\
    \ an overreliance on\ntechnology in smart buildings may result in interruptions\
    \ and dependencies that disrupt\nvital activities. To address these threats, comprehensive\
    \ approaches such as strong data\nprotection rules, cybersecurity safeguards,\
    \ and fair access programs must be implemented,\nall while protecting privacy\
    \ rights and fostering openness.\nThe scope of this study is related to the technological\
    \ aspects of smart buildings\nintegration into smart cities, and this is the major\
    \ limitation. Additionally, a variety of other\naspects might be further investigated\
    \ in the future such as, for example, the impact of smart\nbuilding integration\
    \ on the social, economic, and environmental aspects of smart cities.\nThe human\
    \ factor (residents or building owners) is one such important factor that needs\n\
    to be carefully analyzed and assessed. The evaluation of long-term sustainability,\
    \ user\nacceptance, and the cost-effectiveness of integrated solutions is essential\
    \ for the successful\nimplementation of smart building integration projects. Adopting\
    \ a human-centric approach\nthat prioritizes equity and accessibility in service\
    \ delivery is also crucial. Citizen feedback\nloops through social media, mobile\
    \ apps, and the Internet of things can enable co-creation\nand ensure that smart\
    \ city initiatives address the needs of all residents. Challenges that\narise\
    \ from technological advances such as electromagnetic radiation of smart buildings\n\
    and smart cities, e-waste, a plethora of under-sea cables, etc., and their impact\
    \ on the\nintegration of smart buildings into a smart city have to be analyzed\
    \ and taken into account\nby decision makers.\nIn summary, advanced digital technologies\
    \ enable the integration of smart buildings\ninto smart cities and new smart services\
    \ provide enormous beneﬁts to the cities and their\ninhabitants. At the same time,\
    \ potential threads caused by certain technologies need to\nbe discussed and leveraged\
    \ in each infrastructure area; thus, additional measures should\nbe implemented\
    \ to minimize the negative effects correspondingly. These decisions are\nwithin\
    \ the responsibility limits of the city planners and smart city strategy development\n\
    authorities who pave the way for new technologies selection and implementation\
    \ to\nintegrate smart buildings into a particular smart city. Thus, further research\
    \ is required to\ndevelop standardized frameworks, guidelines, and best practices\
    \ for successful integration.\nThe next stage to continue this research is to\
    \ present the smart building integration into\nthe smart city evaluation framework\
    \ by considering the identiﬁed technological factors\nSmart Cities 2023, 6\n1852\n\
    and their impact on the efﬁciency, resilience, and environmental sustainability\
    \ of the\ncity’s performance.\n8. Conclusions\nThe presented study researched\
    \ the key factors affecting the smart building integration\ninto the smart city\
    \ considering technological aspects. The established conceptual framework\nrevealed\
    \ three key dimensions of smart building integration into a smart city: physical,\
    \ data,\nand functional. The research revealed that the successful integration\
    \ of smart buildings\ninto smart cities requires attention to multiple factors.\
    \ Through a comprehensive review\nof the relevant literature and case studies\
    \ research, 26 factors inﬂuencing integration in\nﬁve infrastructure areas, namely\
    \ smart energy, smart mobility, smart water, smart security\nsystems, and smart\
    \ waste management, were identiﬁed and discussed. The ﬁndings have\nimportant\
    \ implications for policymakers, urban planners, and stakeholders involved in\n\
    smart city development.\nIn the area of smart energy, the adoption of energy-efﬁcient\
    \ systems, renewable energy\nintegration, and demand-side management are critical\
    \ for achieving energy optimization\nand sustainability. Policymakers and urban\
    \ planners should prioritize the development of\nsupportive regulations, incentives,\
    \ and infrastructure to encourage the implementation of\nthese technologies.\n\
    Smart mobility integration plays a vital role in enhancing transportation efﬁciency\
    \ and\nreducing congestion and CO2 emissions. Policymakers and urban planners\
    \ should focus on\nthe integration of smart transportation systems, the promotion\
    \ of electric vehicles, and the\nimplementation of intelligent trafﬁc management\
    \ strategies. Investments in infrastructure,\nsuch as charging stations and smart\
    \ trafﬁc control systems, are necessary to support the\nwidespread adoption of\
    \ smart mobility solutions.\nSmart water management is essential for achieving\
    \ sustainable water use in smart\ncities. Policymakers and urban planners should\
    \ emphasize the integration of smart water\nmonitoring systems, leak detection\
    \ technologies, and water conservation practices. In-\nvestments in infrastructure\
    \ and the development of data-sharing mechanisms can enable\nefﬁcient water management\
    \ and ensure the long-term sustainability of water resources.\nThe integration\
    \ of smart security systems is crucial for ensuring the safety and re-\nsilience\
    \ of smart buildings and cities. Policymakers and stakeholders should prioritize\
    \ the\nimplementation of intelligent surveillance, access control, and emergency\
    \ response systems.\nIt is also important to address privacy and cybersecurity\
    \ concerns through robust data\nprotection measures and secure communication protocols.\n\
    Smart waste management integration contributes to efﬁcient waste disposal, recycling,\n\
    and resource recovery. Policymakers and urban planners should promote the adoption\
    \ of\nIoT-based waste monitoring systems, encourage recycling initiatives, and\
    \ explore waste-\nto-energy solutions. Public awareness campaigns and incentives\
    \ can encourage active\nparticipation and support the transition toward a circular\
    \ economy.\nThe successful integration of smart buildings into smart cities and\
    \ the identiﬁcation of\nthe sets of integrated smart building services require\
    \ a thorough and synchronized strategy.\nEffective addressing of the challenges\
    \ and capitalization on the opportunities presented by\nsmart technologies necessitates\
    \ collaboration among policymakers, urban planners, real\nestate professionals,\
    \ technology providers, and other associated stakeholders.\nAuthor Contributions:\

    Abstract: Over the past few years, a lot of devices and machines around us are
    becoming ‘smart’. Based on the idea of the Internet of Things (IoT), different
    devices and machines can connect to the internet and communicate with each other.
    Such internet enabled devices are continuously observing their environment and
    logging a lot of data in the back-end database. By applying data analytics on
    the gathered Big Data, smart decisions are made to facilitate the end user according
    to the current situation. This capability of adaptive decision making actually
    makes ordinary devices and machines ‘smart’. These devices and machines are becoming
    intelligent by learning about their surroundings from different sources, and develop
    the ability to avoid unforeseen situations by analyzing that data. In this chapter,
    we provide a comprehensive overview of how different industrial players are using
    data analytics to provide better services to their customers and improve their
    internal processes and workflows. We discuss how different industries use data
    analytics to gain vital insights for providing better healthcare to public, making
    homes more secure, increasing crop yield, delivering goods more quickly, reducing
    the downtime of a machine, avoiding a disease, etc. An overview of different analytics
    platforms and solutions used in different industries for time series and streaming
    data are also discussed in this chapter. We recommend Artificial Intelligence

    \ \n\"Things\" that are part of the \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) are equipped\
    \ with sensors, software, and network \nconnectivity, giving them the ability\
    \ to gather and share data with one another and with other devices. The \nongoing\
    \ digital transformation is taking place in many different domains, including\
    \ medical, industry, \ntransportation, and urban planning[1]. Connected devices\
    \ and their networks are important to this \ntransformation. This response will\
    \ concentrate on the architecture, applications, and future directions of \npotential\
    \ development of IoT networks.The term \"Internet of Things\" (IoT) describes\
    \ a network of actual \nphysical objects that are linked to the internet and are\
    \ capable of exchanging data and information with one \nanother. These items,\
    \ often known as \"smart devices,\" have sensors, software, and network connectivity\
    \ that \nenable data collection and transmission[2]. Healthcare, industry, transportation,\
    \ and smart cities are just a few of \nthe sectors being transformed by IoT networks.IoT\
    \ networks are becoming more and more significant as \nbusinesses all over the\
    \ world continue to utilize this technology to increase operational effectiveness,\
    \ cut costs, \nand improve customer experience[3]. Over the coming years, the\
    \ global IoT industry is anticipated to expand \nrapidly, increasing in size to\
    \ an estimated $1.5 trillion by 2030.This study paper's main goal is to give a\
    \ \nthorough review of IoT networks, covering its design, uses, and prospects.\
    \ Also, this study will emphasize the \ndrawbacks and restrictions of IoT networks\
    \ as well as how they may affect future studies. The reader will have a \nbetter\
    \ knowledge of the potential of IoT network. \nTurkish Journal of Computer and\

    III. \nArchitecture of IoT Networks \nIoT networks are made up of a variety of\
    \ parts that cooperate to make it possible to gather, process, and transmit \n\
    data. An IoT network's essential elements include: \nA. Definition and components\
    \ of IoT networks \ni. \nDevices: These are actual physical things with processors,\
    \ sensors, and network connectivity. Smart \nhousehold appliances, wearable fitness\
    \ trackers, commercial machinery, and environmental sensors are \na few examples\
    \ of IoT gadgets. \nii. \nSensors: Sensors are used to collect data from the physical\
    \ environment, such as temperature, \nhumidity, pressure, or position. A wide\
    \ range of sensors, such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, \nmicrophones, and cameras,\
    \ can be used by IoT networks. \niii. \nActuators: These parts are used to change\
    \ the environment in response to information gathered by \nsensors. For instance,\
    \ an IoT network may employ actuators to modify a room's temperature or turn on\
    \ \nand off lighting. \niv. \nNetwork Connectivity: IoT devices need to be connected\
    \ to a network to transmit data. Many network \ntechnologies, such as Wi-Fi, cellular\
    \ networks, and Bluetooth, can be used to do this. \nTurkish Journal of Computer\
    \ and Mathematics Education  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604\
    \ \n \n \n2070 \n \n \n \nResearch Article  \nv. \nData processing is necessary\
    \ in order to make use of the data that IoT devices collect. This can be \ndone\
    \ on the device itself, on a nearby edge device, or on the cloud. Data analysis,\
    \ aggregation, and \nfiltering are all examples of processing. \nvi. \nStorage:IoT\
    \ networks may store, process, and analyse data using cloud services. These can\
    \ include \nservices for data storage, data analytics, and machine learning. \n\
    vii. \nApplications: Software applications can be used by IoT networks to let\
    \ users interact with and manage \nthe network. These can include mobile or web\
    \ tools that let consumers access and keep tabs on data \ncoming from their Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT) devices. \nviii. \nSecurity: IoT networks need to be secure\
    \ to avoid unauthorized access or modification of data. These \nmay include threat\
    \ detection technologies, access controls, and encryption. \nThese components\
    \ work together to enable IoT networks to collect, process, and send data from\
    \ the real world. \nIoT networks can offer a number of advantages by fusing these\
    \ elements, including increased operational \neffectiveness, lower costs, and\
    \ better user experiences. \nB. Four layers of IoT network architecture \nIoT\
    \ networks can be further divided into blocks or modules, each of which serves\
    \ a particular function. \nDepending on the particular use case of the IoT network,\
    \ these blocks can be organized in a variety of ways. \nSome of the typical building\
    \ blocks or modules for IoT network topologies include the following:All physical\
    \ \ncomponents of the IoT network, such as sensors, actuators, and gateways, are\
    \ included in the device layer. These \ngadgets gather information and talk to\
    \ other gadgets in the network.All network elements that permit \ncommunication\
    \ between devices, such as Wi-Fi routers, gateways, and switches, are included\
    \ in the network \nlayer. The network layer also comprises protocols and technologies,\
    \ such Bluetooth, Zigbee, and LoRa, that \nallow devices to connect with one another.\
    \ \ni. \nCloud Layer: This layer consists of cloud-based services that give the\
    \ IoT network access to storage, \ncompute, and analytics. These services can\
    \ be used to store data, handle data processing and analysis, \nand give end users\
    \ insights. \nii. \nApplication Layer: This layer consists of computer programs\
    \ that give end users access to the \ninformation gathered by the Internet of\
    \ Things network. These programs can be used to display data, \nstart processes,\
    \ and provide notifications. \niii. \nSecurity Layer:The security procedures in\
    \ this layer assure the availability, confidentiality, and \nintegrity of the\
    \ data gathered by the IoT network. Threat detection, access limits, and encryption\
    \ are \nexamples of security measures. \niv. \nDevice Layer:Device management,\
    \ network monitoring, and firmware updates are just a few of the \ntools and services\
    \ that help network administrators manage the IoT network. \nIoT networks can\
    \ be designed in a variety of ways depending on the network's needs and the individual\
    \ use \ncase. IoT networks often depend on a combination of physical objects,\
    \ network elements, cloud-based services, \nsoftware applications, security methods,\
    \ and management tools to operate, regardless of the architecture. \nC. Centralized\
    \ and decentralized networks \ni. \nCentralized Networks: All data gathered by\
    \ IoT devices is transmitted to a central server for \nprocessing and storage\
    \ in a centralized IoT network design. On-site or in the cloud are both viable\
    \ \nlocations for this server. The server is responsible for processing and analyzing\
    \ data, and may also \nserve as a gateway to other systems. As all the data is\
    \ in one place, centralized networks can be simpler \nto manage and maintain.\
    \ Yet, centralized networks may be less scalable and more subject to single \n\
    points of failure. \nii. \nDecentralized Networks: With a decentralized IoT network\
    \ architecture, data processing and storage \nis distributed among different devices\
    \ and systems. For instance, instead of being routed to a \ncentralized server,\
    \ data gathered by IoT devices may be processed and analyzed on the edge, in a\
    \ \nnearby gateway or device. While there are several nodes that can handle data\
    \ processing and storage, \nTurkish Journal of Computer and Mathematics Education\
    \  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI: https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604\
    \ \n \n \n2071 \n \n \n \nResearch Article  \ndecentralized networks can be more\
    \ scalable and resilient than centralized networks. Decentralized \nnetworks,\
    \ on the other hand, can be trickier to run and maintain because data is dispersed\
    \ throughout \nnumerous hardware and software platforms. \nNetwork topologies\
    \ that are centralized or decentralized each have benefits and drawbacks of their\
    \ own. The \nnetwork's size, the amount of data being collected, whether real-time\
    \ processing is needed, and the required \nlevel of security all play a role in\
    \ the architecture choice. To attain the appropriate level of scalability, \n\
    robustness, and security, certain IoT networks may employ a hybrid architecture,\
    \ which mixes centralized and \ndecentralized features. \nIV. \nApplications of\
    \ IoT Networks \nIoT networks are used in a wide range of fields and businesses,\
    \ including manufacturing, transportation, \nhealthcare, and smart cities. Below\
    \ is a summary of some of the major IoT network-using industries: \ni. \nHealthcare:\
    \ By enabling remote patient monitoring, streamlining hospital operations, and\
    \ giving real-\ntime patient data, IoT networks can improve patient outcomes and\
    \ lower expenses. IoT devices, for \ninstance, can be used to track patients with\
    \ long-term diseases like diabetes or heart disease and notify \nmedical professionals\
    \ of any changes in their state. \nii. \nManufacturing: By providing real-time\
    \ monitoring of production processes and equipment, IoT \nnetworks can assist\
    \ increase operational efficiency and decrease downtime. IoT sensors, for instance,\
    \ \ncan be used to monitor machine performance and anticipate maintenance requirements\
    \ prior to a \nbreakdown. \niii. \nTransportation: IoT networks can aid in enhancing\
    \ user experience, reducing congestion, and \nimproving safety in the transportation\
    \ sector. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to track traffic \npatterns and\
    \ modify traffic lights to improve flow. \nIoT networks have the potential to\
    \ enhance urban environments' sustainability, safety, and livability. IoT sensors,\
    \ \nfor instance, can be used to monitor air quality, control energy use, and\
    \ improve waste management. \nA. Examples of specific use cases \nThe following\
    \ are some particular use cases for IoT networks: \na) Smart Homes: IoT devices\
    \ can be utilised to build energy-efficient, safe, and simple to maintain smart\
    \ \nhouses. For instance, IoT-enabled security systems can send out real-time\
    \ notifications if there is any \nunexpected activity in the home, while IoT-enabled\
    \ thermostats can automatically adjust the \ntemperature based on user preferences\
    \ and occupancy. \nb) Asset tracking: IoT networks can be used to track assets\

    \ stop natural disasters. \nd) Agriculture: Agricultural operations including\
    \ irrigation, fertilizer, and pest control can be monitored \nand optimized via\
    \ IoT networks. IoT sensors, for instance, can be used to enhance crop development\
    \ \nand output by monitoring soil moisture levels and adjusting irrigation systems.\
    \ \n \nV. \nIV. Future Directions of IoT Networks \nA. Emerging trends in IoT\
    \ networks \nDigital twins are virtual reproductions of actual systems or gadgets.\
    \ They can be used to imitate the behavior of \nsystems in the real world because\
    \ they are developed using sensor data. Design, testing, and maintenance of IoT\
    \ \nsystems and devices can be made better with the use of digital twins. \nTurkish\

    Research Article  \ni. \nFog Computing: A decentralized computing architecture\
    \ known as fog computing puts processing \npower closer to Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) devices. Although though it uses a more distributed \nmethodology, it\
    \ is comparable to edge computing. For real-time IoT applications, data processing\
    \ speed \nand latency reduction are essential, and fog computing can help. \n\
    ii. \nHybrid Cloud: A hybrid cloud is an infrastructure that combines public and\
    \ private clouds. IoT \nnetworks may balance their needs for affordability, scalability,\
    \ and security with the aid of hybrid \nclouds. For instance, private cloud infrastructure\
    \ can be used to store sensitive data whereas public \ncloud infrastructure can\
    \ be used to store less sensitive data. \niii. \nHuman-Machine Interfaces (HMIs):\
    \ HMIs allow users to communicate with IoT systems and devices. \nHMIs come in\
    \ tactile, aural, and visual forms. These could aid in enhancing IoT networks'\
    \ usability and \naccessibility. \niv. \nPredictive Maintenance: In order to forecast\
    \ when maintenance is necessary before equipment fails, \npredictive maintenance\
    \ uses data from IoT sensors. Reduced downtime, increased dependability, and \n\
    lower maintenance costs can all be a result of predictive maintenance. \nv. \n\
    Smart Energy: To maximize energy efficiency and minimize waste, smart energy utilises\
    \ IoT networks. \nIoT sensors, for instance, can be used to track energy use in\
    \ buildings and modify heating or lighting \nbased on occupancy levels. \nvi.\
    \ \nVoice Recognition: Voice-activated instructions and IoT device control are\
    \ made possible by speech \nrecognition technologies. Speech recognition can help\
    \ make IoT networks more convenient and \naccessible. \n \nB. Edge computing and\
    \ 5G networks \nThe adoption of edge computing and 5G networks is one of the most\
    \ important trends in IoT networks. Instead \nof transmitting data to a central\
    \ server for processing, edge computing uses devices at the network's edge to\
    \ \nprocess data. Many IoT applications depend on low latency and quick reaction\
    \ times, which can be achieved \nwith this method. Contrarily, 5G networks provide\
    \ greater bandwidth and lower latency than earlier wireless \nnetwork generations,\
    \ making them ideal for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. \nC. Artificial\
    \ Intelligence and Machine Learning \nThe growing application of machine learning\
    \ (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technology in IoT networks is \nanother\
    \ trend. IoT devices can benefit from AI and ML to improve decision-making and\
    \ automate processes like \nanomaly detection and predictive maintenance. Costs\
    \ can be cut, productivity can be increased, and the user \nexperience can be\
    \ improved. \nD. Blockchain technology \nIn IoT networks, blockchain technology\
    \ is another new development. Blockchain is a distributed ledger \ntechnology\
    \ that makes transactions safe, open, and impenetrable. Blockchain can be utilized\
    \ in IoT networks to \nbuild secure, decentralized systems that are impervious\
    \ to hackers or tampering. Blockchain technology, for \ninstance, can be applied\
    \ to develop a safe and open supply chain management system that can monitor the\
    \ flow \nof commodities from manufacture to delivery.IoT networks have a promising\
    \ future, filled with both exciting \nprospects and difficult obstacles. To ensure\
    \ that IoT networks can reach their full potential as the technology \ndevelops,\
    \ it will be crucial to solve challenges like privacy, security, and interoperability.\
    \ \nVI. \nChallenges & Limitations of IoT Network \nIoT networks provide many\
    \ benefits, but they also present a number of obstacles and constraints that need\
    \ to be \novercome. We will look at a few of these difficulties and their potential\
    \ effects in this section. \nA. Privacy and Security Issues \nTurkish Journal\
    \ of Computer and Mathematics Education  \nVol.11 No.03 (2020), 2067-2075 \nDOI:\
    \ https://doi.org/10.17762/turcomat.v11i3.13604 \n \n \n2073 \n \n \n \nResearch\
    \ Article  \nSecurity and privacy issues are one of the biggest problems facing\
    \ IoT networks. Given that there are billions of \ninternet-connected gadgets,\
    \ the possibility of cyberattacks and data breaches is a major worry. IoT devices\
    \ \nsometimes have poor security safeguards, which leaves them open to hacking\
    \ and other online dangers. \nFurthermore, IoT devices frequently gather and send\
    \ sensitive data, such private health information, \nnecessitating strong privacy\
    \ measures. \nB. Problems with Interoperability and Compatibility \nInteroperability\
    \ and compatibility problems are another difficulty facing IoT networks. IoT systems\
    \ and devices \nare frequently created by several manufacturers and may employ\
    \ various communication protocols or standards. \nAs a result, integrating equipment\
    \ from many manufacturers and developing a cohesive system may be difficult. \n\
    Additionally, the demand for interoperability and compatibility will only increase\
    \ as IoT networks develop. \nC. Congestion in the Network and Scalability \nScalability\
    \ and network congestion are additional issues that IoT networks must deal with.\
    \ The need for \nbandwidth and other network resources increases along with the\
    \ number of devices connected to the network. \nThis may cause network congestion,\
    \ which may have an effect on how well IoT applications work. Scaling the \nnetwork\
    \ infrastructure to meet the rising demand might be difficult as the number of\
    \ IoT devices keeps \nincreasing. \nD. Battery Life and Power Use \nFor IoT networks,\
    \ power consumption and battery life are major obstacles. Many Internet of Things\
    \ (IoT) \ndevices run on batteries and can be found in far-off or challenging-to-reach\
    \ places. This makes it difficult to \nchange batteries or recharge devices, which\
    \ may affect the network's overall dependability and performance. In \naddition,\
    \ power consumption will become a more pressing issue as the number of IoT devices\
    \ increases.IoT \nnetworks provide many advantages, but there are also a number\
    \ of problems and restrictions that need to be \nworked around. IoT networks may\
    \ realize their full potential by creating strong security and privacy measures,\
    \ \naddressing interoperability and compatibility challenges, managing network\
    \ congestion, and minimizing power \nusage. \nVII. \nConclusion \nWe have covered\
    \ the architecture, applications, and anticipated future developments of IoT networks\
    \ in this \npaper. We have looked at an IoT network's four-tiered architecture\
    \ and all of its components, such as sensors, \ngateways, cloud platforms, and\
    \ apps. We have also discussed the various applications of IoT networks in a \n\
    variety of fields, including healthcare, industry, transportation, and even smart\
    \ cities.We have also looked into \nthe most recent advancements in the Internet\
    \ of Things (IoT), such as edge computing, 5G networks, AI, and \nblockchain.\
    \ The usefulness and value of IoT networks may rise as a result of these tendencies.IoT\
    \ networks \nprovide a lot of advantages, but they also have some disadvantages\
    \ that need to be dealt with. This includes \nproblems with energy use, battery\
    \ life, interoperability, scalability, security, and privacy. It also includes\
    \ \nproblems with network congestion.To fully realize the potential of IoT networks,\
    \ future research should focus \non fixing these problems and overcoming these\
    \ limitations. Managing network congestion, optimizing energy \nuse, creating\
    \ robust security and privacy measures, and resolving interoperability and compatibility\
    \ issues are a \nfew of them.IoT networks, which have the potential to revolutionize\
    \ numerous industries and raise people's \nliving standards everywhere, represent\
    \ a significant advancement in technology. With further research and \ndevelopment,\
    \ IoT networks will without a doubt play a significant role in determining the\
    \ direction of \ntechnology and society. \nReferences \n[1] Al-Fuqaha, A., Guizani,\

    \ of processes. In the field of civil engineering, IoT \napplications have the\
    \ potential to greatly improve construction, \ninfrastructure management, and\
    \ overall project efficiency. \nOne key application of IoT in civil engineering\
    \ is in smart infrastructure \nmonitoring. By embedding sensors and devices into\
    \ structures such as \nbridges, roads, and buildings, engineers can collect real-time\
    \ data on \nvarious parameters, including structural integrity, temperature, humidity,\
    \ \nand traffic patterns. This data allows for continuous monitoring and early\
    \ \ndetection of potential issues or anomalies, enabling timely maintenance \n\
    and preventing costly failures. \nIoT also plays a vital role in construction\
    \ site management. By deploying \nsensors and connected devices on construction\
    \ sites, project managers can \nmonitor resource utilization, equipment performance,\
    \ and worker safety. \nFor example, IoT sensors can track the usage and maintenance\
    \ needs of \nconstruction machinery, optimize their operation, and detect potential\
    \ \nmalfunctions in real-time. This improves efficiency, reduces downtime, \n\
    and enhances worker safety by providing timely alerts and notifications. \nFurthermore,\
    \ IoT facilitates efficient energy management in civil \nengineering projects.\
    \ By integrating smart energy meters, sensors, and \ncontrol systems into buildings\
    \ or infrastructure, engineers can monitor and \noptimize energy consumption.\
    \ This allows for real-time energy \nmonitoring, identification of energy inefficiencies,\

    \ This \ntrend allows for faster response times, reduced latency, and improved\
    \ \nefficiency by reducing the reliance on cloud computing. \nDigital Twins: Digital\
    \ twin technology has gained traction in civil \nengineering projects. A digital\
    \ twin is a virtual replica of a physical asset \nor system that can simulate\
    \ its behavior and performance in real-time. By \nintegrating IoT data into digital\
    \ twin models, engineers can monitor and \nanalyze the performance of infrastructure,\
    \ predict maintenance needs, and \noptimize operations. \nIntegration with Building\
    \ Information Modeling (BIM): BIM is a digital \nrepresentation of the physical\
    \ and functional characteristics of a building \nor infrastructure project. IoT\
    \ is increasingly being integrated with BIM to \ncreate \"smart\" or \"connected\"\
    \ BIM models. This integration allows for \nreal-time data exchange between IoT\
    \ devices and BIM software, enabling \nbetter collaboration, accurate simulations,\
    \ and improved decision-making \nthroughout the project lifecycle. \n \nInternational\

    \ AND APPLICATIONS\nMuhammad Zaigham Abbas Shah, Syed\nNovember 8, 2022\nInternet\
    \ of Things is a system that integrates different devices and technologies,\n\
    removing the necessity of human intervention. This enables the capacity of having\n\
    smart (or smarter) cities around the world. By hosting different technologies\
    \ and al-\nlowing interactions between them, the internet of things has spearheaded\
    \ the develop-\nment of smart city systems for sustainable living, increased comfort\
    \ and productivity\nfor citizens. The Internet of Things (IoT) for Smart Cities\
    \ has many different domains\nand draws upon various underlying systems for its\
    \ operation, in this work, we provide\na holistic coverage of the Internet of\
    \ Things in Smart Cities by discussing the fun-\ndamental components that make\
    \ up the IoT Smart City landscape, the technologies\nthat enable these domains\
    \ to exist, the most prevalent practices and techniques which\nare used in these\
    \ domains as well as the challenges that deployment of IoT systems for\nsmart\
    \ cities encounter and which need to be addressed for ubiquitous use of smart\
    \ city\napplications. It also presents a coverage of optimization methods and\
    \ applications\nfrom a smart city perspective enabled by the Internet of Things.\
    \ Towards this end,\na mapping is provided for the most encountered applications\
    \ of computational opti-\nmization within IoT smart cities for five popular optimization\
    \ methods, ant colony\noptimization, genetic algorithm, particle swarm optimization,\
    \ artificial bee colony op-\ntimization and differential evolution. For each application\
    \ identified, the algorithms\nused, objectives considered, the nature of the formulation\
    \ and constraints taken in\nv\nto account have been specified and discussed. Lastly,\
    \ the data setup used by each\ncovered work is also mentioned and directions for\
    \ future work have been identified.\nWithin the smart health domain of IoT smart\
    \ cities, human activity recognition\nhas been a key study topic in the development\
    \ of cyber physical systems and as-\nsisted living applications. In particular,\
    \ inertial sensor based systems have become\nincreasingly popular because they\
    \ do not restrict users’ movement and are also rel-\natively simple to implement\
    \ compared to other approaches. Fall detection is one of\nthe most important tasks\
    \ in human activity recognition. With an increasingly aging\nworld population\
    \ and an inclination by the elderly to live alone, the need to incor-\nporate\
    \ dependable fall detection schemes in smart devices such as phones, watches\n\
    has gained momentum. Therefore, differentiating between falls and activities of\
    \ daily\nliving (ADLs) has been the focus of researchers in recent years with\
    \ very good results.\nHowever, one aspect within fall detection that has not been\
    \ investigated much is di-\nrection and severity aware fall detection. Since a\
    \ fall detection system aims to detect\nfalls in people and notify medical personnel,\
    \ it could be of added value to health pro-\nfessionals tending to a patient suffering\
    \ from a fall to know the nature of the accident.\nIn this regard, as a case study\
    \ for smart health, four different experiments have been\nconducted for the task\
    \ of fall detection with direction and severity consideration on\ntwo publicly\
    \ available datasets. These four experiments not only tackle the problem\non an\
    \ increasingly complicated level (the first one considers a fall only scenario\
    \ and\nthe other two a combined activity of daily living and fall scenario) but\
    \ also present\nmethodologies which outperform the state of the art techniques\
    \ as discussed. Lastly,\nfuture recommendation have also been provided for researchers.\n\

    Motivation\nThe world is experiencing a bulging world population and increasing\
    \ urbanization\nwhich is set to grow by more than 10% in the next 30 years [1]\
    \ resulting in a total\nof 70% living in cities by 2050. Countries around the\
    \ world are looking at equipping\ntheir cities to deal with the influx of people\
    \ and the stress it will bring to current\ncity systems [2]. This is to be performed\
    \ keeping in view the UN Sustainable De-\nvelopment Goals 2030 [3]. In this regard,\
    \ Smart Cities have come out as a major\ninitiative by various governments in\
    \ making cities more navigable and welcoming to\nthe expected population increase\
    \ and providing city dwellers a better living experi-\nence, as is evidenced by\
    \ the multiple projects ongoing on both the public and private\nlevel [4, 5, 6,\
    \ 7]. The Internet of Things (IoT) has been the prime enabler of smart\ncities\
    \ as it has provided the means in terms of sensors, architectures, storage and\n\
    other technologies to instrument cities. It allows stakeholders to gather data,\
    \ pro-\ncess it and then make decisions based on the analyses performed. There\
    \ are various\ndomains within smart cities, these include Smart Agriculture, Smart\
    \ City Services,\nSmart Grid, Smart Health, Smart Homes, Smart Industry, Smart\
    \ Infrastructure and\nSmart Transportation.With improvement of Artificial intelligence\
    \ (AI) capabilities\nin the last decade, there have been different applications\
    \ of machine learning (ML)\nand deep learning (DL) algorithms within each of these\
    \ domains providing for better\ndecision making and improvement of services. Apart\
    \ from various supervised and un-\nsupervised learning applications, several tasks\
    \ within different components of smart\ncities can be formulated into optimization\
    \ problems and/or require heuristics to be\nincorporated in some form. However,\
    \ in both such tasks, there is a dearth of an\noverall coverage of Smart City\
    \ IoT based ML/DL and combinatorial optimization\nproblems. Such a coverage would\
    \ be very beneficial to researchers starting in the\nfield and has been presented\
    \ herein.\nOne of the major applications of the IoT Smart Cities is for health\
    \ purposes.\nMany countries around the world, especially in the developed world\
    \ are facing an\naging population. With the retirement of the ’baby boomer’ generation,\
    \ countries\naround the world are facing a big question over caring for their\
    \ elderly population.\nOne of the major issues that elderly people face today\
    \ are falls [8]. In the US, falls\naccount for a majority of the deaths caused\
    \ by injury in population aged 65 and\nabove [9] and a fall related injury occurs\
    \ every 19 minutes [10]. As indicated in [11],\nfalls have been associated with\
    \ estimated medical costs ranging from $31.5 billion for\n2013 to $49.5 billion\
    \ for 2017. Moreover, Floerence et al. [12] notes that in 2018,\nfalls contributed\
    \ to 8% of Medicaid expenses in the US for older adults, consequently\n1\nfalls\
    \ have huge health as well as financial ramifications for people and governments.\n\
    Determining when a person has experienced a fall is therefore an important task\
    \ in\nthe healthcare of people, more so in the old age population who tend to\
    \ increasingly\nlive alone and are at increased risk of suffering from falls.\
    \ Apart from just detecting\nif a fall has occurred or not, the direction of a\
    \ fall is an important consideration\nas well. Bourke et al. [13] notes that even\
    \ though 60% of falls occurring in older\nadults are forward falls, falls occurring\
    \ sideways may result in fracture and thus\nare important to determine. Quick\
    \ dispatch of healthcare providers can result in\ntimely treatment of fall related\
    \ injuries, thereby reducing the overall impact to life\nand wealth. Additional\
    \ information about the fall could benefit the medical dispatch\nteam to help\
    \ decide emergency procedures which could be matched up with patient\nhistory\
    \ of potentially being injury prone in a certain part of the body. In light of\
    \ this\nall, the development of fall detection systems has been of keen interest\
    \ to researchers\nin the domain of human activity recognition, tele-medicine and\
    \ smart health.\n2\nAims\nCiting the importance of IoT usage in communities, the\
    \ aims of this dissertation are\nas follows:\n1. To provide a wholistic coverage\
    \ of IoT based Smart City system design consid-\nering important aspects such\
    \ as sensors, technologies used, IoT architectures,\nthe use of machine/deep learning\
    \ methods and optimization schemes as well as\nthe challenges.\n2. Considering\
    \ the case study of smart health and specifically fall detection, de-\nvelop methodologies\
    \ for detection of falls considering fall direction and severity.\n3\nOrganization\n\

    \ cities for five popular algorithms. It\nthus provides a coverage of optimization\
    \ applications under the IoT smart city um-\nbrella. Chapter V presents work on\
    \ a chosen case study of smart health based on\nIoT. The considered task is fall\
    \ detection with direction and severity consideration.\nFour experiments have\
    \ been performed in this regard considering three scenarios, one\nconsidering\
    \ falls only with direction and severity and two others considering falls and\n\
    activity of daily living (ADL) as a combined problem. The designed methodologies\n\

    The conclusion and future work opportunities are discussed in chapter VI.\n2\n\
    CHAPTER II\nIOT SMART CITIES\n1\nIntroduction\nThis chapter provides an overeview\
    \ of the use of IoT in Smart Cities and discuss\nhow it facilitates such initiatives.\
    \ It starts by laying out the structure of Internet\nof Things in a Smart City\
    \ context, discussing its various applications, components\nand architectures\
    \ while also discussing the technologies used at the different levels of\nthe\
    \ IoT architecture. Lastly, a discussion of the technical challenges that exist\
    \ in the\ndeployment of IoT in the Smart City domain is provided along with identification\
    \ of\npotential solutions to those challenges followed by future directions.\n\
    It is hard to define a Smart City, in fact, cities claim to be ‘smart’ based on\
    \ a\nvariety of criteria, for e.g. implementing novel e-governance schemes, creating\
    \ so-\ncial learning ventures and community engagement programs, focusing on sustainable\n\
    living as well as the more typical application of Information and Communication\n\
    Technologies for innovation [14]. In this work, Smart Cities are defined to be\
    \ the ap-\nplication of various information and communication technologies (ICT)\
    \ with the aim\nof creating a better living experience for a city’s population.\
    \ This encompasses use\nof these technologies in all the domains discussed previously,\
    \ including governance,\ntransport, housing, business, sustainable living, social\
    \ learning, community engage-\nment, providing opportunities and more. In an ideal\
    \ sense, the idea of a smart city\ntranscends the typically set boundaries of\
    \ a traditional city’s administrative and so-\ncial structure by allowing interaction\
    \ between the two, thereby enabling it to operate\nin a more cohesive and engaged\
    \ manner. Smart cities offer several advantages (in\nterms of value) compared\
    \ to a traditional city ecosystem:\n1. Climate goal achievement: Smart cities\
    \ are at the forefront of pioneering tech-\nnologies to help enable countries\
    \ meet climate goals. Smart city focuses on\nsmart energy management, smart transportation\
    \ systems and city administra-\ntion which aim to reduce the carbon footprint\
    \ of cities and enable development\nand use of new technologies for cleaner living.\n\
    2. Money value: Smart City ventures will be a market of USD 1 Trillion by 2025\n\
    [15], this provides a huge monetary incentive for not only governments but\nprivate\
    \ companies to actively contribute to the development of technologies\nsupporting\
    \ smart city development.\n3. Societal impact: The centerpiece of the smart city\
    \ project is to improve the qual-\nity of life of a city’s inhabitants and help\
    \ develop an inclusive society wherein\nevery opinion is catered for and equal\
    \ opportunity is provided. Information and\n3\nCommunication Technologies in the\
    \ smart city context are a fundamental com-\nponent to the provision of public\
    \ services by facilitating interactions of citizens\nwith the city environment\
    \ and making life easier.\n2\nSmart City Components\nA smart city is made up of\
    \ several components which are illustrated in Figure 1.\nSmart city applications\
    \ typically have four aspects associated with them, the first is\nthe collection\
    \ of data, the next is its transmission/reception, third is the storage and\n\
    fourth is analysis. The collection of data is application dependent and has been\
    \ a real\ndriver for sensor development in the various domains. The second part\
    \ is the exchange\nof data, this involves data transmission from the data collection\
    \ units towards the\ncloud for storage and analysis.\nThis task has been achieved\
    \ in several manners,\nmany smart city ventures have city-wide Wi-Fi networks,\
    \ 4G and 5G technologies are\nbeing used, as well as various types of local networks\
    \ which can convey data either\non a local level or a global level. The third\
    \ stage is storage in the cloud, different\nstorage schemes are used to arrange\
    \ and organize data so as to make it usable for\nthe fourth stage which is data\
    \ analysis. Data Analysis refers to the extraction of\npatterns and inferences\
    \ from the gathered data to guide decision making. In some\nsituations, simple\
    \ analysis such as basic decision making and aggregating would work\ntoo. For\
    \ more complex decision making, the availability of the cloud allows not only\n\
    for heterogeneous data gathering/storage and processing but also analysis through\n\
    the use of statistical methods as well as machine and deep Learning algorithms\
    \ in\nreal-time [16].\n2.1\nSmart Agriculture\nFood security is one of the most\
    \ important parts of the United Nations Sustainable\nDevelopment goals for 2030.\
    \ With an increasing world population, worsening climate\nchange causing erratic\
    \ weather in food centers of the world, the race to ensure that\nfood production\
    \ is made sustainable and that dwindling resources such as water are\nutilized\
    \ efficiently has been a high priority for countries around the world. Smart\n\
    agriculture is the use of sensors embedded into plants and fields to measure various\n\
    parameters to help in decision making and prevent/diseases, pests etc [17]. A\
    \ part\nof the smart agriculture paradigm is precision agriculture, which involves\
    \ sensors\nbeing placed in plants to provide targeted measurements and therefore\
    \ allow for\ntargeted care mechanisms to be deployed. Precision agriculture will\
    \ be necessary\nfor food security in the future [18] and therefore is an essential\
    \ part of the fight for\nsustainable food production. The major applications of\
    \ AI in IoT for agriculture are\ncrop monitoring/disease detection and data driven\
    \ crop care and decision making.\n2.2\nSmart City Services\nSmart city services\
    \ encompass the activities that sustain a city’s population, these\ninvolve municipal\
    \ tasks such as supply of water, waste management, environmental\n4\nSmart \n\
    Energy\nSmart \nTransportation\nSmart \nAgriculture\nSmart \nInfrastructure\n\
    Smart  \nCity Services\nSmart Health\nSmart Homes\nSmart  Industry\nFigure 1.\
    \ Smart City Components\ncontrol and monitoring etc. Sensors for water quality\
    \ can be deployed to continually\nprovide an update about the quality of water\
    \ being used in the city and detect leaks\n[19]. One popular component of smart\
    \ city initiatives is the management of waste,\nand it has been the part of many\
    \ of the smart city initiatives mentioned earlier, from\nchutes in Barcelona to\
    \ having bins equipped with sensors and connected to the cloud\nso as to not only\
    \ inform the relevant authorities of the need to empty them but also\nusing AI\
    \ to determine the best route to reduce cost [20]. Sensors can also be used to\n\
    monitor the environmental conditions in a city to determine pollution levels [21]\
    \ and\nguiding citizens to the next free parking space to save fuel costs [22].\n\
    2.3\nSmart Energy\nTypical electrical systems have one-way energy flow from a\
    \ main generator source,\nusually a hydroelectric or fossil fuel based power plant.\
    \ Power generation is controlled\nvia feedback from the substations, however,\
    \ since there is no information feedback\nfrom the consumer end, the power generation\
    \ scheme used with these systems requires\nthat the power being produced by these\
    \ sources outstrips the demand by a large\namount to ensure continuous supply\
    \ of power. The process of detecting faults and\nperforming corrective actions\
    \ in such systems is also a time taking process. Moreover,\nwith renewable energy\
    \ technologies becoming cheaper, the consumer of today not\nonly has a supply\
    \ from the main utility but also performs their own generation.\nSmart Grids is\
    \ the use of ICT to make the current and newly installed grids more\nobservable,\
    \ allow for distributed energy generation, both at the consumer end as well\n\
    as the utility end and introduce self-healing capabilities in to the grid. One\
    \ aspect\n5\nof smart grids is that real time power data is transmitted to utilities\
    \ at different\npoints on the grid throughout the supply lines till the customer.\
    \ Since smart grids\nprovide real-time data about consumer usage, it allows for\
    \ better management of\npower generation using prediction models developed through\
    \ acquired consumption\ndata, integrating different energy sources as well as\
    \ self-healing [23] of the network\nto ensure an uninterrupted supply.\n2.4\n\
    Smart Health\nSmart Health refers to the use of ICT to improve health care availability\
    \ and quality.\nWith an increasing population and rising costs of healthcare,\
    \ this area has been of\nintense focus of researchers as well as healthcare providers.\
    \ Current health systems\nare over burdened and therefore cannot cater to the\
    \ increasing demand from the pop-\nulace. In this regard, smart health aims to\
    \ ensure that healthcare be available to as\nmany people as possible through telemedicine\
    \ services [24] and improved diagnosis\nassistance to doctors utilizing AI [25].\
    \ With the ubiquitousness of mobile phones\nand health trackers [26] that can\
    \ capture real-time data about peoples health (ECGs,\ntemperature, body oxygen\
    \ saturation and other biosensors) while also recording daily\nactivity and detecting\
    \ abnormal movements using inertial sensors, it has become pos-\nsible to leverage\
    \ cloud capabilities for processing this data to make better healthcare\ndecisions.\
    \ Thus reducing the overall costs as well as burden on healthcare facilities.\n\
    2.5\nSmart Home\nOne major component of Smart Cities is the Smart Home since it\
    \ is central to the\nlife of the city’s inhabitants. Smart Homes involve the use\
    \ of sensing units installed\nthroughout a person’s home that provide information\
    \ about the home as well as\nits occupants. These sensors might include user activity\
    \ monitors such as ambient\nsensors, motion trackers and power/energy consumption.\n\
    2.6\nSmart Industry\nIndustries around the world are busy in a continuous pursuance\
    \ of being more ef-\nficient and increasing productivity while reducing cost.\
    \ The industry 4.0 paradigm\nentails the vision of a connected factory where all\
    \ its intermediary functionaries are\nseamlessly integrated, working in tandem\
    \ with each other. This is made possible be-\ncause of the internet of things\
    \ [27]. The use of IoT in manufacturing and production\nprocesses, cyber physical\
    \ systems integrating workers and machines has led to several\nbenefits to the\
    \ industry such as faster and better innovation, optimization of manu-\nfacturing\
    \ schemes (resources and processes), better quality of products and enhanced\n\
    safety for factory workers. However, smart industries come with several challenges\n\
    for IoT usage, working with a set of heterogeneous devices and machines has its\
    \ own\nchallenges and requires cyber physical systems to have flexibility in configuration,\
    \ con-\nnectivity and quick implementation for use in IoT applications for Smart\
    \ Industry\n[28]. Artificial Intelligence has gone hand in hand with IoT to spur\
    \ the development\nand deployment of industry 4.0 services. With sensors being\
    \ embedded in machines\n6\nand other processes in the factory, data from these\
    \ sources provide an opportunity for\nusing AI techniques to increase automation,\
    \ perform business intelligence operations\nand more. In fact, researchers have\
    \ suggested frameworks for integrating AI within\nIoT for Smart Industry [28,\
    \ 29, 30]. The major applications of AI in the industry are\npredictive maintenance,\
    \ monitoring/fault detection (machine health) and production\nmanagement.\n2.7\n\
    Smart Infrastructure\nThe infrastructure of a city is paramount to its living\
    \ quality, city governments need\nto construct new bridges, roads and buildings\
    \ for the use of its inhabitants and also\nperform maintenance for uninterrupted\
    \ usage. Smart infrastructure helps cities in\nensuring their infrastructure is\
    \ in shape and usable by utilizing sensors for measuring\nbuilding/bridge structural\
    \ state for structural health monitoring using accelerome-\nters [31] and smart\
    \ materials [32]. Data collected through these sensors allows for\npredictive\
    \ maintenance of these essential units to maintain normal operation of the\ncity.\n\
    2.8\nSmart Transport\nMany urban centers suffer from traffic problems, this includes\
    \ congestion, pollution,\nscheduling and cost reduction issues for public transport.\
    \ The rapid development\nand implementation of new Information and Communication\
    \ Technologies, Vehicle-\nInfrastructure-Pedestrian communication has become commonplace.\
    \ Whether it be\nVehicle to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I), Vehicle\
    \ to Pedestrian (V2P)\nor Pedestrian to Infrastructure (P2I), such technologies\
    \ have made the design of smart\ntransportation systems possible. With cars having\
    \ a GPS device and the common-\nality of cellphones with every driver, many approaches\
    \ use GPS data to track driver\nbehavior and traffic patterns [33]. This real-time\
    \ data is already used for route map-\nping in applications such as Waze and Google\
    \ Maps and used for trip scheduling in\npublic transport. Parking systems equipped\
    \ with sensors can also guide drivers to\nthe nearest free parking spot.\n3\n\
    Internet of Things for Smart Cities\nAt the heart of the smart city initiatives\
    \ is the internet of things, it is the enabling\ntechnology that has allowed for\
    \ the pervasive digitization that gives rise to the con-\ncept of smart cities.\
    \ The internet of things refers to the ubiquitous connection of\ndevices to the\
    \ internet, allowing them to send information to the cloud and poten-\ntially\
    \ get directions for performing actions. IoT involves the collection of data and\n\
    performing data analytics operations to extract information in order to support\
    \ de-\ncision and policy making. It is estimated that by 2025 more than 75 billion\
    \ devices\nwill be connected to the internet [34], spearheading even more application\
    \ develop-\nment. Within the smart city context, IoT allows for sensors to collect\
    \ and send data\n7\nabout the city’s state to a central cloud, which is then mined\
    \ or processed for pattern\nextraction and decision-making purposes.\n3.1\nIoT\
    \ Architectures for Smart cities\nThe Internet of Things unifies the operations\
    \ of data sensing, transmission/recep-\ntion, processing and storage through the\
    \ use cloud services. Based on technology, a\ngeneric IoT architecture consists\
    \ of five layers where successive layers operate on the\ninformation from the\
    \ previous layer as shown in Figure 2. It also shows the three\ndifferent architectures\
    \ that exist for IoT systems.\nCloud Computing\nEdge computing\nFog Computing\n\

    Layer\nNetwork Layer\nSensing Layer\nFigure 2. IoT Architecture\nThe Sensing layer,\
    \ also called the Perception layer consists of sensors that can\nget information\
    \ about physical quantities of interest in any application as well as\nactuators\
    \ which can act upon physical objects, such as Radio Frequency IDentification\n\
    (RFID) readers for reading RFID tags and other such devices. The data read by\
    \ the\nsensing layer is passed onward to the Middleware layer using the networking\
    \ layer\nthrough wireless network technologies such as Wi-Fi, cellular internet,\
    \ Zigbee and\nBluetooth etc.\nThe Middleware layer provides a generic interface\
    \ for the sensing\nlayer hardware and the Application layer which uses the data\
    \ through various API’s\nand database management services to provide users with\
    \ services. The Business layer\nis attached to the application layer and is used\
    \ to develop strategies and formulate\npolicies that help manage the complete\
    \ system.\nIn terms of architectures, typically, IoT architectures are categorized\
    \ based on\nthe type of operation responsibilities allocated to parts of the IoT\
    \ system, this cat-\negorization is based mainly on processing of data responsibilities.\
    \ There are three\narchitectures of IoT systems with respect to the stage of the\
    \ IoT framework where\nprocessing of data can be carried out and these are Cloud,\
    \ Fog and Edge Models.\nTable 1 lists the traits of each of three layers of the\
    \ IoT system. It is important to\n8\nmention that the three IoT architectures\
    \ discussed here are not mutually exclusive,\ninstead the aim of this hierarchy\
    \ is to complement the higher layer by providing it only\nuseful information which\
    \ makes the system more productive and dependable. For any\nIoT system designer,\
    \ the aim is to establish a balance between the capabilities of the\nthree layers\
    \ keeping in view system costs and requirements.\n3.1.1\nCloud Computing Model\n\
    This was the first proposed architecture for IoT systems and is based on the premise\n\
    that processing of data from the various components in the IoT system should take\n\
    place in the cloud. Cloud computing allows for the remote accessing of uninterrupted\n\
    shared resources (computing, storage and services) over the network. It should\
    \ be\nable to dynamically allocate these resources without human intervention,\
    \ schedule\nor pool as necessary and be able to be accessed from a variety of\
    \ different platforms\n[35]. The cloud can provide both hardware as well as software\
    \ services for smart city\napplications. It has the advantage that it provides\
    \ a central management platform\nfrom which to observe, control the IoT system\
    \ as well as to disseminate command\nactions based on the received data. Moreover,\
    \ this centralization also allows for cloud\nsystems to have sufficiently large\
    \ computing and storage capacities thereby allowing\nthem to perform complex tasks\
    \ of data mining, pattern extraction and making infer-\nences from sensor data\
    \ in smart cities to make use of it in the best manner possible.\nHowever, there\
    \ are a few disadvantages with using the cloud computing model for\nthe IoT. First,\
    \ transmitting all gathered data to the cloud increases network traffic,\neven\
    \ though this may not be true for applications in which measurements are not\n\
    very frequent, but in other cases, this could increase network costs. Moreover,\
    \ data\ntransmission overheads may increase due to the large amount of data that\
    \ needs to\nbe transmitted by the many sensors existing in the smart city scenario.\
    \ Another\ndisadvantage that the cloud computing model suffers from is data latency,\
    \ since the\nsensing units exist at the sensing layer and the decision making/data\
    \ processing takes\nplace in the cloud, this gives rise to data latency in the\
    \ transmission of sensing infor-\nmation, especially when many devices start sending\
    \ data at the same time. Network\nreliability can be an issue when using this\
    \ model, with the large volume of data traffic\non the network, it might not be\
    \ possible to enforce robust data transmission schemes\nas IoT systems get bigger.\n\
    3.1.2\nFog Computing Model\nSince most of the information produced with in IoT\
    \ takes place towards the sensing\nend of the IoT system, also called the edge,\
    \ Fog Computing was proposed in [36]\nto overcome some of the problems of the\
    \ cloud computing model for the IoT. Fog\ncomputing provides a more diverse distribution\
    \ of responsibilities than are dictated\nby the cloud computing architecture by\
    \ moving some of the processing to devices\non the local network.\nTypically,\
    \ Fog computing refers to data processing that is\ncarried out by routers and\
    \ other network devices within in the Network layer in the\nIoT. Since network\
    \ devices nowadays increasingly offer better computational capabil-\n9\nities,\
    \ one can leverage them to perform rudimentary operations on data. Operations\n\
    such as aggregation and collection of sensor data, simple processing operations\
    \ and\ndecision-making can be performed to reduce the amount of information flow\
    \ towards\nthe higher cloud layer. Questions that need to be answered for the\
    \ decision-making\nprocess include but are not limited to for e.g., does the decision\
    \ require the use of\naveraging for one quantity and instantaneous values of the\
    \ other? Is it possible to\nextrapolate data received for one quantity and use\
    \ the currently measured value for\nanother one? Based on the previous data for\
    \ a given period, can one provide higher\nlayers with decision options rather\
    \ than just data, thereby providing better quality\ninformation to the cloud layer\
    \ thus resulting in better utilization of cloud resources.\nFog layers can localize\
    \ decision making since they have access to the local state of a\ngiven region\
    \ [37]. This would be helpful in implementing distributed decision mak-\ning mechanisms\
    \ which might be necessary in some applications. Moreover, they also\nallow for\
    \ local networks to be established using non-internet technologies such as Zig-\n\
    bee, Bluetooth, RFID etc where sensors and other end devices transmit data to\
    \ the\nFog node (also referred to as access points in such systems) which is connected\
    \ to the\ncloud.\nFog computing results in reduced costs for deployment of IoT\
    \ systems, increases ro-\nbustness as latency, data overhead and errors in transmission\
    \ are reduced. This also\nimproves the efficiency of the applications as quicker\
    \ decisions can be made on the\nreceived data, which is important in critical\
    \ decision-making situations. Moreover,\nFog devices have the capability to not\
    \ only receive data from similar devices at the\nedge but also collect it from\
    \ many different types of devices. This capability to mea-\nsure different parameters\
    \ in the edge environment enable for an application neutral\nIoT system architecture\
    \ to be developed.\nData sent upward by the Fog layer in the IoT hierarchy would\
    \ be used to gain insights\nin to system behavior and to guide new rules of system\
    \ operation, this will typically\nbe carried out in the cloud. Devices in the\
    \ Fog layer may be provided decision making\nguidance from the higher cloud layer\
    \ to ensure smooth system operation. However,\na balance needs to be struck as\
    \ to the division of responsibilities between the cloud\nand the fog layer keeping\
    \ in view the costs involved.\n3.1.3\nEdge Computing Model\nThe purpose of Fog\
    \ Computing was to push some of the decision making towards\nthe edge of the network.\
    \ In recent years, with increasingly capable devices being\ndeveloped that are\
    \ attached to ‘edge’ nodes, simple decision making, and processing\nof data has\
    \ been increasingly moved on to these devices so as to reduce network\nand device\
    \ costs even further at the fog level and make for even deeper distributed\ndecision-making\
    \ schemes. Edge computing refers to data processing that is done at\nthe ”thing”\
    \ level, i.e. by sensors and other devices in the IoT system [38]. Another\nconcept\
    \ about Edge computing as discussed in [39] defines the Edge computing layer\n\
    as an intermediary layer between the Fog and the ‘things’ (sensors) rather than\
    \ edge\nnodes. The difference between them in this case is the Edge computing\
    \ nodes act\nas aggregation and decision-making units on a smaller scale compared\
    \ to fog devices\n10\nwhich act to provide seamless connectivity and data integrity\
    \ throughout the IoT\nnetwork. The aim of the Fog and the Edge computing paradigms\
    \ is to decentralize\nthe IoT system for purposes of reducing cost, increasing\
    \ scalability and increasing\nrobustness.\nTable 1. Comparison of Cloud, Fog and\

    \ Internet of Things promises the digitization of all aspects of our lives. For\
    \ smart\ncities, this digitization process entails the proliferation of sensing\
    \ nodes in every\ndomain of a city’s operation mechanism. With an application\
    \ scope this broad, the\ncreation and subsequent deployment of IoT systems in\
    \ smart cities carry enormous\nchallenges that need to be considered. In this\
    \ section, a discussion is provided of\nthe challenges that IoT system designers\
    \ face when making deployments in smart\ncity applications.\nThe focus in this\
    \ work is on the technological challenges that\npertain to IoT use in smart cities\
    \ and has also been the focus of researchers. Figure 3\nshows the different challenges\
    \ which Smart City IoT system deployment encounters,\nnamely Security and Privacy,\
    \ Smart Sensors, Networking and Big Data Analytics. A\nsummary of the discussion\
    \ in this section is presented in Table 2.\n11\nSmart City\nChallenges\nSmart\

    3.2.1\nSecurity and Privacy\nSecurity, along with Privacy is the primary concern\
    \ in smart cities.\nSmart cities\ninvolve having essential city infrastructures\
    \ online, any aberration in the operation\nof the city’s services will bring inconvenience\
    \ to its citizens and put human lives and\nproperty at risk. Therefore, security\
    \ is a big concern in smart cities. In today’s age\nwhere cybercrime and warfare\
    \ have become a tactic in world politics, smart cities\nare at an ever-greater\
    \ risk of being the target of such malicious attacks. Encryption\nof data transmitted\
    \ over the network is necessary in this scenario. For smart city\nprojects to\
    \ be successful, they require the trust and participation of citizens. The\nproliferation\
    \ of sensors in smart cities, which continuously collect data about the\nactivity\
    \ of people may expose the daily activities of citizens to unwanted parties.\n\
    Moreover, companies and corporations on the IoT network may use citizen data\n\
    without their approval for things like targeted advertising and may perform acts\
    \ such\nas eavesdropping etc. Solutions to this will require processes that anonymize\
    \ data\ncollection while retaining the integrity of the context of the measured\
    \ task so that\napt decision making is possible. Security and Privacy has been\
    \ covered in detail in a\nlater section.\n12\n3.2.2\nSmart Sensors\nSmart sensors\
    \ are the hardware components that gather data in smart cities. These\ndevices\
    \ are manufactured by a host of different vendors that adhere to different sens-\n\
    ing mechanisms, standards of measurement, data formats and connectivity proto-\n\
    cols. Smart city deployment will require all these devices to exchange data, perform\n\
    scheduling of tasks between them and be able to aggregate data together for mak-\n\
    ing inferences. A solution to this issue is to develop and use open protocols\
    \ and\ndata formats that will enable manufacturers to create equipment that can\
    \ communi-\ncate between each other, further spurring IoT system deployment. Another\
    \ solution\ncould be the development of ‘standard’ access point nodes for IoT\
    \ systems that can\ncommunicate to devices using several different communication\
    \ protocols and are able\nto decode the information received. Some manufacturers\
    \ have, in fact, made their\nproducts compatible with other protocols as mentioned\
    \ in [40].\nAnother challenge for smart sensors is reliability and robustness.\
    \ Reliability and\nrobustness refer to the dependability and correctness of the\
    \ IoT system. IoT is the\nbackbone of future smart cities and being imperative\
    \ to their operation, the IoT\nsystem needs to provide a smooth experience to\
    \ its users. This requires that service\nrequests from users of the application\
    \ receive an accurate and timely response. The\nquality of service needs to be\
    \ ensured for every citizen in the smart city. Systems\nthat deliver critical\
    \ utilities such as transport, electricity etc. should be decentralized.\nThe\
    \ distributed connection points will allow for robustness and increase reliability.\n\
    One such example is self-healing in Smart Grids [23].\nMany current networking\
    \ protocols are developed for infrastructure networked\ndevices which have access\
    \ to continuous power, however, sensors in smart cities will\nbe mobile in many\
    \ scenarios and thus be battery powered. Moreover, they will need\nto measure,\
    \ transfer and in some cases save data they have collected. This requires\nthe\
    \ development of not only low power, low overhead data transmission schemes\n\
    but also development of new memory and storage technologies as well as low power\n\
    devices that extend battery life as much as possible. Storing this large amount\
    \ of\ndata would require development of compression algorithms which will be employed\n\
    and database schemes that will need to be developed in the future as smart cities\n\
    and IoT are scaled up. Solutions for power issues necessitate the development\
    \ of new\nbattery technologies and perhaps the incorporation of energy harvesting\
    \ mechanisms\nin such devices to make long lasting service provision possible.\n\
    3.2.3\nNetworking\nThe IoT depends on the capability of sensing and other devices\
    \ to be able to send\nand receive information to each other and the Cloud. With\
    \ new smart city appli-\ncations coming up, providing networking to these devices\
    \ to remain connected is a\nbig challenge. Current networking methods are not\
    \ optimized to providing network-\ning services for smart city components. Many\
    \ devices in smart cities have mobility\nand data throughput requirements which\
    \ need to be met to provide an acceptable\nquality of service. Different approaches\
    \ have been suggested in terms of defining ac-\n13\ncess points, local networks\
    \ etc. to solve this problem. Another aspect of networking\nwould be working on\
    \ efficient and dynamic routing protocols that can serve IoT re-\nquirements capable\
    \ of working with stationary as well as devices in motion, which\nmany current\
    \ protocols do not offer sufficiently [41].\n3.2.4\nBig Data Analytics\nIoT connected\
    \ devices generated 13.6 Zetta Bytes of data in 2018 and this is expected\nto\
    \ grow to 79.4 Zetta Bytes till 2025 [34]. To make use of this data and continuously\n\
    improve the services that are delivered in smart cities, new data analytics algorithms\n\
    need to be developed. With the myriad of the different parameters that are measured\n\
    in smart cities, these algorithms need to be applicable to data of varying nature\
    \ (both\nstructured and unstructured), better data fusion techniques need to be\
    \ developed as\nwell so as to combine them in meaningful ways and be able to extract\
    \ inferences and\nrecognize patterns. Deep learning has been of interest in this\
    \ area as it can lever-\nage on this large amount of data to provide better results\
    \ for different applications.\nAnother important consideration would be to ensure\
    \ that the developed algorithms\nare scalable in that they have enough generality\
    \ and can be used through out the\nintended application. For, e.g., for the purposes\
    \ of activity recognition, the authors\nin [42] found that a CNN trained for activity\
    \ recognition on one dataset failed to\nperform well on others or in [43] where\
    \ the deep learning network performs poorly\nwhen the color of tomatoes is different\
    \ from what it was trained on. Concept drift is\nanother issue of concern as with\
    \ the continuous acquisition of data, the properties of\ndata may change over\
    \ time. Techniques such as incremental learning may be useful\nin this respect.\
    \ Explainability is another important factor for Smart City analytics\nto be widely\
    \ acceptable, specially in the area of smart health. There have been some\napproaches\
    \ suggested towards this end, in [44] a hybrid deep learning classifier and\n\
    semantic web technologies based solution is demonstrated for the application of\
    \ flood\nmonitoring. In [45], the authors present an explainable deep learning\
    \ based health-\ncare system at the Edge for COVID-19 care based on a distributed\
    \ learning paradigm\nwith promising results. However, more work needs to be performed\
    \ to incorporate\nexplainability techniques such as distillation, visualization,\
    \ and intrinsic methods into\nMachine and Deep Learning based smart city applications\
    \ in order to increase smart\ncity application proliferation.\n3.3\nSensing Technologies\n\
    Sensing is at the heart of smart city technologies. Sensors provide the knowledge\
    \ and\ndata from which smart city innovations are created. With the vastly different\
    \ nature\nof Smart City projects and its various components, there are numerous\
    \ sensors which\nare used as part of these initiatives. The authors in [58] have\
    \ provided a framework\nfor the comparison of IoT sensors and have listed sensors\
    \ they found in use for the\nInternet of Things. We use their work to direct our\
    \ survey of the sensing technologies\nused in smart cities. Sensors within IoT\
    \ can be divided in to several groups, these are\nambient, motion, electric, biosensors,\
    \ identification, presence, hydraulic and chemical\n14\nTable 2. Smart City IoT\

    \ are the key component in smart city IoT\nsystems which provide the interaction\
    \ between the smart city system and the city’s\ninhabitants and allow for new\
    \ services to be developed. One thing to note is that\nmany of the sensors find\
    \ applications in multiple areas as discussed. Furthermore,\nany given application\
    \ will require measuring different physical quantities and will\nrequire the use\
    \ of many different types of sensors. For, e.g., ambient, motion, electric,\n\
    identification, position, chemical and hydraulic sensors have been found to be\
    \ used in\nsmart homes. As noted in the challenges, working with different sensors\
    \ which might\nhave different output data types is a task that needs to be dealt\
    \ with when working\nwith multiple types of sensors. Table 3 presents a summary\
    \ of the sensors used in\neach smart city component.\n3.3.1\nAmbient Sensors\n\
    Ambient sensors include sensors used to measure physical quantities indicating\
    \ to\nenvironmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, light intensity\
    \ and pressure.\nAmbient sensors are used in a variety of smart city applications\
    \ including smart homes\nwhere they are used to regulate the comfort level, they\
    \ are also used for smart city\nservices.\n3.3.2\nBio-Sensors\nBio-sensors are\
    \ used for measuring health parameters of living things. Bio-sensors in\nsmart\
    \ cities are used for monitoring patients for healthcare purposes. Such sensors\

    and more.\n3.3.3\nChemical\nChemical sensors are used to measure chemical properties\
    \ of materials, this includes\ngas sensors which can measure/detect carbon monoxide\
    \ (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2)\nand other gases for air quality monitoring, sensors\
    \ for detecting smoke, pH and other\nsensors for water quality monitoring etc.\n\
    3.3.4\nElectric Sensors\nElectric sensors allow for the measurement of electrical\
    \ power and are widely used in\nsmart grids and smart homes to monitor the power\
    \ consumption of consumers/ap-\npliances. Types include current transformers and\
    \ voltage sensors to measure current\nand voltage, respectively.\n3.3.5\nHydraulic\n\
    Hydraulic sensors refer to sensors used for liquid measurements such as level,\
    \ flow,\nleak detection. These are used for measurement of liquid levels in tanks\
    \ [59].\n16\n3.3.6\nIdentification\nIdentification sensors refer to RFID tags\
    \ and Near Field Communication (NFC) de-\nvices. These sensors are used in applications\
    \ involving payments, data exchange in\nthe domain of smart transportation and\
    \ smart city services.\n3.3.7\nMotion Sensors\nMotion sensors refer to sensors\
    \ that can be used for the detection of motion. Sensors\nfor motion sensing involve\
    \ inertial sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes.\nThese sensors are used\
    \ in smart health applications such as activity tracking as well\nas applications\
    \ like vibration sensing in smart homes and industry.\n3.3.8\nPresence\nPresence\
    \ sensors indicate to the presence of a humans or objects. Passive InfraRed\n\
    (PIR) sensors are very popular and are used to detect human motion, reed switches\n\
    can be used on windows and doors for security purposes, inductive loop sensors\
    \ which\nuse electromagnetic induction can be used to detect presence in transport\
    \ systems.\nUltrasonic sensors are also used to determine the distance of objects.\n\
    Capacitive\nsensors are also included in this type, these may be used to determine\
    \ position.\n3.3.9\nOther Sensors\nVarious smart city applications make use of\
    \ different sensing modalities such as audio\nor visual information or other signal\
    \ measurement devices, for, e.g., bluetooth and\nWi-Fi signal strength. Since\
    \ the sensors for these modalities capture raw information\nabout signals (visual,\
    \ sound or signal strength etc.), the gathered data is typically\nprocessed further\
    \ before it indicates to the target variable being measured.\n3.4\nNetworking\
    \ Technologies\nThe internet of things in smart cities depends on the aggregation\
    \ of data measured by\nindividual sensing units placed throughout the smart city\
    \ environment. Systems that\ncan use these measurements individually have long\
    \ existed and provided automation\nfor small projects. However, the ‘smart’ in\
    \ smart city comes from the collective usage\nof the data from these individual\
    \ sensing units to perform complex decisions while\ndelivering services to citizens.\
    \ The collective use of this data enables its analysis over\na wider scope compared\
    \ to individual levels so as to determine long term patterns\nand provide meaningful\
    \ insights to support services. The number of such IoT devices\ncurrently present\
    \ in the world [34] are multiple times that of the world population.\nTo enable\
    \ these devices to exchange data, wireless technologies need to be used as\nphysical\
    \ connections would, for one, be too costly (where ever they can be used),\nsecond,\
    \ would not satisfy the mobility requirements that are typical of many smart\n\
    city applications. The internet has provided connectivity to computers, smartphones\n\
    and other electronic devices around the world with each other, allowing for instant\n\

    transfer of information between them. However, for IoT the internet may not neces-\n\
    sarily be the only communication method [72] as many applications do not possess\n\
    edge devices that can connect to the internet. An application may consist of a\
    \ local\nnetwork of sensing units which can exchange data between them and rely\
    \ on a multi-\nhop communication protocol to send data to a central node, hub\
    \ or gateway. The\ngateway might be fixed and would be connected to the internet,\
    \ thereby relaying any\nmonitored data to the cloud for further processing or\
    \ use. It might also be possible\nthat devices within an application may use many\
    \ different protocols with the central\nnode having the capability to communicate\
    \ with all of them, a common case for such\narchitectures is the smart home where\
    \ manufacturers produce devices using propriety\nor incompatible protocols for\
    \ which a hub may be used, an example of such a system\nwas provided in [73] and\
    \ several hubs are commercially available. In this section, we\ndiscuss the network\
    \ types, topologies and protocols used in the Internet of Things for\nSmart City\
    \ applications as illustrated in Figure 5. We later provide a comparison of\n\
    these protocols in Table 4.\n3.4.1\nNetwork Topologies\nThere are three IoT network\
    \ topologies, point to point, star and mesh [74]. The first\ntype of topology\
    \ is the point to point topology where devices are connected to each\nother sequentially\
    \ in a point to point manner. Point to point networks introduce\ndata hops for\
    \ packets that need to be sent to other nodes as data needs to go through\neach\
    \ node in the path of the two nodes wanting to exchange data. Point to point\n\
    networks are not very popular in IoT systems as it ranks low on fault resiliency\
    \ and\nwill breakdown if there is a fault in any of the intermediate nodes. In\
    \ Star topology,\n18\nall units in a network are connected to a central node or\
    \ gateway and cannot send data\nto each other directly. In order to perform an\
    \ exchange of data among themselves, the\ndevices need to send it through the\
    \ central node. Star topology networks, with their\ncentral node structure provide\
    \ a natural aggregation scheme for data collection within\nthe internet of things,\
    \ however, large networks consisting of many devices, which can\nbe the case in\
    \ most smart city applications, may result in high latency and possible\nbottlenecks\
    \ in high information throughput scenarios. Star topology has been used in\nvarious\
    \ applications including disaster management [75] and environmental sensing\n\
    [76]. The last type of network topology that is used in IoT is the Mesh network\n\
    topology, mesh networks allow all individual devices to communicate between them.\n\
    By enabling communication between the nodes in a network, mesh topology offers\n\
    a larger range as data transmitted towards a certain node can make multiple hops\n\
    through the network, this also increases the networks resilience as alternate\
    \ paths\ncould be used if packet delivery fails due to any node becoming faulty.\
    \ In fact, such\ntopologies have been used in smart homes [77] as well as in smart\
    \ grids [78]. There are\nother topologies which have not been mentioned, for,\
    \ e.g., tree (which has multiple\nstar networks connected in a point by point\
    \ fashion).\n3.4.2\nNetwork Architectures\nNetwork Architecture refers to the\
    \ structure of the network used for a given appli-\ncation. As discussed earlier,\
    \ the ‘things’ in IoT may not necessarily be connected\nthrough the internet,\
    \ in fact a distributed connectivity structure may be imple-\nmented with only\
    \ one unit in the network being capable of sending data to the\ncloud depending\
    \ on the requirement. Work in [72] mentions three types of network\narchitectures\
    \ that are used for smart cities based on IoT. These are Home Area\nNetworks (HANs),\
    \ Wide Area Networks (WANs) and Field/Neighborhood Area Net-\nworks (FANs/NANs).\
    \ Home Area Networks are short range networks and are usually\nused to transmit\
    \ information to a central node which is responsible for data collection\nbefore\
    \ it is sent to the cloud. Communication within the network is performed using\n\
    some low power communication protocol such as Zigbee, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi etc. HANs\n\
    are very popular in smart homes where they are used to gather power consumption\n\
    and times of operation data from a multitude of appliances which are then sent\
    \ to\na smart meter as part of a smart grid [79]. The second type of network architecture\n\
    is Field Area Networks (FANs), sometimes also called Neighborhood Area Networks\n\
    (NANs). Field Area Networks have a larger communication range than HANs and\n\
    are used to provide connection between a customer (for, e.g., in a smart grid)\
    \ to the\nutility company. Wide Area Networks are used for network structures\
    \ that require\ncommunication over large distances. These networks are not as\
    \ dense as HANs or\nFANs and utilize technologies such as cellular services, wired\
    \ connections such as fiber\noptics as well as a class of low power protocols\
    \ designed for WANs themselves [80].\nWANs are used in a variety of smart city\
    \ applications including Smart Grids where\nthey are used to connect multiple\
    \ substations together or exchanging data between\nthe customer and the substation\
    \ [81].\n19\n3.4.3\nNetwork Protocols\nThe type of network to use depends on the\
    \ requirements of the application. It is\nimperative that the communication protocol\
    \ used in a smart city application meet\nthe desirable quality of service (QoS).\
    \ Several protocols have been used in the internet\nof things for smart cities\
    \ [48, 82, 83, 84], herein, we discuss the traits of the most\npopular wireless\
    \ networking protocols used in smart cities.\n3.4.3.1\nRFID\nRadio Frequency Identification\
    \ (RFID) utilizes radio frequencies\nto transmit and receive data. RFID communication\
    \ consists of two types of devices,\none device is the Reader and the other is\
    \ called the Tag. The Reader is usually\npowered and once a tag comes in the vicinity\
    \ of the reader, an exchange of information\ntakes place after authorization as\
    \ the tag harvests the energy from the reader. Such\ntags are called passive tags,\
    \ there are also active tags which are do not depend on the\nreader for their\
    \ power. Depending on the standard, RFID can operate on different\nfrequencies\
    \ in the radio frequency spectrum between 125 KHz to 928 MHz and can\nbe used\
    \ over short ranges. They are used in applications such as smart transport\n(toll\
    \ tax collection, parking), smart health and more.\n3.4.3.2\nNear Field Communication\n\
    Near Field Communication (NFC) is very\nsimilar to RFID, however, the structure\
    \ of NFC communication doesn’t consist of\ntags and readers. Unlike RFID, both\
    \ devices which want to communicate using NFC\nneed to be powered and data tranmission/reception\
    \ can take place in both directions\nunlike RFIDs. This enables the use of NFC\
    \ to control and configure devices unlike the\nRFID which cannot be used for measurement\
    \ or control tasks. NFC utilizes similar\nfrequencies to RFID but is used for\
    \ very short distances. NFC devices are popular\nfor applications involving payment\
    \ using smart phones and are also used in smart\nhomes.\n3.4.3.3\nBluetooth\n\
    Bluetooth is a low energy protocol popular in IoT applica-\ntions as it can support\
    \ an unlimited number of nodes [82]. The protocol is designed\nfor short range,\
    \ low bandwidth communication in an arrangement where devices can\neasily exit\
    \ or enter the network. Bluetooth natively supports the star topology as it\n\
    has a master device at the center of the communication mechanism. It operates\
    \ in\nthe 2.4 GHz ISM band and can have maximum data rates of 2 Mbps. Bluetooth\
    \ has\nbeen widely used in smart home due to it providing a direct connection\
    \ interface to\nsmart phones without the need for any intermediary hub device.\n\
    3.4.3.4\nZ-Wave\nZ-Wave or Zensys wave is a low power protocol developed to\n\
    be used in home automation applications. It is a low speed protocol with a short\n\
    range, operating in the frequencies of 868 MHz and 900 MHz. It operates in a master\n\
    slave fashion where a master can have multiple slave devices which can respond\
    \ to\ncommands from the master node. Therefore this is well suited for applications\
    \ where\na central control element is present and needs to gather data from multiple\
    \ sensing\nunits such as smart homes and smart healthcare systems.\n20\n3.4.3.5\n\
    Li-Fi\nLi-Fi (Light Fidelity) uses visible light instead of radio frequency\n\
    (RF) to exchange data. The advantage with using Li-Fi over RF communication is\n\
    that it can utilize already present lighting systems which also results in conservation\n\
    of power [85]. It offers very high speeds of data transfer for short distances\
    \ and has\nbeen used in parking systems.\n3.4.3.6\nWi-Fi\nWi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)\
    \ operates using wireless frequencies in the\n2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands to provide\
    \ high speed internet connectivity in a limited\ndistance. Wi-Fi is popular in\
    \ many smart city applications as it provides ready to\nuse interface to smart\
    \ phones, computers and other wearable gadgets.\n3.4.3.7\nZigbee\nThe ZigBee protocol\
    \ was developed as a low power low cost pro-\ntocol for wireless sensor networks\
    \ (WSNs) and has evolved to be used in the Internet\nof Things. The ZigBee protocol\
    \ operates in the 868 MHz/915 MHz/2.4 GHz band\nand offers moderate data transfer\
    \ speeds with distances similar to Wi-Fi in a multi-\nhop data transfer scheme.\
    \ Zigbee radios are low cost devices and therefore it is a\npopular protocol used\
    \ by many manufacturers of smart home, smart healthcare de-\nvices. A ZigBee network\
    \ will have three devices, one called the coordinator which\nis the controller\
    \ of the network, the router which is responsible for moving data to\nother devices\
    \ and the ZigBee end device (sensors and actuators).\n3.4.3.8\nWi-SUN\nThe Wireless\
    \ Smart Utility Network (Wi-SUN) is a network\napproved by Institute of Electrical\
    \ and Electronic Engineers (IEEE) and is used in\nfield area networks for utility\
    \ metering, automation of distribution for utilities such\nas electricity, gas\
    \ etc. and also for demand response systems for utility-based appli-\ncations.\
    \ It supports IPv6 addressing and can be used in star or mesh configuration\n\
    where it also allows for multi-hop communication [86].\n3.4.3.9\nCellular\nCellular\
    \ technologies refers to 3G, 4G and 5G communications.\nAlong with Bluetooth and\
    \ Zigbee, they are the most popular IoT enabling technolo-\ngies. Cellular communication\
    \ provides high data rate and supports more content rich\napplications compared\
    \ to the other protocols. With the long range they provide, they\nare preferred\
    \ for a variety of applications where power is not an issue. Depending on\nthe\
    \ technology, cellular bands range from 600 MHz to 80 GHz with very high data\n\
    rates.\n3.4.3.10\nLoRaWAN\nLoRaWAN stands for Long Range Wide Area Network (Lo-\n\
    RaWAN) and it is a Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) that consists of several\n\
    gateways and multiple end devices with the gateways connected to a back-end net-\n\
    work server. The back-end server provides connection to the cloud. End devices\
    \ do\nnot have a fixed association with a specific gateway and may send data to\
    \ multiple\ngateways when it needs to transfer data to the cloud.\n21\n3.4.3.11\n\
    6LoWPAN\n6LoWPAN which is short for IPv6 over Low Power Net-\nworks was created\
    \ by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) specifically for\ninternet of\
    \ things applications with the aim of making it possible for providing in-\nternet\
    \ connectivity to small devices. It is an IP based network and leverages IPv6\n\
    communication. This is a short-range network operating in Industrial, Scientific\
    \ and\nMedical (ISM) bands.\n3.4.3.12\nSigFox\nSigFox is a proprietary standard\
    \ developed by SigFox Inc., France.\nIt uses unlicensed bands to perform ultra-narrowband\
    \ bidirectional communication\nwith low speeds [87]. SigFox has a similar architecture\
    \ to LoRaWAN and like Lo-\nRaWAN and 6LoWPAN, SigFox is a popular LPWAN in the\
    \ IoT domain offering\nsufficiently large distances of communication of up to\
    \ 50 km. SigFox finds applica-\ntions in security in buildings, smart lighting\
    \ and environmental monitoring.\n3.4.3.13\nNB-IoT\nNB-IoT (Narrow Band IoT) is\
    \ a type of LPWAN which oper-\nates on Global System for Mobile Communications\
    \ (GSM) and Long-Term Evolution\n(LTE) bands. In fact, it can operate using the\
    \ same hardware with a software up-\ngrade as it is considered a bare bones version\
    \ of LTE. It allows for connecting up to\n100,000 devices per cell.\nTable 4.\

    \ Smart Cities.\n3.5\nSecurity and Privacy in Smart City IoT\nSmart Cities involve\
    \ the transmission of sensing data, control information through\nthe internet\
    \ as well as local networks. Moreover, several components in smart cities\ntend\
    \ to critical aspects of a citys operation and are highly intertwined with the\
    \ social\nand private life of its citizens. Consequently, security and privacy\
    \ in Smart Cities\nis of great importance and has been of high interest to researchers\
    \ [51, 88, 89, 90,\n91, 92]. The topic of Security of IoT has been covered in\
    \ [93] who deliberate upon\nthe challenges faced in the different architectures\
    \ of the IoT and present issues and\nsolutions. We cover security for IoT in smart\
    \ cities so as to highlight issues that are\npertinent to in the Smart City context\
    \ and to complete our discussion on this topic.\nSmart Cities are enabled by collecting\
    \ data through sensors within a city as well\nas its populace, process it and\
    \ then mine it to provide a better quality of life to the\npeople living. These\
    \ sensors can provide an estimate about the internal state of a\ncity’s components\
    \ such as transportation, power system, building condition/state,\nhuman mobility\
    \ and more. All of this data is sent to the cloud where it is processed\nand mined.\
    \ However, there are several issues that pertain to how these data are\nsent and\
    \ used and raises questions about integrity, protection and the confidentiality\n\

    \ for Smart Cities.\nof this process. In fact, this concern is not unwarranted\
    \ for, in 2015 an attack on\nthe Ukranian power grid which left 225,000 people\
    \ without power [94] opened the\nworlds eyes to the very real threat posed by\
    \ cyber attackers. Data gathered in Smart\nCity applications can be used to perform\
    \ many undesired acts, GPS devices that are\npresent in every phone and most vehicles\
    \ are susceptible to providing information\nabout a persons location, habits as\
    \ well as lead to privacy issues as discussed in [91],\npower consumption and\
    \ ambient sensor data from a building may indicate to occu-\npancy [95] and even\
    \ indicate to the individual identities [96]. This information may\nbe used by\
    \ bad actors to carry out unlawful acts causing risk to life and property.\nTo\
    \ secure the Internet of Things for Smart Cities, typical security schemes might\
    \ not\nbe as effective in many cases and new methods will need to be developed\
    \ to cope\nwith the security and privacy issues in IoT for Smart Cities. In order\
    \ to provide a\nstandardized framework and terminology for discussing security\
    \ attacks, we adapt the\nstandard attack incident taxonomy [97] suggested by the\
    \ Computer Emergency Re-\nsponse Team (CERT) which was established by Defense\
    \ Advanced Research Projects\nAgency (DARPA) for use towards IoT for Smart Cities.\
    \ This is shown in Figure 6.\nThere are different types of security and privacy\
    \ issues in IoT in Smart Cities,\nthey exist on each of the three levels of the\
    \ IoT architecture, application software\nlayers, network layer and the perception\
    \ layer along with some system wide issues, a\ndiscussion is provided for each\
    \ of them. Furthermore, Table 5 provides a summary\nof the security and privacy\
    \ issues in IoT for Smart Cities and the counter measures\nthat one can take to\
    \ mitigate them.\n3.5.1\nApplication Software Layers\nApplication software layers\
    \ are comprised of the Middleware, Application and Busi-\nness Layers. Security\
    \ and privacy in the application software layers tend to issues\nrelating to storage\
    \ of data and its usage. These are data visibility, access and injec-\ntion.\n\
    24\n3.5.1.1\nData Visibility/Identification\nOnce data is gathered, it is sent\
    \ to the\ncloud where it is stored and mined to make inferences. Since the cloud\
    \ would be used\nby multiple entities with different standards of security protocols\
    \ and practices, it is\nextremely important that data stored in the cloud is encrypted\
    \ so as not to allow its\nexposure to unwanted entities. Any data stored in plain\
    \ form would be a risk to not\nonly user privacy but also company rapport.\n3.5.1.2\n\
    Data access/Secondary Use\nAccess control is also a major issue in\nsmart city\
    \ data. Most Smart City applications rely on the usage of data from different\n\
    applications to provide smart services, thus resulting in the gathered data to\
    \ be used\nby many different enterprises. To allow this to take place smoothly\
    \ while preserving\nprivacy, suitable access control schemes will need to be devised\
    \ to allow for responsible\naccess to users of this data. A well-defined hierarchy\
    \ of data users will need to be\ndeveloped and implemented to limit access only\
    \ to intended authorized personnel.\nInformation flow control should also be employed\
    \ that can track data flow as access\nto it is made and to detect any violation\
    \ of access or usage rules. Moreover, data\nmashups that will occur in the cloud\
    \ where multiple entities merge their data to\nwork on some common goal, should\
    \ be carried out with proper oversight.\nData\nanonymization may also be required\
    \ in such a scenario where specific values may be\nconverted in to a range perhaps\
    \ ( e.g., using k-anonymity [90]) and unwanted data be\ndeleted as necessary.\
    \ Blockchain has been suggested to be used for access control as\nwell as access\
    \ tracking of users in IoT applications where each user access to a service\n\
    or an application ends up as a transaction to form the applications IoT trail\
    \ [98].\n3.5.1.3\nData Injection/Data Integrity\nData injection refers to the\
    \ injection\nof false information or modification information about a user in\
    \ the system after\ngaining access. Since data is typically stored in databases,\
    \ SQL injection involves\nan attacker inserting queries to modify data or make\
    \ false data insertions into the\ndatabase. This can have far reaching consequences\
    \ for smart city applications such\nas patient record manipulation as well as\
    \ manipulation or deletion of government\nrecords. SQL injection prevention schemes\
    \ involve the validation of data before using\nit [99] such as positive pattern\
    \ matching. It also involves limiting database access\nbased on the user requirements\
    \ and performing penetration testing.\n3.5.2\nNetwork Layer\nLike other networks,\
    \ the IoT in Smart Cities are also susceptible to network attacks\nsuch as Denial\
    \ of service, Eavesdropping, Man in the middle attack, Side Channel\nand spoofing\
    \ attacks [100]. We discuss these attacks and discuss remedial actions\nthat should\
    \ be taken to prevent them.\n3.5.2.1\nMan in the Middle Attack\nMan in the middle\
    \ (MITM) attack refers\nto the interception of data on the network by faking the\
    \ identity of a network node\nor device. This is carried out by appearing as the\
    \ intended recipient to the sender\n25\nand the original sender to the recipient\
    \ by unauthorized actors. To prevent this,\nthe exchange of data between two entities\
    \ should employ cryptographic protocols\nwhich can ensure secure communication.\
    \ Many public networks do not make use of\nencryption when exchanging data, this\
    \ endangers user data and can give access to\nunwanted persons to user information\
    \ [90]. Policies need to be devised to allow for\nsuitable data communication\
    \ standards for such networks while keeping the user as\nwell as commercial interests\
    \ in mind.\n3.5.2.2\nEavesdropping/Sniffing Attack\nEavesdropping refers to the\
    \ listening\nof data on the network. In eavesdropping an unauthorized entity joins\
    \ the network\nand can listen to the data that is being exchanged between the\
    \ devices on the network.\nTo avoid this, strategies include the use of authenticate\
    \ always protocols which initiate\nauthentication steps whenever devices need\
    \ to communicate with each other. This will\nensure that no unwanted users are\
    \ allowed access to network traffic to prevent such\nattacks. Moreover, industry\
    \ standard security protocols such as the Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS), Wi-Fi\
    \ Protected Access 2 (WPA2) should be used for authenticating\nremote access.\
    \ Furthermore, remote sessions should have time-outs implemented to\nensure that\
    \ mistakes are not made by forgetful employees.\n3.5.2.3\nSide Channel Attack\n\
    Side Channel Attacks refer to the extraction\nof information by observing operation\
    \ characteristics of the implemented computer\nalgorithms or systems such as power\
    \ consumed, time taken, traffic analysis, fault\nanalysis, acoustic analysis [101].\
    \ Side Channel attacks don’t give nonpermitted parties\naccess to the data within\
    \ the network but may allow them to determine important\ninformation about the\
    \ system, such as the protocol used, or allow them to drop\npackets so as to degrade\
    \ performance of the network. One solution to counter network\ntraffic side channels\
    \ attacks is to saturate network bandwidth to prevent patterns\nfrom being observed.\
    \ Another popular method of preventing side channel attacks is\nto make use of\
    \ masking [102].\n3.5.2.4\nDenial of Service Attack\nDenial of Service (DOS) or\
    \ Distributed DOS\n(DDOS) attacks involve an entity getting access to the network\
    \ and using legitimate\nnodes within it to flood the target with unnecessary requests\
    \ to consume network\nbandwidth and degrade quality of service. With a smart city\
    \ depending on sensors\nto provide it with a ‘view’ of the city, DOS attacks can\
    \ make the smart city system\nblind which can lead to loss of property and life.\
    \ Countermeasures for DOS attacks\ninvolve anomaly detection by monitoring of\
    \ network data to check for any irregular\nbehavior. Artificial Intelligence has\
    \ found applications in this area as noted by [103],\nfor, e.g., it has been used\
    \ to identify abnormal data in smart grids [104] as well as\ndetecting attacks\
    \ [105, 106].\n3.5.2.5\nSpoofing Attack\nIn a spoofing attack, an attacker adds\
    \ itself to the\nnetwork by appearing to be a legitimate device on the network,\
    \ thereby allowing\nthem to send irregular or abnormal data to upset normal operation\
    \ of a smart city\n26\nsystem. Due to the varying nature and types of IoT devices\
    \ having different levels of\nbuilt-in security, spoofing is a particularly dangerous\
    \ attack for IoT systems. Methods\nto prevent spoofing are the use of cryptography,\
    \ hybrid encryption [107] as well as the\nuse of blockchain [108] to validate\
    \ data exchange and as well as authenticate devices.\n3.5.3\nPerception Layer\n\
    Perception layers attacks refer to physical attacks on an IoT based smart city\
    \ system.\nThis requires the physical presence of an attacker near the sensing\
    \ elements in an IoT\nsystem. We cover these attacks to provide a holistic assessment\
    \ of the security and\nprivacy issues in IoT Smart Cities. Tempering and Radio\
    \ Interference (jamming)\nare attacks which can affect the performance of smart\
    \ city systems. Tempering may\noccur during the development or the manufacturing\
    \ process while jamming can take\nplace due to a generation of radio frequencies\
    \ which interfere with the frequencies\nused by devices on the network to exchange\
    \ data. To circumvent this, policies may\nbe incorporated into software which\
    \ alert businesses and other Smart City partners\nto missing or abnormal data\
    \ from sensing devices.\n3.5.4\nSystem Wide Issues\n3.5.4.1\nData Leakage\nData\
    \ leakage refers to the unintentional conveyance of\ninformation about subjects\
    \ in smart cities. The many data sources in smart cities\nmay contain information\
    \ related to a user’s identity, health, quality of life etc. Smart\nCity application\
    \ managers use this data to improve their services and provide a bet-\nter user\
    \ experience, however, it is possible that this data might be shared with third\n\
    party entities. It is therefore necessary to anonymize data before such assignments\n\
    are taken. Data leakage can also take place when devices within a network perform\n\
    discovery tasks and may provide personal information to rogue nodes in the network.\n\
    In Smart Grids, power consumption data should be anonymized by considering the\n\
    data on a neighborhood level rather than on the individual level, moreover, systems\n\
    could be installed in homes using batteries to modify the demand response signal.\n\
    Data aggregation is an important tool in preserving individual privacy and preventing\n\
    data leakage. Moreover, data should be encrypted when sending it over the network\n\
    so that any unauthorized access is avoided. Another strategy would be to use data\n\
    minimization. Typically, sensors used in smart cities will gather data of less\
    \ ‘interest’\nin addition to data of interest. For, e.g., navigation systems many\
    \ times record loca-\ntion information even when not in use or video applications\
    \ such as facial recognition\nsystems typically record other activities apart\
    \ from being activated whenever a face is\nobserved in the video. This extra information\
    \ increases the risk of data leakage. Data\nminimization can be employed in such\
    \ cases to limit the data that is being gathered\non the user.\n3.5.4.2\nTrustworthiness\n\
    Apart from the technical steps that need to be taken\nto provide a secure usage\
    \ experience of smart city applications and to encourage its\nuse, it is important\
    \ that smart city users be provided clear policy guidelines to how\n27\nTable\

    \ are the fact that they provide an improved quality of life for\na city’s population\
    \ along with reduction of costs in terms of operation and also enable\ncities\
    \ to be sustainable. IoT enables sensors and devices to be deployed throughout\
    \ a\ncity to give an overview of the state of the city’s main functions such as\
    \ transportation\nsystems, electric, water and gas distribution as well as crime\
    \ monitoring to name\na few. This real time information helps city administration,\
    \ businesses and other\nstakeholders to provide better services to people, increase\
    \ the effectiveness of those\nservices and reduce the cost through efficient operation.\n\
    On the technical side, IoT data has made possible to use data analytics to gauge\n\
    various aspects of the multitude of services which are being provided in the city\
    \ as\nwell as to determine interactions between them and utilize that information\
    \ for better\ndecision making to make life easier for citizens. Furthermore, the\
    \ distributed nature\nof IoT systems and the flexible architectures which enable\
    \ fluidity through movement\nof sensing units is easily scalable thereby requiring\
    \ little additional cost to upgrade\nand expand currently deployed systems. Moreover,\
    \ this distributed architecture also\nmakes such systems very robust to faults\
    \ thereby increasing reliability of deployments\nand offering self-healing in\
    \ applications such as electricity systems.\n29\n4.2\nWeaknesses\nIoT in Smart\
    \ cities do suffer from some weaknesses in terms of technology, for, e.g.,\nthe\
    \ current deployment scenario has a myriad of different technologies relating\
    \ to\nnetworks, hardware platforms and software frameworks which do not often\
    \ work to-\ngether very well as discussed. Different standards’ bodies such as\
    \ the IETF, European\nTelecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), IEEE and\
    \ other organizations have\nbeen contributing with standards for communication,\
    \ network discovery, identifica-\ntion, management of devices etc. However, the\
    \ sheer number of ‘standards’ with\nmany of them not being compatible with each\
    \ other has not fully solved the inter-\noperability problem and this can cause\
    \ hurdles for expansion of IoT systems without\na significant overhaul of system\
    \ components. Another problem currently facing IoT\nsystems is the lack of data\
    \ policies and legislation. The concern here is that data\npolicies are not mature\
    \ enough to regulate how data is handled in IoT systems, as\nhas been discussed\
    \ previously. This is a major problem given the growing issue with\nuser data\
    \ privacy in a connected world.\n4.3\nOpportunities\nIoT in Smart cities presents\
    \ many opportunities to researchers and businesses alike\nin lieu of mitigating\
    \ the weaknesses and also in the provision of new city services.\nThe data gathered\
    \ by the sensors in IoT systems has the potential to provide a\nholistic overview\
    \ of the city’s state allowing for the use of big data algorithms to\ndevelop\
    \ new applications and services. For researchers in the data analytics domain,\n\
    this heterogenous data provides a wonderful opportunity for the development of\
    \ new\ndata science algorithms for service delivery. There is a large monetary\
    \ value towards\nthe development and usage of computationally cheap encryption\
    \ techniques, efficient\ndata storage methods and networking technologies to make\
    \ IoT deployment easier\nand cheaper.\nDevelopment of new sensor technologies\
    \ is another opportunity for\nresearchers in IoT for smart cities.\nThe development\
    \ of newer, efficient, low-cost\nsensors would aid to the creation of IoT services\
    \ and enable even wider usage.\n4.4\nThreats\nWith a connected system, there are\
    \ several threats that come with IoTs for Smart\nCities involving trust issues\
    \ among users, privacy concerns due to network attacks,\npotential data theft\
    \ etc. Privacy and security are the most important concerns of\nIoT applications,\
    \ with such a personalized interaction mechanism between people\nand devices as\
    \ is the case of smart cities, the risks for privacy breaches, data theft\nand\
    \ leakages are high and this is a constant concern for service users as well as\n\
    providers. Numerous attacks on Smart City systems have exposed the vulnerability\n\
    of this technology to cyber attacks and also demonstrated the consequences that\
    \ it\nhas on the population. Traditional security procedures and methods such\
    \ as access\nauthentication, routing and networking might not be enough or possible\
    \ in many IoT\ndeployments due to IoT devices typically not having sufficient\
    \ computing capabilities,\n30\nthis has exacerbated the privacy and security concerns\
    \ for IoT stakeholders. This can\nalso feed to a lack of trust by customers to\
    \ participate in smart city applications.\n5\nConclusions\nThis chapter presented\
    \ a broad coverage of the Internet of Things in Smart Cities.\nProviding a detailed\
    \ discussion of Smart Cities and its different domains, IoT was\npresented as\
    \ a vital enabler of smart city services and the various smart city architec-\n\
    tures and the challenges that are faced in the deployment of smart city applications\n\
    were deliberated upon. This was followed by a review of the sensing and networking\n\
    technologies used for such applications Finally, the security and privacy issues\
    \ faced\nby IoT based Smart Cities were discussed and a SWOT analysis is provided.\n\
    31\nCHAPTER III\nAI IN IOT SMART CITIES\n1\nIntroduction\nThis chapter provides\
    \ insight into different ways in which AI has been applied in\nthe IoT for Smart\
    \ Cities using the application of clustering, regression, classification\netc.\
    \ In addition, various applications, solutions and data used for implementing\
    \ the\noverall framework of Smart Cities are discussed in detail. along with the\
    \ types of\ndeployment used by these proposed approaches.\n2\nBig Data Algorithms/Artificial\
    \ Intelligence\nThe various sensors that make up the internet of things in a smart\
    \ city relay in-\nformation about the city’s state to the cloud. However, measuring\
    \ raw data is not\nenough, to utilize this data and to make the city ‘smart’,\
    \ data analysis is key. Data\nanalysis in smart cities has four layers, the first\
    \ is Data Acquisition, which deals with\nthe collection and storage of data, this\
    \ is followed by the Preprocessing layer which\nperforms operations (such as imputing\
    \ missing values, scaling, removing erroneous\ndata points etc.) on the data to\
    \ ensure that data is of suitable quality to be used for\nthe data analytics stage.\
    \ The data analytics stage involves the application of data\nscience techniques\
    \ on the data to extract patterns and insights which would be used\nfor policy\
    \ making, planning and other actions in the Service layer. In this section, we\n\
    focus our attention on the third stage of the data analysis process, i.e., data\
    \ analytics.\nData analytics in the Smart City based on the IoT involves the use\
    \ of Deep Learning\nand Machine Learning on the gathered data. The discussion\
    \ in this chapter considers\nthe following aspects of the use of AI (ML/DL) in\
    \ the IoT for smart cities:\n1. The type of application: This refers to the aim\
    \ of the application.\n2. Algorithm/Network: This refers to the algorithm being\
    \ used to perform the\ntask and can be any of the ML/DL algorithms covered.\n\
    3. System Architecture: System architecture refers to the IoT architecture pro-\n\
    posed for the covered work. This can be Cloud, Fog or Edge.\n4. Task: This refers\
    \ to the type of machine learning task being performed. This can\nbe classification,\
    \ clustering or regression. In this category, a brief description is\nalso presented\
    \ about what quantities/outcomes are being worked with.\n32\n5. Data Type: This\
    \ refers to the type of data being used. Data can be of two\ntypes, heterogeneous\
    \ or homogeneous. Heterogeneous refers to the use of data\nof different modalities\
    \ whereas homogenous refers to a single modality being\nused. The aim of providing\
    \ this information is to capture the complexity of the\ndata involved in an application.\n\
    2.1\nMachine Learning\nMachine learning (ML) has been a crucial element of smart\
    \ city application develop-\nment [109], helping in prediction (classification),\
    \ estimation (regression) and cluster-\ning tasks. Machine learning refers to\
    \ the set of approaches through which computers\ncan be used to learn from empirical\
    \ data [110] and has been used in smart cities\nin various applications. Since\
    \ there has been a lot of work in this area using ML\nalgorithms, we focus on\
    \ work in the last few years. It was found that most commonly\nused ML algorithms\
    \ have been the Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forests\n(RF), Decision Tree\
    \ (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Means, K-Nearest Neighbor (K-NN)\nand Logistic Regression\
    \ (LR).\n2.2\nDeep Learning\nDeep learning is the use of successive layers of\
    \ Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to\nlearn patterns. The idea is that successive\
    \ non-linear layers of interconnected artificial\nneurons can be used to learn\
    \ patterns in data that simple machine learning algorithms\nmight not be able\
    \ to do. Deep learning architectures can process noisy data to provide\noutput\
    \ for classification and prediction tasks. This makes them very useful in the\n\
    Smart City environment where the IoT enables the collection of heterogeneous sensor\n\
    data which can be of varying nature. Data derived from sensors can be processed\
    \ to\nextract features or can be fed directly to deep learning algorithms which\
    \ can perform\nboth feature extraction as well as classification/prediction. Deep\
    \ Learning methods\nsuch as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)(Long Short-Term Machines\
    \ (LSTM) and\nGated Recurrent Units (GRU)), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN),\
    \ Deep Neural\nNetworks (DNN) and Stacked Autoencoder Networks (SAE) were the\
    \ preferred deep\nlearning methodologies used for smart city applications and\
    \ our discussion revolves\naround the utilization of these methods.\n3\nAI Applications\
    \ for Smart Cities\nIn this section, the applications for of AI in smart cities\
    \ have been discussed, we also\nmention the kind of deployment as well as the\
    \ nature of data utilized to achieve their\ntask.\n3.1\nSmart Agriculture\nThe\
    \ major applications of AI in IoT for agriculture are crop monitoring/disease\
    \ de-\ntection and data driven crop care and decision making. Considering the\
    \ scarcity of\n33\nwater, the authors in [111, 112, 113] develop irrigation systems\
    \ which monitor and\ncontrol the amount of water being used for crops, all structured\
    \ around a cloud com-\nputing system. This problem has been devised both as a\
    \ classification as well as a\nregression problem as in [114], who develop a closed\
    \ loop water irrigation system using\nsupport vector regression and K-Means clustering.\
    \ The authors in [115, 116] propose\ncloud based greenhouse monitoring systems\
    \ using images and a host of physical pa-\nrameters from plants such as temperature,\
    \ humidity and light using several machine\nand deep learning methods. Plant disease\
    \ detection is also an important task within\nsmart agriculture and has been worked\
    \ on by the authors in [117, 118, 119, 120] who\npresent schemes for disease detection\
    \ for various crops including tomatoes and pota-\ntoes. The proliferation of sensing\
    \ systems in agricultural fields has also provided an\navenue for data driven\
    \ decision making and planning for farmers. This involves pre-\ndicting various\
    \ physical parameters which can affect crop growth like solar radiance\n[121]\
    \ and temperature, humidity, windspeed [122, 123, 124, 125, 126] to help in deci-\n\
    sion making in terms of plant care but also classification systems for recommending\n\
    crops to be sown [127, 128]. It is important to note that all of these implementations\n\
    are cloud based.\nThere have been some suggested methodologies for bringing fog\
    \ processing for AI\nin smart agriculture, for, e.g., in [129] a deep learning\
    \ entrusted to fog nodes (DLEFN)\nalgorithm is described to support efficient\
    \ use of resources and reduce cloud resource\nusage. However, as noted in [130],\
    \ who use an edge system for temperature prediction\nusing an LSTM, edge device\
    \ performance still lacks that of similar cloud systems but\nthe inclusion of\
    \ DL capable hardware does provide opportunities for further innova-\ntions. Previous\
    \ work by the same author [131], where they aimed to monitor crops\nfor frost\
    \ signs and trigger anti-frost measures, compared edge and cloud computing\nsystems\
    \ for outlier detection and determined that cloud implementations to provide\n\
    much better performance. However, they do note the potential for edge systems\
    \ to\nprovide highly responsive data analytics in smart agriculture. More applications\
    \ can\nbe envisaged for AI deployment in smart agriculture, for, e.g., monitoring\
    \ of crop\ngrowth, selection of the fertilizer and the timeline for it to be used\
    \ as well as targeted\napplication, pest detection and intelligent pesticide spraying\
    \ so as to reduce harm to\nthe environment, environmental monitoring to track\
    \ the effects of climate change and\nmore. Some of these applications have potential\
    \ to be deployed as edge computing\nsystems. A summary of the use of IoT based\
    \ AI in Smart Agriculture is presented in\nTable 7.\n3.2\nSmart City Services\n\
    A popular component of smart city initiatives is the management of waste and involves\n\
    having bins equipped with sensors and connected to the cloud to not only inform\
    \ the\nrelevant authorities of the need to empty them but also using AI to determine\
    \ the\nbest route to reduce fuel consumption. The use of IoT systems for waste\
    \ management\nhas been observed in the works of [133] who utilize IoT systems\
    \ to help reduce energy\nwastage in waste collection by municipalities. Hussain\
    \ et al. [134] develop a waste\nmanagement system that not only determines if\
    \ bins are full and need collecting\n34\nTable 7. AI use for Smart Agriculture\n\

    \ air quality\naround it using RNNs. The sensing modalities in each of these applications\
    \ is pretty\nsimilar in that they indicate to whether a waste bin is full or not\
    \ which is then\nused for route planning. Considering the requirements of such\
    \ a system, in terms\nof implementation, all of these systems are cloud based.\
    \ Sewer monitoring has been\nperformed in [135] in a cloud based system, they\
    \ use sewer water level and rain gauge\ndata along with a RNN to perform sewer\
    \ overflow monitoring. The RNN is used to\npredict sewer overflow ahead in time.\
    \ Water quality has monitoring has been the focus\nof [136, 137, 138] where the\
    \ authors use multiple sensors measuring pH value, chloride,\nnitrate content\
    \ and hardness of water to determine whether it is fit for drinking or\nnot. In\
    \ [139], Liu et al. use data from water monitoring stations along the Yangtze\n\
    river to predict water quality. Like the classification-based systems, they use\
    \ multiple\nchemical measurements from the water such as oxygen, pH, turbidity\
    \ etc. Apart from\nair quality, smart city monitoring systems are an important\
    \ application within the\nsmart city services domain. This includes urban noise,\
    \ which has been the focus of\nresearchers in [140, 141] as well as other more\
    \ comprehensive monitoring systems as\nproposed in [142, 143]. All these systems\
    \ are cloud based and use a combination\nof sensors for sound and/or image data\
    \ for performing noise monitoring/detection\nand various smart city dashboard\
    \ applications. In Table 8, we summarize the type\nof deployments, applications\
    \ task and data for smart city services applications. It\nis noted that most of\
    \ the applications relating to city services such as air quality\nmonitoring and\
    \ prediction, sewer monitoring, waste collection have been proposed as\ncloud\
    \ systems as data needs to be collected from nodes at various points in a city.\n\
    It is envisaged that due to the nature of the applications, many smart city services\n\
    would still rely on cloud or fog architectures as the decision-making taking place\
    \ in\nsuch situations isn’t possible on only a local level. It is also observed\
    \ that most of the\napplications required data from multiple sensors and therefore\
    \ utilized heterogeneous\ndata to carry out the task at hand.\n3.3\nSmart Energy\n\
    Load/energy consumption forecasting is an essential task for monitoring and control\n\
    of electrical power supply in the electricity grid and ensure appropriate demand\
    \ side\nmanagement. It has been performed by the authors of [148] who use data\
    \ collected\nfrom consumers in a smart grid to determine load for up to 24 h in\
    \ advance. They treat\nthis as primarily a clustering problem where they form\
    \ clusters of similar load profiles\nand then use distance functions to determine\
    \ energy consumption for the future. The\nauthors in [149] also use a cloud based\
    \ clustering approach, using historical power\ndata, they use K-Means clustering\
    \ to determine the closest historical records and then\ncombine them to predict\
    \ energy consumption 24 h in advance. The load forecasting\nproblem has been dealt\
    \ as a regression by [150] using a SVM and by [151] through an\nRNN using electricity\
    \ power data. A regression approach is also followed by [152, 153]\nwho use electricity\
    \ consumption in addition to environmental data for load forecasting\nusing deep\
    \ learning methods (DNN and a combination of Autoencoders and RNNs\n(GRU)). Edge\
    \ based systems have been suggested by the authors of [154, 155, 156]\n36\nTable\

    \ use federated learning to train a\nRNN. In addition to load forecasting, smart\
    \ grid management/monitoring is also a\nnecessary application in this domain.\
    \ The authors in [157] use decision trees in a cloud\nbased system to classify\
    \ between different faults in a smart grid. In [158], the authors\nuse power consumption\
    \ data from consumers in China to determine electricity theft\nin a cloud based\
    \ system. They use wide and deep convolutional neural networks to\ncapture the\
    \ periodic and nonperiodic components from electricity consumption data\nand show\
    \ their network to be suitable for electricity theft detection. The authors in\n\
    [159] present a framework for edge computing based monitoring of the smart grid.\n\
    Edge computing in the smart grid has several advantages as it reduces delay and\
    \ also\nit is secure in terms of data privacy. A summary of the use of IoT based\

    \ two major applications of IoT with AI in health, these are activity recog-\n\
    nition/fall detection and disease diagnosis/health monitoring, a summary of the\
    \ IoT\nbased AI systems used in Smart Health is presented in Table 10. Activity\
    \ recog-\nnition involves the use of movement sensors such as accelerometers,\
    \ gyroscopes and\nmagnetometers with the aim to help provide the user with feedback\
    \ on their health.\nThis can be in terms of them having enough physical exercise\
    \ or not, used for sports\ntherapy, fall detection and for monitoring of different\
    \ diseases such as Parkinson’s or\nother motor degenerative ailments. The most\
    \ popular sensor for activity recognition\nare inertial sensors which have been\
    \ used by [160, 161] in a cloud based setting using\nvarious deep and machine\
    \ learning algorithms. In [162], Castro et al. include vital\nsign data in addition\
    \ to movement information for human activity recognition in a\ncloud environment,\
    \ they utilize the DT as their classifier. In [163],, the authors pro-\npose an\
    \ edge-based system to perform activity recognition for people by recording\n\
    their movements using the accelerometer and gyroscope present on the phone. They\n\
    use a SVM as their classifier and differentiate between six different activities\
    \ of daily\nliving. Fall detection has been performed by [164, 165] in a fog and\
    \ edge environment,\nrespectively, using an accelerometer, Santos et al. [164]\
    \ use a CNN while Yacchirema\net al. [165] useRFCwith both approaches showing\
    \ promising results.\nEquipped with the power of AI in IoT, Smart Health systems\
    \ facilitate the provi-\nsion of telehealth services as well as real time monitoring\
    \ of patients, giving doctors\nand patients feedback on their health.\nHealth\
    \ monitoring systems and real time\ndisease diagnosis have been one of the most\
    \ important applications of IoT technol-\nogy. The authors in [166, 167, 168,\
    \ 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176] develop\ncloud based health monitoring\
    \ systems for detecting various types of diseases, such\n38\nas heart (stroke\
    \ [167], irregular sound [169], irregular rhythm [171, 173]), epilep-\ntic seizures\
    \ [172], Parkinson seizure [176] and multiple disease diagnosis systems\n[174,\
    \ 175]. In [174, 175], the authors formulate the problem of disease diagnosis\
    \ as\na classification problem and utilize medical data such as ECGs, EEG, heart\
    \ rate,\nblood pressure, blood sugar, heart sound, blood glucose, liver health\
    \ along with var-\nious machine and deep learning methods to achieve this task.\
    \ Fog and edge based\nhealth monitoring/disease diagnosis systems have also been\
    \ suggested by a number\nof researchers. The authors in [177] present a fog based\
    \ system using a deep neural\nnetwork to detect heart disease from a patients\
    \ vital signs (blood oxygen, heart rate,\nrespiration rate, EEG, ECG, EMG, blood\
    \ pressure, glucose) and activity data. In\n[178], Devarajan & Ravi work on a\
    \ fog computing based Parkinson detection system\nusing a persons speech. Moreover,\
    \ an edge computing system is presented in [179]\nwhich utilizes EEG signals to\
    \ determine seizures in patients.\nTable 10. AI use for Smart Health\nApplication\n\

    \ Smart Homes.\nThis is especially\nneeded for the elderly and is typically achieved\
    \ by the use of ambient sensors, Wi-Fi\nand radio frequency systems in smart homes.\
    \ In this work, we include all monitoring\nmethods that depend on sensors placed\
    \ in the home/within the smart home domain.\nIn [182], Pirzada et al. use a network\
    \ of reed switches connected to the cloud to\nmonitor the activities of elderly\
    \ people as a clustering problem. They use the K-\nNN algorithm to determine anomalies\
    \ in the daily activities which can then be used\nto send medical or other help\
    \ requests to assist people. A similar setup for activity\nrecognition for ambient\
    \ assisted living has been presented in [183, 184, 185] where they\nuse data from\
    \ a number of different sensors including motion, presence, water float,\ntemperature\
    \ etc to determine various activities being performed in a home. In [186],\na\
    \ cloud based assisted living system for the deaf has been developed that performs\n\
    haptic conversions for sounds detected in a home. An array of sensors are used\
    \ to\nmonitor environmental sound and the authors use RNNs for detecting the sound\n\
    event before its passed on to the haptic vibration producer. Another task within\n\
    in monitoring is localization of people, this part of smart homes is also applicable\n\
    to smart infrastructure in that such systems are used in smart buildings as well.\n\
    Applications of localization include security, i.e., detecting unauthorized presence\n\
    and people monitoring in general (for, e.g., locating elderly people in homes)\
    \ etc.\nThe authors in [187] perform localization using a grid of Wi-Fi units\
    \ that measure\nsignal strength to determine peoples locations indoors for buildings.\
    \ They formulate\nthis both as a classification problem as well as a regression\
    \ problem. The classification\nproblem being formulated as coded locations (for,\
    \ e.g., a given room no) while the\nregression case estimating the location of\
    \ the user in a coordinate grid. Their system is\ncloud based and they use a deep\
    \ neural network to perform this task and have found\nsuitably good results. Occupancy\
    \ detection has been performed by the authors of\n[188] making use of various\
    \ ambient measurements (temperature, humidity, pressure\netc.) and passing them\
    \ to a cloud before using a deep neural network to classify\nbetween the various\
    \ number of people present in an indoor environment. In [189],\nZimmermann et\
    \ al. also make use of ambient sensors for the occupancy problem and\nuse a na¨ıve\
    \ bayes learner to determine both the presence of occupants as well as their\n\
    number.\nHome automation is another application that the IoT finds application\n\
    within the Smart Home domain. The integration of AI has helped develop smart\n\
    home automation systems that aim to reduce energy consumption in homes as well\n\
    as maintain user privacy, security. Chowdhry et al. [190] use a combination of\
    \ visual\ndata and motion sensing to perform home automation for security using\
    \ a SVM.\nAn interesting use of AI in home automation is presented in [191] who\
    \ develop a\ncloud based home automation system, they take measurements from various\
    \ ambient\nsensors and control appliances and use a Na¨ıve Bayes classifier to\
    \ determine which\ntechnician to call whenever sensor measurements appear aberrated.\
    \ The problem of\nintelligent consumption of energy has been considered by [192]\
    \ who develop an energy\ndisaggregation system on the appliance level in smart\
    \ homes using stacked denoising\nautoencoders. They achieve this using power data\
    \ for individual appliances as well\n40\nas the total power consumed in the home\
    \ and send it to a local cloud. Data is then\ndisaggregated for various appliances\
    \ to provide feedback to the user.\nMore work\nproviding energy intelligence to\
    \ consumers has been performed by [193, 194, 195].\nKonstantakopoulos et al. [195]\
    \ pose this as a regression problem, they propose a\ncloud-based system utilizing\
    \ both ambient sensor data (lighting, temperature etc)\nand appliance power data\
    \ to forecast resource usage for consumers using a RNN.\nThey show a reduction\
    \ in energy consumption for their users using this information.\nEventhough applications\
    \ covered in smart homes have been cloud based systems,\nthere have been recent\
    \ proposals for frameworks that combine edge and cloud pro-\ncessing as in [196]\
    \ who discuss a hierarchical control system for smart homes through\na edge microgrid\
    \ and a cloud power grid. Due to the nature of smart homes in that\nthe sensing\
    \ scheme is present within a finite space (within the home), edge and fog\ncomputing\
    \ based systems are expected to be increasingly incorporated smart home\napplications.\
    \ A summary of the use of IoT based AI in Smart Homes is presented in\nTable 11.\n\
    3.6\nSmart Industry\nOne of the major applications of AI in the IoT powered smart\
    \ industry is towards\nfault detection in products and anomaly detection in industrial\
    \ processes. This has\nseen the use of both Machine Learning (SVM [197, 198],RFC[199,\
    \ 200]) as well as\nDeep Learning (DNN [201, 202, 203], CNN [204]) methods using\
    \ a cloud computing\nstructure to perform anomaly detection/product inspection\
    \ and monitoring using a\nvariety of heterogeneous and homogenous data sources\
    \ such as inertial sensors for ma-\nchines, images for products and processes\
    \ and other process specific variables. Other\napproaches suggested in [205, 206]\
    \ propose a fog computing method along with edge\ncomputing systems suggested\
    \ in [207, 208]. An edge computing system for anomaly\ndetection is presented\
    \ in [209] where edge devices collaboratively train a deep anomaly\ndetection\
    \ model. Production management is another application that has found usage\nof\
    \ AI in IoT based smart Industry. For, e.g., the authors in [210, 211, 212, 213,\
    \ 214]\nuse cloud based data driven systems along with machine and deep learning\
    \ algorithms\nto help with task dispatching, performance analysis as well as worker\
    \ activity recog-\nnition utilizing a variety of sensing modalities. The work\
    \ of [213, 214] are especially\ninteresting as they aim is to not only perform\
    \ production management but also pro-\npose data for various health related analysis\
    \ to create a safer working environment\non the factory floor. A fog system for\
    \ production management has been presented in\n[215] who use activity data to\
    \ determine resource allocation locations to contribute\nto management of a production\
    \ operation. Furthermore, product inspection, which\nis a common application of\
    \ instrumentation systems in a factory, has been performed\nby [216, 217] who\
    \ utilize images and sensor data in a cloud based system to monitor\nproduct quality.\n\
    A factory has a multitude of machines and equipment working round the clock\n\
    manufacturing goods. Maintenance is an important aspect of this operation where\n\
    regular checks are performed on the equipment to ensure that no breakdown occurs\n\
    during the production process, which might result in monetary loss or loss of\
    \ life.\n41\nTable 11. AI use for Smart Homes\nApplication\nNetwork\nSystem\n\

    \ with the data gathered by various sensors on these machines, it is often\nmore\
    \ beneficial to take an active approach rather than a passive one by using this\n\
    data for predictive maintenance purposes. Predictive maintenance utilizes data\
    \ from\nthe daily operation of machines in an industry to optimize the manufacturing\
    \ op-\neration [218] and is one of the main uses for AI in the industry. In [219,\
    \ 220], the\nauthors suggest a predictive maintenance scheme using SVMs utilizing\
    \ data from ac-\ncelerometers measuring vibration in a crane motor and data from\
    \ various sources in\na semiconductor manufacturing process, respectively, both\
    \ work in a cloud environ-\nment as evidenced from the architecture. Prediction\
    \ of failure can also be a regression\noperation, as was demonstrated by [221]\
    \ who use RNNs to predict future values of\na physical parameters of a pump using\
    \ a number of heterogeneous sensors used to\nmonitor it. As with the other two\
    \ systems, this system also had a cloud architecture.\nThe authors in [170] also\
    \ present a regression based health prognosis system for the\nindustry using a\
    \ CNN on machine data (Images, stress, temperature, vibration, po-\n42\nsition\
    \ and electromagnetic signal measurements). The use of IoT based AI in Smart\n\
    Industry has been presented in Table 12.\n3.7\nSmart Infrastructure\nAn application\
    \ within smart infrastructures also involves monitoring of civil structures\n\
    for structural health. The authors in [222] take a clustering approach to perform\n\
    health monitoring of a bridge using vibration data in a cloud setting.\nThey use\n\
    clustering to determine clusters of abnormal behavior in accelerometer measurements\n\
    from a bridge. In [223, 224, 225], accelerometer signals have been used where\
    \ as [226]\nhave used piezo electric transducers for performing structural health\
    \ monitoring of\nbridges formulated as a classification problem between different\
    \ damaged states of\na bridge. The prime sensing modality for monitoring has been\
    \ measuring vibration\nusing accelerometers, however, other sensors such as fiber\
    \ optic gratings can also be\nused to measure stress.\nThe second avenue for AI\
    \ applications in IoT for smart infrastructure is the use\nof IoT devices for\
    \ building environment control and energy management as well com-\nfort aware\
    \ control. This involves the prediction of building energy usage based on\nenvironmental\
    \ data (such as temperature, humidity) and electrical power data. The\nauthors\
    \ in [227] and [228] use electric power data and heat flow information in a\n\
    building to predict the energy requirements in the future so as to better manage\
    \ en-\nergy consumption. Ambience control of a museum has been performed in [229]\
    \ where\nthe authors use deep learning algorithms to predict the CO2 and humidity\
    \ levels\nfor the care of exhibits. Comfort aware energy management has been performed\
    \ in\n[230] where the authors use a CNN to regulate thermal comfort in a building\
    \ using\nvarious physical quantities. It can be noted that all of these mentioned\
    \ systems have\nbeen deployed in the cloud, this is due to the nature of the application.\
    \ However,\nthere have been efforts for developing fog/edge systems for smart\
    \ infrastructure. The\nauthors in [231] describe a framework for deploying edge\
    \ and fog computing services\nin smart buildings and demonstrate their systems\
    \ effectiveness for the case of energy\nmanagement. Table 13 summarizes the use\
    \ of IoT based AI in Smart Infrastructure.\n3.8\nSmart Transport\nMajor smart\
    \ transportation applications involve smart parking and transportation\nmanagement.\
    \ Smart parking aims to solve the problem of helping users finding park-\ning\
    \ spots in order to save time as well as reduce gas emissions and is therefore\
    \ a much-\nresearched topic for AI deployment towards smart transportation. Solutions\
    \ to this\nproblem have been formulated both as a regression problem as well as\
    \ a classification\none, both utilizing imaging and/or other occupancy sensing\
    \ modalities. Regression\nsolutions [232, 233, 234] are typically used to predict\
    \ a parking lots occupancy levels\nin the future whereas classification systems\
    \ [235, 236, 237] involve guiding drivers ac-\ncording to the shortest distance\
    \ as well as used for user localization purposes within\nsuch lots. In addition\
    \ to cloud based approaches, edge computing systems for smart\nparking have also\
    \ been devised as suggested in [238, 239] who deploy CNNs on edge\n43\nTable 12.\

    \ determining traffic flow as well as\nprediction of traffic flow for traffic\
    \ light control and other management tasks such as\naccident detection. In this\
    \ regard, video cameras are popular for detection of vehicle\ndensity on roads\
    \ for traffic congestion determination. However, with most cars having\na GPS\
    \ device and the commonality of cellphones with every driver, many approaches\n\
    use the data from the GPS along with weather and generic traffic flow information\n\
    to determine traffic prediction. The nature of traffic flow prediction using sensing\n\
    modalities such as GPS require systems to be operated as cloud-based systems as\n\
    is the case in [240, 241, 242, 243]. Of these, Wangyang et al. [242] and Xiao\
    \ et al.\n[243] use deep learning based sequential modeling approaches to predict\
    \ traffic flow\nahead of time where as Aung & Naing [240] and Yunxiang Liu & Wu\
    \ [241] solve this\nthrough a classification formulation. A traffic management\
    \ system for public buses\nhas been proposed in [33, 244] where GPS data is used\
    \ to predict bus arrival times\nfor public transportation systems. Accident detection\
    \ has been performed using car\nposition and velocity information in a Vehicular\
    \ Adhoc NETworks (VANET) envi-\nronment by the authors of [245]. They do this\
    \ through a cloud based system that\ncan use this information to predict whether\
    \ an accident has occurred or not. Apart\nfrom typical sensing modalities, with\
    \ smart phones and user participation in social\nmedia, smart transportation systems\
    \ are expected to increasingly include more sens-\ning modalities [246] fused\
    \ together for use in decision making for traffic management\npurposes. Mukherji\
    \ et al. [247] use Wi-Fi signals to determine commuter traffic a\nsubway station.\
    \ They do this by using the measured signal strength of the Wi-Fi\nsignals along\
    \ with a Random Forest classifier in a cloud-based setting. Their system\nis able\
    \ to determine if a person is on the train or on the platform which can be used\n\
    to help with planning train times and routes. A summary of IoT based AI for Smart\n\

    This chapter presents a coverage of combinatorial optimization in IoT based smart\n\
    cities by deliberating on the most popular applications of optimization algorithms\n\
    and providing an insight to how those problems are formulated and worked upon.\
    \ It\nprovides a mapped overview of the optimization landscape in the smart city\
    \ domain\nwhile considering the IoT. Through this mapping, the common optimization\
    \ problems\nacross the various components of the IoT enabled smart city have been\
    \ identified. For\neach problem discussed, the objective function used, the nature\
    \ of the objective as\nwell as the constraints considered have also been elaborated\
    \ on.\n2\nOptimization and Heuristics in IoT Smart Cities\nAs has been observed\
    \ by [249], combinatorial optimization problems in the real-world\nare known to\
    \ be difficult to formulate and generally are hard to solve. Moreover,\nchoosing\
    \ the right algorithm is also a tedious task as each comes with a different\n\
    set of characterizations. This is very applicable to the IoT bases smart city\
    \ where\napplications in each component caters to a different environment and\
    \ aspect of the\ncity’s operation and therefore requires intricate design of the\
    \ problem. This chapter\ntakes guidance from the work of [249]. They note that\
    \ the most popular algorithms for\nuse in combinatorial optimization problems\
    \ are the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO),\nGenetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm\
    \ Optimization (PSO), Differential Evolution\n(DE) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC).\
    \ Moreover, following from their discussion, six\nfactors are considered for each\
    \ application identified. These are:\n1. The type of application: This refers\
    \ to the problem being optimized within the\nsmart city domain.\n2. Data Setup:\
    \ For each application, we mention the data setup used. While doing\nso, we aim\
    \ to capture the various ways in which researchers have sourced data\nfor their\
    \ proposed method.\n3. Single-Parallel problems: Another thing to note in smart\
    \ city optimization\nproblems is whether a problem has been considered as a single\
    \ problem or\nmultiple sub-problems/parallel.\n4. Objective direction, function\
    \ and number of objectives: Maximization or mini-\nmization, lowest fitness function\
    \ value desirable or higher fitness function value\n49\nis desirable.\nSince we\
    \ list the objectives, we also covere the number of ob-\njectives inherently.\
    \ Single objective, where a single fitness is optimized for its\nbest value or\
    \ multi-objective where multiple objective functions need to be con-\nsidered\
    \ at the same time. The latter is a complex process as some objectives\nmay have\
    \ conflicts and thus requires the need to perform trade-offs with what’s\nacceptable.\n\
    5. Constraints: Constraints are a set of restrictions or prerequisites that may\n\
    sometimes be necessary to determine if a solution is considered valid or not.\n\
    Soft constraints are desirable but not necessary whereas hard constraints are\n\
    mandatory to be met. Constraints are put on the fitness function according to\n\
    application being considered. Covering this aspect is particularly important as\n\
    constraints are determined by the application being worked on.\n3\nMeheuristic\
    \ Algorithms\nMetaheuristic algorithms are widely used to solve combinatorial\
    \ optimziation prob-\nlems in the real-world [249]. The aim of these algorithms\
    \ is to determine the minima\nor maxima of an objective function which translates\
    \ an optimization objective in to\none or more mathematical equations. Five algorithms\
    \ have been considered in this\nchapter, these are the Ant Colony Algorithm, Genetic\
    \ Algorithm, Particle Swarm Op-\ntimization Algorithm, Differential Evolution\
    \ and Artificial Bee Colony. As mentioned\nearlier, these have been chosen as\
    \ these were the most commonly used optimzation\nalgorithms identified by [249].\
    \ In this section, we provide a brief intuitive description\nfor each of them.\n\
    3.1\nAnt Colony Optimization\nAnt colony optimization is derived from the behavior\
    \ of ants searching for food\n[250]. It was observed that during this process,\
    \ each ant deposits a chemical called\npheromone on the path which it takes towards\
    \ the food. The more the ants take a\ngiven path, the more the pheromone is deposited\
    \ on it. Subsequent ants that want\nto go towards the food use the amount of pheromone\
    \ on a given path or sub-path\nto decide which path to take so as to determine\
    \ the optimal route to the food. In\nthe artificial ant colony optimization algorithm,\
    \ the points on the path that form the\nsub-paths are encoded on a graph where\
    \ each ant can only visit a given vertex (travel\non the same sub-path) once.\
    \ Each iteration starts with a number of artificial ants,\nan ant would choose\
    \ the next vertex to visit based on the level of pheromone on the\npossible sub-paths\
    \ available to it as well as whether that path has been used before.\nAt the end\
    \ of each iteration, the pheromone levels are updated so as to prioritize the\n\
    use of the most used path for ants in the next iteration.\n3.2\nGenetic Algorithm\n\
    A genetic algorithm [251] is based on evolutionary science. The idea behind the\
    \ ge-\nnetic algorithm is that starting from a given population set of organisms,\
    \ subsequent\n50\nreproduction will result in fitter organisms being produced\
    \ given that the organisms\nchosen for reproduction have some level of fitness.\
    \ To solve an optimization prob-\nlem, a genetic algorithm begins with a given\
    \ population size of strings also called\na chromosome. Each ‘chromosome’ consists\
    \ of a ‘gene’ which may represent points\nin the population. The sequence in which\
    \ the genes are present would represent a\nsolution to the problem. For e.g. for\
    \ a route scheduling problem, this may be the\ncoordinates of the stops. The ‘goodness’\
    \ of a chromosome is determined by a fitness\nfunction that quantifies how appropriate\
    \ a given chromosome is as a solution for the\nproblem. Choosing the right fitness\
    \ function is an important consideration in genetic\nalgorithms as it needs to\
    \ gauge the kind of optimization that is to be performed.\nThe optimization process\
    \ starts with an initial population of a given size. Once a fit-\nness function\
    \ has been defined, in each iteration, two or more chromosomes (parents)\nare\
    \ taken at random from the population and one or more offsprings are generated.\n\
    The random selection takes the selected parents fitness function value in to account,\n\
    however, its necessary that not all parents chosen are the fittest of the population\
    \ as\notherwise, diversity will be compromised, and the algorithm may get stuck\
    \ in a local\nminimum. The method by which these offspring are generated is called\
    \ the Crossover\nfunction and the number of parents mated to form offsprings from\
    \ them depends\non the crossover rate. The Crossover function defines the way\
    \ the genes within the\nchromosomes are exchanged. Usually, the crossover rate\
    \ has a high value. Moreover,\ndepending on some mutation rate, a given fraction\
    \ of all offsprings are mutated. Mu-\ntation depends on the mutation function\
    \ used and involves members of the offspring\nbeing swapped in some manner. When\
    \ one iteration of the offspring creation from\nthe parents in the entire population\
    \ is completed, the offsprings replace members of\nthe original population (typically\
    \ the weakest) and one generation of the GA is said\nto be completed. In order\
    \ to converge to a sufficiently good result, GA’s need to run\nfor many generations.\n\
    3.3\nParticle Swarm Optimization\nParticle Swarm Optimization is modeled on the\
    \ social behavior of animals rather than\nthe evolutionary biological behavior\
    \ on which Genetic Algorithms are based. PSO\n[252] is particularly based on the\
    \ behavior of a flock of birds searching for food. Each\nbird in the flock searches\
    \ for food and can communicate with other birds in the flock\nas soon as it finds\
    \ food or a good direction for it. Therefore, each bird has two food\n‘directions’\
    \ that it needs to consider, first is on an individual level which is called\n\
    the personal best and the second is on the flock level which is the global best.\
    \ Using\nthese two values the bird will proceed towards that path and will inform\
    \ other birds\nin the flock too. The idea here is that after enough time and with\
    \ all the individuals\nworking together, the swarm will find the place with the\
    \ highest concentration of\nfood. In terms of using PSO for optimization tasks,\
    \ individual birds are equivalent\nto a solution as in a GA and each is considered\
    \ as a point or a particle, collectively\nthey make up the swarm. This swarm population\
    \ may be initialized randomly or\nbased on some domain knowledge about the problem.\
    \ The highest concentration of\nfood represents the optimal solution for the whole\
    \ swarm where as a good direction\n51\nrepresents the local optimal solution for\
    \ each case. The aim here, like birds in a flock\nis to determine the global optimal\
    \ solution using information from each individual\nparticle. Each particle has\
    \ three aspects to it, its position, its velocity and a value of\nits current\
    \ position’s ’goodness’. This ’goodness’ as in the GA is defined by a fitness\n\
    function. Like birds, each particle has a personal best fitness value and is also\
    \ aware\nof the global best fitness value. For any particle, the new direction\
    \ of movement is\ndecided by a combination of the personal best and the global\
    \ best as well as the\nparticle’s intention to maintain its current movement.\
    \ Furthermore, several different\ntopologies can be utilized, and a neighborhood\
    \ can also be set for each particle to\nconvey positions when limiting the global\
    \ best parameter to the local best scheme\nrather than the whole swarm. The algorithm\
    \ may be stopped till the best solution is\nreached or no more improvement is\
    \ observed.\n3.4\nDifferential Evolution\nDifferential evolution [253] is a stochastic\
    \ evolutionary algorithm which is used for\noptimization problems for continuous\
    \ functions. The DE algorithm does not expect\ngradient information and thus it\
    \ doesn’t need to be differentiable. Like other evolu-\ntionary algorithms, a\
    \ solution is searched for in the design space by maintaining a\nset of individual\
    \ candidate solutions. In each iteration, the solutions with the best\nfitness\
    \ are combined together and retained for the next iteration. The aim is to im-\n\
    prove upon the fitness value and this process is repeated until a pre-decided\
    \ condition\nfor termination of this process is satisfied. Differential Evolution\
    \ is very similar to\nGenetic Algorithms in that both are evolutionary in nature,\
    \ however, the difference\nis that the DE uses real numbers in the chromosome\
    \ and also that the mutation oper-\nation consists of the difference between two\
    \ or more chromosomes of the population\nwith the possible addition of some type\
    \ of noise to create a new individual. Like\nGA, DE also suffer from getting stuck\
    \ in local minima. The DE algorithm also has\nthree control parameters, the population\
    \ size, the mutation factor and the crossover\nprobability.\n3.5\nArtificial Bee\
    \ Colony\nArticle Bee Colony [254] is a swarm intelligence algorithm based on\
    \ the behavior of\nbees. Within bees, there are different social classes who work\
    \ together to complete\ntasks such as harvesting pollen and nesting through the\
    \ use of smell, ’swing dance’\nand other methods. Bee colonies consist of three\
    \ types of bees, queen, male and\nthe worker bees which work on activities such\
    \ as searching for food, gathering and\nstorage of honey.\nAfter gathering honey,\
    \ the worker bee comes to the nest and\ninforms other bees about the location\
    \ of the honey source site through a dance. The\nABC algorithm simulates the behavior\
    \ of bees by considering three elements, the\nfood source, employed bees and unemployed\
    \ bees. The food source is represented as\nrevenue considering its distance and\
    \ quality, the higher the revenue, the better is the\nvalue. In computational\
    \ optimization terms, the food source is a potential solution\nto the objective\
    \ formulation of the considered problem and the quality or value of\n52\nthe food\
    \ source represents the fitness value of that particular solution. At the start,\n\
    all bees are used as scouts, searching for food sources. When a food source is\
    \ found,\nfor a high value food source, bees who find those food sources become\
    \ hire bees and\ncollect the food source. If the food source is of intermediate\
    \ value, the bees become\nfollow bees and if the food source value becomes low,\
    \ the bees become scout bees to\nlook for better food sources. Hire bees, the\
    \ bees with a food source location having\na high value, lead the follow bees\
    \ to develop solutions in their neighborhood in order\nto come up with more solutions.\
    \ A subset of the highest-ranking solutions are then\nconsidered before this process\
    \ is repeated again until the end conditions are met.\n4\nOptimization Applications\
    \ in Smart Cities\nSeveral tasks in smart city operations require the use of metheuristics\
    \ to be solved,\nthe aim being to optimize the resources present in the city.\
    \ This section presents\nthe different uses of optimization techniques for IoT\
    \ enabled Smart Cities.\nThis\ntask is performed for all eight components, Smart\
    \ Agriculture, Smart City Services,\nSmart Grid, Smart Health, Smart Homes, Smart\
    \ Homes, Smart Industry, Smart\nInfrastructure and Smart Transportation.\n4.1\n\
    Smart Agriculture\nSmart Agriculture involves the use of digital technologies\
    \ such as sensors and in-\ntelligent systems to improve agricultural productivity.\
    \ The sustenance of agriculture\ndepends on water, and it is central to the agricultural\
    \ production of food items around\nthe world. However, water is becoming an ever-scarce\
    \ resource due to the increasing\ndemand caused by human population growth, increased\
    \ economic activity by indus-\ntries and also due to climate change. It therefore\
    \ is necessary to utilize this precious\nresource wisely so as make use of it\
    \ in the best manner possible.\nOne approach\ntowards ensuring that water and\
    \ land is used appropriately is by introducing irriga-\ntion management schemes\
    \ such as irrigation scheduling and water allocation in the\nfarming process.\
    \ A summary of the optimization problems, objectives, constraints in\nsmart agriculture\
    \ and the use of IoT is illustrated in Figure 8.\nMeasurements in water irrigation\
    \ systems are typically performed by sensors\nplaced at different points in the\
    \ canals and rivers to determine water flow, volume and\nspeed. This information\
    \ regarding water movement can be combined with economic\ninformation such as\
    \ yeild, crop profit to optimize water distribution. Irrigation man-\nagement\
    \ through scheduling has been performed by the authors of [255, 256, 257, 258]\n\
    to maximize net return on crop profits, water use efficiency and to minimize leakage\n\
    losses. In [259] Fuqiang et al. aim to optimize water delivery through canals\
    \ while\nalso performing scheduling. They do this using a genetic algorithm and\
    \ work with\ntwo objectives, minimizing the difference between the time of water\
    \ delivery and wa-\nter demand and the fluctuation in water discharge of the main\
    \ canal. Their model\nwas applied to a district in China.\nThe authors in [260,\
    \ 261] work on optimal allocation of water. Of these, Ikudayisi\net al. [260]\
    \ use the differential evolution algorithm to minimize the water allocated to\n\

    \ terms of job creation, ensuring\nfood security and the yield of crops.\nWu et\
    \ al.\n[261] approach this as problem\nof reducing deviation between different\
    \ channels and minimizing water seepage to\nensure a more consistent supply to\
    \ all water channels. An approach presented by\nOcampo et al. [262] tackles this\
    \ problem not as a task of allocation directly but\nconsiders the scenario of\
    \ providing sufficient water to a smart farm while controlling\ntwo water pumps.\
    \ The objective function is formulated to minimize the energy cost\nof the water\
    \ pumps while maintaining sufficient supply of water to the plants on the\nfarms.\
    \ Constraints considered for such applications include the limited quantities\
    \ of\nwater being worked with, the time for which the water was available and\
    \ the area\nof land which was to be considered. Another allocation based scheme\
    \ is presented\nby Zhuo et al. [263] who use a genetic algorithm for an irrigation\
    \ system based on\na reservoir and two pumping stations. Their aim is to ensure\
    \ that there is no water\n54\nshortage. The objective function used by them is\
    \ the minimization of the annual sum\nof squared water shortage. Other work in\
    \ [264] also minimizes use of groundwater\nand increase benefit to the regional\
    \ water supply through reduction of water deficits\nin the Dujiangyan region of\
    \ China.\nA precision agriculture scheme is presented by Roy et al.\n[265] who\
    \ combine\nan IoT system consisting of sensors on plants using a GA based rainfall\
    \ predictor.\nCombining predicted rainfall information along with the sensed moisture\
    \ level in\nthe crops, they control plant watering. Lin et al. [266] propose a\
    \ framework for the\nmanagement of fertigation and irrigation in precision agriculture.\
    \ They perform short\nterm management and long-term management. Soil and crop\
    \ growth data is gathered\nfrom IoT based sensor systems. Long term planning refers\
    \ to the allocation of water\nand fertilizer resources to crops in terms of quantity\
    \ so as to meet demands whereas\nshort term refers to when and how to use them.\
    \ They use a genetic algorithm for long\nterm planning considering the allocation\
    \ of water and fertilizer for crops to maintain\npH value and electrical conductivity.\
    \ This information has been presented in Table\n16 while a summary of the identified\
    \ data sources used by each considered work has\nbeen provided in Table 17.\n\
    4.2\nSmart City Services\nAccording to the world bank, the amount of annual solid\
    \ waste generated is set to be\n3.40 billion tons [268] in 2050. Managing this\
    \ waste and its collection in an efficient\nmanner is imperative for health and\
    \ climate reaons. The most common application\ntowards smart city services optimization\
    \ is waste management as illustrated in Figure\n9 which summarizes the objectives,\
    \ constraints and the use of IoT.\nSmart waste collection systems include sensors\
    \ attached to trash cans which can\ninform the municipal authority about the status\
    \ of the garbage amount present in\nthem.\nOnce the trash cans are close to being\
    \ full, it is the responsibility of the\nmunicipal corporation to perform garbage\
    \ collection in an efficient manner. In this\nrespect, data provided by the sensors\
    \ on garbage cans can be used to determine\nan optimized route for garbage collection\
    \ to construct the Vehicle Routing Problem\n(VRP) in the Smart City Services domain.\
    \ As such, this problem has been performed\nkeeping in view various goals. The\
    \ minimization of the route distance taken by a\ngarbage tuck has been performed\
    \ by the authors in [269, 270, 271, 272, 273]. The\naim in this case is to determine\
    \ a route for garbage collection vehicles that minimizes\nthe total distance traveled\
    \ by the them. Zhang et al. [273] consider multi-vehicle\nallocation while considering\
    \ the single objective of minimizing route distance. Wei\net al. [274] use the\
    \ Artificial Bee Colony algorithm to determine garbage collection\nroutes resulting\
    \ in the minimum emission of CO2. Another optimization objective\nin route optimization\
    \ for waste management has been the minimization of the total\ntravel time, such\
    \ a target is described by the authors of [275, 276, 277, 278] who aim\nto reduce\
    \ travel time while considering emptying of waste bins. Another optimization\n\
    consideration in route optimization for waste management is to reduce cost. This\
    \ has\nbeen carried out by Tirkolaee et al. [279] who formulate a multi-objective\
    \ function of\ntravel cost and total useage cost of vehicles and determine the\
    \ route with the minimum\n55\nTable 16. Optimization in Smart Agriculture\nApplication\n\

    the applications, objectives, constraints and IoT usage for optimization algorithms\
    \ in\nSmart Grids has been illustrated in Figure 10.\nAn increasing population\
    \ has led to an increasing demand for electricity around\nthe world. This burdening\
    \ of the electricity grid has led to measures for increasing\nthe performance\
    \ of the electricity distribution system by reducing loss, prevent over-\nload\
    \ and reduce cost. The authors in [282, 283, 284, 285, 286, 287, 288] work on\n\
    the improvement of grid performance by minimizing cost and reducing power losses.\n\
    Power loss minimization is specifically targeted by [282, 286, 284]. Of these,\
    \ Ettappan\net al. [282] aim for the reduction of power losses, voltage deviation\
    \ and increasing\nvoltage stability. Atteya et al. [286] also address this problem\
    \ by considering net-\nwork redistribution to minimize losses in the grid whereas\
    \ Sakr et al. [284] focuses\non minimizing transfer losses in the smart grid to\
    \ accomplish this task. Nguyen and\nMohammadi [285] attempt the reduction of power\
    \ losses and line congestion by deter-\nmining the location of thyristor controlled\
    \ series compensator devices. The problem\nis formulated as a multi-objective\
    \ problem aiming to minimize loadability of the lines,\nactive power loss and\
    \ the reactance of the transmission line. A cost reduction-based\napproach to\
    \ improve grid performance is followed by Das et al. [283] who aim to\nreduce\
    \ cost of maintaining electrical stability and also the cost of management of\
    \ the\ndistribution network. They do this by considering changing the location\
    \ of energy\nstorage systems within the grid. Kanwar et al. [287] take maximizing\

    \ while considering sizing of a distributed energy resource\ngeneration system.\n\
    Distributed energy resource (DER) management is another area where optimiza-\n\
    tion algorithms are used in Smart Grids. The management of distributed energy\n\
    sources within smart grids is dependent on the interconnectivity provided by IoT\n\
    in the smart grid system.\nSmart meters within the smart grid provide real-time\n\
    information relating to power consumption which can be used for controlling DER\n\
    electricity. Moreover, IoT devices allow for switching loads and generation sources\
    \ as\nrequired. This assists in creating a virtual power plant to aggregate all\
    \ energy sources\nin a DER scenario. With global warming and a changing climate,\
    \ utilities around\nthe world are increasingly incorporating various renewable\
    \ energy sources within their\ngrid which often times are an economically convenient\
    \ option as well. However, many\n59\nof these sources such as wind and solar (photo\
    \ voltaic [PV]) do not offer a consistent\nsupply of power throughout the day.\
    \ In this regard, systems such as batteries as\nwell as conventional generation\
    \ plants need to be used together along with renewable\nenergy sources. For utility\
    \ companies, it is necessary to optimize power production\nso that the maximum\
    \ amount of energy is utilized from these renewable sources so\nas to reduce cost\
    \ to the user while also maintaining the quality of service. The au-\nthors in\
    \ [289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302] provide\n\
    a management scheme for DERs to minimize cost. In this regard, the authors in\n\
    [292, 293, 294, 297, 289, 290, 300, 301, 302] all formulate the problem of distributed\n\
    energy resource management as a single objective problem where the cost incurred\
    \ is\nminimized. On the other hand, the authors in [298, 295, 291] and [299] formulate\
    \ this\nas a multi-objective problem. Azaza and Wallin [299] not only target reduction\
    \ of\nelectricity production cost but also maximize reliability of the system\
    \ while reducing\nthe environmental impact of the distribution system. It is interesting\
    \ to note that the\nimprovement of system reliability is formulated as a minimization\
    \ problem as well.\nSimilarly, Das et, al. [291] consider the reduction of both\
    \ the total cost as well as\nthe environmental cost of the system. Their considered\
    \ scenario also consists of a\nPV, Wind Turbine and battery. The constraints considered\
    \ were constraints regard-\ning power flow, limitations on power and voltage values,\
    \ power balance constraint\nand power generation constraints on the renewable\
    \ energy sources. In [289, 302], a\nDER management system is developed for a microgrid\
    \ which consists of a controllable\ncollection of energy storage and generation\
    \ sources powered by IoT devices.\nPlanning in distribution networks has been\
    \ considered by the work of [303] and\n[304]. Mahdavi et al. [303] work on expanding\
    \ transmission lines utilizing the artificial\nbee colony algorithm to minimize\
    \ cost of network expansion, power losses in load\nand generation. On the other\
    \ hand, Maji and Acharjee [304] aim to determine the\nminimum number of Phase\
    \ Measurement Units (PMUs) to make the distribution\nnetwork observable. The constraints\
    \ used were power flow and balance of power as\nwell as limits on the number of\
    \ transmission lines available. The internet of things also\nfinds usefulness\
    \ in terms of the use of Phase Measurement Units that provide voltage\nand current\
    \ measurement capabilities within smart grids to perform maintenance and\nmonitoring\
    \ operations. A summary of this discussion has been provided in Table 20\nand\
    \ the data setups used by the covered research work is presented in Table 21.\n\
    4.4\nSmart Health\nSmart health refers to the use of technology to provide better\
    \ healthcare to patients.\nThis can be in the form of developing tools for better\
    \ diagnosis of diseases or the use\nof algorithms for better planning and healthcare\

    ambulance dispatch increases mortality [307], moreover, economically speaking,\
    \ a\none-minute delay in response time for cardiac patients found that the mortality\
    \ in-\ncreases by 1% and adds annual costs of USD 7 billion in healthcare expenditure\n\
    [308]. Keeping this in mind ambulance deployment and location determination have\n\
    been of considerable interest in the area of optimization for smart health. These\n\
    two problems are specific cases of the Vehicle Routing Problem [309] and Maximum\n\
    coverage problem [310] sometimes called the Ambulance Routing Problem [311] and\n\
    Ambulance Location Problem [312]. The authors in [313] work on the optimal allo-\n\
    62\ncation determination based on fixed sites and a finite number of ambulances\
    \ while\nminimizing lateness of ambulance arrival using the Ant Colony Optimization.\
    \ Later\non, in their work in [314], they do a comparison with using GAs and find\
    \ that GAs\nprovide better performance. Kochetov and Shamray [315] attempt localization\
    \ of\nambulance fleet at base stations with the aim to minimize the average waiting\
    \ time\nfor arrival of ambulances. An interesting approach to this problem is\
    \ presented in\nYan et al. [316] who work on this problem from a scheduling perspective\
    \ where they\ncontrol scheduling of emergency vehicles to reduce the total cost\
    \ in terms of money\nand time using a Genetic Algorithm. Another approach for\
    \ sequencing vehicles to\nensure emergency vehicles reach their destination in\
    \ time is presented by Lu et al.\n[317] who aim to prioritize emergency vehicle\
    \ thoroughfare on traffic intersections.\nThey do this by minimizing the entrance\
    \ time of the vehicle by manipulating vehicle\norder. Constraints used for these\
    \ problems include constraints on the speed of the\nambulances, the flow of vehicles\
    \ on the road, specific road connections present as well\nas time constraints.\
    \ The internet of things serves a pivotal role in enabling the allo-\ncation and\
    \ routing of emergency vehicles. The connectivity provided by IoT through\nvehicle-to-vehicle\
    \ communication as well as vehicle to infrastructure communication\nfacilitates\
    \ providing a real-time indication of the vehicle’s location as well as the con-\n\
    dition of traffic in a given area. This information can then be used to determine\
    \ an\noptimal route for emergency vehicles as well as for their optimal deployment\
    \ to serve\npeople in need. Information about optimization methods for smart health\

    \ energy management has been the prime application of optimization in smart\n\
    homes, a summary of the objectives, constraints and the use of IoT has been shown\n\
    in Figure 12.\nSmart Homes \nHome Energy Management \nAppliance\nScheduling \n\

    \ interconnectivity betwen homes\nFigure 12. Optimization applications in Smart\
    \ Homes.\n64\nHome energy management refers to the development of demand side\
    \ manage-\nment schemes that aim to reduce the electricity cost billed to a customer\
    \ or maintain\ncomfort for the user. One way this is performed is by appropriate\
    \ appliance schedul-\ning. The idea here is to schedule the usage of appliances\
    \ in such a way that the\nmost power-hungry devices are turned on during off peak\
    \ hours when electricity costs\nmight be lower. The combination of the Smart Grid\
    \ and Smart Homes facilitates the\ndevelopment of optimization schemes that not\
    \ only benefit the customer (in terms\nof reduced electricity costs and maintaining\
    \ comfort) but also be useful for the util-\nities in ensuring that load profiles\
    \ (though minimizing the peak to average ratio)\nare more consistent thereby allowing\
    \ better planning of the power generation mix\nused by them. The authors of [319]\
    \ perform appliance scheduling for the purpose of\nminimizing electricity cost\
    \ and the waiting time for appliance usage. Interestingly,\nthey incorporate comfort\
    \ maintenance by adding it as a constraint. A similar ap-\nproach has been followed\
    \ by Bui et al [320] and Makhadmeh et al. [321] who aim to\nminimize the cost\
    \ of electricity usage with a constraint for maintenance of comfort.\nMakhadmeh\
    \ et al. [321] also include the reduction of waiting time rate for appliances\n\
    by the user and the reduction of the peak to average ratio of the power consumed\
    \ as\nconstraints. The authors in [322, 323, 324, 325] perform appliance scheduling\
    \ while\nconsidering electricity cost and peak to average ratio which need to\
    \ be minimized.\nAll of the authors present a multi-objective function for this\
    \ purpose combining the\nobjectives of minimizing the cost and the peak to average\
    \ power ratio. Azimi et al.\n[326] combine the problem of reducing cost and power\
    \ together as a single objective\nby considering the minimization of the ratio\
    \ of operating cost and load factor in a\nbattery supported system. The works\
    \ of [327, 328, 329, 330, 331] also consider user\ncomfort as part of the objective.\
    \ In [327], Essiet and Wang form a multi-objective\nminimization problem of electricity\
    \ cost, peak to average ratio for power and discom-\nfort of users in a smart\
    \ home supported by a renewable energy system consisting of a\nbattery and PV\
    \ system. In Chanra et al. [332], the authors aim to reduce electricity\ncost\
    \ by appliance scheduling in such a manner so as to make as much use of onsite\n\
    energy units as possible so as to reduce usage of utility provided electricity.\
    \ The\nenergy units they consider are a diesel generator, renewables and battery.\
    \ Another\napproach that aims to reduce cost of consumed electricity is presented\
    \ by Faia et\nal. [333] who formulate it as a problem of minimizing the energy\
    \ bill and the cost\nassociated with curtailment of power in a system with a battery\
    \ and a photovoltaic\nsystem. Work in [334, 330, 335, 336] also perform appliance\
    \ scheduling to reduce\ncost of electricity. Appliance scheduling for smart homes\
    \ has also been performed by\nFatima et al. [323] and Abid et al. [322] considering\
    \ a microgrid for homes where\ninstead of optimizing data from single homes, the\
    \ authors used data from connected\nsmart meters to determine an optimized control\
    \ scheme for appliances across the grid.\nThe constraints used for optimization\
    \ in smart homes are on the comfort needing to\nbe maintained, constraints on\
    \ the powerflow, time of operation, the maximum power\nthat is present or used\
    \ and which appliances are switchable appliances. Appliance\nscheduling is based\
    \ on smart meters as well as individual control and monitoring of\nappliances\
    \ using IoT systems. IoT devices enable the microgrid which is used to\ngather\
    \ data as well as control the switching on and off of sources from the houses\n\
    65\nelectricty supply. The information gathered from these IoT units can be processed\n\
    to optimize energy consumption patterns to reduce cost to the customer as well\
    \ as\nincrease comfort. The use of the considered optimization schemes for smart\
    \ homes\nhas been presented in Table 24 with the data setups presented in Table\
    \ 25.\n4.6\nSmart Industry\nOne of the biggest enablers of the Industry 4.0 concept\
    \ has been the use of AI tech-\nniques to improve the efficiency of the manufacturing\
    \ and production process. This\nhas led to the development of cyber physical systems\
    \ aiming to assist in activity recog-\nnition [339], machine health prediction\
    \ [340] and production management in terms of\nbottleneck prediction [341]. Apart\
    \ from conventional AI applications of anomaly de-\ntection, classification and\
    \ regression, computational optimization also finds numerous\napplications as\
    \ it fits well with the objective of efficient and streamlined manufac-\nturing.\
    \ The major applications for the use of computational optimization have been\n\
    in the area of routing and location for logistics and are variations of the vehicle\n\
    routing problem and are typically represented as Multidepot Vehicle Routing Prob-\n\
    lem (MVRP), Vehicle Routing Problem Pick-up and Delivery with Time Windows\n(VRPPDTW)\
    \ or Large-scale Dynamic Vehicle Routing Problem (LSDVRP). Figure\n13 summarizes\
    \ the objectives utilized, constraints and the role of IoT in optimization\nfor\
    \ Smart Industry.\nThe authors in [342] and [343] use the ABC and the GA respectively\
    \ to determine\nthe best location of service sites for logistic operations. Both\
    \ these approaches use\nmulti-objective formulations aiming to reduce cost of\
    \ operations, transportation as\nwell as the establishment of the centers. The\
    \ authors in Su et al. [344] use ACO,\nAlinaghia et al. [345] PSO and Utama et\
    \ al. [346] use ABC to address the problem\nof determining the best route for\
    \ logistics operations.\nThe routing and coverage\nproblem for logistics involves\
    \ determining the best route for either a single or multiple\nvehicles at a depot\
    \ which have to visit every customer. The works of [344, 345, 346]\nfocus on reducing\
    \ the cost incurred in the routing for vehicles in logistics as a single\nobjective\
    \ formulation. On the other hand, the authors of [347, 348] and [349] all\nwork\
    \ on the minimization of distance as their objective in determining the optimal\n\
    route for delivery vehicles trying to serve multiple locations.\nMounia and Bachir\n\
    [348] address routing in logistics as a multi-objective problem where they not\
    \ only\naim to minimize the distance traveled by the vehicles but also aim to\
    \ reduce CO2\nemissions and the number of vehicles used. A time based optimization\
    \ approach is\npresented by the authors of [350] and [351] with [350] also factoring\
    \ in reduction of fuel\nconsumption in their objective function formulation. Constraints\
    \ used for the routing\nand location determination problem are related to time,\
    \ capacity constraints for the\nvehicles, each customer being served only once,\
    \ constraints related to the route. The\ndetermination of the location and the\
    \ route for vehicles is dependent on real time\ninformation concerning the traffic\
    \ in the area as well as the loads to be collected from\neach site in addition\
    \ to other information which can be provided by IoT units. The\nusage of optimization\

    Smart Infrastructure\nWithin the infrastructure domain, the most common optimization\
    \ problem is the\narea of health monitoring of structures. Structural Health Monitoring\
    \ (SHM) is a\nnecessary application within the smart infrastructure domain as\
    \ it makes for safe\nusage of different structures of public use.\nThese structures\
    \ can be buildings as\nwell as transport structures such as bridges, tunnels.\
    \ Structural health monitoring\ntypically involves the use of sensors attached\
    \ to a structure at several points that can\ngauge some type of physical variable\
    \ (vibration, strain, acceleration, temperature,\ntilt etc) from the structure.\n\
    Data gathered from these connected sensors is then\nused to determine if any structural\
    \ damage has taken place or not.\nWithin the\ndomain of SHM, optimization algorithms\
    \ find application towards the Optimal Sensor\n69\nTable 27. Data setup for Smart\

    For the optimal sensor placement problem, the aim is to determine the best num-\n\
    ber and placement of sensors over a structure so as to reduce the number of sensors\n\
    used as well as improve the measurement process, both these aims result in increased\n\
    reliability of the SHM system as well as potentially lower the cost of the system\n\
    too. The authors in [353, 354, 355, 356, 357] work on the placement of sensors\
    \ for\nstructural health monitoring focusing on improving the effectiveness of\
    \ the deployed\nsystem. In this regard, [353] and [356] use the genetic algorithm\
    \ to solve a multi-\nobjective problem aiming to minimize the measurement error\
    \ and cost. Yang et al.\nin [355] formulate OSP as single objective minimization\
    \ where they aim to reduce\nthe ratio of sensor placement performance to the redundancy\
    \ of information resulting\nfrom each tested placement. Another approach that\
    \ works on the error is presented\nby [354] who use the Particle Swarm Optimization\

    \ It must be noted that the objective function is for-\nmulated as minimization\
    \ of negated accuracy and negated robustness measurement.\nOptimized structural\
    \ health monitoring for aircraft monitoring has been targeted\nin [358]. In their\
    \ setup consisting of vibration sensors, the authors optimize sensor\nplacement\
    \ by minimizing the cross correlation of the vibration waves in the sensing\n\
    network. The most common constraint for sensor placement is restrictions on the\n\
    places where sensors can be placed. This information has been provided in Table\
    \ 28\nand the data setups are presented in 29.\n4.8\nSmart Transportation\nOne\
    \ of the most popular optimization applications within smart cities are within\
    \ the\nsmart transport domain. These include parking system routing, traffic signal\
    \ control\nand scheduling. A summary of the applications, their objectives, constraints\
    \ and the\nrole of IoT is illustrated in Figure 15.\n71\nSmart TransportaƟon \n\

    Smart transport systems consist of sensors along roads and traffic intersections\n\
    to measure relevant parameters while also providing communication services between\n\
    vehicles and infrastructure. This allows for measurement of the current state\
    \ of roads\nin terms of traffic congestion and usage thereby allowing for the\
    \ use of optimization\ntechniques to improve trip experiences for users and make\
    \ the transportation system\nmore efficient. The authors in [361, 362, 363, 364,\
    \ 365] work on the minimization\nof time (wait and travel) in traffic signal control.\
    \ The aim of such systems is to\nreduce traffic build up on signal intersections.\
    \ Of these, the work in [361, 362] and\n[363] use the artificial bee colony and\
    \ the genetic algorithm respectively for a single\nobjective function of minimizing\
    \ delay time. An interesting approach for this problem\nis presented by Li et\
    \ al. [365] who use a multi objective formulation targeting the\nminimization\
    \ of the average travel time both overall and individually for all vehiclesl.\n\
    Another multi-objective approach in traffic signal control is presented by Chen\
    \ and\nYuan [366] who form a mixed problem of minimizing vehicle emissions and\
    \ travel\ntime together. Korkmaz [367] work on the estimation of delays in traffic\
    \ signals using\na genetic algorithm, they use it to minimize the difference between\
    \ the estimated\n72\nand simulated values.\nTang et al.\n[364] carry out distributed\
    \ optimization in a\nfog and cloud hierarchy.\nFirst, fog nodes optimize phase\
    \ timings within a single\ncycle and if the number of vehicles exceeds a threshold,\
    \ the results are sent to the\ncentral controller to further optimize over different\
    \ cycles so that a traffic jam is\navoided or alleviated. Zhang et al. [368] attempt\
    \ traffic signal optimization using\nmulti objective optimization functions of\
    \ reducing time delay and increasing traffic\ncapacity.\nConstraints used for\
    \ traffic signal control are timing constraints on the\nphase durations, flow\
    \ rate of vehicles and on the travel time.\nTraffic routing is also another important\
    \ aspect in smart transportation. This\ntypically involves the determination of\
    \ the best route to the destination keeping in\nview various criteria such as\
    \ reduction of distance, time, cost etc.\nThe problem\nof traffic routing is addressed\
    \ by the works of [369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375,\n376, 377, 378, 379]. The\
    \ authors in [369] and [370] use the ant colony optimization\nand genetic algorithm\
    \ to minimize the travel distance in parking system routing.\nThey aim to minimize\
    \ distance traveled by a driver looking to find a free parking\nspot, using the\
    \ algorithm, an optimized route is determined for the parking spot.\nIn, [371,\
    \ 373] and [372] the ant colony optimization algorithm is used to determine\n\
    the best route in a generic traffic scenario where cars can communicate with road\n\
    side units in a VANET architecture. Routing for public transport is performed\
    \ by\n[380] and [375] in a connected vehicle scenario aiming to minimize travel\
    \ time. An\neconomic objective approach to traffic routing is taken by the authors\
    \ of [376, 378]\nand [379] who minimize the total cost of the trip.\nMao [379]\
    \ also include traffic\ncongestion and travel time as well in their computation.\
    \ Hassoune et al. [381] work\non a parking guidance using the ant colony optimization\
    \ algorithm to reduce traffic\ncongestion and minimize distance. Constraints for\
    \ traffic routing are related to the\nroad network allowing travel in specific\
    \ directions, signaling and travel time. Within\nsmart transportation, IoT nodes\
    \ are used to determine occupied parking spaces and\nthis data is used for routing\
    \ applications in parking. Traffic routing is based on vehicle\nto vehicle and\
    \ vehicle to infrastructure communication provided by VANETs within\nthe IoT framework.\
    \ These systems enable cars to exchange data with each other and\nalso with fixed\
    \ infrastructure on the roads. This discussion is also presented in Table\n30\
    \ and the data setups for the covered work are presented in Table 31.\n5\nConclusion\n\
    This chapter provides coverage of the application of five popular computational\
    \ algo-\nrithms in the IoT enabled Smart City. It provides a mapping of the various\

    As discussed earlier, IoT finds usage in many different Smart City domains, both\
    \ for\nuse in classification/regression tasks as well as for optimization applications.\
    \ One\nof the most important applications of IoT within Smart Cities is within\
    \ the Smart\nHealth domain wherein IoT devices enable the monitoring of patients\
    \ for different\ndiseases such as heart disease etc. While there are a multitude\
    \ of IoT within Smart\nHealth, in order to develop algorithms on IoT sensor data,\
    \ the case of ambient assisted\nliving was chosen, in particular, this work considers\
    \ the case of fall detection.\n2\nIoT for Fall Detection\nThe United Nations estimates\
    \ that the number of old people (aged 60 and above) will\nbe 2.1 billion by 2050\
    \ and 3.1 billion by 2100 [382] leading to an increased old age\npopulation. With\
    \ people above 65 years suffering the greatest number of fatal falls\namong adults\
    \ aged 60 and over [383] healthcare costs related to fall related injuries\nrun\
    \ in to billions of dollars. These falls can result in injuries of moderate to\
    \ severe\nnature in the people experiencing the falls and may lead to decreased\
    \ mobility [384],\nespecially for the elderly [385]. Furthermore, following the\
    \ initial fall, the likelihood\nof experiencing additional falls increases [386]\
    \ and can lead to mental stress in the\nform of post-fall syndrome [387].\nThe\
    \ Internet of Things has spearheaded the development of cyber-physical systems\n\
    that facilitate the recognition of activities/events being performed by people\
    \ in their\ndaily life. One aspect of this application scenario is fall detection.\
    \ Falls can occur\ndue to a variety of reasons [388] and Fall Detection Systems\
    \ (FDS) are used for\npeople with different of health related ailments such as\
    \ in Parkinsons disease [389],\nepilepsy [390], arthritis, people suffering from\
    \ cardiovascular diseases and various\nneuro-degenerative diseases [391]. In any\
    \ scenario, it is pertinent that when a person\nundergoes a fall, they be provided\
    \ care as quickly as possible. Providing timely care\nafter a fall may improve\
    \ post-fall life quality of a patient. Fall detection Systems can\nplay a vital\
    \ role in contributing to the provision of timely care [389, 392] by alerting\n\
    healthcare professionals. As noted by [393] fall detection systems are necessary\
    \ for\nold people with cognitive impairments who may not be able to get up after\
    \ a fall for\nlong durations of time which may result in pressure sores and other\
    \ complications\nand due to vulnerability to injuries when experiencing a fall,\
    \ it may sometimes result\nin death [394].\n76\nA fall is an unintended and sudden\
    \ change of posture resulting in one resting on\nthe ground or some other lower\
    \ level elevation. The aim of a FDS is to monitor the\nmovement of a person and\
    \ determine when a fall has taken place with the aim to\nalert healthcare personnel\
    \ or other caregivers. Over the years different methodologies\nhave been suggested\
    \ to address this problem, however, before discussing the different\nmethods utilize\
    \ for fall detection purposes, it is important to mention what researchers\nenumerate\
    \ to be the traits of a ’good’ FDS [395].\n2.1\nChallenges/Requirements of a FDS\n\
    The following are the typical typical traits/requirements of a good fall detection\n\
    system.\n2.1.1\nNon-intrusiveness\nAn important requirement in fall detection\
    \ systems is to be non-intrusive. Any FDS\nshould not be an impediment in the\
    \ execution of daily activities of a person as it may\nrestrict movement or inconvenience\
    \ their lifestyle.\n2.1.2\nLow Latency\nAn FDS needs to be able to detect a fall\
    \ with low latency. Latency refers to the time\nduration between the occurring\
    \ of a fall and its detection. FDS need to detect falls\nas quickly as possible\
    \ to ensure that caregivers can be notified right away so that apt\ncare is provided\
    \ to the person. Low latency depends on not only the algorithm being\nused to\
    \ detect falls but also parameters like network speed and reliability. Sensor\
    \ data\ntransmission to the main system might also be included in this calculation\
    \ depending\non the FDS proposed.\n2.1.3\nLow power consumption\nPower consumption\
    \ is an important issue in FDS, especially for ones which are battery\npowered.\
    \ Many FDS are expected to be used by elderly people who might not be\nas regular\
    \ in charging the FDS, therefore FDS should consume as little power as\npossible.\n\
    2.1.4\nAllow mobility\nA FDS should not hamper mobility as it might be preventive\
    \ in adoption of a FDS\ntoo. FDS which require people to remain infront of a camera\
    \ at a certain viewpoint\netc can be difficult to deploy and use.\n2.1.5\nDifferentiate\
    \ between Falls and Activities\nA FDS should have low false positives and false\
    \ negatives. In other words it should\nbe able to confidently detect falls and\
    \ be able to differentiate them from activities of\n77\ndaily living such as walking,\
    \ sitting, jumping, running etc. Any false alarms will result\nin wastage of valuable\
    \ healthcare resources, on the contrary, any false negatives might\ncause the\
    \ patient/person having undergone the fall to not get appropriate medical\ncare\
    \ in time and lead to potential death or trauma.\n2.1.6\nNotify caregivers\nA\
    \ complete fall detection solution should have some mechanism of informing care-\n\
    givers whenever a fall is detected. Typically this is carried out in terms of\
    \ email,\nnotifications via some system or messages. Moreover, this process should\
    \ be quick so\nas to ensure the dispatch of any needed help as quickly as possible.\n\
    2.1.7\nTrack history\nA complete fall detection solution should be able to provide\
    \ the history about a\npatient in terms of falls that a person may have suffered\
    \ from as this will help monitor\nthe patients health and determine likelihood\
    \ to suffer from falls in the future. FDS\nmay sometimes also look at other biological\
    \ parameters during falls so as to help\ninvestigate the causes of falls using\
    \ the conditions prevalent at that time. Biological\nparameters that could be\
    \ measured include heart rate, perhaps an ECG or others as\ndeemed necessary based\
    \ on a patients history.\n2.2\nTypes of Fall Detection Systems\nFall detection\
    \ systems can be categorized in to three types based on the sensing\nmechanisms\
    \ used and their placement. These are Ambient Sensor based systems,\nVisual based\
    \ systems and Wearable Sensor based systems.\n2.2.1\nAmbient Sensor based systems\n\
    Ambient sensor based systems are also sometimes referred to as environmental sensor\n\
    based systems since these types of FDS rely on the use of a number of wirelessly\n\
    connected ambient sensors placed in a given area for the detection of falls. These\n\
    FDS make use of various sensors including Passive InfraRed (PIR) Sensors [396],\n\
    Acoustic sensors such as microphones, thermal sensors as well as sensors measuring\n\
    Wi-Fi signal strength etc. For e.g., the authors in [397] develop a fall detection\
    \ system\nbased on two PIR sensors and a vibration sensor to detect vibrations\
    \ on the floor\nwhen a person falls down. Using the PIR sensor to detect a persons\
    \ motion. feature\nextraction is performed on vibration measurements and an SVM\
    \ classifier is used to\ndetermine whether a fall has taken place or not. Another\
    \ approach presented in [398]\nutilize sounds in a home to determine falls in\
    \ the elderly. They do this by extracting\nfeatures in sound signals and like\
    \ [397] use a Support Vector Machine classifier to\ndetermine falls. The authors\
    \ in [399] make use of Wi-Fi channel state information\nfor fall detection. They\
    \ achieve this by feature extraction in the frequency domain\nfollowed by an SVM\
    \ classifier.\n78\nAmbient fall detection systems offer the advantage of not requiring\
    \ people to wear\nanything on their bodies and are thus nonrestrictive in that\
    \ sense. However, such\nsystems are prone to suffer high false positives due to\
    \ the large number of external\nfactors such as other heat emitting devices, multiple\
    \ people moving around at the\nsame time etc. Another issue that comes with ambient\
    \ fall detection systems is that\ndeployment could be cumbersome to cover a large\
    \ space, therefore they are typically\ndeployable in small places such as a home\
    \ or a small building but are very difficult\nto use outdoors due to the nature\
    \ of the setting as well as the possible sources of\nexternal interference.\n\
    2.2.2\nVision based systems\nVision based systems rely on the processing of video\
    \ frames or other visual infor-\nmation such as depth and thermal images or their\
    \ combination [400] to detect falls.\nTypically, the recorded data is sent to\
    \ a server or central computer which provides\nprocessing capabilities. Moreover,\
    \ recently, with the use of deep learning algorithms,\nsuch systems have found\
    \ to provide improved performance. For e.g. [401] use Convo-\nlution Neural Networks\
    \ on velocity information in video frames. Another approach\nthat uses CNNs is\
    \ given in [402] who model human motion from video frames using\nCNNs and then\
    \ use a logistic regression classifier to determine falls. Other approaches\n\
    with CNNs include the works in [403] and [404], both of which achieve very high\
    \ de-\ntection accuracy. Another DL network which has been useful in fall detection\
    \ systems\nbased on cameras is Long Short Term Machine, a recent example of that\
    \ is the use of\na CNN + LSTM combination on 360 degree video recordings of an\
    \ indoor facility to\ndetermine falls. The LSTM allows for capturing the changing\
    \ characteristics between\nvideo frames to provide fall recognition.\nEventhough\
    \ vision based FDS have been able to provide improved fall detection\nperformance\
    \ recently, like ambient sensor based systems, these systems suffer from\nsome\
    \ drawbacks. They are affected negatively in terms of performance and deploya-\n\
    bility from external factors such as occlusion, restricted mobility of the people\
    \ being\nmonitored, typically usable in environments over a small area, have high\
    \ computa-\ntional costs and are expensive. One other issue with vision based\
    \ systems is privacy,\nvision systems which use normal cameras pose risk of violation\
    \ to the privacy of peo-\nple being captured on video. The question of privacy\
    \ can be circumvented by the\nuse of depth cameras for e.g. a kinect [405, 406]\
    \ or using heatmaps using infrared\ncameras/sensors [407].\n2.2.3\nWearable Sensor\
    \ based systems\nWearable fall detection systems involve the use of a device attached\
    \ to the subject.\nThe wearable device monitors user activity by means of sensors\
    \ and can determine\nwhen a fall has occurred. Information about the fall is then\
    \ conveyed to a doctor or\nother medical professionals. Various types of sensors\
    \ can be used in these systems\nincluding inertial measurement sensors such as\
    \ accelerometers, gyroscopes, magne-\ntometers [408] or health sensors such as\
    \ ECGs, oxygen level and pulse rate sensors\n79\nas well. The devices that contain\
    \ these sensors can be worn on the hand, wrist, arm,\nchest, waist, legs, thigh\
    \ or even put inside shoes and are usually battery powered.\nWearable fall detection\
    \ systems have the advantage that they do not restrict move-\nment of the person\
    \ using them and consume less power than the other two approaches,\nhowever, a\
    \ disadvantage to this is the need to ’carry’ the device all the time. Another\n\
    disadvantage is the need to charge the device regularly which might be difficult\
    \ to do\nfor older people, a way this has been addressed in some approaches is\
    \ to make use of\nenergy harvesting [409].\n2.3\nTypes of Wearable FDS\nThere\
    \ are two types of wearable systems in use for fall detection purposes.\n2.3.1\n\
    Threshold based systems\nThe first of type of wearable FDS are threshold-based\
    \ fall detection systems where\nauthors have used various thresholding techniques\
    \ on sensor values measuring motion,\nparticularly the accelerometer. The major\
    \ advantage of threshold based fall detection\nsystems is their relative low computational\
    \ cost and use of sensor fusion techniques\nto improve fall detection accuracy\
    \ , however, the big disadvantage of such systems is\nthat threshold based systems\
    \ do not generalize well across subjects since people may\nhave different gaits,\
    \ this is especially true for people of different ages. As a result,\nthreshold\
    \ based FDS may suffer from having many false positives as well as false\nnegatives\
    \ since the FDS needs to differentiate between activities of daily living and\n\
    falls, which many times may appear to be fairly similar to each other in terms\
    \ of\nsensor readings.\n2.3.2\nMachine/Deep Learning based systems\nSince threshold-based\
    \ systems are rigid in terms of their usage, ML/DL methods\nprovide a flexible\
    \ method for fall detection. ML/DL algorithms can learn complex\npatterns from\
    \ sensor data which indicate to a fall while monitoring a persons activities\n\
    and therefore are useful in fall detection systems. As opposed to threshold based\n\
    systems, their generalizing capability allows them to be used across subjects.\n\
    A\ntypical ML framework for fall detection will involve data acquisition, prepossessing,\n\
    feature extraction and then usage of a suitable ML algorithm to make the inference\n\
    for a fall or no fall. A deep learning framework based FDS might have a similar\n\
    methodology, but depending on the DL algorithm used, feature extraction might\
    \ be\nomitted.\n2.4\nSensors used in Wearable FDS\nAs mentioned before, the sensors\
    \ used in wearable FDS are accelerometers, gyroscope,\nmagnetometer, ECG, Pulse\
    \ Rate and oxygen saturation levels. In this section, we will\ndiscuss briefly\
    \ the role of these sensors in wearable FDS and parameters of interest\nwhen using\
    \ them in FDS.\n80\n2.4.1\nAccelerometers\nAccelerometers, together with gyroscopes\
    \ are the most widely used sensors in wear-\nable FDS. One reason for this is\
    \ that both these sensors are typically present in\nsmartphones, which have been\
    \ used to either collect data for and/or deploy fall de-\ntection systems. An\
    \ accelerometer provides a measure of absolute acceleration and\nare used to detect\
    \ vibrations, force in a variety of applications involving monitoring\nof machines,\
    \ planes, civil architectures and more. In an FDS, an accelerometer is\nable to\
    \ capture the movement patterns of individuals which can be used to determine\n\
    falls.\n2.4.2\nGryroscope\nGyroscopes are used to measure tilt/orientation.\n\
    Gyroscopes find applications in\nvarious areas where orientation measurement is\
    \ required, for e.g. in airplanes and\nsubmarines where they are used in stabilization\
    \ systems, smartphones and game re-\nmotes for interactive gameplay, among other\
    \ things. Since orientation is an important\ncharacteristic of a fall, gyroscopes\
    \ are one of the most widely used sensors in FDS\nalong with acceleratorometers.\n\
    2.4.3\nMagnetometer\nA magnetometer is a device that measures the direction and\
    \ strength of magnetism\nrelative to the earths magnetic north. In addition to\
    \ other applications, magnetome-\nters are used in aircrafts for direction referencing.\
    \ These sensors are not very popular\nin FDS but have been proposed in some approaches\
    \ [410, 411] to be used for fall\ndetection in addition to accelerometers and/or\
    \ gyroscopes.\n2.4.4\nVarious Medical Sensors\nWearable fall detection systems\
    \ may also incorporate different types of medical sen-\nsors such as ElectroCardioGraphs,\
    \ ElectroMyoGraphs, Pulse Rate or Oxygen Level\nmeasurement in the FDS solution.\
    \ Even though there have been some approaches\nwhich have used medical sensors\
    \ exclusively for fall detection (such as EMG[412]),\nhowever, like magnetometers,\
    \ these sensors are usually used along with accelerome-\nters and/or gyroscopes.\
    \ Adding these sensors to fall detection systems has the added\nadvantage of assessing\
    \ falls from a health standpoint too as this information can be\nused to determine\
    \ risk of falls [413].\n2.5\nDesign considerations for Wearable FDS\nWearable\
    \ fall detection systems utilize sensor measurements to ascertain the occur-\n\
    rence of a fall. Since wearable FDS units are always attached to a persons body,\
    \ they\ncontinuously provide measurements of a persons movements and activities.\
    \ In order\nto use these measurements in a FDS, there are some design considerations\
    \ involved.\nWe discuss them in this section.\n81\n2.5.1\nSampling frequency\n\
    The sampling frequency dictates the number of sensor measurements recorded per\n\
    second. The sampling frequency used in an FDS should be high enough to capture\n\
    fall motion but not too high so as to increase data processing, storage requirements\n\
    as well as allow for energy efficient operation. In fact, depending on the position\n\
    of the sensors, significant reductions can be made in the sampling frequency used\n\
    for sensors with little or no change in performance as demonstrated by [414].\
    \ Such\nreductions could result in low power consumption by the wearable module\
    \ thereby\nenabling longevity of operation.\n2.5.2\nWindowing\nSince wearable\
    \ fall detection systems provide a continuous stream of sensor data, the\ndata\
    \ needs to be windowed for fall detection to be performed. Windowing refers to\
    \ the\nextraction of a subset of the sensor data stream in a sliding manner or\
    \ otherwise and\nis typically specified in terms of time duration for its size.\
    \ It is typical for wearable\nFDS designers to test different window sizes for\
    \ their fall detection algorithms. The\nsize of the window used would dictate\
    \ memory and computational requirements of\nthe unit used for deploying the FDS\
    \ system. Another important factor in windowing\nsensor signals is whether overlapping\
    \ is used during the windowing process or not.\nThis might be important to allow\
    \ for smooth transitions between different windows.\n2.5.3\nFeature Extraction\n\
    Feature extraction is the process of determining quantities from data which charac-\n\
    terizes it for a desired task appropriately. Feature extraction not only aims\
    \ to capture\nimportant aspects of the data being worked on but also to present\
    \ its content in a\nreduced size, thereby, making use of the data easier. Feature\
    \ extraction is a typ-\nical step of the a signal processing and machine learning\
    \ workflow and follows the\nwindowing step. There are different types of features\
    \ which have been computed\nfor fall detection applications, common feature computations\
    \ include the determina-\ntion of time domain features, frequency domain features,\
    \ statistical features etc. or\nsome combination from sensor data in FDS. Feature\
    \ extraction is followed by either a\nthresholding algorithm to sensor values\
    \ or a machine/deep learning model. For deep\nlearning, there have been some end\
    \ to end deep learning approaches which skip the\nstep of manual feature extraction.\
    \ In such approaches, deep learning networks such\nas CNN may be used to extract\
    \ features followed by other networks such as LSTM\nto determine falls, an example\
    \ is proposed in [415].\n2.6\nLiterature Review\nAs discussed previously, wearable\
    \ fall detection systems present several advantages\nwhen used for fall detection\
    \ purposes such as non-intrusiveness, ease of mobility, small\nsize of deployment,\
    \ low cost and that many implementations are typically standalone\nsystems. This\
    \ added with the fact that sensors and other components which are used\n82\nin\
    \ such systems have been becoming cheaper and cheaper to produce has resulted\
    \ in\na lot of interest in the development of wearable FDS by researchers and\
    \ technologists\nalike. Therefore, wearable FDS methodologies have gained considerable\
    \ interest in\nfall detection research. We discuss some of the popular methodologies\
    \ proposed in\nthis regard.\nThe authors in Mrozek et al. [416] present a complete\
    \ design of a wearable fall\ndetection system for an Internet of Things scenario.\
    \ They conduct two experiments\nwith their system, in one experiment, data is\
    \ collected from a gyroscope and an\naccelerometer and sent to the cloud for fall\
    \ detection (as a web service) while in\nthe second experiment, fall detection\
    \ is performed on the edge node (smart phone).\nThrough their experiments they\
    \ conclude that performing fall detection on the edge\nnode results in less network\
    \ traffic and storage requirements for the cloud. Algo-\nrithmically speaking,\
    \ they extract 3 second overlapping windows from measurements\nof both sensors,\
    \ perform feature extraction and pass it on to a boosted decision tree\nclassifier\
    \ for determining whether a fall has taken place or not. Moreover, the boosted\n\
    decision tree classifier was trained using the SisFall [417] dataset. Another\
    \ IoT based\nsystem is proposed by Marquez et al. [418] who develop a fall detection\
    \ system for\nIoT on the edge. They first gather data from an accelerometer and\
    \ a gyroscope placed\non the waist of multiple subjects and train a support vector\
    \ machine classifier on a\ncombination of raw sensor values and its standard deviation.\
    \ They are able to deploy\ntheir system successfully and achieve satisfactory\
    \ results. Moreover, feature selection\nis also performed before the classification\
    \ stage. A fog based fall detection model has\nbeen proposed by Sarabia-J’acome\
    \ et al. [419] who utilize a Long Short Term Memory\nRecurrent Neural Network\
    \ in their method. Edge nodes collect Inertial Measurement\nUnit (IMU) measurements\
    \ and relay them to a fog node which processes the data to\ndetermine if a fall\
    \ has taken place or not. One motivation for them to develop RNN\nmodels over\
    \ a Convolutional Neural Network one is the requirement of less param-\neters\
    \ and thus less computational requirements. Their final model consists of a 1D\n\
    CNN layer followed by two LSTM layers and a fully connected layer for classification\n\
    and is trained using raw data (window of 15s) from the SisFall dataset.\nZurbuchen\
    \ et al. in [420] provide a comparison of various machine learning al-\ngorithms\
    \ for fall detection while using data from the SisFall dataset. They perform\n\
    experiments using Decision Trees, Random Forest Classifier, Gradient Boosting\
    \ tree,\nK-Nearest Neighbor and Support Vector Machines. Segments of 10 seconds\
    \ are ex-\ntracted from the trials in the SisFall dataset and various time and\
    \ frequency domain\nfeatures are computed for those segments. These are then passed\
    \ on to the classifiers.\nThrough their experiments, they find that Random Forest\
    \ and Gradient Boosting\ntrees perform the best among the considered methods.\
    \ Another comparison of var-\nious ML algorithms is provided by Chelli and P¨atzold\
    \ in [421] who compare the\nperformance of a number of machine learning algorithms\
    \ on two datasets, the Cogent\nLabs dataset [422] and the one provided in [423].\
    \ The algorithms they consider are\nan artificial neural network, K-NN, an ensemble\
    \ bagged tree (EBT) and Quadratic\nSupport Vector Machine (QSVM). They compute\
    \ several time and frequency domain\nfeatures from accelerometer and gyroscope\
    \ signals and pass them on to the classi-\nfiers. Their best performing classifiers\
    \ were QSVM and EBT. Kerdjidj et al. in [424]\n83\nuse compressive sensing to\
    \ explore the use of different modalities for fall detection\npurposes. The performance\
    \ of accelerometer only and an accelerometer - gyroscope\nsensor combination in\
    \ a fall detection scenario is compared. A Shimmer device [425]\nis used to capture\
    \ data from 17 volunteers asked to perform activities of daily living\nas well\
    \ as fall like movements. They first extract segments of length 2.56 seconds\n\
    from their recordings before performing feature extraction and passing it on to\
    \ four\ndifferent machine learning classifiers, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector\
    \ Machines,\nDecision Trees and an Ensemble Classifier (EC). They conduct two\
    \ such experiments,\none with compressive sensing and the other without. Their\
    \ results indicate that the\nEC classifier and SVM perform the best with the help\
    \ of compressive sensing included\nin the pipeline. A ’transfer learning’ approach\
    \ towards fall detection is provided by\nFanez et al. in [426] and they test it\
    \ on the UMAFall [427] dataset and the FallOVI\ndataset (created by them). Using\
    \ a finite state machine which captures windows\nof accelerometer measurements\
    \ based on peak values, the authors convert the win-\ndowed segments into string\
    \ representations using symbolic aggregate approximation\n(SAX) [428]. During\
    \ training each user performs normal ADLs and falls for a short\nperiod of time.\
    \ Peak values are determined from sensor measurements and used to\ncreate bag\
    \ of words using SAX. After this, normal operation of the system starts\nand information\
    \ retrieval (term frequency - inverse term frequency) values are used\nto determine\
    \ what label to give to new SAX words derived from sensor values. If a\ndetermined\
    \ word is not similar (using Manhattan distance) to any word in the bag of\nwords\
    \ (K-NN clustering is used to group similar words), a fall event is suggested\
    \ to\nhave occurred. ’Transfer learning’ involves the use of clusters formed by\
    \ other users\n(performing activities only) as the starting point of the training.\
    \ Their experiment\ncompared an SVM classifier with their information retrieval\
    \ based scheme. They are\nable to detect falls all the time with the UMAfall dataset\
    \ but have a high number\nof false positives for the FallOVI dataset. An noticeable\
    \ aspect of this approach is\nthe use of clustering and ’feature extraction’ as\
    \ strings. In Giuffrida et al. [429]\nthe authors use data from the SisFall dataset\
    \ and an SVM classifier to differentiate\nbetween falls and no-fall samples. They\
    \ extract slices (of 1 second) from the SisFall\ntrials and label each slice as\
    \ containing a fall or not. A number of features were then\ncomputed for each\
    \ slice before feature selection was performed and an SVM classifier\nwas trained\
    \ to determine the output class.\nDeep Learning methods have also been widely\
    \ used for fall detection purposes.\nCasilari et al. in [430] explore the contribution\
    \ of the gyroscope sensor for use in\ncombined accelerometer-gyroscope based fall\
    \ detection systems.\nTo do this, they\nmake use of measurements from the SisFall\
    \ dataset, extract observation windows of\n5 seconds around peaks of accelerometer\
    \ sensor signal values over a trace and pass\nthem on to a Convolutional Neural\
    \ Network with four convolutional layers, three\nmax pooling layers followed by\
    \ one fully connected layer for classification. Training is\nperformed in two\
    \ different sets of experiments, one including gyroscope data and the\nother without\
    \ it. They note that the results they get while using only accelerometer\nsignal\
    \ measurements are better than that when using data from both sensors. A\nCNN\
    \ is used for fall detection purposes by Santos et al. in [431] from accelerometer\n\
    measurements. Their network consists of six convolutional layers, two max pooling\n\
    84\nlayers in between followed by a fully connected layer for classification.\n\
    They use\ndata from the URFD dataset [432] and the Smart Watch and Notch datset\
    \ [433] in\ntheir experiments. They note that their model performs best when they\
    \ use data\naugmentation for both the datasets. However, this was achieved by\
    \ two different\nvariants of the same model. This highlights the point of a single\
    \ model not necessarily\nperforming well on all datasets. Another interesting\
    \ aspect of their work is the use of\nthe Mathews Correlation Coefficient to evaluate\
    \ performance of their algorithms. A\nmodified AlexNet [434] has been used in\
    \ [435] by Alarifi et. al. They collect tri-axial\ndata from inertial measurement\
    \ sensors consisting of accelerometer, gyroscope and\nmagnetometer at six different\
    \ positions on a subjects body. A total of 16 activities of\ndaily living and\
    \ 20 falls were recorded by them. Feature extraction is then performed\nin terms\
    \ of various statistical measurements as well as frequency analysis. This is\n\
    followed by principal component analysis and then passed on to the classification\n\
    stage consisting of an optimized AlexNet ConvNet. Waheed et. al. in [436] develop\n\
    a FDS using a Bi-Directional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network. They\n\
    consider the binary case of fall and no fall and perform experiments using the\
    \ SisFall\ndataset as well as the UP-Fall dataset [437]. Their network consists\
    \ of eight layers\nin total. Two Bi-LSTM layers and two fully connected layers\
    \ with dropouts being\nused for regularization. Training is performed with creating\
    \ missing values in the\ndata to introduce noise tolerancy.\nCasiliri et al.\n\
    in [438] provide a performance\ncomparison for a CNN network on multiple public\
    \ fall detection datasets. The aim\nof their work is to test the cross-application\
    \ of a similar CNN network trained on\ndifferent datasets. They set their experiments\
    \ up by training a four layer CNN on\neach dataset separately for fall detection\
    \ on 14 datasets (using similar positions of\nsensor placement) on windows of\
    \ 5 seconds for accelerometer signals. Their results\nindicate a very good performance\
    \ of the network for the SisFall dataset, however, it\ndoesn’t perform very well\
    \ for most of the other datasets, in some cases, performing\nless than random\
    \ chance, which is quite surprising. Their experiments do however,\nhighlight\
    \ an issue with the well accepted notion that an algorithm developed on some\n\
    benchmark dataset will necessarily work similarly well with other datasets.\n\
    The\nauthors suggest that the erratic performance of their method could be due\
    \ to the\ndifference in the nature of the data in terms of sampling frequency\
    \ used, range of\nthe sensor and the varying type of movements. Another cross-dataset\
    \ approach for\nfall detection has been proposed in [439] where the authors use\
    \ a combination of a\nCNN and Long Short Term Memory network to extract features\
    \ followed by a K-\nNearest Neighbor classifer to detect falls as well as identify\
    \ the subjects within four\nfall datasets, DFNAPAS [440], SisFall, UniMiB-SHAR\
    \ [441] and ASLH [442]. The\nnetwork is trained using the DFNAPAS dataset, before\
    \ training the network however,\ndata augmentation is carried out for the fall\
    \ class. Their best results are achieved\nfor a value of K = 3 and they achieve\
    \ good results for all experiments. They observe\nthat using a deep learning architecture\
    \ for feature extraction purposes along with a\nmachine learning classifier performs\
    \ better than a using a fully connected layer at the\nclassification stage.\n\
    Post fall intelligence is an important research area in the field of fall detection\n\
    as it can be useful in determining various post fall injuries [443] and serve\
    \ as an\n85\nintelligence parameter [444] for doctors. Jung et al. in [445] also\
    \ target detection\nof pre-impact falls for wearable airbag deployment. Their\
    \ method involves the ap-\nplication of a threshold on determined features from\
    \ accelerometer and gyroscope\nmeasurement measurements. The thresholds are then\
    \ applied to a dataset collected\nby them and also on the SisFall dataset. The\
    \ threshold is determined by performing\na grid search on the extracted features\
    \ from their dataset to maximize specificity and\nsensitivity. They do note that\
    \ some activties like sitting down quickly on a chair or a\nmattress triggered\
    \ false positives. Moreover, when applied to SisFall, their methods\nperformance\
    \ is not as high as achieved by methods based on ML/DL. Koo et. al.\n[446] present\
    \ experiments for post fall detection from a combination of self collected\ndata\
    \ and the SisFall dataset. They conduct tests using sliding windows as well as\
    \ dis-\ncrete windows from these signals and compute statistical features from\
    \ them. After\nfeature extraction, two different classifiers, the artificial neural\
    \ network and support\nvector machine are tested with the computed features as\
    \ well as raw sensor values.\nThey find that both ANN and SVM are suitable for\
    \ use in post fall detection sce-\nnarios. Another approach looking at the different\
    \ phases of a fall has been presented\nin [447] where Hsieh et. al. use accelerometer\
    \ sensor data to differentiate between\nfive phases of a fall, pre-fall, free-fall,\
    \ impact, resting and recovery and the initial\nand end static phases. To do this,\
    \ they compute various time domain and statistical\nfeatures and test five classifiers,\
    \ SVM, K-Nearest Neighbors, Naive Bayes, Decision\nTrees and Adaptive Boosting\
    \ (AdaBoost). For their experimental setup, the best\nresults were achieved using\
    \ the K-NN classifier. In Musci et al. [448], the authors\npropose a RNN based\
    \ method to differentiate between falls, pre-impact falls (state\nwhere a person\
    \ is in a dangerous state of transition which may result in a falls) and\nnormal\
    \ activities. Their motivation for including preimpact falls is to enable timely\n\
    deployment of a fall protection system. First, they label data from the SisFall\
    \ dataset\nto form three classes. They then extract windows of duration 1.28 seconds\
    \ with an\noverlap of 50% from the sensor signals and pass them on to their network\
    \ which\nconsists of two fully connected layers and two-layer LSTM layers. Moreover,\
    \ due to\nan imbalanced training set, they define a new balancing loss function.\
    \ Their method\nresults in fall detection good results for the three classes considered.\
    \ A CNN-LSTM\napproach has been proposed in [449] by Yu et al. for detection of\
    \ pre-impact fall and\nfalls in the SisFall dataset. They provide a comparison\
    \ of standalone CNN, LSTM\nand a combined CNN-LSTM architecture for this task\
    \ and also implement them on\na Jetson Nano. They define a pre-impact fall as\
    \ the time interval where a subject\ntransitions from a controlled state to a\
    \ state which may lead to a fall. First, they\nlabel data in the SisFall dataset\
    \ as described in [448] to form a three class problem.\nThey achieved their best\
    \ results for their CNN+LSTM model having four CNN layers\nfollowed by two LSTM\
    \ layers and a fully connected layer for classification. Their ap-\nproach highlights\
    \ the combined capability of CNN-LSTM for feature extraction. An\naspect of fall\
    \ intelligence is direction, in [450] Lee et al. use the velocity vector from\n\
    the acceleration sensor in a smartphone for fall detection with direction and\
    \ then\nlater on in [451], they use the standard deviation of the accemerometer\
    \ and gyro-\nscope sensor measurements from a smart phone to determine falls and\
    \ fall direction.\nThey perform a small experiment and are able to differentiate\
    \ between left, right,\n86\nfront and backward falls. More work on fall detection\
    \ with direction was performed\nby the authors in [452] who use an accelerometer\
    \ and gyroscope combination along\nwith a kalman filter for tilt estimation. Fall\
    \ detection is then performed using an\nSVM classifier. Falls with direction detection\
    \ has been attempted in [453, 454] by\nthe same authors. They collect accelerometer\
    \ data from various subjects and extract\nthree features from the recordings for\
    \ each axis, the mean, standard deviation and\nprincipal components (using Principal\
    \ Component Analysis). These are then passed\non to a SVM classifier to differentiate\
    \ between a forward, backward, left and right\nfall and ADLs.\nWhile direction\
    \ aware fall detection is an important determination in terms of post\nfall intelligence,\
    \ fall detection with severity is necessary since it could help provide\nindications\
    \ to falls with immediate recovery or otherwise, as falls without immediate\n\
    recovery would be more detrimental to health than a fall with immediate recovery\
    \ as\nhas been suggested in [455]. In [456] the authors attempt to classify between\
    \ different\nfalls (direction: forward, backward, right, left and intensity: hard,\
    \ soft [fall on knees\nfirst, then on floor]) and five different ADLs using accelerometer\
    \ data. They collected\ndata for their experiments using a triaxial accelerometer\
    \ mounted on the chest. Fea-\nture extraction consists of first concatenating\
    \ acceleration values in each axis and\nthen using a Debauchies-2 level-3 wavelet\
    \ which are then sent to the classification\nstage. In the classification stage\
    \ five different classifiers, an ANN, a Radial Basis\nFunction (RBF) Network,\
    \ Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis (PPCA) and\nLinear Discriminant Analysis\
    \ (LDA) are used through a voting machine to determine\nfalls. A voting machine\
    \ (VM) involves multiple classifiers giving a vote towards any of\nthe multiple\
    \ classes and the sum of the vote is compared against a vote threshold to\ndetermine\
    \ the event that has taken place. In their work, the authors train individual\n\
    VMs for all the activity and fall types in their dataset by structuring them all\
    \ in par-\nallel and adding a comparator function at the end of the pipeline.\
    \ Moreover, a K-NN\nmulticlass classifier also feeds in to the comparator and\
    \ is trained while training of\nthe other classifier, it is provided the true\
    \ value of the activity being input to the\nclassification stage. The authors\
    \ show that their dataset works very well. A valuable\ninsight about their work\
    \ is the ensembling mechanism the authors have employed to\ndetermine fall directions.\
    \ In [457], Hussain et al. propose a fall detection system that\ncan first determine\
    \ falls and then the type of fall using data from the SisFall dataset.\nThey accomplish\
    \ this in a hierarchical setup where their system first considers fall\ndetection\
    \ as a binary problem, whether a fall has taken place or not, and if a fall\n\
    has been detected, it classifies between the various falls in the dataset. Their\
    \ system\nis designed to work with 10 second non-overlapping windows of accelerometer\
    \ and\ngyroscope signals. Data from each record is first low pass filtered before\
    \ two different\ntypes of feature sets, consisting of various time domain and\
    \ statistical features, are\ncomputed on the data. This is then followed by the\
    \ machine learning stage where\nthree different classifiers are tested, K-NN,\
    \ SVM and RFC. In the fall detection stage,\nstatistical features are computed\
    \ from ADL and fall signals and sent to the three clas-\nsifiers for the preliminary\
    \ binary classification. After a fall has been determined to\nhave happened, numerous\
    \ other statistical and time domain features are then com-\nputed on the data\
    \ before being sent to the next stage to determine the type of fall\n87\nactivity\
    \ taking place. In their experiments, the authors find that K-NN is most effec-\n\
    tive in differentiating between falls and ADLs where as RFC performs the best\
    \ when\nthe different fall activities need to be determined. This work highlights\
    \ the usefulness\nof a hierarchical approach towards non-binary fall detection.\
    \ One proposed method\nto perform combined activity recognition and fall detection\
    \ has been presented in\n[458]. In this, Li et. al. use multi-modal sensor fusion\
    \ and a Bi-LSTM classification\nnetwork to differentiate between five activities\
    \ of daily living and a fall. The sensors\nthey use are an inertial sensor placed\
    \ on the wrist, waist and ankle as well as a radar\nsensor. After pre-processing\
    \ both the inertial measurement and radar signals, various\nstatistical and moment\
    \ computations were performed to be used as features. These\nwere passed on to\
    \ the multilayer Bi-LSTM network after feature selection to deter-\nmine the output\
    \ class. One thing to note is that both both [458] and [421] consider\nfall as\
    \ a single category rather than considering falls as a detailed problem (direction\n\
    and/or severity) in itself. More recent work by We et al. [459] also considers\
    \ ac-\ntivity recognition and fall detection together. They use inertial measurement\
    \ sensor\ndata from two datasets, the MobiAct dataset [460] and the SmartFall\
    \ dataset [433].\nThe MobiAct dataset contains data from four falls and nine activities\
    \ of daily living\nwhereas the SmartFall dataset has non-fall and fall recordings.\
    \ In their experimenta-\ntion, they compare the performance of different machine\
    \ learning models and several\ndeep learning models, including a CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM\
    \ combination and Gated\nRecurrent Units. The machine learning models are trained\
    \ by computing time and\nfrequency domain features whereas the deep learning models\
    \ are trained using raw\nsensor data. They find that the GRU designed by them\
    \ consisting of two GRU units\nfollowed by a softmax classification layer is the\
    \ best performing model. Another deep\nlearning approach utilizing sequential\
    \ modeling for a fall detection system that also\nconsiders ADLs has been presented\
    \ by Seng¨ul et al. [461]. They collect their own\ndata for two types of falls\
    \ and four activities of daily living. After data augmentation\non the minority\
    \ classes, they use a Bi-LSTM for classification. Le et al. [462] propose\na non-binary\
    \ fall detection scheme utilizing a collection of time, frequency frequency\n\
    domain features in addition to the three Hjorth parameters of activity, mobility\
    \ and\ncomplexity. They use data from two datasets, the MobiAct dataset and the\
    \ UP-Fall\ndataset. They are able to achieve good results on both datasets using\
    \ all three feature\ntypes with a random forest classifier.\nThe use of attention\
    \ based models has also been finding increasing usage in fall\ndetection research.\
    \ Yhdego [463] use an attention model to perform binary fall de-\ntection. The\
    \ fall dataset is collected by them and after windowing, the authors use\ntime2vec\
    \ positional encoding on the data. Their network consists of three attention\n\
    blocks each consisting of multiheaded self attention followed by normalization\
    \ and a\nfully connected network. After the attention blocks follow two fully\
    \ connected layers.\nThey find that their network incorporating attention performs\
    \ well in differentiating\nbetween fall and non-fall samples. Another interesting\
    \ approach using attention is\npresented by Liu et al. [464]. Inorder to apply\
    \ attention on both temporal (step wise)\nand spatial (channel wise) aspects of\
    \ the signals, a gated scheme is suggested. A fully\nconnected layer is used to\
    \ determine the embeddings before positional information is\nadded to the data.\
    \ Positional encoding is only used for stepwise attention as channel\n88\nwise\
    \ positions are not useful. Self attention is performed in the step-wise part\
    \ of the\nnetwork and is carried out for the individual channels in a pairwise\
    \ fashion across all\ntime steps while the channel wise attention is performed\
    \ across the different channels\nacross all time-steps. The outputs of these two\
    \ units are combined through a fully\nconnected network which weighs them before\
    \ concatenation and classification.\n2.7\nFall detection Datasets\nThere are several\
    \ datasets published for use in algorithm development for fall detec-\ntion as\
    \ has been noted in [438]. Of these, for this case study, we choose two datasets,\n\
    these are the SisFall and the K-Fall dataset. The SisFall [417] dataset is chosen\
    \ as\nit contains recordings of elderly people which are most at risk from injury\
    \ due to\nfalls and therefore should provide a good representation of activities\
    \ of the elderly. It\nshould be noted that its one of the most used dataset for\
    \ fall detection purposes [438].\nThe other dataset used is the K-Fall [465] dataset.\
    \ It was released on the pattern of\nthe SisFall dataset and includes more activities\
    \ compared to SisFall. A summary of\nthe datasets is presented in the next section.\n\
    2.7.1\nSisFall Dataset\nThe SisFall dataset consists of accelerometer and gyroscope\
    \ recordings of 19 types of\nactivities of daily living and falls. Two accelerometers\
    \ and one gyroscope were placed\non the waist and used for making the measurements.\
    \ This location was chosen so as\nto ensure that all body movements while performing\
    \ the activities/falls were captured\nby the sensory system. Furthermore, the\
    \ data recordings involved 23 young people\nbetween the ages of 19-30 years old\
    \ and 15 elderly people between the ages of 60-75\nyears. The dataset contains\
    \ annotated sensor measurements of each of these ADLs\nand falls recorded as well\
    \ as video recordings of sample experiments. There are four\nmain types of falls\
    \ present, six of them are forward falls , three backward falls, four\nlateral\
    \ falls and two vertical falls. The types of falls performed were directed through\n\
    a survey taken from elderly people living independently as well as the ones living\n\
    in retirement homes and include scenarios of slipping and tripping. Moreover,\
    \ they\nare preceded by various types of ADLs being performed to make the recordings\
    \ as\nclose to a real world scenario as possible. The ADLs recorded were approved\
    \ by\nmedical personnel and were chosen so as to be similar to falls. The ADLs\
    \ include\nhigh mobility activities such as walking up/down stairs, jogging as\
    \ well as activities\nwhich can be confused with falls such as quickly sitting\
    \ in a chair, bending at the\nknee and stumble while walking etc. In total, there\
    \ were 2706 ADL recordings and\n1798 fall recordings. The SisFall data is utilized\
    \ in this study as it has been the\nthe dataset of choice for several previous\
    \ research approaches addressing the subject\nof fall detection [466, 467, 468,\
    \ 436, 469] and also because the volunteer makeup\nconsists of both men and women,\
    \ young adults and the elderly. The ADLs and Falls\nin the SisFall dataset have\
    \ been presented in Table 32 with a brief description of the\nactivities and falls\
    \ provided as well.\n89\nTable 32. ADL and Falls present in the SisFall dataset.\n\

    \ the SisFall dataset and contains 15\nfall types and 21 ADLs. The falls in K-Fall\
    \ are the same as those in SisFall. However,\nin the case of ADLs, they remove\
    \ the activity of sitting in and getting out of a car\nand combine some of the\
    \ activities while adding static activities of sitting on a chair,\nsitting on\
    \ a sofa and lying down.\nA total of 2729 ADL recordings and 2346 fall\nrecordings\
    \ are present in the dataset. This dataset is included in the study to test\n\
    cross-dataset fall detection. The details of the K-Fall dataset are presented\
    \ in Table\n33.\n2.8\nExperiments\nThis section discusses the experiments conducted\
    \ for the purposes of fall detection.\nFour experiments have been performed in\

    \ and severity. The second, third and\nfour experiments involved the inclusion\
    \ of activities of daily living classification in\naddition to the fall classes\
    \ considered in the first experiment. Moreover, experiment\nfour presents results\
    \ for a cross-dataset fall detection scenario.\n2.8.1\nFall Detection with Severity\
    \ and Direction consideration\nThis section describes the work on fall detection\
    \ considering severity and direction\nwhile only considering sensor data for falls.\
    \ The experiment has been performed as\ntwo tasks, one for determining falls considering\
    \ direction only and the other while\nconsidering both direction as well as severity.\n\
    2.8.1.1\nData Labeling\nTo perform fall detection that is direction and severity\
    \ aware, we only considered fall\n91\ndata from the SisFall dataset. As can be\
    \ seen from Table 32, most of the falls in\nthe dataset have been labelled as\
    \ either being in the forward, backward or lateral\ndirection.\nHowever, two of\
    \ the falls (F06 and F07) are not labeled in terms of\ndirection. For the considerations\
    \ of this research work, these were assigned the labels\nof Forward and Lateral\
    \ respectively using the videos of sample trials provided by the\ndataset authors.\n\
    Concerning fall severity, while the original labels from the dataset contained\
    \ in-\nformation for most falls for direction, the approach followed by Gibson\
    \ et al. [456]\nwas used to determine the severity of falls. According to the\
    \ practice followed by\nthem, all falls where in some support was used to soften\
    \ the impact of the fall were\nconsidered as soft falls whereas all falls where\
    \ the subject fell directly were classified\nas hard falls. This resulted in six\
    \ classes for fall types with hard and soft for ima-\npact and forward, backward\
    \ and lateral for direction. These are Forward Soft Falls\n(FSF), Forward Hard\
    \ Falls (FHF), Backward Soft Falls (BSF), Backward Hard Falls\n(BHF), Lateral\
    \ Soft Falls (LSF) and Lateral Hard Falls (LHF). These labels have\nbeen summarized\
    \ in Table 34.\nTable 34. Labeling used for Fall only classification for the SisFall\

    \ useful representations from the accelerometer\nand gyroscope sensor data. Lastly,\
    \ feature selection is carried out where we aim to\nreduce the number of features\
    \ used in the last stage that is classification.\nData Pre-processing\nRecordings\
    \ in the SisFall dataset vary in length between 12 and 100 seconds. The\ntrial\
    \ recordings for falls in the SisFall dataset consist of subjects performing various\n\
    activities before experiencing the fall. For a sound feature extraction process,\
    \ we\nextract equal duration segments of sensor readings from these trials that\
    \ represent\nthe fall taking place along with some part of the pre-fall activity\
    \ being performed.\nTo do this, for each record we first calculate the acceleration\
    \ magnitude (also called\nthe Signal Magnitude Vector (SMV) ) [430] for all sensor\
    \ value samples within a trial\nrecording. The SMV can be calculated as given\
    \ in Eq.1.\nSMVj =\nq\f\fAxj\n\f\f2 +\n\f\fAyj\n\f\f2 +\n\f\fAzj\n\f\f2\n(1)\n\
    93\nwhere SMVj represents the SMV value for a sample j in a given trial. The SMV\n\
    is calculated for all samples and the sample location for the SMV peak value is\n\
    determined within the trial. This is then used as the midpoint for extracting\
    \ a 2.5\nsecond segment from the trial. A segment length of 2.5 seconds was chosen\
    \ as it was\nvisually found to capture all the falls as well as some part of the\
    \ pre-fall activity being\nperformed. Using this scheme, segments were extracted\
    \ for all the fall trials in the\ndataset.\nThere are a total of 1798 fall samples\
    \ in the dataset, after the labeling used, there\nwere a total of 838 samples\
    \ for the forward fall category, 360 samples for the backward\nfall category and\
    \ 600 samples for the lateral fall category. Sample waveforms for the\nthree directions\
    \ of falls and three severity levels have been shown in Appendix A.\nFeature Extraction\n\
    Feature extraction is used to convert inputs in to more useful representations.\
    \ In\nthis experiment, we take cue from the work of [420, 470] who use various\
    \ time and\nfrequency domain features successfully for fall detection and recognition\
    \ of activities\nof daily living. Table 35 lists the features computed for each\
    \ extracted segment. Each\nof these features have been computed for every axis\
    \ of the considered accelerometer\nand gyroscope sensor measurements.\nTable 35.\

    \ Range\nFor a set of numerical values X ordered in arranged ascending order,\
    \ the ith percentile\nis defined as the number n below which i percent of the\
    \ total numbers of X fall below\nit. Therefore, the 25th Percentile (also called\
    \ the First Quartile) is the number in X\nbelow which exactly 25% of the values\
    \ fall. Similarly, 75th Percentile (also called\nthe Third Quartile) is the number\
    \ in X below which exactly 75% of the values fall.\nAnother important quantity\
    \ concerning percentiles is the Interquartile Range (IQ\n94\nRange), also called\
    \ the Midspread. The IQ Range is the difference between the 75th\nPercentiles\
    \ and the 25th Percentiles.\nDelta\nThe Delta represents the difference between\
    \ the minimum and maximum\nvalue of a set of numeric values X.\nKurtosis\nIt’s\
    \ a metric for how much a distribution’s tails diverge from that of\na normal\
    \ distribution. A large Kurtosis values indicates to larger extremity of the\n\
    divergences which can be thought of as outliers. The Kurtosis for a set of numerical\n\
    values X can be calculated as given in Eq. 2.\nKurtosis(X) =\n1\nNσ4\nN\nX\ni=1\n\
    (xi − µ)4\n(2)\nMean\nFor a set of values X, the arithmetic mean or the average\
    \ returns the\ncenter value of X. Mathematically it is given in Eq. 3.\nMean(X)\
    \ =\nPN\ni=1 xi\nN\n(3)\nMedian\nFor a set of values X, the median indicates to\
    \ the central tendency of\nX. It divides a set of values in to two equal parts.\
    \ For a set X of size N arranged in\nascending order, the median can be calculated\
    \ as in Eq. 4.\nMedian(X) = X[N + 1\n2\n]\n(4)\nMaximum\nFor a set of values X,\
    \ the maximum value represents the largest\nvalue in the set X.\nMinimum\nFor\
    \ a set of values X, the minimum value represents the smallest\nvalue in the set\
    \ X.\nSkewness\nThe Skewness measures the lack of symmetry in the probability\
    \ dis-\ntribution of data around its mean. It is calculated as in Eq. 5.\nSkewness(X)\
    \ =\n1\nNσ3\nN\nX\ni=1\n(xi − µ)3\n(5)\nStandard Deviation and Variance\nThe Standard\
    \ Deviation measures the\nvariation of a set of numerical values around its mean.\
    \ For a set of numerical values\nX, the standard deviation can be calculated as\
    \ in Eq. 6.\n95\nStd(X) =\nsPN\ni=1(xi − µ)2\nN\n(6)\nwhere µ is the Mean of X.\
    \ The Variance of X is the square of the Standard\nDeviation.\nPower Spectral\
    \ Density\nThe Power Spectral Density (PSD) is an indication\nto the power content\
    \ of a signal with respect to its frequency. It therefore helps to\nunderstand\
    \ the distribution of power in the signal for the different frequencies that\n\
    comprise it. The PSD has been computed using the Welch method [471]. Once the\n\
    PSD has been computed, the mean, median and Root Mean Squared (RMS) values\nof\
    \ the PSD are computed.\nPower Spectral Entropy\nThe Power Spectral Entropy (PSE)\
    \ is a measure of\nthe entropy in the power spectrum of a signal and indicates\
    \ to the complexity present\ntherein. It is computed as an entropy calculation\
    \ on the normalized PSD estimate.\nSimilar to the PSD computation, the Welch method\
    \ was used to estimate the PSD\nbefore PSE calculations were performed.\nThe aforementioned\
    \ quantities were computed for all windowed samples of the fall\nrecordings. In\
    \ total, this resulted in 96 features being computed for each segment.\nBefore\
    \ these features are passed on to the next stage, normalization was performed\n\
    feature wise for each sensor.\nFeature Selection\nFeature selection is an important\
    \ step in the machine learning pipeline. It not only\nhelps to reduce the feature\
    \ set size used in an application which helps computationally\nbut may also result\
    \ in performance improvement as observed by [472]. Feature se-\nlection is performed\
    \ using Random Forest Recursive Feature Elimination (RF-RFE)\n[473] which involves\
    \ determining the importance of features by eliminating features\niteratively\
    \ and looking at classifier performance. It starts by developing a model us-\n\
    ing all the available features within the dataset, in every iteration, the feature\
    \ that\nhas the ’least importance/contribution’ is discarded and a new model is\
    \ fitted with\nthe remaining features. This process is carried out until a pre-decided\
    \ number of\nfeatures remain. Since in this work, our goal is to reduce the number\
    \ of features\nfrom the original count, we perform manual tests by establishing\
    \ a baseline for the\nperformance of our models. The baseline is formed by using\
    \ all features for each\nof our classification tasks and using the highest weighted\
    \ F1-score achieved as the\nperformance goal cut-off for the reduction of features.\
    \ This step will ensure that we\natleast get the same performance as the original\
    \ feature set.\nClassification\nClassification refers to the usage of a classification\
    \ algorithm, also called a classifier\n96\nto determine the output ’label’ or\
    \ category given a set of input values called features.\nIn the current setting,\
    \ the classification problem is a supervised one wherein the\nclassifier is provided\
    \ inputs and their corresponding output labels which allow it\nto learn the relationship\
    \ between the input and the output.\nOnce this mapping\nhas been sufficiently\
    \ learned (a process called training) the trained classifier can\nbe provided\
    \ unlabeled inputs for it to predict an output label value or class. The\nefficacy\
    \ of the classifier in predicting the correct output is measured through various\n\
    metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score etc. This experiment consists\
    \ of\ntwo classification experiments being performed, one is the direction only\
    \ experiment\nwhere the classifiers used are trained to distinguish between the\
    \ three direction of falls\ngiven the input feature set and another experiment\
    \ where the classifiers are trained\nto determine fall directions and severity\
    \ together.\nFour different classifiers were tested to perform these tasks, these\
    \ are the Random\nForest Classifier, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees and\
    \ Extreme Gradient\nBoost (XGBoost). All of the classifiers were trained using\
    \ five fold cross validation\nwith a stratified split and a parameter search being\
    \ performed for tuning purposes.\nSupport Vector Machines\nSupport Vector Machine\
    \ is a supervised learning\nalgorithm that, in its simplest form tries to fit\
    \ a line in between data samples of two\ndifferent classes to separate them. The\
    \ criteria used by the SVM to fit this line is\nthe maximization of the distance\
    \ between the line and the (data) points closest to it.\nThis concept of using\
    \ a line to separate two dimensional data can be extended to two\ndimensional\
    \ planes being used for separating three-dimensional data and hyperplanes\nfor\
    \ higher dimensional data. SVMs are quite flexible in that they can not only be\
    \ used\nto work with linearly separable data but also with data that is not linearly\
    \ separable.\nThis is achieved using Kernel functions which map the nonlinearly\
    \ distributed data\nin to a higher dimensional space to make it linearly separable\
    \ (as much as possible).\nThere are several kernel functions available to be used\
    \ for this purpose such as the\nhyperbolic tangent, radial basis, sigmoid, polynomial\
    \ etc. Optimizing the SVM re-\nquires the tuning of the cost parameter C, a small\
    \ value of C indicates an underfit\nwhereas a very large value of C indicates\
    \ an overfit.\nEven though, the current experiment considers using SVMs for a\
    \ classification\ntaks, it should also be mentioned that SVM’s are not limited\
    \ to application towards\nclassification problems and they have also been used\
    \ for regression applications too.\nDecision Tree\nDecision Trees are one of the\
    \ most widely used classification\nalgorithms due to their interpretability. The\
    \ aim of the algorithm is to come up with\nas simple a solution as possible while\
    \ successively dividing the data in to simpler and\nsimpler classification tasks\
    \ based on the values of the features. For a classification\nproblem, given a\
    \ set of input features of the training set, decision trees use the values\nof\
    \ the features to divide or split the dataset in to more simpler sub problems.\
    \ The\naim being to get the largest information gain when choosing the feature/s\
    \ for the\nsplit. Each split point in a decision tree is called a node and each\
    \ split is called a\nbranch. Branches from a given node represent all the possible\
    \ outcomes from that\n97\nnode and may contain subsequent decision nodes as well\
    \ which are called child nodes.\nEach branch ends at a node called the leaf node\
    \ where data points are assigned a\nclass label.\nDepending on the number of input\
    \ features and the output classes, decision trees\ncan be built to classify the\
    \ dataset in a ’complete’ manner due to its iterative parti-\ntioning scheme.\
    \ However, this is undesirable since that would lead to overfitting of the\nmodel\
    \ and also because such trees would lead to a complicated model, which is not\n\
    desirable since that would impact interpretability. The process of removing branches\n\
    and replacing them by leaf nodes is called pruning. Pruning aims to increase the\n\
    models generalizations capabilities and increase robustness. Two paramters which\n\
    are used for this purpose are tree depth limits the number of child nodes present\
    \ in\nevery branch and the number of features used at each split.\nRandom Forest\
    \ Classifier\nRandom forest is a bagging approach towards de-\ncision trees where\
    \ instead of deciding on where to split for each node, for each tree\na random\
    \ subset of features is used and the feature/threshold to split the data is\n\
    determined within that subset of features to separate the data in the best manner\n\
    possible. This process is repeated multiple times which results in various trees\
    \ pro-\nducing possibly different predictions. The predictions from each tree\
    \ are combined\nto form an ensemble either through majority voting or by averaging.\
    \ The imple-\nmentation of Random Forests used in this work uses the averaging\
    \ approach. There\nare several parameters that are important in the tuning of\
    \ Random Forests are the\nnumber of trees created before the averaging process\
    \ starts, the number of levels in\neach tree and more.\nExtreme Gradient Boost\n\
    Extreme Gradient Boost is another ensemble based\ntree algorithm, however compared\
    \ to the RFC, XGBoost uses boosting instead of\nbagging. In boosting, the input\
    \ samples are uniformly weighted and first a ’weak’\nlearner (classifier) is created\
    \ for a given task that doesnt perform well but is sufficient\nin the sense that\
    \ it is better than random guessing. In subsequent iterations of the\nlearner,\
    \ input samples which werent classified correctly by the learner are reweighted\n\
    by assigning larger weights to them while the weights for correctly classified\
    \ inputs\nis reduced. This step is repeated for a number of times with different\
    \ weak learners\nbeing trained.\nThe decision of the weak learners are combined\
    \ through majority\nvoting to determine the output class. Parameters used to tune\
    \ XGBoost are the\nmaximum depth allowed in each tree, the weight settings etc.\n\
    2.8.1.3\nResults\nAs mentioned previously, two separate experiments were conducted,\
    \ first was to dif-\nferentiate between fall directions only and the other to\
    \ differentiate between fall\ndirection as well as severity. The results from\
    \ those experiments are presented here.\nThe metrics considered for judging model\
    \ quality is the F1-score. The F1-score is the\nharmonic mean of the precision\
    \ and recall and is given as in Eq. 7.\n98\nF1 Score = 2 ∗ (Precision ∗ Recall)\n\
    Precision + Recall\n(7)\nwhere Precision is the ratio of the True positive samples\
    \ divided by the sum of the\nTrue positive and False positive samples as given\
    \ in Eq. 8. It is also called positive\npredictive value as it indicates to the\
    \ capability of the classifier to identify correctly\nthe samples of a given class.\n\
    Precision =\nTrue Positive\nTrue Positive + False Positive\n(8)\nand recall indicates\
    \ to the models capability to identify the samples of a given\nclass over the\
    \ whole dataset. It is also called the sensitivity and is the ratio of the\nTrue\
    \ positives to the sum of the True positives and False Negatives as shown in Eq.\n\
    9.\nRecall =\nTrue Positive\nTrue Positive + False Negative\n(9)\nWe report on\
    \ the F1-scores for each class when discussing classification perfor-\nmance and\
    \ deciding on the best classifier. Moreover, for the best classifier identified\n\
    the precision and recall have also been provided.\nFall direction\nIn this experiment,\
    \ fall segments labeled for direction only were used as input to the\nclassifiers.\
    \ To establish a baseline to be used as a reference in the feature selection\n\
    process, all computed features (96 in total) were passed to the four classifiers.\
    \ The\nbest performing model was found to be the SVM with a weighted F1-score\
    \ of 90.4%.\nFeature selection was then performed keeping in view baseline performance\
    \ of the\nSVM classifier so as to retain or improve this performance baseline\
    \ when choosing a\ngiven number of ’top’ features. Following this rule, feature\
    \ selection resulted in 90\nfeatures. The results are given in Table 36. It can\
    \ be observed from the table that\nthe SVM has outperformed the other algorithms\
    \ in detecting forward and lateral falls\nwhereas it achieves a slightly lower\
    \ F1-score for the backward fall class. Overall the\nSVM has shown to be better\
    \ at discriminating falls with direction.\nTable 36. Fall F1-scores (Fall direction\

    \ experiment, fall segments from the dataset were labeled for direction and\n\
    severity based on the labeling shown in Table 34 and passed to each of the classifiers\n\
    after feature selection. Like before, to establish a baseline, all computed features\
    \ (96\nin total) were passed to the four classifiers. The best weighted F1-score\
    \ of 78.44% was\nachieved by the SVM classifier. We used this value as the baseline\
    \ we aim to achieve\nafter feature selection. With this condition the number of\
    \ features were reduced to\n93. The performance achieved for each of the four\
    \ tested classifers is summarized in\nTable 37. It can be observed that the SVM\
    \ is the best performing classifier for all fall\ntypes bar FHF where the random\
    \ forest classifer achieves a slightly higher F1-score.\nThe highest F1-score\
    \ overall is achieved for the class BSF where as the lowest has\nbeen achieved\
    \ for LHF. When looking at fall direction, falls in the forward direction\ncan\
    \ be seen to be the hardest to identify followed by lateral falls. No such pattern\n\
    can be noted for soft/hard falls.\nTable 37. Fall F1-scores (Fall severity and\

    Discussion\nTo summarize the results from both experiments, we present the individual\
    \ F1-\nscores, Precision and Recall for the best performing classifier in each\
    \ case. These\nhave been presented in Table 38 and Table 39.\nTable 38. Best Results:\

    92.46\nIn both cases the best performing classifier was the SVM. This is inline\
    \ with\nthe findings of other research work as found from the literature review\
    \ [424, 429].\nA surprising outcome during this work was the unsatisfactory performance\
    \ of tree\nbased algorithms contrary to [420], we attribute this to the difference\
    \ in the data\nsegmentation scheme and also the fact that we follow different\
    \ labelling for the data\n100\nTable 39. Best Results: Fall direction and Severity\n\

    in terms of a direction and severity aware system. Moreover, the final weighted\
    \ F1-\nscores for the fall direction experiment was 92% and for the fall direction\
    \ and severity\nwas 79.53% which resulted in an improvement of just above 1% in\
    \ both cases with a\nsmall reduction in the number of features utilized, 90 and\
    \ 93 respectively compared to\n96 in the original feature set. Commenting on the\
    \ direction, the hardest to predict fall\nwas in the lateral direction and the\
    \ classifier incorrectly predicted forward falls and\nlateral falls in both the\
    \ scenarios tested. This highlights the difficulty in capturing\nthe difference\
    \ between these two fall directions using the features considered.\n2.8.2\nFall\
    \ Detection with Severity and Direction along with ADL consid-\neration using\
    \ Wavelet Pooling and K-NN\nThis section provides a framework for a fall and activity\
    \ recognition system. It aims\nto determine an appropriate sensor modality to\
    \ use and the window size to be used\nfor the task. The framework does this as\
    \ a problem of differentiating between various\nactivities of daily living as\
    \ well as various types of falls with regard to fall datection\nbeing direction\
    \ and severity aware. To do this, data from the SisFall dataset is used\nand after\
    \ suitable pre-processing and feature extraction, machine learning algorithms\n\
    are utilized to differentiate between different activities of daily living and\
    \ falls\n2.8.2.1\nData Labeling\nSince we aim to perform activity recognition\
    \ and fall detection with direction and\nseverity, the ADL labeling of the original\
    \ dataset has been modified. This labeling\nhas been shown in Table 40. As can\
    \ be observed from Table 40, the activities Walking\n(W), Jogging (J), Sitting\
    \ (S) and Standing (SB) have been considered for this work\nwhich are typical\
    \ activities in ADL detection problems. Each of these labels includes\ndata from\
    \ multiple original activities, for e.g. activities with original labels of walking\n\
    upstairs and downstairs, walking slowly and walking quickly have been considered\
    \ as\nwalking in this work. A similar scheme has been used for the other three\
    \ activity\nlabels as well. Some of the activities such as being on one’s back\
    \ change to lateral\nposition, wait a moment, and change to one’s back (D14),\
    \ getting in and out of the\ncar (D17), stumble while walking (D18), and gently\
    \ jumping without falling while\ntrying to reach a high object (D19) have not\
    \ been considered. The reason for this\nis that they have very few samples to\
    \ be considered as standalone activities (only\none type of sub-activity and also\
    \ because most of these are not considered in typical\n101\nADL detection scenarios).\
    \ For falls, the labeling same as that for the direction and\nseverity experiment\
    \ has been retained.\nTable 40. ADL Labels used for SisFall Recordings.\nActivity\

    \ work with individual parts being elab-\norated upon in the proceeding subsections.\
    \ As can be seen, the first stage consists of\ndata preprocessing, followed by\
    \ feature extraction and then evaluation or classifica-\ntion.\nData Preprocessing\n\
    Data preprocessing for this experiment was performed in a similar manner to section\n\
    2.8.1 for most recordings. The SMV was computed for the complete recording and\n\
    windowed segments of a fixed duration were extracted.\nWindowed segments are\n\
    extracted in this manner from all considered activities in the SisFall dataset\
    \ except\nthe activities of D01, D02, D03 and D04 which consist of a single trial\
    \ per subject of\nduration 100s. In such cases, continuous windowed segments of\
    \ duration n seconds\nare extracted from the recordings. It is also pertinent\
    \ to mention here that since\nboth accelerometers are placed at the same position,\
    \ we only consider one of the\naccelerometers along with the gyroscope readings\
    \ present in the recorded trials. To\ndetermine the value of n as well as the\
    \ appropriate sensor modality to use for the\nfinal system, experiments were performed\
    \ on the developed framework and the results\nhave been discussed in subsequent\
    \ sections.\nFeature extraction\nIn this experiment, feature extraction consists\

    \ wavelet decomposition and then performing pooling,\nthe inspiration for this\
    \ type of feature extraction came from the work of [475].\n103\nWavelet Decomposition\n\
    Wavelets can be used for a variety of applications\nsuch as spectral analysis\
    \ where they are used to analye a signal in the time-frequency\ndomain, denoising,\
    \ compression and signal enhancement. A wavelet is a function of\nfinite duration\
    \ and has an average value of zero, an example of a mexican hat wavelet\nis shown\
    \ in Figure. 19. The width of the wavelet is called its scale and it is analogous\n\
    to frequency in an inverse manner. A large value of the scale (wider window) allows\n\
    for capturing of low frequency components of the signal whereas a small scale\
    \ value\ncaptures low frequency components.\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n0.2\n0.1\n\

    \ (Mexican Hat).\nWavelets are convolved with an input signal to produce two sets\
    \ of coefficients.\nThese are called the detail and approximation coefficients.\
    \ The detail component\nrepresents the high frequency component captured by the\
    \ wavelet whereas the ap-\nproximation component represents the low frequency\
    \ part. Since the wavelet has\nonly been convolved once with the signal, these\
    \ coefficients are said to be level 1\ncoefficients. At each level, resulting\
    \ coefficients are downsampled by half to result in\na lower resolution signal.\
    \ Subsequent approximation components can be convolved\nwith the wavelet to result\
    \ in approximation and detail components for the next level\nthus forming what\
    \ is called a wavelet decomposition tree.\nTo perform wavelet decomposition, in\
    \ this experiment, we make use of the Haar\nwavelet [476] shown in Figure. 20.\
    \ Level 4 haar wavelets were computed for each of\nthe extracted segments of the\
    \ signals.\nSpatial Pooling\nThe results from the decomposition provide a large\
    \ number\nof features which would pose a problem for use in the proceeding classification\
    \ stage.\nIn order to reduce the feature dimension size, Spatial Pyramid Pooling\
    \ [477] was\nused. Spatial Pyramid Pooling is an adaptive pooling method which\
    \ was developed\nto address the issue of fluctuating input sizes in CNNs for image-based\
    \ applications,\nand it entails converting varying-size convolutional feature\
    \ maps into fixed-length\nsummarizations. These summarizations, having uniform\
    \ length can then be passed\non to the fully connected parts of the CNN where\
    \ a fixed length input is necessary.\n104\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n\

    Figure 20. Haar Wavelet.\nGiven a pooling size pxp, adaptive pooling works by\
    \ dividing the input in to pxp pieces\nwhile computing the size of each piece\
    \ automatically and performing any necessary\npadding. Once these pieces are created,\
    \ a pooling operation is typically performed\n(max pooling or average pooling\
    \ for e.g.) on each of these pieces to summarize the\ninput into an output of\
    \ fixed size pxp. This results in a fixed output length for any\nsize of the input.\
    \ In this experiment, 4-2-1 1D Spatial Pyramid pooling was used\non the detail\
    \ and approximation coefficients of the wavelet decomposition of activity\nand\
    \ fall data. This process has been shown in Figure 21. Each coefficient set was\n\
    divided in to four and two parts and then max pooling was used to determine the\n\
    maximum value in these divided parts and the coefficient set as a whole.\nThese\n\
    maximum values were then concatenated together to form the seven valued output\n\
    from that coefficient set. Furthermore, the results for each coefficient set within\
    \ each\naxis were also concatenated to form the feature vector for a sensor axis\
    \ measurement.\nThis operation was performed for each axis of accelerometer and\
    \ groscope sensor\ndata with the final feature vector of 210 values consisting\
    \ of the concatenations of\nthe individual vectors for each axis. It is hypothesized\
    \ that this way local as well as\nglobal information at each level of the wavelet\
    \ coefficients can be captured. For the\nwavelet decomposition, tests were performed\
    \ with level values of 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 and\nit was determined that level-4 produced\
    \ the best results.\nClassification\nA hierarchical classification approach is\
    \ employed to discriminate between the vari-\nous activities and falls considered\
    \ from the SisFall dataset. Hierarchical classification\ninvolves the division\
    \ of a complex taxonomic classification problem in to a set of\nsubsets that are\
    \ potentially easier to differentiate as the task becomes more localized.\nHierarchical\
    \ classifiers have been used in multiple different applications [478] where\n\
    they have been found to improve upon the performance of many flat classification\n\
    schemes. The classification framework used in this work combines hierarchical\
    \ clas-\nsification with a vote based system. The classification problem is divided\
    \ into three\nparts, each with its own classifier to indicate to the subclass\
    \ of the output. The clas-\n105\nMaxpooling Size = 4\nMaxpooling Size = 2\nMaxpooling\

    \ 1-D Spatial Pyramid Pooling.\nsifier in part one consists of differentiating\
    \ whether a given recording is a fall or one\nof the four considered ADLs. In\
    \ order to train this stage, the activities of Standing,\nWalking, Sitting and\
    \ Jogging along with all falls combined in to one class are passed\nto the classifier.\
    \ This dilutes the original ten-class problems in to a five-class sub\nproblem.\
    \ The output of this stage is the determination of whether a given recording\n\
    is either one of the four ADLs (Standing, Walking, Sitting or Jogging) or a fall.\
    \ If a\nrecording has been detected to be a fall, it is sent to the second and\
    \ third stages.\nThe second and third stages work in parallel on samples detected\
    \ as falls from\n106\nthe first stage in the form of a voting machine. These two\
    \ stages vote individually\non the direction and severity of the detected fall\
    \ samples. In order to train them,\nfall samples were relabeled to represent direction\
    \ and severity only and are fed to the\nclassifiers. For the direction, the classification\
    \ problem is formulated as a three-class\nproblem of determining fall directions\
    \ as being Forward, Backward or Lateral. For\nthe severity classifier, the classification\
    \ problem is formulated as a two-class problem\nof a fall being either Soft or\
    \ Hard. After a signal has passed through all necessary\nstages, the outputs of\
    \ the individual stages are combined to indicate to the activity\nor type of fall\
    \ being fed at the input.\nFour classifiers were tested for each part of the hierarchical\
    \ scheme, the classifiers\nconsidered were K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector\
    \ Machines, Random Forests\nand eXtreme Gradient Boosting. Parameter tuning was\
    \ performed using gradient\nsearch for each classifier over a range of values\
    \ for each parameter.\nK-Nearest Neighbor\nCompared to the SVM which attempts\
    \ to create a deci-\nsion boundary between classes on a global level, the K-NN\
    \ algorithm operates locally.\nStarting from a data point, the 1 Nearest Neigbhor\
    \ algorithm will assign each new\nsample the class of its neighbor. However, using\
    \ a single neighborhood point to assign\nnew classes may lead to erroneous classes\
    \ being assigned. Therefore, typically mul-\ntiple neighboring points are used\
    \ to determine the label for a given point. In K-NN,\n’K’ represents the number\
    \ of points used in the neighborhood to assign labels to data\nsamples. Each considered\
    \ sample is assigned the majority label within a neighbor-\nhood of K points around\
    \ it. In this manner, the K-NN algorithm is successively able\nto create a decision\
    \ boundary separating the data in to the different output classes.\n2.8.2.3\n\
    Results\nThree experiments were performed in this section. The first was to choose\
    \ the best\nclassifier to use, once that was determined. experiments were conducted\
    \ to determine\nthe observation window size and different combination of sensor\
    \ modalities. We used\nthe weighted F1-score as our training metric due to the\
    \ imbalance in the samples\nof the different classes in the data. Moreover, for\
    \ evaluation purposes, we report on\nthe individual F1-scores for each output\
    \ class and provide discussions as necessary.\nFurthermore, for the best performing\
    \ results, the Precision and Recall and Specificity\nwere also specified. Specificity\
    \ can be calculated as given in Eq. 10. It is also called\nthe True Negative Rate\
    \ and indicates to a classifiers capability to correctly detect\nsamples which\
    \ don’t belong to a given class. These metrics have been computed on\na one versus\
    \ all basis.\nSpecificity =\nTrue Negative\nTrue Negative + False Positive\n(10)\n\
    The data after the feature extraction stage was split in to a train/test partition\n\
    based on a 75/25 ratio with a parameter grid being searched through to obtain\n\
    107\ntuning parameters for maximizing the weighted F1-score while using five-fold\
    \ cross\nvalidation.\nClassifier Selection\nThis test was conducted to determine\
    \ the best classifier to use for the proceeding\nexperiments of observation window\
    \ selection and sensor modality selection. Here,\nexperiments were performed for\
    \ the considered window durations for each activity\nand the classifier which\
    \ provided the best performance overall was chosen. The mean\nF1-scores for each\
    \ output class for each classifier are shown in Figure 22. It can be\nobserved\
    \ that in general K-NN and SVM perform better compared to the ensemble\nmodels,\
    \ the RFC and XGBoost. However, since the K-NN slightly outperforms the\nSVM in\
    \ eight of the ten considered classes, we choose K-NN as the classifier for this\n\
    framework.\nBHF\nBSF\nFHF\nFSF\nJ\nLHF\nLSF\nS\nSB\nW\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n\

    \ Window Duration\nAn important consideration in working with activity recognition\
    \ systems is to de-\ntermine the appropriate observation window size for the analysis\
    \ of sensor signals\nto accomplish the ADL recognition/fall detection task. The\
    \ size of the observation\nwindow is important as a smaller observation window\
    \ increases the response time of\nthe activity recognition/fall detection system\
    \ and it can also impact the time taken\nin the computation of features. In order\
    \ to find the best observation window size,\nwe perform experiments using five\
    \ values, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 seconds. The classification\nresults in terms of the\
    \ F1-score are presented in Table 41. For each case, samples\nof duration equal\
    \ to half of the observation window were extracted around the peak\nvalue of the\
    \ SMV. From the table, it can be observed that an observation window\n108\nof\
    \ size 3 seconds produces the best results for six out of the ten output classes.\
    \ It\nonly produces poorer results for the classes BHF, BSF and S, SB where window\
    \ sizes\nof 2 seconds, 6 seconds and 4 seconds respectively perform better than\
    \ the 3 second\nwindowing case. Upon further investigation of this phenomenon\
    \ using the result of\nother classifiers, it was observed that the activities\
    \ of (BHF and BHF) were best rec-\nognized by all the classifiers with a window\
    \ size of 2 seconds (for the case of K-NN,\nthere is a small difference between\
    \ the 2 second and 6 second case), for the other two\nactivities of S and SB too\
    \ the F1-score was obtained for the 4 second duration (for\nthe activity S, the\
    \ difference in performance over windows larger than 4 seconds is\nvery small).\
    \ This could be attributed to the feature aggregation process in the max\npooling\
    \ operation in the different spatial segments.\nTable 41. Performance for different\

    Sensor Modality\nThe second experiment in designing the proposed system is the\
    \ determination of\nthe best sensor modality to use.\nUsing a single sensor would\
    \ result in less data,\nfaster processing and reduced hardware costs compared\
    \ to the multisensor approach\ncombining accelerometer and gyroscope. To do this,\
    \ the classification framework was\ntested with 3 second windowed segments of\
    \ the combined acceleromter and gyroscope\ndata as well as data of the accelerometer\
    \ and gyroscope sensors individually. The\nresults of this experiment are presented\
    \ in Table 42. It can be observed that using\na combination of both accelerometer\
    \ and gyroscope data together produces the best\nresults for eight of the ten\
    \ output classes. An accelerometer-only system produces\nbetter results for the\
    \ detection of activity SB and the fall FHF. The outcome of this\nexperiment agrees\
    \ with previous work for fall detection by Waheed et. al. [436] on\nthe SisFall\
    \ dataset.\n2.8.2.4\nDiscussion\nTable 43 reports on the best results obtained\

    \ 43, the best recognized ADLs are W and J whereas the best rec-\nognized fall\
    \ is BSF. The worst performing class in ADLs is SB whereas the worst\nperforming\
    \ fall is LHF. Upon further inspection of the cause of the bad performance\nwith\
    \ LHF, looking at the confusion matrix, it was observed that LHF was most\ncommonly\
    \ confused with FSF which resulted in a reduction of the classification per-\n\
    formance for this class. On the other hand, in the case of FSF (the second worse\n\
    performing class), looking at the confusion matrix, it was observed that FSF was\n\
    confused with LSF and FHF. Furthermore, the specificity values indicate that there\n\
    has been very little mis-identification for each of the classes. When talking\
    \ about\nthe activity S, it was observed that samples from this activity were\
    \ confused with\nthe activity W which resulted in the sub-par performance of the\
    \ classifier for its\nrecognition.\n110\n2.8.3\nFall Detection with Severity and\
    \ Direction along with ADL consid-\neration using CNN-XGBoost\nThis section presents\
    \ a scheme for performing fall detection considering fall direction\nand severity\
    \ as well as activity recognition. Inertial sensor data taken from the SisFall\n\
    dataset is used to develop the methodology. Data pre-processing is first carried\
    \ out\nin terms of windowing and relabeling. Then, data augmentation is carried\
    \ out for\nclasses which do not have a sufficient number of samples. Lastly, feature\
    \ extraction is\nperformed along with classification. This work considers fall\
    \ and activity recognition\nas a holistic problem, in that different types of\
    \ falls and activities are considered\nthereby producing a more ’complete’ recognition\
    \ system for use in cyber-physical\nsystems. Moreover, towards this end, a CNN-XGBoost\
    \ combination is proposed.\n2.8.3.1\nMethodology\nThe proposed scheme follows\
    \ a typical deep learning so-\nlution framework. First, inertial sensor data from\
    \ the IMU sensors contained within\nthe SisFall dataset is pre-processed to extract\
    \ windowed segments, then data aug-\nmentation is performed for minority classes,\
    \ followed by feature extraction and then\nclassification. This has been illustrated\
    \ in Figure 23 and a discussion is provided for\neach of the steps in the proceeding\
    \ sections.\nData Pre-processing\nBefore the IMU sensor recordings can be used\
    \ for ADL and fall detection, raw sensor\nmeasurements need to be suitably processed.\
    \ In this experiment, data pre-processing\nconsists of two steps, the first is\
    \ the extraction of uniform sized windows as was\nperformed in the previous section\
    \ from the IMU recordings and the next is data\naugmentation. Since windowing\
    \ of the signals has already been discussed previously,\nonly data augmentation\
    \ is discussed here.\nData Augmentation\nThe use of deep learning methods require\
    \ a suitable\namount of data to be present for them to learn the data pattern\
    \ sufficiently well. Un-\nfortunately, due to the nature of the problem considered,\
    \ the relabeled data from the\nSisFall dataset contains a reduced amount of data\
    \ for some of the classes, especially\nfall classes and also for the ADL of Standing.\
    \ In order to alleviate this shortcom-\ning, data augmentation was employed to\
    \ increase the number of samples from these\nclasses. Three augmentations were\
    \ performed for each of the extracted recordings\nfor the classes SB, FHF, FSF,\
    \ BHF, BSF, LHFand LSF. These were the addition of\nnoise, scaling and resampling\
    \ after inerpolation [439]. For augmentation with noise,\nwhite gaussian noise\
    \ was added to the extracted windows of the considered classes.\nThe noise was\
    \ generated using a standard deviation equal to 0.01. The addition of\nthe noise\
    \ simulates measurement noise during recording which might be encountered\nwhen\
    \ IMU based fall detection systems are employed. For scale based augmentation,\n\
    the original extracted window was multiplied by a random number from the uniform\n\
    distribution between 0.8 and 1.2 thereby scaling it between 80% and 120% of its\
    \ orig-\ninal form. By doing so, changes in amplitude over the same type of activity/fall\
    \ are\nincorporated. This could indicate to a change in fixation (loosening etc)\
    \ of the sensing\n111\nPeak SMV Detection\nWindowing\nCNN\nXGBoost Classifier\n\

    \ to incorporate sampling inconsistencies, the windows are first upsam-\npled\
    \ and then downsampled. This was done by a scale of ten. With this strategy,\n\
    each from original window were produced three additional samples. An illustration\n\
    for the results of the augmentation process for an X-axis accelerometer measurement\n\
    for a lateral fall has been shown in Figure 24.\nFeature extraction\nThe aim of\
    \ feature extraction for a classification problem is to produce a representa-\n\
    tion of the input that can be better used to indicate to the output class. In\
    \ this regard,\nresearch in the area of fall detection with inertial sensors has\
    \ made use of different\ntypes of hand crafted features such as statistical, time\
    \ and frequency domain as well\nas wavelet transforms [479, 480, 481, 482]. Convolutional\
    \ Neural Networks (CNNs\nor Covnets) are a set of neural networks developed following\
    \ the visual cortex within\nthe brain [483]. CNNs perform operations on inputs\
    \ by introducing convolutions of\n112\nFigure 24.\nIllustration of data augmentation.\n\
    (X component of Accelerometer,\nLateral Fall)\nseveral filters with learnable\
    \ weights to gauge the importance of each datapoint in\nthe input. These layers\
    \ containing the filters and to which the input is provided are\ncalled convolutional\
    \ layers. Through these learnable weights, CNNs are able to cap-\nture temporal\
    \ and spatial dependencies of the input. Moreover, using the same filters\nfor\
    \ different inputs reduces the number of parameters as the weights are reused.\
    \ This\nallows CNNs to develop a deeper understanding of the provided input compared\
    \ to\ntypical multilayer perceptron models. CNNs have revolutionized the field\
    \ of computer\nvision where they have been used for a variety of tasks such as\
    \ classification, object\ndetection, segmentation and object counting [484, 485]\
    \ and they have also successfully\nbeen used for applications within the speech\
    \ and other time series signal application\ndomain [486, 487, 488]. In this experiment,\
    \ rather than using hand crafted features\n113\nas in the previous experiments,\
    \ a CNN has been used to perform feature extraction\nin order to take advantage\
    \ of the spatial and temporal dependency capturing capa-\nbilities of CNNs. CNNs\
    \ are usually comprised of several convolutional (Conv) layers.\nWithin a multilayer\
    \ CNN, the earlier Conv layers capture low level features from the\ninput with\
    \ more complex features being computed by the successive layers. Also,\nCNNs may\
    \ employ pooling layers between convolutional layers so as to reduce the\nsize\

    XGB classification\nStage\nFigure 25. CNN Network for feature extraction and XGBoost\
    \ classification stage.\nAs seen from the figure, the network consists of four\
    \ Conv layers of 64 filters\neach.\nThese layers have filters of size 3x1 and\
    \ are used to extract features from\nraw inertial sensor measurements. Each Conv\
    \ layer is followed by a Relu activation\nfunction which applies a non-linearity\
    \ to the output of the Conv layers. To condense\nthe output of the first three\
    \ Conv layers, a pooling layer is utilized. Instead of max\npooling, average pooling\
    \ is used in this network. Max pooling picks out the largest\nvalue of the patch\
    \ of data being observed currently, in contrast, average pooling uses\nthe average\
    \ of the data being observed. Average pooling has been successfully used in\n\
    114\nplace of max pooling in a variety of scenarios [489, 490]. Normalization\
    \ is performed\nusing a batch normalization layer for each Conv layer. The output\
    \ of the last Conv\nlayer are feature maps derived from the input raw inertial\
    \ sensor measurements from\nboth the accelerometer and the gyroscope.\nClassification\n\
    Classification is carried out by using a eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) clas-\n\
    sifier. The output from the CNN is first flattened and then provided as an input\
    \ to\nthe XGBoost stage. The parameters of the XGBoost classifier are tuned through\
    \ a\nparameter search over a range of values. We make use of an XGBoost classifier\
    \ due\nto its suitability for a large dimensional input which results from the\
    \ flattened CNN\noutput.\n2.8.3.2\nResults\nIn order to use the proposed CNN for\
    \ feature extraction, it must first be trained\naccordingly. In order to train\
    \ the network, a fully connected layer with a softmax\noutput was added as the\
    \ final stage to serve as the intermediate temporary output\ndeterminant stage.\
    \ The windowed data from the SisFall dataset was divided in to\nthree sets, train,\
    \ validation and test in a stratified manner. A learning rate of 0.01\nwas used\
    \ for the network with a batch size of 20 and the stochastic gradient descent\n\
    was used as the optimizer. Moreover, the metric chosen was the average of the\
    \ recall\nscores of all classes together, also called as the unweighted average\
    \ recall (UAR).\nThe recall is considered as one wants the system correctly classify\
    \ as many positive\nsamples for every class as possible. The final network was\
    \ determined using early\nstopping. The unweighted average recall (UAR) can be\
    \ computed as,\nUAR =\nk\nX\nn=0\n\x10\nTPn\nTPn+FNn\n\x11\nk\n(11)\nwhere k stands\
    \ for number of classes and TPn stands for the number of True\nPositive samples\
    \ in the nth class and FNn stands for number False Negative samples\nin the nth\
    \ class. Therefore, the average of the individual recall scores from all classes\n\
    was aimed to be maximized.\nData from the training set was provided to the CNN\
    \ network after performing data\naugmentation on the minority classes, during\
    \ training, the validation set was used\nto observe performance of the network\
    \ and determine the best performing instance.\nOnce training was finished, the\
    \ last fully connected classification layer was removed\nand replaced by an XGBoost\
    \ classification stage. To train the XGBoost stage, the\nweights of the final\
    \ best performing CNN model were loaded in to CNN layers of\nthe network and input\
    \ samples were then passed through them as before. Using the\noutput of the CNN\
    \ stage as an input for the XGBoost, a search was then carried\nout to determine\
    \ the optimal parameter values. After training of the XGBoost stage,\nthe completely\
    \ trained CNN-XGBoost model was tested using the test set.\nTwo\n115\nsets of\
    \ tests were performed, one while considering all ADLs as a single class versus\n\
    individual falls and the other considering common individual ADLs and individual\n\
    falls.\nOne ADL vs Individual Falls\nIn this experiment, all ADLs present in the\
    \ SisFall dataset were combined in to one\nclass to build a generic ADL versus\
    \ fall system. The results are presented in Table 44.\nIt can be observed from\
    \ the table that the ADL class has been detected with perfect\nrecall score. Among\
    \ the falls, the worst performance was observed for LHF with the\nbest performance\
    \ for FHF.\nTable 44. One ADL vs. Individual Falls.\nActivity/ Fall\nPrecision\n\

    \ From Table 45,\nwhen looking at the recall achieved for the individual activities,\
    \ it can be observed\nthat the best recognized activities are W and J with each\
    \ achieving a recall of around\n97%. The worst performance in terms of ADLs was\
    \ achieved for the activity SB for\nwhich a recall of 83.78% was attained. Considering\
    \ the case of falls, out of the six\nfalls, the worst recall score of 75% was\
    \ achieved for BHF and LHF whereas the best\nrecall score was of 95.83% was achieved\
    \ for BSF and LSF. The fall class FSF was also\n116\nnot identified well, achieving\
    \ a recall score of 77.08%. Furthermore, as observed from\nthe table, a high value\
    \ of specificity was obtained for all ADLs and falls indicating\nto correct determination\
    \ of negative samples for each class as well. Investigating the\nperformance of\
    \ the network from the confusion matrix, it was observed that the worst\nperforming\
    \ activity SB was equally confused as S and W, this can be attributed to\nthe\
    \ fact that the SB activity includes slight bending which could lead to confusion\
    \ for\nthe classifier. For the worst performing falls, it was observed that BHF\
    \ was confused\nwith LHF and LSF whereas LHF was confused with FHF and FSF. The\
    \ confusion\nbetween the falls is apparent from plots shown in Appendix A where\
    \ BHF has very\nsimilar accelerometer signal values to these classes.\n2.8.3.3\n\
    Discussion\nInorder to better understand the performance of the network for the\
    \ various fall\ndetection types from Tables 44 and 45, the performance of the\
    \ network for fall severity\nhas been illustrated in Figure 26. It can be observed\
    \ that soft falls are better detected\ncompared to hard falls with UARs for the\
    \ individual ADL and fall experiment being\n79.63% for hard falls and that for\
    \ soft falls is 89.58%. For the one ADL and individual\nfall experiment, the difference\
    \ is less stark, being 85.18% for hard falls and 88.88%\nfor soft falls.\n60\n\

    network\nThis section presents a discussion on fall detection with severity and\
    \ direction along\nwith ADL recognition on the SisFall and the K-Fall datasets.\
    \ Two experiments were\nconducted in this regard, one with all ADLs as one class\
    \ versus the six fall types\nconsidered and another for individual ADLs and falls.\n\
    2.8.4.1\nData Labeling\nSince this experiment also uses the K-Fall dataset, the\
    \ labeling scheme for K-Fall\nis shown in Table 48. The labeling for the SisFall\
    \ dataset was retained the same\nfor the individual ADL and fall experiment.\n\
    However, for the one ADL and fall\nexperiment, all activities were labeled as\
    \ a single class ADL.\n2.8.4.2\nMethodology\nThe methodology consists of the two\
    \ steps of data preprocessing and classifi-\ncation. Data preprocessing has been\
    \ performed in the same manner as in section\n2.8.3.1. Therefore, this section\
    \ focuses on the ConvLSTM network used. The net-\nwork used in this work is illustrated\
    \ in Figure 28. It consists of four layers, the first\nof these is the ConvLSTM\
    \ layer. The ConvLSTM layer combines the properties of\nsequential learning associated\
    \ with LSTMs with the feature extraction capabilities\nof convolutional neural\
    \ networks and they have found successful use in the human\nactivity recognition/fall\
    \ detection domain [491, 492]. By replacing the simple matrix\nmultiplication\
    \ within LSTM cells by a convolutional operation, the ConvLSTM can\ncapture spatio-temporal\
    \ dependencies as opposed to the temporal only qualities of-\nfered by LSTMs.\
    \ Such spatial information is useful for the problem of fall detection\nwhere\
    \ not only the sequence contained within the recordings is important but also\n\
    the spatial information is also important to determine things like direction for\
    \ e.g.\nThe ConvLSTM layer is followed by a Self-Attention layer to incorporate\
    \ attention\n119\nTable 48. Labeling for K-Fall Dataset\nActivity Code\nAssigned\

    mechanism. Through the attention layer, important parts in the signal which can\n\
    help to determine the output class correctly are identified. For the current work,\
    \ a\nglobal attention mechanism which looks at the complete sequence is used.\
    \ After the\nattention layer follow two fully connected layers, one with a relu\
    \ activation function\nand the other with a softmax function to determine the\
    \ output class.\n2.8.4.3\nResults\nTwo experiments were performed in total on\
    \ the two datasets considered. The\nexperiments consisted of a fall vs ADL scenario\
    \ and another scenario in which ADLs\nwere conisdered individually to provide\
    \ a combined fall and ADL recognition system.\nThe results for each of the experiments\
    \ have been presented in this section. The\nnetwork was trained using an Adam\
    \ optimizer for 40 epochs with early stopping\nbeing used to retain the best performing\
    \ model before running it on the test set.\nAlso, during training, the network\
    \ was tasked to maximize the average recall of all\nclasses combined to ensure\
    \ that positive samples of each class were prioritized for\ncorrect detection,\
    \ however, in addition to recall, the precision, specificity and F1-\nscore have\
    \ also been reported in the results presented for the sake of completeness.\n\
    One ADL vs Individual Falls\nIn this experiment, all the ADLs were considered\
    \ a single class while the categories for\nfalls were retained as per individual\
    \ directions and severity levels. Table 49 presents\nthe results for this experiment\
    \ with the SisFall dataset for which an average recall of\n90.02% was achieved.\
    \ It can be observed that the network is able to determine ADLs\nvery well achieving\

    \ Considering the\nperformance of falls, the best performing fall classes were\
    \ BSF and LSF for which a\nrecall of 96% was achieved. The worst performing fall\
    \ class in this case was FSF with\na recall of 85%.\nIndividual ADL vs Individual\
    \ Falls\nIn this experiment, individual ADLs were considered as separate classes\
    \ in addition\nto the six fall classes mentioned before. This exercise was carried\
    \ out to assess the\ndesigned systems performance as a combined ADL recognition\
    \ and fall detection\nsystem. The result for the SisFall dataset are presented\
    \ in Table 51. The average\nrecall achieved for this experiment using the SisFall\
    \ dataset is 91.49%.\nConsidering fall performance, it can be observed from Table\
    \ 51 that the class\nBSF is the best recognized fall, having a recall of 94.74%\
    \ with the fall LHF being\nthe worst recognized one with a recall of 73.68%. The\

    \ dataset is\nSB with a recall of 97.5% with the worst being the class J.\n2.8.4.4\n\
    Discussion\nWhen comparing the performance of ADLs and falls overall for both\
    \ experiments,\nit can be observed that ADL recognition performance was much better\
    \ than the\nperformance for fall detection. For both experiments conducted, when\
    \ comparing the\nperformance of the network across datasets, the network performs\
    \ better on the K-Fall\ndataset compared to the SisFall dataset. This could be\
    \ attributed to the difference\nin the volunteer make up of the participants as\
    \ K-Fall mostly had young people\nvolunteering to perform falls whereas SisFall\
    \ contains a wide variety of age groups\nand gender make up in its volunteers.\
    \ To gather further insights in to the performance\nof the network in terms of\
    \ fall detection for the two experiments conducted across both\ndatasets, Figure\
    \ 29 illustrates the networks performance for falls for both datasets\nand experiments.\
    \ An average recall of 88.37% was achieved for the SisFall dataset\nand 91.49%\
    \ for the K-Fall dataset for the one ADL vs individual falls experiment\nand 88.57%\
    \ and 91.33% respectively for the individual ADL and individual falls\nexperiment.\
    \ It can be observed that the classes LSF, FHF and BSF were recognized\nvery well,\
    \ each achieving a recall of nearly 90% or higher. The class FHF was also\ndetected\
    \ sufficiently well, achieving an average recall of more than 86% across all\n\
    experiments. For SisFall, the least performing class was LHF and for K-Fall it\

    99.87\n96.56\nonly detection system that considers the direction as well as the\
    \ severity of falls was\npresented. Inertial measurement sensor data from a publicly\
    \ available dataset was\nused to carry out this task. Following a typical machine\
    \ learning pipeline, the data\nwas first preprocessed by extracting equal duration\
    \ segments from the accelerometer\nand gyroscope sensor signals based on the acceleration\
    \ magnitude. This is followed\nby the computation of various time and frequency\
    \ domain features for each of these\nsegments. The next step is feature selection\
    \ and classification which is performed by\nusing four different machine learning\
    \ algorithms popular in fall detection systems.\nFirst, a baseline performance\
    \ is established and then feature reduction is performed\naiming to maintain or\
    \ improve algorithm performance by elimination of redundant\nfeatures. It was\
    \ observed that the weighted F1-score improved slightly (by just over\n1%) for\
    \ both experiments.\nThe other three experiments considered activity of daily\
    \ living and fall detection\nsimultaneously. For the second experiment, utilizing\
    \ inertial sensor data, a hierarchi-\ncal classification framework using wavelets\
    \ and adaptive pooling was presented. To\nachieve this, inertial sensor recordings\
    \ (accelerometer and gyroscope) from the Sis-\nFall dataset were utilized and\
    \ windowed segments were extracted from each recording.\nFollowing this, a level-4\
    \ haar wavelet was used to extract wavelet coefficients from\nthese windowed segments\
    \ and then 4-2-1 1-D Spatial Pyramid pooling was used to\n126\nsummarize the output\
    \ of the wavelet feature coefficients at each approximation and\ndetail level\
    \ before the max pooled coefficients were concatenated to form the final\nfeature\
    \ vector. A hierarchical classification scheme was then used consisting of three\n\
    classification stages, one for determining individual ADLs versus a generic fall\
    \ and the\nsecond and third for fall direction and severity respectively with\
    \ both voting together\nto determine the severity and direction of a fall. Towards\
    \ this end, experiments were\nconducted to determine the most appropriate size\
    \ of the observation window as well as\nsensing modality used. It was found that\
    \ for the proposed setup, a window duration\nof 3 seconds produced the best results\
    \ while using data from both the accelerometer\nand gyroscope. In the third experiment,\
    \ Inertial Measurement Unit (accelerometer\nand gyroscope) data from the SisFall\
    \ dataset is first windowed into non-overlapping\nsegments of duration 3 seconds.\
    \ After suitable data augmentation for the minority\nclasses, the windowed segments\
    \ are passed to a Convolutional Neural Network for\nfeature extraction. The CNN\
    \ is trained to maximize the unweighted average recall\nfor the validation partition.\
    \ Once the CNN is trained, an XGBoost last stage is used\nfor classification.\
    \ Experiments conducted on the test set achieve an unweighted aver-\nage recall\
    \ of 88% for both the one ADL versus individual falls and individual ADLs\nversus\
    \ fall experiments. In comparison with other techniques used for this task, the\n\
    proposed scheme produces sufficiently better results, thereby demonstrating the\
    \ effi-\ncacy of the proposed method. Lastly, a ConvLSTM network with attention\
    \ has been\nused for detection of falls considering fall direction and severity.\
    \ Using data from the\nSisFall and the K-Fall datasets, two experiments were conducted\
    \ on inertial sensor\ndata. The first considered falls versus ADLs and the other\
    \ combined ADL recognition\nand fall detection. Results for both experiments achieved\
    \ an average recall of more\nthan 90%. The results from the cross-dataset performance\
    \ indicate to the robustness\nof the designed methodology.\nTable 55 presents\
    \ the F-1 scores for the four experiments considering fall detection\nwith direction\
    \ and severity for the SisFall dataset. For experiment 1, only the fall\ndetection\
    \ with direction and severity part has been reported. A progression can be\nobserved\
    \ in the detection of falls wherein an increase of nearly 8.5% in the average\n\
    F1-score was achieved.\n127\nCHAPTER VI\nCONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK\n1\nConclusion\n\
    This dissertation provided a coverage of the use of Internet of Things towards\
    \ the\ndevelopment of smart communities. While doing so, the main applications\
    \ of ML/DL\nalgorithms as well as optimization algorithms were discussed and mapped.\
    \ Further-\nemore, other technological components of the IoT such as sensing,\
    \ communication,\nsecurity and privacy were also talked about. Lastly, considering\
    \ the case of smart\nhealth, specifically fall detection, experimentation and\
    \ analysis was conducted and\nthe results presented.\nIn this regard, the usage\
    \ of inertial sensor data has been very popular as they do\nnot restrict a users\
    \ movement and are also easy to deploy compared to other methods.\nFour approaches\
    \ that considered fall detection with direction and severity were pre-\nsented.\
    \ In this regard, four experiments were conducted, first was the development\n\
    of a fall only detection system whereas the other three were for a combined ADL\
    \ and\nfall system. For the other three experiments, a hierarchical and two deep\
    \ learning\nbased approaches were tested. The designed methodologies were compared\
    \ to the\nstate of the art and were found to outperform them.\n2\nContribution\n\
    The Internet of Things has spearheaded tremendous change in society by allowing\
    \ for\ncapturing measurements in different facets of our daily lives. With such\
    \ a fundamental\nimpact being made, it is pertinent that researchers commit to\
    \ analyzing the current\npenetration that IoT possesses in city operation and\
    \ also providing impetuses for\nnew and novel application development. This work\
    \ aims to address these needs by\ndiscussing the use and role of the internet\
    \ of things in smart communities.\nThe\ncontribution of the work are as follows:\n\
    1. Provide a coverage of the IoT based smart city ecosystem in terms of the tech-\n\
    nologies utilized. Discussion has been provided about the sensors, communi-\n\
    cation technologies as well as the IoT architectures that enable IoT smart city\n\
    development. Finally a review of the security and privacy issues was also dis-\n\
    cussed.\n2. Present a study of the uses of ML and DL methods for different applications\
    \ of\nsmart cities in an IoT context. To this end, the type of architecture employed\n\
    and the data source type were also covered.\n128\n3. The use of optimization algorithms\
    \ in IoT smart cities has been provided. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this is\
    \ the first comprehensive review of optimization\nalgorithms in IoT Smart Cities.\n\
    4. Considering the case of smart health, methodologies have been devised for the\n\
    novel case of fall detection with direction and severity detection. In this respect,\n\
    the performance time, frequency domain and statistical features on inertial\n\
    sensor data has been analyzed and presented.\n5. A combined activity of daily\
    \ living and fall detection framework with fall di-\nrection and severity consideration\
    \ has been discussed.\nFour approaches in\nthis regard have been presented, one\
    \ utilizing time-frequency information us-\ning wavelets along with a hierarchical\
    \ classification scheme, third a Convolu-\ntional Neural Network-eXtreme Gradient\
    \ Boost combination and the last being\na ConvLSTM has been proposed. The proposed\
    \ approaches has been shown to\noutperform the state of the art in the field.\n\
    3\nFuture Work\nThe IoT is revolutionizing development of smart city applications.\
    \ There are several\nopportunities. Some of these are listed below:\n• IoT Systems\
    \ for Smart Cities\n– A major research area is in the security and privacy of\
    \ IoT in smart cities in\nterms of encryption techniques, authentication protocols,\
    \ data anonymiza-\ntion techniques and other methods to prevent unvalidated access\
    \ to the IoT\nnetwork. As mentioned before technologies such as blockchain could\
    \ help\nintroduce access tracking and control, secure device discovery, prevention\n\
    of spoofing, data loss while ensuring that end to end encryption is also\nused.\n\
    – Of the data transfer standards developed till now for IoT, many are not\ncompatible\
    \ with each other. Work needs to be carried out in this regard to\nenable intercommunication\
    \ of sensor nodes using different protocols while\nutilizing low power, which\
    \ is imperative for sensor nodes in the network.\n– Another area to work on, is\
    \ the development of efficient storage techniques\nand low power hardware which\
    \ can reduce operational costs. From a de-\nployment perspective, decentralized\
    \ systems have been proposed as the\nbest solutions to increase reliability of\
    \ the application. Techniques such as\nfederated learning allow for decentralized\
    \ DL system deployments.\n• AI/Combinatorial Optimization in IoT Smart Cities\n\
    – The development of data fusion techniques that can make the use of het-\nerogeneous\
    \ data sources easier, intelligent data reduction/feature selection\nmethods to\
    \ ensure that redundant or ’uninteresting’ data is not part of the\n129\nAI development\
    \ pipeline. This will help in a quicker turnaround time as\nwell as improved performance\
    \ of deployments. Current methods need to be\nused as well as new ones be researched\
    \ for making ML and DL algorithms\nmore explainable to suit the various applications\
    \ in a smart city.\n– Hybrid and novel optimization methodologies (for e.g. graywolf\
    \ optimiza-\ntion [493]) which combine characteristics of multiple heuristic schemes\n\
    could potentially outperform singular methodologies.\nThere have been\nseveral\
    \ works which combine multiple optimization techniques.\n– Reinforcement learning\
    \ (RL) has the potential to provide solutions to com-\nbinatorial optimization\
    \ problems as covered in [494]. The idea is to use\nmachine learning and reinforcement\
    \ learning to get rid of human created\nheurists which may lead to optimizations\
    \ towards local optimums. Agents\ncan be trained to search for these heuristics\
    \ to automate the process.\n• Smart Health: Fall detection\n– The addition of\
    \ additional sensor modalities apart from intertial sensor\nmeasurements might\
    \ help improve performance for the worst detected\nclasses from the experiments\
    \ conducted. Various authors have incorpo-\nrated medical or pressure sensors\
    \ in their fall detection systems.\nData\nfrom these sensors can be used together\
    \ as an input to a deep learning\nnetwork. This additional information gathered\
    \ for subjects while under-\ngoing a fall could also describe valuable health\
    \ parameters that can be used\nfor diagnosis or early detection of ailments which\
    \ might be the underlying\ncause of falls.\n– Another work opportunity in the\
    \ data science domain would be the as-\nsessment of this problem considering a\
    \ data centric approach, where, in\ncontrast to a model centric approach where\
    \ the focus is on developing the\nbest model, data centric focuses on working\
    \ with data to improve applica-\ntion performance using systematic procedures\
    \ for labeling, augmentation\netc. Such systematic procedures and qualitative\
    \ data analysis would aid\nin cross-dataset algorithm deployment as well.\n130\n\

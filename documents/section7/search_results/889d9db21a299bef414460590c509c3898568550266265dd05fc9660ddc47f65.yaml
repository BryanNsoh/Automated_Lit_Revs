    \ is the largest consumptive user of fresh water. Water scarcity\nis increasing\
    \ worldwide, resulting in tighter regulation of its use for agriculture. This\
    \ necessitates the\ndevelopment of irrigation practices that are more efﬁcient\
    \ in the use of water but do not compromise\ncrop quality and yield. Precision\
    \ irrigation already achieves this goal, in part. The goal of precision\nirrigation\
    \ is to accurately supply the crop water need in a timely manner and as spatially\
    \ uniformly\nas possible. However, to maximize the beneﬁts of precision irrigation,\
    \ additional technologies need\nto be enabled and incorporated into agriculture.\
    \ This paper discusses how incorporating adaptive\ndecision support systems into\
    \ precision irrigation management will enable signiﬁcant advances in\nincreasing\
    \ the efﬁciency of current irrigation approaches. From the literature review,\
    \ it is found that\nprecision irrigation can be applied in achieving the environmental\
    \ goals related to sustainability.\nThe demonstrated economic beneﬁts of precision\
    \ irrigation in ﬁeld-scale crop production is however\nminimal. It is argued that\
    \ a proper combination of soil, plant and weather sensors providing\nreal-time\
    \ data to an adaptive decision support system provides an innovative platform\
    \ for improving\nsustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows\
    \ that adaptive decision support systems\nbased on model predictive control are\
    \ able to adequately account for the time-varying nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while considering operational limitations and agronomic objectives\n\
    in arriving at optimal irrigation decisions. It is concluded that signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in crop\nyield and water savings can be achieved by incorporating model predictive\
    \ control into precision\nirrigation decision support tools. Further improvements\
    \ in water savings can also be realized by\nincluding deﬁcit irrigation as part\
    \ of the overall irrigation management strategy. Nevertheless, future\nresearch\
    \ is needed for identifying crop response to regulated water deﬁcits, developing\
    \ improved\nsoil moisture and plant sensors, and developing self-learning crop\
    \ simulation frameworks that can\nbe applied to evaluate adaptive decision support\
    \ strategies related to irrigation.\nKeywords: precision irrigation; adaptive\
    \ decision support systems; model predictive control;\ncrop yield; water savings;\
    \ sustainability\n1. Introduction\nGlobally, 70% of water use is applied in irrigation\
    \ of crops, making irrigation the largest\nconsumptive user of fresh water [1].\
    \ Over 80% of freshwater withdrawals in developing countries is\napplied in irrigation\
    \ [2]. Irrigated agriculture provides 40% of the world’s food from less than 20%\
    \ of\nthe cultivated area highlighting the importance of irrigation in global\
    \ food security [3].\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353; doi:10.3390/su9030353\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n2 of 29\nIrrigated crop production globally extends\
    \ over 275 million hectares, with an estimated annual\nincrease of 1.3% [2]. Global\
    \ climate change may further increase irrigation water demand due to a\ngreater\
    \ variation in annual precipitation amounts [4]. Postel [5] suggested that irrigation\
    \ will provide\n46% of the global crop water requirement by 2025, which was computed\
    \ as 28% in 1995, resulting in a\ndecline of rain-fed agriculture. Food production\
    \ in the developing world, notably in South, Southeast\nand East Asia, is at present\
    \ heavily reliant on irrigation. The total irrigated area in Asia is 230 million\
    \ ha,\nwhich represents over 70% of the global irrigated area. Of the 230 million\
    \ ha of irrigated land area, 60%\nis located in China and India [3]. It is estimated\
    \ that 75% of the grain production in China is dependent\non irrigation [2]. Sarma\
    \ [6] noted that India uses as much as four times more water to produce one\n\
    unit of a major food crop as compared to the USA and Europe. This implies that\
    \ an improvement\nin water use efﬁciency in the developing world would conserve\
    \ at least half of the water presently\napplied in irrigation.\nIt is estimated\
    \ that a water volume of 2630 km3 is abstracted yearly from surface and ground\n\
    water sources for irrigated crop production. The absence of surface water sources\
    \ in a number of\ncommunities has further increased the pressure on groundwater\
    \ resources. This has resulted in the\nover-abstraction of global groundwater\
    \ sources which is calculated to be as much as 163 km3 per\nannum [2]. A global\
    \ shortage in freshwater sources is predicted unless action is taken to improve\
    \ water\nmanagement and increase water use efﬁciency. This has necessitated greater\
    \ regulatory demands for\nenvironmental protection of freshwater [7]. It is reported\
    \ that only half of the total freshwater volume\nabstracted for irrigation globally\
    \ reaches the targeted crops [2]. These have brought about the need to\ndevise\
    \ procedures to use the limited water more efﬁciently while maximizing crop yield\
    \ and quality.\nConventional irrigation practice involves applying water uniformly\
    \ over every part of the ﬁeld\nwithout taking into account the spatial variability\
    \ in soil and crop water needs; this consequently leads\nto overirrigation in\
    \ some parts of the ﬁeld while other parts of the ﬁeld are underirrigated [8].\
    \ The risks\nassociated with overirrigation include surface runoff, deep percolation\
    \ and leaching of nitrates and\nnutrients. Those associated with underirrigation\
    \ are more subjective and include reduction in crop\nyields and quality, as well\
    \ as inefﬁcient use of fertilizer and other supplemental inputs for crop\nproduction\
    \ [9].\nThe irrigation process requires a high level of ‘precision’ in order to\
    \ optimize the water input\nand crop response, while minimizing adverse environmental\
    \ impacts. Precision irrigation is an\nevolving ﬁeld with active interest by both\
    \ industry and academic researchers. It is conceptualized by\nsome researchers\
    \ as the use of efﬁcient irrigation application systems, whereas others view it\
    \ as the\nvariable application of irrigation based on predeﬁned maps or sensor\
    \ feedback [10]. Smith et al. [11]\nsuggested that ‘precision’ involves the accurate\
    \ determination, quantiﬁcation of crop water needs and\nthe precise application\
    \ of the optimal water volume at the required time. This implies that varying\n\
    water application spatially is not the sole requirement for the achievement of\
    \ ‘precision’ in the irrigation\nprocess. Hence, precision irrigation can be deﬁned\
    \ as the process of accounting for the ﬁeld-scale\nspatial variability in crop\
    \ water need and applying the right amount of water to match the spatial crop\n\
    water need at the right time [9]. The advantages associated with precision irrigation\
    \ include increased\ncrop yields, improved crop quality, improved water use efﬁciency/savings,\
    \ reduction of energy costs\nand reduction of adverse environmental impacts [12].\
    \ Pierce [13] viewed precision irrigation as a\ntool for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of improved irrigation water use\nefﬁciency\
    \ and improved environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\nThe balance of several\
    \ core aspects is however important for the successful implementation of\na robust\
    \ precision irrigation system. Implementing a precision irrigation system involves\
    \ efforts on\nreal-time monitoring of crop and soil conditions, scheduling irrigation\
    \ and control of the irrigation\napplication equipment. Research has been mainly\
    \ focused on the sensing and control aspects of\nprecision irrigation with much\
    \ advancements in the last decade [12]. Research is limited, however,\nin the\
    \ development of appropriate irrigation scheduling tools for the precision irrigation\
    \ process [14].\nIrrigation scheduling is the process by which a producer determines\
    \ when to apply irrigation and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n3 of 29\nthe amount\
    \ of irrigation water to apply [15]. Hornbuckle et al. [16] suggested that the\
    \ irrigation\nscheduling endeavour should be treated as an all-encompassing decision\
    \ support system for irrigation\nmanagement. A robust decision support system\
    \ is important in the successful implementation of\nprecision irrigation. The\
    \ need for a decision support system capable of real-time management decisions\n\
    of when, where and how much to irrigate while also considering uncertainty in\
    \ climatic inputs,\nthe time-varying nature of cropping systems, as well as equipment\
    \ and operational limitations cannot\nbe overemphasized. Rhodig and Hillyer [17]\
    \ noted that the development of an optimal decision support\ntool for precision\
    \ irrigation will involve the combination of appropriate modeling and management\n\
    tools. The decision support tools available for precision irrigation management\
    \ are presently inﬂexible\nand difﬁcult to adapt to varying cropping scenarios\
    \ [18].\nIn recent years, there has been a number of in-depth reviews on precision\
    \ irrigation (e.g., [9,16]),\nand our intention is not to repeat the areas they\
    \ addressed. Rather, our aim is to provide an in-depth\ntechnical analysis of\
    \ the considerations necessary for the development of a practical and robust decision\n\
    support system for precision irrigation in order to improve sustainable irrigated\
    \ agriculture. To that\nend, the review will focus on the following critical aspects\
    \ of precision irrigation: (1) monitoring\nconsiderations; (2) present limitations\
    \ and state of the art in decision support; and (3) opportunities for\nimproving\
    \ sustainability. We will however include brief sections on the concept of spatial\
    \ variability\nand the control of water application in precision irrigation.\n\
    2. Spatial Variability: The Long-Term Challenge of Irrigated Agriculture\nThe\
    \ underlying argument for precision irrigation is the presence of within-ﬁeld\
    \ spatial variability\nthat inﬂuences crop water demand. The spatial variability\
    \ in crop water demand may have a direct\ninﬂuence on the crop yield, quality\
    \ and the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds [19]. The soil water\npresents\
    \ the sole source of water available for direct plant uptake and therefore its\
    \ spatial variability\nwill have a direct inﬂuence on crop water demand. Soil\
    \ and landscape characteristics like soil texture,\ntopography, abiotic and management\
    \ factors (e.g., compaction, tillage) and hydraulic properties vary\nspatially\
    \ across a ﬁeld [11]. These have a direct inﬂuence on the water-holding capacity\
    \ of the soil.\nHedley and Yule [20] reported that the spatial variation in the\
    \ soil water retention characteristics was\nstrongly correlated with the spatial\
    \ variation in soil texture across a ﬁeld, noting that areas with heavier\nsoils\
    \ within a ﬁeld had a larger water-holding capacity in comparison to those with\
    \ light textured\nsoils. The advent of rapid non-invasive technologies for mapping\
    \ soil properties, speciﬁcally electrical\nconductivity mapping, can reveal within-ﬁeld\
    \ variability that can guide in variable rate irrigation\nmanagement. These have\
    \ been successfully applied by Hedley and Yule [21] and Daccache et al. [8].\n\
    Readers are directed to [22,23] for a comprehensive overview of electrical conductivity\
    \ mapping.\nThe variability in yield across a ﬁeld has also been found to be strongly\
    \ correlated with the spatial\nvariability in water available for crop use. The\
    \ spatial variability in crop yield is a function of the\ninterplay between water\
    \ stress, nutrients, in addition to soil’s physical and chemical properties [24].\n\
    The yield map can be correlated with the soil electrical conductivity (EC) map.\
    \ These similarities can be\nexplained through the spatial variability of soil\
    \ properties that exists across a ﬁeld. The water-holding\ncapacity of the soil\
    \ is a major factor affecting yield, and the yield map will likely show a strong\n\
    correlation to soil EC [25]. Irmak et al. [26] noted that the spatial variability\
    \ in soil water retention\ncharacteristics played a dominant role in explaining\
    \ the spatial yield variability observed in soybean.\nMartinez-Casasnovas et al.\
    \ [27] suggested yield mapping as an important tool in variable rate\nirrigation\
    \ management.\nA robust precision irrigation system will be able to meet the spatially\
    \ varying crop water demand\nacross a ﬁeld at the right time. This requires accurate\
    \ knowledge of the within-ﬁeld variability. This\nis addressed by applying the\
    \ concept of irrigation management zones/units in precision irrigation.\nThe irrigation\
    \ management zones are a group of homogeneous units with similar soil water retention\n\
    characteristics [21]. It is however important that these management zones are\
    \ large enough to be\nmanaged individually while remaining relatively homogeneous\
    \ in order to reﬂect the spatial soil\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n4 of 29\n\
    variation across the units. The delineation of irrigation management zones based\
    \ on real-time sensor\ndata has also been demonstrated. This is achieved by applying\
    \ infrared thermometry/thermography\nto assess the spatial variation in crop canopy\
    \ temperature across a ﬁeld [28]. The crop canopy\ntemperature of a healthy transpiring\
    \ crop will often be less than that of the ambient air. When crop\ntranspiration\
    \ is reduced as a result of water deﬁcits, the crop canopy temperature is expected\
    \ to increase.\nThe characterization of crop water status as a function of the\
    \ canopy and ambient temperature is the\nbasis for using infrared thermometry/thermography\
    \ as a mapping tool for precision irrigation [29].\nShaughnessy et al. [30] and\
    \ Evett et al. [31] have successfully applied this procedure in generating\ndynamic\
    \ maps to guide variable rate water application for ﬁeld crops grown under a center\
    \ pivot\nsystem. It should, however, be noted that infrared temperature measurements\
    \ are usually taken over\na short period, mostly at midday when the crop is expected\
    \ to experience the highest evaporative\ndemand. Hence, this method is well suited\
    \ for crop production systems in which the soil moisture\ndynamics has relatively\
    \ long time constants.\n3. Spatial Scales of Irrigation Management\nCentre pivot,\
    \ lateral move and low energy precision application (LEPA) moving machines can\
    \ be\nmodiﬁed to apply spatially variable irrigation [32]. These systems are particularly\
    \ suited to variable\nrate water application because of their current level of\
    \ automation and large coverage area with\na single lateral pipe. Fixed irrigation\
    \ systems also have potential to be deployed for variable rate\nwater application\
    \ as they can be very accurate and can be automated based on sensor feedback [2].\n\
    Implementing a spatially varied irrigation system requires an understanding of\
    \ the characteristics of\nthe irrigation application system deployed including\
    \ the spatial scales covered by the water application\nequipment. The spatial\
    \ scale associated with the variability in crop water requirements and its impact\n\
    on yield should also be identiﬁed [32].\nO’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested that\
    \ the size and numbers of irrigation management zones\nthat can be controlled\
    \ in a precision irrigation strategy will determine the overall ﬂexibility of\
    \ the\nsystem. For moving application systems, the width of the management zone\
    \ is dependent on the\nnumber of drops or nozzles within an individually controlled\
    \ set (i.e., sprinklers controlled by a single\nsolenoid valve) and the length\
    \ will be dependent on the pattern of variability in the direction of the\ntraveling\
    \ sprinkler. The wind speed and the overlap from the wetted sprinkler patterns\
    \ between\nmanagement zones will also affect the accuracy of the water volume\
    \ applied. Raine and McCarthy [32]\nnoted that the spray diameter and overlap\
    \ achieved by moving application systems make it impossible\nto target water applications\
    \ on a single crop basis using these systems. Hedley et al. [2] suggested that\n\
    the economic beneﬁts of spatially varied irrigation should be an important consideration\
    \ even when\nthe system is considered achievable from a technical standpoint.\
    \ The spatial scales associated with\nmoving and ﬁxed irrigation systems is presented\
    \ in Table 1. Smith et al. [11] concluded that the spatial\nresolution of a precision\
    \ irrigation system will be inﬂuenced by the spatial scales associated with the\n\
    application system, spatial resolution of the inﬁeld sensors and the spatial scales\
    \ associated with the\nvariability in crop water requirements.\nTable 1. Spatial\

    \ in Precision Irrigation\nThe water application system used in the precision\
    \ irrigation process must be able to control the\nwater application volume applied\
    \ per unit time to each deﬁned irrigation management unit within a\nﬁeld [13].\
    \ The development of variable rate water application systems has been mostly focused\
    \ on\ncontinuous move systems [11].\nThe control of water application on continuous\
    \ move systems (centre pivot, linear move, boom\nand reel) is based on databases\
    \ of spatially referenced data deﬁning irrigation management units [20].\nThe\
    \ volume of water applied to each management unit can be achieved by varying the\
    \ application rate\nof sprinklers or controlling the ground speed of continuous\
    \ move systems [13].\nThe application rate of sprinklers is mostly varied through\
    \ the pulse modulation of the sprinkler\nnozzles. This involves the application\
    \ of normally opened solenoid valves to control ﬂow through\nan individual or\
    \ group of sprinkler heads. The solenoid turns the ﬂow of water either on or off\
    \ at\na sprinkler location in order to achieve a desired application depth within\
    \ a speciﬁed cycle time.\nThe cycle time is the total number of switching (either\
    \ to on or off phase) required by the solenoid\nvalves during a pulse cycle [34].\
    \ Evans et al. [34] applied the pulse modulated sprinkler control\non a linear\
    \ move sprinkler system. Daccache et al. [8] also applied a pulsed modulated sprinkler\n\
    control on a boom and reel irrigation system. Field evaluation of both systems\
    \ indicated a satisfactory\nperformance over a range of water application rates.\
    \ They however noted a problem with sprinkler\noverlap at the edge of the irrigation\
    \ management units.\nThe variation in irrigation volume applied by a continuous\
    \ move system can also be achieved by\nvarying its travel speed. The sprinklers\
    \ on the manifold of the irrigation system are usually operated\nat a speciﬁed\
    \ ﬂow rate and pressure. An increase in travel speed of the system reduces the\
    \ application\ndepth and a decrease in the travel speed increases the application\
    \ depth [35]. This type of system\ncannot be applied in situations where variable\
    \ application depths are needed along the length of the\nirrigation system [34].\
    \ Al-Karadsheh [9] evaluated the performance of speed control in achieving\nvariable\
    \ water application rate on a linear move system. The wetted diameter of the sprinklers\
    \ was\nreported to be between 15.2 and 21.3 m. He reported that the system needed\
    \ to travel a minimum\ndistance of 16 m before a desired change in application\
    \ volume can be reached. This suggests that this\nsystem is not suitable for use\
    \ in applications where the management units are small in scale.\nThe adaptation\
    \ of ﬁxed irrigation systems for variable rate water application has been achieved\n\
    (e.g., [36]). Variable water rate application in these systems is usually achieved\
    \ either by individual\nnozzle or emitter control, or zone management [13]. Readers\
    \ are referred to [13] for a comprehensive\nreview of such systems. Miranda et\
    \ al. [37] described a distributed control system implemented to\nachieve variable\
    \ rate water application in a ﬁxed irrigation system operating in predeﬁned management\n\
    zones. Their results indicated that the system was able to apply the irrigation\
    \ volume required in\neach zone. Goumopoulos et al. [38] also implemented a variable\
    \ rate water application setup for a\nﬁxed irrigation system capable of zone-speciﬁc\
    \ irrigation of strawberries. Individual nozzle control\nin a micro-sprinkler\
    \ system has been demonstrated by Coates et al. [39]. They reported individual\n\
    control of 54 nodes in a vineyard with the system. The nozzle connected to each\
    \ node was capable of\nachieving a unique water application volume. They concluded\
    \ that the water requirements of each\ndeﬁned zone in the vineyard can be individually\
    \ met by the irrigation system. The authors reported a\npayback period of between\
    \ 3.5 and 4.5 years for the system.\n5. Monitoring\nThe routine or continuous\
    \ monitoring of moisture ﬂuxes in the soil–plant–atmosphere system is a\nfundamental\
    \ aspect of managing crop production in irrigated agriculture. Monitoring can\
    \ essentially\nbe viewed as the application of various sensing technologies in\
    \ determining and characterizing\nthe spatiotemporal ﬁeld-scale moisture dynamics\
    \ and plant water use. These sensing methods can\nbe classiﬁed under three broad\
    \ headings: soil-based, weather-based and plant-based sensing [40].\nSoil-based\
    \ sensing typically involves the use of sensors to determine the soil moisture\
    \ content or\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n6 of 29\npotential. This information\
    \ is then used to infer the amount of water available for plant use and\nits temporal\
    \ dynamics. The weather-based sensing involves the use of the crop evapotranspiration\n\
    to determine the temporal crop water use. The evapotranspiration is determined\
    \ using climatic\nvariables such as radiation, rainfall and wind speed [41,42].\
    \ The plant-based sensing involves the\ndetermination of plant water status which\
    \ is usually related to plant physiology. Measurements\nof canopy temperature,\
    \ stomatal resistance, sap ﬂow, leaf turgor pressure, stem diameter and leaf\n\
    thickness are used to infer plant water status [43].\nRecent advances in remote\
    \ sensing has enhanced the possibility of monitoring the spatial nature of\nboth\
    \ soil and crop water status. Remote sensing encompasses non-contact technologies\
    \ that are capable\nof sensing radiation reﬂected or emitted from agricultural\
    \ ﬁelds. They are deployed using satellites,\naerial platforms and tractors [44].\
    \ These technologies have a high spatial resolution and are well suited\nfor regional\
    \ soil and crop water evaluation [45]. This review focuses on sensing technologies\
    \ that can\nbe applied in monitoring ﬁeld-scale soil and crop water dynamics.\
    \ Readers are referred to [44,46] for a\ncomprehensive review of remote sensing\
    \ technologies applicable in precision agriculture.\n5.1. Soil-Based Sensing\n\
    The knowledge of soil moisture ﬂuxes comprising of the depletion and reﬁll of\
    \ soil water can be\nused to monitor crop water use hence making it a useful tool\
    \ in irrigation scheduling and management\ndecisions [47]. Several methods have\
    \ been developed for measuring soil moisture content; they are\nindirect methods\
    \ which rely on the strong relationship between a particular property of the soil\n\
    and the soil moisture content. Moreover, they are able to provide continuous monitoring\
    \ and are\nnon-destructive [48]. In precision irrigation, the commonly applied\
    \ method for monitoring the\ntemporal dynamics of ﬁeld-scale soil moisture is\
    \ the dielectric-based method [20]. This is because\nof the ease of their deployment\
    \ in large-scale soil moisture sensor networks [49]. Thus, the proper\ndeployment\
    \ and management of this technology can optimize the sustainability of irrigated\
    \ agriculture.\nConsequently, this section will outline a brief description of\
    \ this method including a consideration of\nthe factors affecting sensor performance.\
    \ For a more detailed description of other state-of-the-art soil\nmoisture sensing\
    \ technologies, readers are referred to [50,51].\n5.1.1. Dielectric Soil Moisture\
    \ Sensors\nDielectric soil moisture sensors operate by exploiting the dielectric\
    \ properties of soil and its\nconstituents [52]. The relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of a substance is used to describe the effect of\nan electromagnetic ﬁeld on\
    \ its molecular structure. It is a dimensionless constant greater than one,\n\
    made up of a real and imaginary part [53]. The apparent relative dielectric permittivity\
    \ of soil, ε′soil\nis a function of its constituents majorly being water, air\
    \ and solid particles. The relative dielectric\npermittivity of the other constituents\
    \ except water has a negligible effect as they have small values in\nthe range\
    \ of 1–7. The one of water, ε′water having a value of approximately 80 has the\
    \ most remarkable\neffect. It is therefore possible to correlate the volumetric\
    \ moisture content (VMC) to ε′soil using\nempirical equations at a frequency range\
    \ of between 50 MHz and 17 GHz. At this high frequency\nrange, ε′soil is highly\
    \ stable and it usually referred to as the apparent dielectric permittivity of\
    \ soil [54].\nA range of electromagnetic sensors exploits this property to provide\
    \ a non-destructive in situ\nmeasurement of soil moisture contents. They include\
    \ time domain reﬂectometry (TDR) sensors, time\ndomain transmission (TDT) sensors\
    \ and capacitance sensors.\n5.1.2. Factors Affecting the Performance of Dielectric\
    \ Soil Moisture Sensors\nThe accuracy of data from soil moisture sensors is important\
    \ in the precision irrigation process.\nOver estimation of soil moisture status\
    \ may lead to a delay in irrigation scheduling decisions and\nconsequently affect\
    \ crop yield and quality. Underestimation of soil moisture status on the other\
    \ hand\nmay lead to application of irrigation too often or when not required by\
    \ the crops. This will result in\nwater/energy wastage and adverse environmental\
    \ effects.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n7 of 29\nDielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ measure the soil moisture content for the soil volume\ncorresponding to their\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence. The various factors affecting the performance of dielectric\n\
    soil moisture sensors include bulk electrical conductivity (salinity), soil texture,\
    \ bulk density and\ntemperature. A variation in any of these factors around the\
    \ sphere of inﬂuence of the dielectric sensor\nwill have an effect on its performance.\
    \ These properties vary with location and depth in a soil proﬁle\nand it is important\
    \ to take them into account when calibrating dielectric soil moisture sensors\
    \ [55].\nThese sensors often rely on site-speciﬁc calibration, but they often\
    \ come with ‘universal’ calibrations\nwhich can be used where absolute accuracy\
    \ is not required. The accuracy of calibration equations\nsupplied by manufacturers\
    \ of these sensors are usually between a range of ±4 - 2% VMC when applied\nin\
    \ non-saline soils [56]. Site-speciﬁc calibration equations which are developed\
    \ by comparing the\nsensor output to gravimetrically derived soil moisture content\
    \ can be applied when a higher level of\naccuracy is required [57]. In addition,\
    \ for capacitance type probes, it is essential that the probe access\ntubes are\
    \ ﬁtted correctly without air gaps to ensure robust soil water measurements. For\
    \ a detailed\ntechnical description of factors affecting the performance of dielectric\
    \ sensors, readers are referred\nto [58,59].\n5.2. Proximal Sensing and Mapping\
    \ of Soil Moisture\nThe recent advances in rapid mapping and positioning technologies\
    \ enables the spatial\ncharacterization of soil moisture retention properties\
    \ to inform precision irrigation decisions.\nThe electromagnetic induction (EM)\
    \ technique is used in combination with accurate positioning\nsystems to quantify\
    \ soil moisture variability at resolutions less than 10 m. It also provides a\
    \ highly\naccurate digital elevation map (DEM) [2].\nThe EM sensor maps the soil’s\
    \ apparent EC which is inﬂuenced by soil texture and moisture in\nnon-saline soils\
    \ [48]. Those same factors correlate highly to the soil’s water-holding capacity.\
    \ Based on\nthe EC maps, a targeted soil sampling can be conducted at different\
    \ parts of the ﬁeld. Topographic\nfeatures that are likely to inﬂuence ﬁeld-scale\
    \ soil moisture dynamics are derived using the DEM [60].\nThe EC maps enable the\
    \ grouping of discrete units known as management units with similar\navailable\
    \ water-holding capacity (AWC) characteristics which can then be used in selecting\
    \ soil\nmoisture monitoring sites. This has been demonstrated by [34,61]. The\
    \ data from soil moisture sensors\nlocated in the management units can also be\
    \ used in generating dynamic application maps based\non a relationship between\
    \ the soil moisture depletion and the mapped EC values. These application\nmaps\
    \ serve as an input into the precision irrigation control system. Hedley and Yule\
    \ [21] applied soil\nmoisture sensors and an EC map in generating dynamic water\
    \ status maps for a 35.2 ha irrigated\nmaize ﬁeld. Daccache et al. [8] applied\
    \ a similar method in producing dynamic soil moisture maps for\nvarious ﬁelds.\n\
    The electric resistivity tomography technique can also be applied in deriving\
    \ the EC map of a ﬁeld.\nHedley et al. [2] reported that the method has a good\
    \ vertical resolution but it cannot be deployed on a\nmoving platform for rapid\
    \ non-invasive mapping. It has been applied by Kelly et al. [62] in positioning\n\
    soil moisture sensors to support irrigation decisions.\nThe ground-penetrating\
    \ radar (GPR) can also be applied in monitoring the ﬁeld-scale soil moisture\n\
    status [50]. It can be mounted on a vehicle or moving irrigation system for mapping\
    \ soil moisture in a\nﬁeld. The GPR is however affected by high clay content,\
    \ is not amenable to automation and requires\nfurther development to improve its\
    \ viability in precision irrigation applications [63].\nThe deployment of soil\
    \ moisture sensors in management units defined by these mapping techniques\nenables\
    \ the dynamic updates of soil moisture maps which can aid variable rate water\
    \ application.\n5.3. Weather-Based Sensing\nWeather-based sensing involves the\
    \ use of climatic variables in determining ET which is indicative\nof the crops’\
    \ daily water use. Evaporation accounts for the direct evaporation of water to\
    \ the air from\nthe soil surface or canopy interception of either precipitation\
    \ or applied irrigation. Transpiration\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n8 of 29\n\
    accounts for the uptake of water by a plant and the subsequent loss of water as\
    \ vapor through stomata\nin its leaves, required for metabolic cooling of the\
    \ leaf to maintain photosynthesis without the leaf\noverheating [41]. Evapotranspiration\
    \ is generally viewed as a combination of the evaporation of water\nfrom the soil,\
    \ evaporation from the canopy surface and plant transpiration [64].\nThe evaporation\
    \ and transpiration process occur simultaneously and are often difﬁcult to\ndistinguish.\
    \ The predominance of each of these processes however varies at different crop\
    \ growth\nstages. At the initial crop growth stage, water is lost mainly in form\
    \ of evaporation from the soil\nsurface. As the development of the crop progresses,\
    \ transpiration becomes the major medium of water\nloss to the atmosphere [45].\n\
    The ET process is largely dependent on solar radiation, vapor pressure deﬁcit\
    \ of the atmosphere\nat any given time and wind speed. It is also inﬂuenced by\
    \ soil water content, the rate at which water\ncan be taken up from the soil by\
    \ the plant roots and crop characteristics (type, variety and growth\nstage) [64].\
    \ Readers are directed to [41,65] for a further discussion on the ET process.\n\
    The temporal dynamics of evapotranspiration on hourly or daily timescales is appropriate\n\
    for quantifying crop water use in the precision irrigation process. The United\
    \ Nations Food and\nAgriculture Organization Penman–Monteith (FAO-PM) equation\
    \ presents a procedure for computing\nhourly or daily ET values using standard\
    \ climatological measurements of solar radiation, air\ntemperature, humidity and\
    \ wind speed made at a height of 2 m above a fully transpiring grass\nsurface\
    \ [41]. These data can be obtained from automatic weather stations installed on\
    \ a speciﬁc ﬁeld or\nfrom a metrological network. The equation provides a basis\
    \ from which reference ET (ET from the\nwell-watered grass surface) for different\
    \ time periods can be calculated and to which ET from other\ncrops can be computed\
    \ using crop coefﬁcients, Kc [66]. The crop coefﬁcients are speciﬁc to each crop\n\
    and crop canopy cover, which is dependent on the crop growth stage. The Kc curve\
    \ deﬁned for a crop\nover its growth stage is generalized for regions with similar\
    \ climates. The Kc is however dependent on\nthe canopy dynamics including cover\
    \ fraction, leaf area index and greenness which may vary across\nregions with\
    \ similar climates [67]. This introduces errors into ET estimates derived using\
    \ the standard\nFAO-PM crop coefﬁcient approach. The FAO-PM method presents a\
    \ relatively easy procedure for\ndetermining the temporal dynamics of crop water\
    \ use. The crop coefﬁcient used in determining the\nactual ET of a particular\
    \ crop however needs to be estimated at each growth stage. It is noted in\nAllen\
    \ et al. [41] that reference ET can be overestimated by as much as 20% during\
    \ conditions of low\nevaporative demand.\nRemote sensing provides a means of overcoming\
    \ the shortcomings of the FAO-PM crop coefﬁcient\napproach of estimating crop\
    \ ET by providing real-time feedback on daily crop water use as inﬂuenced\nby\
    \ actual crop canopy dynamics, local climatic conditions and ﬁeld spatial variability\
    \ [68]. The remotely\nsensed normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) computed\
    \ from crop canopy reﬂectance\nmeasurements in the red and near-infrared (NIR)\
    \ wavelengths has been found to be a useful tool in\ncomputing accurate crop coefﬁcients\
    \ for a broad range of crops [69]. Singh et al. [70] has demonstrated\nthe use\
    \ of the calculated reference ET and the remotely sensed NDVI in estimating the\
    \ water use of\ncotton. A similar procedure has also been demonstrated by Farg\
    \ et al. [67] for estimating the daily\nwater use of wheat.\nThe surface renewal\
    \ analysis method presents an opportunity for assessing the real-time temporal\n\
    dynamics of crop water use. The surface renewal (SR) method is used to determine\
    \ the sensible heat\nwhich can then be applied to the energy balance equation\
    \ to determine the latent heat (i.e., ET) [71]. It is\nbased on analyzing the\
    \ temperature time series generated from monitoring the change in heat content\n\
    of air parcels that interact with the crop canopy. When an air parcel comes in\
    \ contact with the crop\ncanopy, the air temperature remains constant for a brief\
    \ time period known as the quiescent period.\nThe temperature of the air parcel\
    \ however increases after this time period as energy is transferred\nto it from\
    \ the crop canopy. The increase in temperature continues until the air parcel\
    \ is replaced by\ncooler air from the atmosphere. At this time, the temperature\
    \ of the air shows a sharp drop [72].\nA high frequency trace of this temperature\
    \ renewal event exhibits a ramp-like function. Applying\nSustainability 2017,\
    \ 9, 353\n9 of 29\nstructure function theory to the ramp function enables the\
    \ determination of the sensible heat ﬂux.\nThe instrumentation requirement for\
    \ an SR system is minimal, consisting of small diameter ﬁne wire\nthermocouples\
    \ or a two-dimensional sonic anemometer and a high frequency data acquisition\
    \ system\n(2 Hz to 10 Hz) [71]. Standard climatological measurements are also\
    \ required to obtain the other\nparameters in the energy balance equation.\nThe\
    \ SR technique requires that measurements are taken at a minimum height above\
    \ the crop\ncanopy. It is assumed that the canopy is homogeneous and able to absorb\
    \ all the momentum transferred\nto it by the ambient airﬂow [73]. This assumption\
    \ introduces errors in ET estimates over ﬁelds\nwith variable canopy structures.\
    \ Castellvi and Snyder [74] concluded that the technique can be\napplied for estimating\
    \ ET from short and dense canopy crops as they are mostly decoupled from\nthe\
    \ environment. The technique also requires calibration using an eddy covariance\
    \ system or a\nlysimeter. This may limit its practicality for farm-scale deployment.\
    \ The SR methodology proposed by\nCastellvi [75], however, does not require calibration.\
    \ Rosa and Tanny [76], Shapland and Snyder [72],\nand Rosa et al. [77] have reported\
    \ highly accurate hourly ET estimates from various crops using a\nsurface renewal\
    \ analysis system.\n5.4. Plant-Based Sensing\nThe importance of plant-based monitoring\
    \ becomes emphasized when studying the effect of\nwater deﬁcit on plants and its\
    \ relation to plant water status. The temporal dynamics of crop water use\ncan\
    \ be monitored using a number of plant-based methods. They include methods that\
    \ require direct\ncontact with the plant and those that require only proximal\
    \ contact with the plants [78]. The contact\nsensors are useful in monitoring\
    \ the temporal dynamics of the plant water status while the proximal\nsensors\
    \ are capable of assessing the spatial nature of crop water status across a ﬁeld\
    \ and hence\nwell suited for the precision irrigation process [11]. A good understanding\
    \ of the various aspects of\nplant water status and plant drought physiology is\
    \ important in the successful application of these\nsystems. Readers are directed\
    \ to [79,80] for a comprehensive overview of plant-based sensing methods\napplicable\
    \ in irrigation management. Plant-based sensing systems measure either the plant\
    \ water\ncontent, plant water potential or the plant physiological response to\
    \ moisture deﬁcits. A summary of\nvarious plant-based sensing systems is given\
    \ in Table 2. It should be noted that many of these require\nskilled manpower\
    \ and considerable management time for their operation.\nTable 2. Summary of plant-based\

    10 of 29\n5.5. Thermal Sensing\nPlant canopy temperature is a widely accepted\
    \ variable indicative of plant water status.\nThe stomata controls evaporative\
    \ cooling of the leaves based on soil water status and prevailing\nenvironmental\
    \ conditions.\nIt closes due to increased water deﬁcits and a reduction in plant\n\
    transpiration causing an increase in plant canopy temperature [91]. The measurement\
    \ of the crop\ncanopy temperature by infrared thermometry which is then normalized\
    \ using an index such as the\ncrop water stress index (CWSI) can be used in determining\
    \ the plant water status and its response to\nwater deﬁcits [79].\nThe CWSI is\
    \ a well-established method of accounting for the variation in canopy temperature\
    \ as\na function of prevailing microclimatological conditions and water deﬁcits\
    \ [92]. It relates the difference\nin the crop canopy temperature measured using\
    \ infrared thermometry to the air temperature as a\nfunction of atmospheric vapor\
    \ deﬁcit [93]. This temperature difference is then related to an upper\nand lower\
    \ temperature baseline to determine a water stress index. The upper baseline represents\n\
    a non-transpiring crop and the lower baseline represents a fully transpiring crop\
    \ under the same\nprevailing environmental condition [30]. The CWSI is a dimensionless\
    \ value of between 0 and 1, with a\nvalue of 0 indicating a well-watered crop\
    \ and a value of 1 indicating a severely water-stressed crop [93].\nBiotic factors\
    \ can also induce stress in a plant thus affecting transpiration rate, crop water\
    \ use and\ncanopy temperature. These biotic factors also affect leaf colour and\
    \ morphology which in turn affects\nthe optical properties of the crop canopy\
    \ [94]. In order to successfully apply infrared thermometry as a\ntool for assessing\
    \ plant water status, it is important to differentiate between abiotic (such as\
    \ water stress)\nand biotic stresses (such as plant diseases and pest infestation).\
    \ Multiband optical sensors could be\napplied in detecting various crop diseases\
    \ and crop infestation within a ﬁeld by computing vegetation\nindices based on\
    \ canopy reﬂectance measurements [33]. This has been applied by Garcia-Ruiz et\
    \ al. [95]\nfor detecting citrus greening and by Yang et al. [96] for detecting\
    \ infestation of green bugs and aphids\nin wheat. It may be useful to outﬁt precision\
    \ irrigation systems with these sensors.\nThe main advantage of thermal sensing\
    \ for precision irrigation application is related to the\nnon-contact and real-time\
    \ capability of the system. Infrared thermometry and thermography provide\nthe\
    \ opportunity to map the spatial variation in crop water status which can guide\
    \ in variable rate\nirrigation management. The use of thermal sensing for guiding\
    \ zone-speciﬁc water application has\nbeen demonstrated as noted in Section 2.\n\
    A major problem faced in applying the thermal sensing approach is the establishment\
    \ of the\nbaseline temperatures. In climates in which the air humidity is often\
    \ high, variations in wind speed and\nnet radiation introduce signiﬁcant errors\
    \ in the estimation of the lower limit baseline temperature [97].\nA number of\
    \ studies have been conducted to develop procedures for enhancing the possibility\
    \ of\napplying measurements of crop canopy temperature in inferring plant water\
    \ status in humid regions.\nJones [98] provides an excellent summary of these\
    \ research efforts. They include the use of well-watered\nplots to substitute\
    \ for empirical non-water stressed baselines, although these well-watered plots\
    \ are\nrarely available in practice. The use of artiﬁcial reference surfaces for\
    \ measuring baseline temperatures\nhas been proposed but it is reported that these\
    \ artiﬁcial reference surfaces differ signiﬁcantly in thermal\nand radiative properties\
    \ in comparison to real leaves. A modeling approach to simulating the canopy\n\
    resistance of well-watered plants has also been investigated but this is limited\
    \ by the difﬁculties\nencountered in correctly modeling stomata behavior and hence\
    \ canopy resistance. The possibility\nof including a wide range of metrological\
    \ data including net radiation and vapor pressure deﬁcit in\nderiving CWSI models\
    \ for humid climates has also been investigated. The mathematical complexity\n\
    typical of the models however limit their practical application.\nAnother problem\
    \ commonly encountered in applying infrared measurements of canopy\ntemperature\
    \ in inferring plant water status is the inclusion of soil temperature and other\
    \ background\ntemperature including the sky and stems in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ This usually leads to\nerrors in estimation of the canopy temperature as the\
    \ soil and background temperature are usually\nmany degrees different from the\
    \ canopy temperature [90]. Jones [99] proposed the use of narrow\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n11 of 29\nacceptance angle infrared sensors that can be positioned\
    \ to view only single leaves as a solution to this\nproblem. It has however been\
    \ found that the temperature estimates of single leaves determined\nby this method\
    \ is mostly not representative of the temperature of the plant canopy.\nA dense\n\
    deployment of infrared sensors may seem an alternative but this may be prohibitive\
    \ in terms of\ncost for practical applications.\nThe advancements in the ﬁeld\
    \ of thermal imagery and the recent availability of low-cost thermal\ncameras\
    \ has presented the possibility of overcoming the problems associated with the\
    \ inclusion of\nsoil and background temperatures in the measured canopy temperature.\
    \ Thermal imagery allows\nfor the average temperature of a deﬁned area to be obtained\
    \ and also the separation of background\ntemperature from the area of interest.\
    \ The temperature of a large number of individual leaves\nmaking up a canopy can\
    \ be included in an image while the soil and background temperature can be\ndiscarded\
    \ by applying automated image processing techniques [92]. Gonzalez-Dugo et al.\
    \ [100] has\ndemonstrated the use of thermal imagery in mapping the crop water\
    \ status in a commercial orchard\nin Spain. They also demonstrated the rapid mapping\
    \ of ﬁeld-scale crop water status by deploying\nthermal imaging equipment on an\
    \ unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).\nPlant-based sensing methods including thermal\
    \ sensing only provide information on the need for\nirrigation and provide no\
    \ information on the volume of irrigation application needed. They are used\n\
    in combination with soil-based sensing for this reason [19].\n6. Decision Support\n\
    A decision support system for irrigation management and scheduling provides a\
    \ framework\nfor incorporating various tools and techniques for site-speciﬁc irrigation\
    \ decisions. The widespread\ncommercial adoption of precision irrigation will\
    \ be predicated on the development of robust and\noptimal decision support systems\
    \ [19].\nA number of decision support systems schedule irrigation at predeﬁned\
    \ intervals and apply\npredeﬁned irrigation volumes. They do not incorporate any\
    \ form of sensor feedback on plant water\nstatus, soil water status and climatic\
    \ variables [101]. This ‘open-loop’ strategy is largely designed based\non heuristics\
    \ and historical data. Mareels et al. [102] suggested that this is an inefﬁcient\
    \ approach often\nleading to overwatering and waste of fertilizer and other supplemental\
    \ crop inputs.\nClosed-loop irrigation strategies aim to irrigate: when the soil\
    \ moisture content reaches a certain\nthreshold [103–105]; when plant sensors\
    \ indicate a certain stress threshold [93,106,107] or with feedback\nfrom crop\
    \ simulation models with the aim of attaining a certain yield, crop physiological\
    \ response or\neconomic objective [108]. These closed-loop irrigation strategies\
    \ have been shown to improve water\nuse efﬁciency in the production of horticultural\
    \ crops under protected environments. Environmental\nconditions in such production\
    \ systems can be controlled based on plant feedback which eliminates the\nstochastic\
    \ plant response often encountered in ﬁeld-scale crop production [109]. Belayneh\
    \ et al. [110]\nimplemented a wireless sensor network of soil moisture sensors\
    \ for closed-loop irrigation control in\na pot-in-pot nursery. A signiﬁcant reduction\
    \ in water use was achieved by the system. The authors\nalso reported a 2.7-year\
    \ payback period for the system. Chappell et al. [111] reported water savings\
    \ of\n83% for a closed-loop irrigation control system implemented in a protected\
    \ crop production system.\nThey noted that there was less occurrence of plant\
    \ diseases in the nursery due to the elimination of\nover-watering. Saavoss et\
    \ al. [112] reported a 65% increase in proﬁt due to the implementation of a\n\
    wireless sensor network-based closed-loop control system in a nursery. The authors\
    \ noted that the\nincrease in proﬁt was due to improvement in crop quality and\
    \ yield resulting from the precise control\nof irrigation applications.\nIn ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop production, the crop needs vary over time and space due to both biotic\
    \ and\nabiotic factors [9]. McCarthy et al. [113] noted that in these crop production\
    \ systems, closed-loop\nstrategies are unable to account for unknown crop dynamics,\
    \ the stochastic nature of climatic variables\nand crop response, and the time-varying\
    \ nature of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. This last\npoint is especially due\
    \ to crop growth, crop management and infestation of pests and diseases.\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n12 of 29\nThe closed-loop systems are also unable to consider\
    \ equipment and other operational limitations.\nMcCarthy et al. [114] concluded\
    \ that an optimal decision support system must be ‘adaptive’ with\nthe ability\
    \ of accommodating the temporal and spatial variability within the ﬁeld. The decision\n\
    support system must also have the capability of modifying irrigation decisions\
    \ in response to crop\nphysiology, uncertainties in climatic inputs, soil, irrigation\
    \ systems and water supply limitations,\neconomic considerations and the quality\
    \ of sensor feedback.\n6.1. Adaptive Decision Support\nThe characteristics of\
    \ a cropping system varies over time. Within a cropped system, the properties\n\
    that will typically vary within and between seasons include crop growth, soil\
    \ properties (due to\naddition of nutrients and other management processes) and\
    \ climate. This will have a direct inﬂuence\non the irrigation timing and volume\
    \ required for optimal crop growth [11].\nAn adaptive decision support system\
    \ is able to continuously re-adjust the irrigation scheduling\nalgorithm in order\
    \ to retain the desired performance of the irrigation system [114]. The adaptive\n\
    decision support system is able to utilize historical or real-time sensor data\
    \ to arrive at irrigation\ntiming and volume that adequately accounts for the\
    \ temporal and spatial variability in the ﬁeld [114].\nIn control theory an adaptive\
    \ control system is generally accepted as a control system able to adjust\nits\
    \ controller parameters based on sensor feedback from a process, such that the\
    \ controlled process\nbehaves in a desirable way [11]. McCarthy et al. [108] noted\
    \ that an adaptive decision support system\nfor irrigation may either be sensor-based\
    \ if they use direct sensor measurements for the irrigation\nstrategy or model-based\
    \ if they use a calibrated simulation model to aid irrigation decisions.\nThe\
    \ development of adaptive decision support systems presents an opportunity to\
    \ improve\nsustainability in precision irrigation through improved water use and\
    \ crop productivity. They will\nalso enhance synergistic applications of data\
    \ available from soil, plant and weather sensors to arrive at\noptimal irrigation\
    \ scheduling decisions [108].\nIn this section we will present a brief discussion\
    \ on state-of-the-art of adaptive decision support\nsystems. We will thereafter\
    \ discuss the opportunities these systems present in improving sustainability\n\
    in irrigated agriculture. Readers are referred to [113] for a comprehensive overview\
    \ on the application\nof advanced process control to irrigation, details on methods\
    \ of operation and a consideration of\nfundamental control concepts as they apply\
    \ to irrigation scheduling.\n6.1.1. Mechanistic Models\nA number of irrigation\
    \ decision support systems are based on complex physical models which\nclosely\
    \ resemble the actual physical system [115]. They are able to incorporate the\
    \ physiological and\nmorphological representation of the plant into the decision\
    \ support tool. Barnard and Bauerle [116]\ndescribed an irrigation scheduling\
    \ system based on the spatially explicit biophysical model, MAESTRA\n(Multi-Array\
    \ Evaporation Stand Tree Radiation A), which couples the within-canopy photosynthesis\n\
    and stomatal conductance. Data on leaf temperature, canopy aerodynamics and environmental\n\
    variables are used as inputs into the model to predict the plant transpiration.\
    \ They reported that\nthe model-based tool applied between 18% and 56% more water\
    \ than a sensing-based method for\nscheduling irrigation in four species. They,\
    \ however, noted that the model-based approach produced\ngreater tree growth.\
    \ Asher et al. [117] described a mechanistic model capable of inferring crop water\n\
    requirements. The model employs leaf temperature data as input for determining\
    \ the crop aerodynamic\ncharacteristics which is then used in the Penman–Monteith\
    \ equation for calculating the actual crop\nET. A major drawback of these mechanistic\
    \ models is that they include static parameters which, once\nidentiﬁed, are assumed\
    \ to remain constant over the cropping season. This is rarely so in practice as\
    \ the\ncropping system varies over time due to both biotic and abiotic factors.\n\

    \ hydrology can be applied in simulating the crop response to irrigation and cropping\
    \ system\nmanagement [115]. These simulation models provide the opportunity to\
    \ evaluate the beneﬁt of several\nprecision irrigation strategies as they eliminate\
    \ the need for time-consuming ﬁeld experiments [118].\nThey can be interfaced\
    \ with real-time sensor feedback from soil or plant sensors and weather data to\n\
    determine daily irrigation requirements of crops. They can also be used in predicting\
    \ the yield impact\nof an irrigation strategy. This is achieved by employing weather\
    \ forecast data in computing a daily soil\nmoisture balance and assessing the\
    \ impact of soil moisture deﬁcits on crop growth [118].\nDeJonge et al. [14] investigated\
    \ the effect of variable rate irrigation management on corn\nproduction in Iowa\
    \ using the CERES-maize model. Corn yield was compared for a period of 28 years\n\
    under simulated scenarios of no irrigation, scheduled uniform irrigation and precision\
    \ irrigation. They\nreported no signiﬁcant difference in corn yield and water\
    \ use between the uniform irrigation and\nprecision irrigation scenarios. Thorp\
    \ et al. [24] described a methodology for applying the Decision\nSupport System\
    \ for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) crop growth model in analyzing variable\
    \ rate\nmanagement practices including irrigation on crop growth and yield. The\
    \ platform enabled the\nevaluation of precision irrigation strategies on crop\
    \ performance in predeﬁned management zones.\nThese systems are however incapable\
    \ of real-time decision support and can only be applied using\nhistorical data.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [114] proposed a simulation framework, VARIwise, capable of real-time\
    \ decision\nsupport in precision irrigation. The simulation framework is capable\
    \ of incorporating real-time data\ninput from ﬁeld sensors in arriving at irrigation\
    \ decisions. The combination of different sensor inputs\ninto the simulation framework\
    \ enables adaptive decision support with the system being able to\nre-adjust irrigation\
    \ decisions based on plant feedback and also explore optimal control strategies.\n\
    Simulation models for use in irrigation decision support require extensive calibration\
    \ and\nvalidation to establish model accuracy. The limitation in data available\
    \ for this endeavour often\nlimit the use of the platforms to speciﬁc crops.\n\
    6.1.3. Artiﬁcial Intelligence\nArtiﬁcial intelligence presents the potential of\
    \ solving problems in precision irrigation which\nare complex, non-linear and\
    \ ill-deﬁned [119]. Artiﬁcial intelligence algorithms are able to emulate\nthe\
    \ human decision-making process when applied to a particular problem domain. They\
    \ have been\ndeployed for implementing adaptive decision support in irrigation\
    \ in form of artiﬁcial neural networks,\nfuzzy logic and expert systems with mixed\
    \ success to date [118–120].\nArtiﬁcial Neural Networks\nArtiﬁcial neural networks\
    \ (ANN) are non-linear mapping structures employed in modeling when\nthe underlying\
    \ data relationship is not well deﬁned. ANN are able to identify and learn correlations\n\
    between input data and corresponding target output values. They are able to predict\
    \ the outcome of\nnew independent data sets making them a useful tool in predictive\
    \ modeling [121]. ANN are well\nsuited for the irrigation decision support problem\
    \ that can often be complex and stochastic in nature.\nThese networks are also\
    \ adaptive in nature and are able to continuously learn in order to provide\n\
    optimal solutions to target problems in dynamic systems.\nKarasekreter et al.\
    \ [122] implemented an ANN for scheduling irrigation in a strawberry orchard\n\
    using soil moisture and its physical properties as model inputs. The system was\
    \ able to achieve water\nsavings of 20.5% and an energy saving of 23.9%. ANN however\
    \ require large datasets for training and\nare unable to describe the physical\
    \ dynamics of a system. This makes their use limited in real-time\ndecision support\
    \ tools.\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n14 of 29\nFuzzy Logic\nFuzzy logic is an\
    \ artificial intelligence algorithm that can be used to model a process and relate\
    \ it\nto human experience in arriving at decisions. A fuzzy logic system is made\
    \ up of a set used to classify\ninput data into membership classes, a decision\
    \ rule that is applied to each set which culminates in a\nhuman-like decision\
    \ output from the system [123]. A detailed description of the process is given\
    \ in [124].\nMousa and Abdullah [123] successfully applied a fuzzy logic model\
    \ in scheduling irrigation in\ndrip and sprinkler irrigation systems using ET,\
    \ soil moisture data and crop growth stage as model\ninputs. Prakashgoud and Desai\
    \ [124] employed a fuzzy logic system using soil moisture data, leaf\nwetness\
    \ and climatological data as model inputs in order to implement irrigation scheduling\
    \ decisions.\nThe system was capable of maintaining soil moisture thresholds in\
    \ the speciﬁed range. Giusti and\nMarsili-Libelli [125] described an adaptive\
    \ irrigation decision support system implemented with fuzzy\nlogic. The system\
    \ incorporates a predictive model of the soil moisture and an inference system\
    \ for\nmaintaining the soil moisture within an acceptable threshold. The system\
    \ was reported to adapt\nirrigation decisions to rainfall uncertainty and produced\
    \ water savings of 13.55% over a simulation\nperiod of 168 days.\nThe accuracy\
    \ of fuzzy logic systems is largely tied to an in-depth knowledge of the system.\
    \ They\nalso lack an inner mechanistic structure with the domain of applicability\
    \ limited to the range of training\ndata used in setting them up. Delgoda et al.\
    \ [115] suggested that the points mentioned makes decision\nmaking with a fuzzy\
    \ system an ad hoc process limiting its application in adaptive decision support.\n\
    Expert Systems\nAn expert system is a tool able to emulate the reasoning process\
    \ a human expert would employ\nin a decision-making process in his/her ﬁeld of\
    \ expertise. It captures the human decision-making\nexpertise and heuristics representing\
    \ it in a series of rules and facts [126]. An expert system typically\nconsists\
    \ of a knowledge base component and an inference engine that acts as a reasoning\
    \ tool [127].\nExpert systems are especially suited to dynamic problems that are\
    \ of a complex nature. They are also\nwell suited to dealing with incomplete and\
    \ uncertain data [128]. This makes them well suited for\nirrigation decision support\
    \ which often requires the input of experts to arrive at optimal decisions.\n\
    Expert systems applied in irrigation decision support can be classiﬁed as either\
    \ ‘expert systems\nproper’ or hybrid expert systems. A detailed review on the\
    \ application of expert systems in irrigation\ndecision support is given in [128,129].\
    \ The ‘expert systems proper’ class of irrigation decision support\ntools schedule\
    \ irrigation based on soil moisture and climatic data. They are unable to consider\
    \ the\ntime-varying nature of the cropping system (crop growth, disease and pest\
    \ infestation) to arrive at\noptimal irrigation decisions. They are also unable\
    \ to account for the stochastic nature of climatic\nvariables and are not well\
    \ suited for real-time applications [129].\nHybrid expert systems which are also\
    \ referred to as model-based expert systems combine\nalgorithmic techniques and\
    \ a knowledge-based component in solving problems relevant to its\napplication\
    \ domain. Its advantage in irrigation is that optimal irrigation decision can\
    \ be made\nby combining expert knowledge with data feedback from inﬁeld sensors,\
    \ data-driven models and crop\nsimulation models [130]. Thomson and Ross [131]\
    \ described a model-based expert system designed\nfor decision support in irrigation\
    \ management. The system employs feedback from soil moisture\nsensors to adjust\
    \ the input of a crop simulation model, PNUTGRO (peanut crop growth simulation\n\
    model), and also incorporates the capability of sensor feedback validation. The\
    \ system was reported\nto maintain soil moisture at the deﬁned thresholds. Goumopoulos\
    \ et al. [38] developed an expert\nsystem-based adaptive decision support platform\
    \ for zone-speciﬁc irrigation of strawberry plants.\nThe system includes a wireless\
    \ sensor network of soil, climate and plant sensors providing feedback\nfor the\
    \ decision support system. It also includes a machine learning process capable\
    \ of inferring new\nrules and extending the knowledge base from logged data sets.\
    \ The system was reported to reduce\nirrigation water consumption by around 20%.\
    \ A hybrid expert system based on real-time soil moisture\ndata with the capability\
    \ of incorporating plant models is described in Kohanbash et al. [132].\nSustainability\
    \ 2017, 9, 353\n15 of 29\nThe performance of an expert system is largely dependent\
    \ on the effectiveness of the knowledge\nacquisition process. An error in this\
    \ process will drastically affect the system reliability and its performance.\n\
    6.1.4. Learning Control\nLearning control decision support strategies perform\
    \ systems identiﬁcation using sensor feedback\nwithout deﬁning a mathematical\
    \ model [113]. Systems identiﬁcation models a dynamic system based\non a time\
    \ series of measured input/output data [133]. A comprehensive overview on the\
    \ theory of\nsystems identiﬁcation is presented in [134].\nIterative learning\
    \ control can be applied in systems with ill-deﬁned models that operate\nrepetitively\
    \ and assume the same initial condition after each iteration.\nIt is well suited\
    \ to the\nirrigation problem as irrigation scheduling and application is a repetitive\
    \ problem over the crop\nseason. The time-varying nature of the soil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system can also be viewed as an\nill-deﬁned problem. The strategy is also able\
    \ to improve system performance by eliminating the effects\nof a repeating disturbance\
    \ with undeﬁned dynamics. Applied to irrigation, this may be a measured\ncrop\
    \ response that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation. The temporal changes\
    \ in crop water use\nand weather conditions are not considered [113].\nMcCarthy\
    \ et al. [114] noted that a drawback of the iterative learning approach may be\
    \ the\ninefﬁcient systems identiﬁcation resulting from the slow system dynamics\
    \ of the crop system in\nresponse to irrigation events. This results from the\
    \ evaluation of the effect of only one irrigation\nvolume on plant response at\
    \ any water application event. They suggested that this drawback may be\neliminated\
    \ by applying the process of iterative hill climbing control. This learning control\
    \ strategy\nemploys an adaptive varied identiﬁcation process. A range of irrigation\
    \ volumes are applied at each\nirrigation event to a number of test cells on the\
    \ ﬁeld. The response in the test cell that best matches\nthe desired system performance\
    \ is identiﬁed as the optimal irrigation process. They reported that\nthe iterative\
    \ hill climbing control procedure was capable of maximizing cotton yield when\
    \ used\nwith a combination of plant and soil sensors to provide feedback for the\
    \ identiﬁcation procedure.\nTheir conclusions were however based on results from\
    \ a simulation study and a ﬁeld-based validation\nof the procedure was not reported.\n\
    The results of the learning control procedure are based solely on sensor measurements\
    \ and may be\nlargely affected by sensor drift as a model of the crop response\
    \ is not developed from the identiﬁcation\nprocedure. This method can be considered\
    \ more of a “brute force” approach than a scientiﬁcally based\napproach to scheduling\
    \ irrigation.\n6.1.5. Model Predictive Control\nModel predictive control (MPC)\
    \ is an industrial control approach employed in decision support\nfor large-scale\
    \ multivariable problems with multiple constraints. It has been successfully implemented\n\
    in the food industry, petrochemical industry and power generation among others\
    \ [135]. Model\npredictive control employs a plant model and optimization algorithm\
    \ to calculate plant inputs in order\nto achieve a future value of a performance\
    \ criterion. The system performance is predicted over a ﬁnite\nhorizon subject\
    \ to constraints on both the inputs and outputs of the plant [101]. Readers are\
    \ directed\nto [135–137] for an in-depth review of the theory of model predictive\
    \ control and its application in\nvarious industries.\nIn the case of irrigation,\
    \ applying a soil moisture balance model, the plant input will be the\nirrigation\
    \ amount, the plant output will be the soil moisture deﬁcit, and both crop ET\
    \ and precipitation\nvalues will be considered as disturbances as they cannot\
    \ be controlled. A prediction of future input\nvalues and disturbances is required\
    \ in an MPC system in order to determine the optimal system\noutput [138]. This\
    \ highlights the need for the incorporation of weather forecast data into the\
    \ MPC\nframework for irrigation decision support.\nModel predictive control appears\
    \ to be well suited to the domain of irrigation decision support.\nThe irrigation\
    \ problem has input constraints in terms of optimal irrigation volume and output\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n16 of 29\nconstraints in terms of soil moisture thresholds\
    \ and the desired plant response to water deﬁcits [135].\nOoi et al. [139], Lozoya\
    \ et al. [101] and Saleem et al. [135] described a model predictive control\n\
    framework for irrigation scheduling based on a soil moisture balance model. They\
    \ employed a\nsystem identiﬁcation procedure to generate a grey box model of the\
    \ soil–plant–atmosphere system\nwith a network of soil moisture sensors providing\
    \ real-time feedback to the control algorithm. They\nall reported the ability\
    \ of the MPC platform to sufﬁciently predict crop irrigation needs and also\n\
    observations of signiﬁcant water savings. The authors of the discussed systems\
    \ however fail to account\nfor the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use in the system dynamics. Delgoda et al. [138]\nnoted that an adequate consideration\
    \ of the uncertainty in rainfall and ET inputs into the water balance\nmodel employed\
    \ in the MPC framework will improve the capability of the MPC system.\nDelgoda\
    \ et al. [115] addressed the drawbacks noted in the above MPC frameworks by employing\n\
    disturbance afﬁne feedback control, an uncertainty modelling technique widely\
    \ applied in MPC\nto account for the stochastic nature of rainfall and crop water\
    \ use. A simple order model of soil\nmoisture dynamics is included in the system\
    \ to enable online calculation of model parameters, hence\naccounting for the\
    \ time-varying nature of soil-plant-atmosphere system. The authors reported an\n\
    optimal performance of the system in humid regions where considerable uncertainties\
    \ in climatic\nvariables exist.\n6.2. Commercial Sensor Applications in Adaptive\
    \ Decision Support\nManufacturers of sensors and a number of system integrators\
    \ are showing considerable interest\nin developing innovative tools that will\
    \ further optimize irrigation water use.\nA sensor integration project is described\
    \ by AgSmarts (Memphis, TN, USA). Moving irrigation\nsystems are equipped with\
    \ sensors which provide data on crop growth stage and soil proﬁle. Aquaspy\nsoil\
    \ moisture sensors (San Diego, CA, USA) positioned in various parts of the ﬁeld\
    \ also provide data\non soil moisture status which is applied in irrigation timing\
    \ and calculation of irrigation volumes.\nThese irrigation decisions are automatically\
    \ adjusted based on the varying water requirements at each\ncrop growth stage\
    \ [140].\nOmica, Italy has deployed a wireless sensor network of Libelium environmental\
    \ and soil moisture\nsensors (Zaragoza, Spain) on a maize farm in Italy to support\
    \ irrigation decisions. The sensors\nare interfaced to a geo-referenced decision\
    \ support system which enables zone-speciﬁc irrigation\nmanagement. The system\
    \ is able to predict crop yield based on irrigation timing and application\nvolumes\
    \ combined with historical yield data. This can then be applied in optimizing\
    \ the decision\nsupport system towards achieving a desired crop yield goal.\n\
    Most decision support systems presently produced for commercial use provide on/off\
    \ irrigation\ncontrol based on speciﬁed thresholds and plant/crop sensor feedback.\
    \ The incorporation of predictive\nmodels into these systems will enhance the\
    \ possibility of improving irrigation water use and crop\nyield [141].\n7. Opportunities\
    \ for Improving Sustainability\nSustainability is premised on the principle of\
    \ meeting the needs of the present generation without\ncompromising the ability\
    \ of future generations to meet their own needs. Sustainable agriculture is\n\
    focused on developing farming practices that are safe and do not have an adverse\
    \ impact on the\nenvironment [142].\nPretty [143] suggested that sustainable agriculture\
    \ integrates the main goals of environmental\nhealth and economic proﬁtability.\
    \ The efﬁcient and effective use of water is considered the main driver\nfor improving\
    \ sustainability in irrigated agriculture. This will involve the use of less water\
    \ for irrigating\ncrops and also preserving the quality of water sources. Conventional\
    \ irrigation practices apply water\nuniformly over a ﬁeld resulting in a high\
    \ volume of water use. Overirrigation may also result from\nthis practice which\
    \ causes leaching of nitrates and nutrients into ground water sources. An important\n\
    consideration would also be the use of less energy for operating water pumps and\
    \ irrigation application\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n17 of 29\nequipment. Soil\
    \ erosion continues to be a serious threat to sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\
    \ This\ncan be eliminated by applying precise irrigation volumes to reduce surface\
    \ runoff.\nPrecision irrigation presents a promising platform for improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated\nagriculture. This is especially hinged on the possibility of eliminating\
    \ the adverse environmental\nimpacts related to conventional irrigation practices\
    \ with the adoption of precision irrigation.\nThe economic proﬁtability of the\
    \ adoption of precision irrigation is however a very important point\nto consider.\
    \ This will be manifested in terms of improved crop yields and increased water\
    \ savings\nincluding the associated reduction in energy consumption resulting\
    \ from the optimal matching of\nirrigation inputs to the spatial water demands\
    \ of the ﬁeld, thus reducing costs [11].\nPrecision irrigation is predicated on\
    \ the hypothesis that the crop water requirements vary spatially\nacross a ﬁeld.\
    \ In heterogeneous crops such as fruit orchards, this variability is also due\
    \ to physiological\nfactors such as leaf area and fruit load [144]. It is assumed\
    \ that varying water application across the ﬁeld\nto meet this spatial crop water\
    \ need will improve crop yield and reduce the costs of associated inputs.\nSmith\
    \ et al. [11] noted that the evidence to support this hypothesis in commercial\
    \ crop production is\nnot readily found in literature.\nEvans and King [18] reviewed\
    \ much of the work prior to that date focused on analysing the\nimprovements in\
    \ crop yield and water savings achievable with precision irrigation and suggested\
    \ that\nthe greatest savings are likely to occur in humid climates by the increased\
    \ utilization of stored moisture\nand in-season precipitation. Results from simulation-\
    \ and ﬁeld-based case studies they reviewed\nshowed water savings of 0% to 26%\
    \ for well-watered crop production employing precision irrigation\nstrategies.\
    \ No signiﬁcant improvements in crop yields resulting from the adoption of precision\n\
    irrigation were reported. They concluded that in arid and semi-arid regions, precision\
    \ irrigation is\nmore suited to maximize net return rather than yield and it may\
    \ have greater potential in reducing\nirrigation water use in humid climates when\
    \ irrigating to maximally utilize in-season precipitation.\nThey further noted\
    \ that the economic beneﬁt of adopting precision irrigation for ﬁeld-scale crop\n\
    production is limited. This is because the cost of equipment, maintenance and\
    \ management is much\ngreater than the revenue improvements achieved as a result\
    \ of improved yield and water savings.\nThe payback period of implementing the\
    \ technology may also exceed the useful life of the water\napplication equipment,\
    \ typically placed at 15 years. A payback period ranging from 5 to 20 years is\n\
    noted in Smith et al. [11] for the adoption of precision irrigation for crop production\
    \ in New Zealand.\nEvans et al. [145] reviewed the adoption trends of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation in the USA covering\na period of 20 years. They noted that\
    \ about only 200 of the 175,000 moving irrigation systems in the\nUSA were ﬁtted\
    \ with variable rate water application technology. They suggested higher net returns\
    \ on\ninvestment as a stimuli for adoption of precision irrigation by growers.\
    \ Growers that had adopted the\ntechnology reported no signiﬁcant savings in water\
    \ and energy use in non-limiting water situations.\nThey noted that in more than\
    \ 20 years of research pertaining to variable rate irrigation management,\nthe\
    \ economic beneﬁt was yet to be demonstrated. This was attributed to the marginal\
    \ water savings\n(5%–15%) which is insufﬁcient to realize a payback for the initial\
    \ investment in the water application\ntechnology. They concluded that an economic\
    \ strategy that optimizes net return rather than total\nreturns for the technology\
    \ should be adopted as a long-term investment goal.\nHeeren et al. [146] conducted\
    \ a simulation study to assess the reductions in pumping costs\nthrough the adoption\
    \ of precision irrigation in 49,224 centre-pivot irrigated ﬁelds in Nebraska,\
    \ USA.\nThe study focused on applying variable rate water applications in mining\
    \ undepleted available water.\nThey noted that the reduction in pumping costs\
    \ achieved from the adoption of precision irrigation\nin all ﬁelds may be negligible\
    \ in comparison to the cost of variable rate water application equipment.\nThey\
    \ concluded that the adoption of this technology will be economically justiﬁable\
    \ only with an\nincrease in energy costs.\nAn economic evaluation of spatially\
    \ varied irrigation applications is presented in Lee [147].\nThe study assessed\
    \ energy savings resulting from pumping lesser volumes of water for irrigation\
    \ on\na 67-acre ﬁeld in Wyoming. The cost of installing the variable rate water\
    \ application equipment on\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n18 of 29\nthe ﬁeld was\
    \ reported as $29,513 with a useful equipment life of 15 years. The yearly return\
    \ for the\nequipment based on energy savings achieved was computed as $1816.71,\
    \ which equates to a payback\nperiod of 16.25 years. This suggests that a payback\
    \ will only be realized for the technology outside the\nuseful life of the equipment.\n\
    Precision irrigation offers the beneﬁt of providing water conservation beneﬁts\
    \ by avoiding\noverirrigation and the associated adverse environmental impacts\
    \ [18]. Sadler et al. [148] discussed\nwater conservation strategies where precision\
    \ irrigation can potentially reduce the total water applied\nand improve the environmental\
    \ quality of irrigated ﬁelds. They suggested that programing zero\nirrigation\
    \ amounts to non-cropped areas will improve water conservation using precision\
    \ irrigation.\nThey also noted that adjusting spatial water application based\
    \ on the inﬁltration rate of the soil and\nsoil water storage capacity will reduce\
    \ the occurrence of surface runoff and soil erosion. Surface runoff\nand leaching\
    \ were identiﬁed as the major avenues for loss of nutrients from the soil. They\
    \ suggested\nthe occurrence of this can be eliminated by spatial application of\
    \ precise irrigation volumes based on\nthe soil water-holding characteristics.\
    \ They presented several case studies in which the adoption of\nprecision irrigation\
    \ has been demonstrated to enhance the environmental quality of irrigated ﬁelds.\n\
    They concluded that precision irrigation has the capability of improving water\
    \ use efﬁciencies while\nreducing the adverse environmental impacts associated\
    \ with conventional irrigation practices.\nThe results from the above studies\
    \ show that precision irrigation is a proven tool for improving\nsustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture in terms of enhancing environmental health. Its economic\n\
    justiﬁcation in terms of signiﬁcant yield improvements and water savings is however\
    \ limited.\nEvans and King [18] suggested that the lack of signiﬁcant improvements\
    \ in yield response when\nemploying precision irrigation may result from the fact\
    \ that the yield response to the water curve\nnear maximum yield (100% ET) is\
    \ almost ﬂat, with small changes in water applied using precision\nirrigation\
    \ having little effect on yield. The majority of these precision irrigation studies\
    \ have used only\nsoil data for irrigation management. The local microclimate\
    \ and crop genetics may however have a\ndirect inﬂuence on the yield response\
    \ of the crops.\nSoil moisture status may also not provide a complete indication\
    \ of crop water status, rather the\nplant may be the best indicator of water availability.\
    \ The decision support systems employed by\ncurrent precision irrigation systems\
    \ assume that the soil–plant–atmosphere system never varies with\ntime. The characteristics\
    \ of the crop, soil and climate vary within the season altering the timing and\n\
    optimal amount of irrigation volume required at any irrigation application event.\n\
    We argue that the incorporation of multiple sensed variables (plant, soil and\
    \ weather data) will\nenhance the possibility of arriving at optimal irrigation\
    \ decisions and hence an improvement in\neconomic outcomes. This should be integrated\
    \ with a decision support system that has the capability\nto adapt to the time-varying\
    \ nature of the cropping system. The decision support system should also\nhave\
    \ the capacity to ‘learn’ in order to improve its performance based on experience\
    \ and a target crop\nproduction function. We discuss how this can be achieved\
    \ by exploiting improvements in monitoring\nand management considerations.\n7.1.\
    \ Monitoring Considerations\nA precision irrigation system is designed to apply\
    \ water at a differential rate in response to the\ntemporal and spatial variation\
    \ in crop water need across a ﬁeld. This process is supported by a number\nof\
    \ sensors providing data to a real-time decision support system. These sensors\
    \ include weather\nstations, soil moisture sensors, environmental sensors, plant\
    \ sensors and thermal sensors which may\nbe integrated into a wireless sensor\
    \ network. A careful design of these sensing systems including a\nconsideration\
    \ of factors affecting their performance is crucial in realizing the goal of improved\
    \ water\nuse through precision irrigation.\nDielectric soil moisture sensors sense\
    \ the water content of the immediate soil in their zone\nof inﬂuence. The zone\
    \ of inﬂuence reported for most commercial dielectric soil moisture sensors\n\
    corresponds to a cylindrical measurement volume of 1.5 L [149]. It is therefore\
    \ important to install\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n19 of 29\nthe sensors in\
    \ areas representative of the soil moisture available for plant use. The normal\
    \ practice\nemployed by most users is to place the sensors in the driest regions\
    \ of the ﬁeld or in the regions\ncomprising of a soil proﬁle with the lowest available\
    \ water-holding capacity [150]. Adopting this\napproach will most likely lead\
    \ to wetter regions in the ﬁeld receiving more frequent irrigation which\nwill\
    \ consequently result in overirrigation. A more efﬁcient approach is to deﬁne\
    \ irrigation management\nzones and place a number of sensors in each management\
    \ zone to give the average soil moisture\nestimate. This may however be limited\
    \ by cost.\nA structured installation proﬁle is also necessary in order to capture\
    \ soil water movement and\navailability. It is recommended that sensors should\
    \ be installed at each soil horizon along the plant\nrooting zone [151]. An accepted\
    \ convention is the installation of sensors at three to four depths along\nthe\
    \ rooting zone (1 per 25% of total rooting depth). The sensor located on the uppermost\
    \ soil proﬁle\nis able to detect precipitation events, the sensor in the deepest\
    \ part of the proﬁle is able to detect\ndrainage and the other sensors located\
    \ midway in the soil proﬁle are able to capture soil moisture\ndynamics useful\
    \ in supporting irrigation scheduling decisions [152]. The variation in soil properties\n\
    at the different rooting depths should also be taken into account. With an increasing\
    \ knowledge of\nthe site, it is usually possible to install the sensors at two\
    \ depths and still adequately capture the soil\nmoisture dynamics. The soil moisture\
    \ sensors should also be deployed using soil-speciﬁc calibration\nequations to\
    \ enable accurate estimates of soil moisture content.\nThe actual crop evapotranspiration\
    \ can vary spatially and temporally under conditions of\nunrestricted water supply.\
    \ These variations can be the result of several factors including differences\n\
    in crop genetics, plant density, weed competition, pest intensity, nutrient availability\
    \ and stage of\ngrowth [18]. Addressing the variation in ET across a ﬁeld may\
    \ result in signiﬁcant water savings.\nThe accurate measurement of evapotranspiration\
    \ is crucial in arriving at optimal irrigation\ndecisions [71]. The FAO-PM procedure\
    \ for calculating ET which is applied in many precision irrigation\nsystems relies\
    \ on information from weather stations applied in calculating a reference ET which\
    \ is\nadjusted for speciﬁc crops using crop coefﬁcients. This calculated ET is\
    \ assumed to be uniform for every\npart of the ﬁeld. This will however result\
    \ in the application of inaccurate irrigation volumes to replace\ncrop water use,\
    \ owing to the spatial nature of the actual ET. The application of the NDVI technique\n\
    in determining site-speciﬁc crop coefﬁcients provides a platform for overcoming\
    \ this challenge.\nThe surface renewal analysis procedure also presents a promising\
    \ tool for quantifying the actual\ncrop ET. It is however best suited to homogeneous,\
    \ short and dense canopies.\nPlant-based measurements provide the best indication\
    \ of plant water status as they provide a direct\nmeasure of the plants’ response\
    \ to soil moisture availability and climatic demand. An efficient plant-based\n\
    monitoring system should however respond sensitively to the slightest change in\
    \ water deficits.\nMeasurements of leaf water potential and sap ﬂow are contact\
    \ methods which give direct\ninformation on plant water status but their spatial\
    \ resolution is limited as many samples are required\nto effectively monitor the\
    \ dynamics of ﬁeld-scale plant water status [153]. Infrared thermometry has\n\
    provided a robust platform for assessing plant water status. The (CWSI calculated\
    \ from the infrared\nmeasurements of crop canopy temperature can adequately quantify\
    \ ﬁeld-scale crop water status with\nhigh spatial and temporal resolution. This\
    \ presents a robust and cost-effective tool for use in precision\nirrigation.\
    \ Its application in humid regions is however marred with difﬁculties.\nA systems\
    \ engineering approach can be applied in overcoming the difficulties encountered\
    \ with\napplying the CWSI in humid climates. A mathematical model derived using\
    \ this approach may adequately\nsimulate the real-time dynamics of the baseline\
    \ temperatures required for computing the index.\nA summary of the technology\
    \ gaps and reﬁnements necessary in monitoring tools in order to\nachieve robust\
    \ precision irrigation management is presented in [11]. They include the limited\
    \ volume\nof inﬂuence, high cost and the need to improve the measurement accuracy\
    \ of soil moisture sensors.\nThe reﬁnements recommended include the development\
    \ of low cost soil measurement sensors with\na wider volume of inﬂuence, low cost\
    \ and resilient wireless communication networks able to link\nspatially deployed\
    \ soil moisture sensors and the development of smart calibration software in order\n\
    Sustainability 2017, 9, 353\n20 of 29\nto improve the accuracy of soil moisture\
    \ sensors. The technology gaps identiﬁed in plant sensing\ntechnology include\
    \ the limited knowledge of irrigation thresholds and quantity, and low spatial\n\
    resolution. The reﬁnements recommended include the integration of plant-based\
    \ sensing with soil\nmoisture sensing tools in order to determine irrigation volumes,\
    \ calibration of infra-red thermography\nagainst physiologically explicit plant\
    \ measurements in order to determine critical thresholds and the\ndeployment of\
    \ IR thermography tools on low altitude UAVs to further enhance spatial coverage.\n\
    A combination of multiple sensor inputs deployed at a density that captures spatial\
    \ variability\nis therefore likely to yield the most robust and accurate solution\
    \ for precision irrigation. This will\nensure that the decision support system\
    \ is robust to data availability, gaps and deﬁciencies. This will\ninclude data\
    \ from soil, weather and plant sensors [11]. An important consideration will also\
    \ include\ndeveloping cost-effective and user-friendly tools which will enhance\
    \ the adoption of these adaptive\nsystems by farmers.\n7.2. Management Considerations\n\
    Management can perhaps be viewed as the most vital aspect of a precision irrigation\
    \ system.\nManagement acts as an interface between monitoring and decision support,\
    \ culminating into irrigation\ndecisions. This enables the implementation of vital\
    \ management decisions of when and where to\napply irrigation and also the irrigation\
    \ volumes to be applied. The decision support system is perhaps\nthe management\
    \ backbone of a precision irrigation system and its proper implementation is vital\
    \ for\nimproving sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\nThe adaptive decision\
    \ support tools discussed have the capability of improving crop yield and\nwater\
    \ savings when deployed as part of a precision irrigation system. Smith et al.\
    \ [11] noted that\nthe simulation of adaptive decision support strategies can\
    \ be used in identifying optimal irrigation\nscheduling decisions. A simulation\
    \ tool capable of representing a range of ﬁeld conditions at different\nspatial\
    \ and temporal scales is considered ideal. Such a simulation framework is presented\
    \ in [114].\nModel-based decision support systems using feedback from multiple\
    \ sensors may present a\nplatform for arriving at optimal water applications.\
    \ MPC appears to be ideally suited for achieving the\naim of improving sustainability\
    \ in irrigated agriculture. A decision support system based on MPC\nemploys an\
    \ optimization algorithm to implement an input strategy with the best performance.\n\
    McCarthy et al. [113] noted that MPC implemented for a precision irrigation system\
    \ could involve\nthe use of real-time data from ﬁeld sensors to calibrate a crop\
    \ or soil model and then optimizing this\ncalibrated model to arrive at optimal\
    \ irrigation scheduling decisions. A combination of data from soil\nmoisture sensors,\
    \ thermal sensors and weather sensors would be appropriate for MPC. The data from\n\
    the sensors would most likely be required daily, as measurements are not required\
    \ at a high temporal\nresolution to calibrate the model. A dense deployment of\
    \ these sensors is however required to account\nfor the spatial nature of ﬁeld-scale\
    \ crop water use. The thermal sensors may be mounted on a moving\nplatform for\
    \ spatial data collection across the ﬁeld.\nEquipment availability, irrigation\
    \ system capacity and other operational considerations can be\nincorporated as\
    \ system-level constraints in an MPC-based decision support system. These constraints\n\
    can be considered to arrive at future irrigation scheduling decisions [113].\n\
    MPC uses a model’s simulation to determine the optimum irrigation application\
    \ timing and\nvolume. When combined with a soft sensing system, variables that\
    \ are not directly measured can be\ncontrolled and optimized. This presents a\
    \ possibility of applying decision support systems based on\nMPC in realising\
    \ a desired crop yield and also a water-saving goal [136].\nThere has been considerable\
    \ research into water use procedures that can achieve improved water\nsavings\
    \ in irrigated agriculture, particularly deﬁcit irrigation. Deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ (DI) is an irrigation\nstrategy in which a crop is exposed to a level of water\
    \ stress at certain growth stages in its development\n(regulated deﬁcit irrigation)\
    \ or throughout its growth season. The growth stage in which the plant is\nsubjected\
    \ to water stress is predetermined as a drought tolerant stage. The goal of deﬁcit\
    \ irrigation is\nthat there will be little adverse effect on yield and irrigation\
    \ water can be conserved [154]. Evans and\nSustainability 2017, 9, 353\n21 of\
    \ 29\nKing [18] suggested deﬁcit irrigation as a tool for improving water use\
    \ in precision irrigation. They\nnoted that it can be applied in maximizing net\
    \ returns and conserve large amounts of water in arid\nand semi-arid regions.\n\
    It is however important to investigate the response of different crops to water\
    \ deﬁcits including\ntiming tolerances in order to develop optimal deﬁcit irrigation\
    \ strategies that can be integrated into\nthe precision irrigation decision support\
    \ framework. It is also important to investigate the economics\nof yield reduction\
    \ associated with deﬁcit irrigation strategies. O’Shaughnessy et al. [33] suggested\
    \ that\nimplementing deﬁcit irrigation as part of precision irrigation management\
    \ will involve the continuous\nassessment of crop stress and growth stage throughout\
    \ the growing season. This will be instrumental in\navoiding temporary severe\
    \ stress which could result in uneconomic reduction in crop yield or quality.\n\
    The high cost of the component technologies of precision irrigation including\
    \ soil, plant and\nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable rate\
    \ water application systems is presently\na constraint to the wide-scale adoption\
    \ of this technology by farmers [148]. The minimal yield\nimprovements and water\
    \ savings currently achieved through ﬁeld-scale precision irrigation may\nnot\
    \ justify the initial capital investment required for its adoption. As fresh water\
    \ resources become\nscarcer, it is expected that more premium will be placed on\
    \ water abstracted for irrigated agriculture.\nRegulatory agencies may also require\
    \ farmers to continuously demonstrate the efﬁcient use of water.\nThese factors\
    \ may promote the adoption of precision irrigation by farmers [155].\nA conceptual\
    \ model-based decision support system that uses the full range of plant, weather\
    \ and\nsoil data for irrigation management is illustrated in Figure 1. This is\
    \ currently being developed by the\nauthors. It involves the integration of various\
    \ sensing systems, dynamic modeling, machine learning\nand model predictive control\
    \ into an adaptive decision support system for precision irrigation.\nSustainability\

    \ including soil, plant and \nweather sensors, decision support systems and variable\

    Technological innovations that can improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture\
    \ form an\nimportant vehicle for actualizing the optimal use of limited water\
    \ resources. Precision irrigation\nhas been demonstrated as such an innovation,\
    \ though presently the economic beneﬁt related to\nthe adoption of this technology\
    \ at ﬁeld-scale crop production is minimal.\nThis is because the\npotential for\
    \ yield improvements and water savings may not cover the cost of technology required\
    \ for\nits implementation.\nThe application of adaptive control techniques to\
    \ irrigation decision support and improvements\nin monitoring tools has the capability\
    \ of dealing with the time-varying and stochastic nature of the\nsoil–plant–atmosphere\
    \ system while also considering operational limitations in arriving at optimal\n\
    irrigation decisions. This ultimately presents a platform for actualizing the\
    \ environmental and\neconomic goals of sustainability in irrigated agriculture.\n\
    A robust design of monitoring tools including a proper combination of soil, weather\
    \ and plant\nsensors is however vital for the proper operation of an adaptive\
    \ decision support system. The decision\nsupport system should be able to account\
    \ for the varying crop water requirements within season as a\nresult of both biotic\
    \ and abiotic factors. The decision support system should also consider agronomic\n\
    objectives to ensure the optimal irrigation strategy is delivered by the precision\
    \ irrigation system.\nThe high cost of sensors and the requirement for dense deployment\
    \ in order to obtain data at\nhigh spatial resolutions is presently a constraint.\
    \ The large dataset required for the calibration of crop\nsimulation models is\
    \ also another signiﬁcant problem. Future research needs include the development\n\
    of cost-effective soil moisture sensors with wider spheres of inﬂuence, identiﬁcation\
    \ of irrigation\nthresholds for plant-based sensors and the development of self-learning\
    \ crop simulation models that\nare able to infer relationships from a limited\
    \ data set. The ﬁeld evaluation of adaptive decision support\nsystems would also\
    \ be beneﬁcial in quantifying their sustainability improvement potential.\nAcknowledgments:\

    Control engineering approaches may be applied to irrigation management to make
    better use of available irrigation water. These methods of irrigation decision-making
    are being developed to deal with spatial and temporal variability in field properties,
    data availability and hardware constraints. One type of control system is advanced
    process control which, in an irrigation context, refers to the incorporation of
    multiple aspects of optimisation and control. Hence, advanced process control
    is particularly suited to the management of site-specific irrigation. This paper
    reviews applications of advanced process control in irrigation: mathematical programming,
    linear quadratic control, artificial intelligence, iterative learning control
    and model predictive control. From the literature review, it is argued that model-based
    control strategies are more realistic in the soil–plant–atmosphere system using
    process simulation models rather than using ‘black-box’ crop production models.
    It is also argued that model-based control strategies can aim for specific end
    of season characteristics and hence may achieve optimality. Three control systems
    are identified that are robust to data gaps and deficiencies and account for spatial
    and temporal variability in field characteristics, namely iterative learning control,
    iterative hill climbing control and model predictive control: from consideration
    of these three systems it is concluded that the most appropriate control strategy
    depends on factors including sensor data availability and grower’s specific performance
    requirements. It is further argued that control strategy development will be driven
    by the available sensor technology and irrigation hardware, but also that control
    strategy options should also drive future plant and soil moisture sensor development.

    © 2021 Introduction A control engineering approach is one solution being developed
    to automate irrigation management. Figure 1 illustrates a generic irrigation control
    system that uses the full range of plant, weather and soil data for irrigation
    management. In Fig. 1: Fig. 1 Generic control scenario for irrigation application
    (adapted from McCarthy et al. 2010a) Full size image the ‘decision support system’
    embodies the control strategy; ‘actuation’ is the action of adjusting the irrigation
    volume and/or timing; and ‘application’ is the resulting physical amount and timing
    of water and fertiliser applied to the crop. This process can be applied to both
    constant and spatially varied irrigation management at a range of time scales.
    Similarly, the actuation of the irrigation volume application may be either manual
    or automated. Control strategies can be either ‘open-loop’ if they do not use
    sensor feedback to adjust the control, or ‘closed-loop’ if the response of the
    system is monitored and used to adjust the control. Open-loop control strategies
    are outside the scope of this paper. Closed-loop irrigation control strategies
    in the literature have been developed using either infield soil sensors that aim
    to regulate the soil moisture content (Luthra et al. 1997; Smajstrla and Locascio
    2000; Dukes and Scholberg 2005); plant sensors to irrigate when the plant has
    reached a stress point (Evett et al. 2002; Peters and Evett 2008); or calibrated
    crop production models to achieve either a desired soil moisture deficit (Capraro
    et al. 2008), or maximise yield, profit or water productivity (i.e. water use
    efficiency, Brown et al. 2010). There are no published comparisons of performance
    between these approaches. The reported closed-loop irrigation control approaches
    do not typically consider uncertainties associated with unknown crop dynamics,
    nor robustness with respect to sensing requirements, irrigation delivery capability
    or water availability. These factors are known to be spatially varied and subject
    to change between and during crop seasons. In addition, the irrigation application,
    rainfall volumes, soil moisture content and crop response (e.g. plant condition,
    vegetative or reproductive growth) are likely to be stochastic in nature. An engineering
    approach generally labelled ‘advanced process control’ is now routinely applied
    for manufacturing and chemical process systems and combines elements from many
    disciplines spanning classical control engineering, signal processing, statistics,
    decision theory and artificial intelligence (Ikonen and Najim 2002). The application
    of advanced process control to irrigation presents opportunities to improve irrigation
    water use and crop performance. Advanced process control techniques can be used
    for irrigation systems that apply irrigation uniformly over a field, but also
    those that apply site-specific irrigation where the crops have spatially and temporally
    varying irrigation requirements. The variability can be caused by soil type, crop
    type, crop condition (stress, etc.) and meteorological conditions (e.g. rainfall).
    These factors are discussed further in Smith et al. (2009). Research into variable-rate
    irrigation technology for centre pivot and lateral move irrigation machines has
    spanned 20 years and produced a number of commercial systems (e.g. Farmscan, Valmont,
    Zimmatic). However, the greatest limitation to the adoption of variable-rate irrigation
    is associated with developing optimal irrigation schedules (i.e. volume and timing
    of irrigation) or irrigation prescriptions (Evans et al. 1996). Recent evidence
    (LaRue, J, pers. comm., March 2011) suggests that there is a poor adoption rate
    of variable-rate irrigation and that growers with these systems are not continuing
    to use them for variable-rate irrigation, e.g. only four out of 100 growers who
    purchased Farmscan systems in Georgia, USA in the previous 5 years are still using
    the variable-rate technology. Existing sensors developed for agricultural system
    control and specifically used in irrigation management include remote imagery,
    on-the-go plant measurement (i.e. continuous measurements from sensors mounted
    on on-farm vehicles/machines), soil moisture sensing arrays and infrared thermometry.
    However, the currently-developed advanced process control systems may not necessarily
    require these sensors. Similarly, these sensors may not be applicable to the best
    performing advanced process control strategies. Hence, it is important to identify
    both the most promising advanced process control strategies and their sensing
    requirements, and also the strategies that can be applied to the currently available
    sensors. Scope, structure and overview This paper reviews the existing literature
    of advanced process control in irrigation and their sensor requirements and ability
    to adapt to the infield conditions. Five general methods of advanced process control
    that have been applied to irrigation in the available literature are discussed
    here: mathematical programming; linear quadratic control; artificial intelligence;
    model predictive control; and learning control. Consideration of the requirements
    of control strategies for irrigation leads to the identification of three ‘advanced
    process control’ strategies capable of overcoming at least some of the limitations
    of existing irrigation control approaches. Each has different requirements of
    measurement information as well as temporal and spatial resolution. In this paper
    the strategies are described as ‘sensor-based’ if they directly use measurements
    to make irrigation decisions; and ‘model-based’ if they use a model (often with
    sensor input) to aid irrigation decisions. Sensor- and model-based irrigation
    control strategies often have different sensor data requirements because of the
    nature of the control. For example, a sensor-based control strategy could use
    feedback from infrared thermometers or soil moisture sensors, whilst a model-based
    control strategy requires soil properties and plant growth information to calibrate
    the crop model. The crop model is calibrated to improve the accuracy of the model
    and involves adjusting model parameters according to comparisons between modelled
    and measured data. The specific model calibration procedure would vary depending
    on the crop and model but may be automated. McCarthy et al. (2011) demonstrates
    the calibration of the Australian cotton model OZCOT. Hence, this paper also discusses
    the sensor requirements of the reviewed control strategies. Advanced process control
    in irrigation: progress to date Mathematical programming Irrigation events can
    be scheduled using linear programming (Holzapfel et al. 1986; Azamathulla et al.
    2009), nonlinear programming (Ghahraman and Sepaskhah 1997) or dynamic programming
    (Rao et al. 1988; Naadimuthu et al. 1999), either singly or in combination. These
    involve making irrigation decisions for each growth stage to maximise the farm’s
    income (Rao et al. 1992). The models used are typically either heuristic crop
    yield production formulae (Benli and Kodal 2003) or daily, physically-based soil–plant–atmosphere
    models (Sunantara and Ramirez 1997). Common objective functions (formulae) used
    in mathematical programming aim to optimise water allocation among a single or
    various crops, or maximise the profit of the irrigation. The constraints that
    were generally defined in the mathematical programming applications were water
    availability, agricultural land and cropping patterns. Dynamic programming is
    the most widely used mathematical programming approach to irrigation scheduling
    (Shang and Mao 2006). However, dynamic programming has considerable computational
    requirements. To help overcome this it is common to: (i) discretise the underlying
    water balance and prediction models; (ii) use both linear programming and dynamic
    programming models; and (iii) assume irrigation events are scheduled at regular
    (i.e. weekly) intervals (Yaron and Dinar 1982; Stoecker et al. 1985; Rao et al.
    1990). An exception of case (ii) is Sunantara and Ramirez (1997) where irrigation
    events could be scheduled on any set date rather than at regular intervals or
    by growth stage. An alternative approach to reduce the computational complexity
    of mathematical programming is to use neural networks to sample only a fraction
    of the state space without significantly simplifying the model (Schütze and Schmitz
    2009). There are often large uncertainties in weather (e.g. rainfall, evapotranspiration)
    and water supply during crop seasons. Stochastic approaches may potentially be
    applied to consider uncertainty in spatial variability of unmeasured variables.
    Stochastic rainfall input is of particular importance if rainfall is the major
    water supply source during the crop season. Ramirez and Bras (1985) and Sunantara
    and Ramirez (1997) demonstrated significant performance improvements by considering
    the stochasticity of rainfall inputs using stochastic dynamic programming for
    optimal irrigation scheduling. However, Yaron and Dinar (1982) found little uncertainty
    in rainfall during a field evaluation of a combined linear/dynamic programming
    model in Mediterranean conditions, because the rainfall occurred outside of the
    cotton growing season. Uncertainty in crop water demands (Ganji et al. 2006) and
    spatial variability of soil properties (Russo 1986) have also been considered
    in irrigation optimisation using mathematical programming. Yaron and Dinar (1982)
    speculated that water prices, water supply hydraulics, and measured soil moisture
    and crop response should all be calibrated within the model to adapt to the local
    conditions. Spatial variations of soil and climate have been incorporated into
    linear programming models used for corn, drybeans and soybeans (He 1999). Linear
    quadratic control Linear quadratic control is a branch of ‘optimal control theory’
    1 in which control is subject to quadratic costs (Lewis and Syrmos 1995). Protopapas
    and Georgakakos (1990) simulated an optimal control system which determined daily
    irrigation rates using a soil and plant state space model. The objective functions
    aimed to achieve a final state while minimising irrigation application and minimising
    salinity. Protopapas and Georgakakos (1990) noted that a field implementation
    would require the consideration of more types of constraints and considerations.
    This would be expected to include irrigation delivery constraints and consideration
    of infield measurements of soil and plant response to calibrate the model. Shani
    et al. (2004) implemented an optimal control system to determine optimal moisture
    dynamics during the crop season. This approach was limited to determining the
    general soil moisture curve throughout the crop season rather than discrete irrigation
    events on set dates. Fieldwork verified that this approach outperformed the policy
    of yield maximisation for sunflowers. Artificial intelligence The numerical optimisation
    of irrigation management is computationally intensive and often requires model
    simplification and discretisation. Neural networks (Schmitz et al. 2002) and evolutionary
    algorithms 2 (Schmitz et al. 2007) have been developed to determine irrigation
    volume and timing to minimise irrigation application and maximise yield. These
    systems used a subsurface flow model to calculate the wetting profiles and train
    a neural network to provide irrigation parameters to achieve the desired soil
    moisture profile. Schmitz et al. (2007) demonstrated a 92% higher simulated yield
    for corn using evolutionary algorithms than using a dynamic programming approach
    which used a simplified model. An alternative approach used an evolutionary algorithm
    to determine the optimal irrigation volume and timing using a soil water balance
    model and a generic yield prediction model (de Paly and Zell 2009; de Paly et
    al. 2010). Model predictive control There has been significant research in using
    soil and crop models in irrigation management to forecast the process output (DeJonge
    et al. 2007). Model predictive control iteratively executes a model to optimise
    process inputs, rather than numerically operating on the model. Model predictive
    control forecasts the system performance over a finite horizon and uses an optimisation
    algorithm to determine which control action to take to achieve the desired performance
    (Mosca 1995). A model predictive control strategy was simulated to regulate soil
    moisture using a soil dynamics model (Park et al. 2009). The model parameters
    were calibrated using a genetic algorithm, real-time weather data and soil moisture
    measurements from capacitance probes. Learning control Control strategies that
    directly use sensor feedback without a model must perform system identification
    efficiently. This is because the optimisation procedure relies on field measurements
    and is not aided by predictions from a model of soil and crop response. One method
    of sensor-based control that has been applied to irrigation is iterative learning
    control (Moore and Chen 2006). Iterative learning control is used in systems that
    operate repetitively with the same initial conditions at each iteration (Ahn et
    al. 2007). Moore and Chen (2006) conceptualised such a controller to adjust the
    irrigation application flow rate to control the water or concentration of nutrients
    in the soil. This model did not consider temporal changes in crop water use or
    weather conditions; hence, the irrigation events were initiated at regular intervals
    to satisfy the condition that the same initial conditions are present before each
    irrigation event. The control strategy assumed that a sensor would be located
    in each cell of the field; however, in a field implementation this may not be
    practical. Discussion Mathematical programming and linear quadratic control use
    numerical methods to optimise irrigation application and/or timing. The computational
    requirements of these strategies were large even with the simplified crop model.
    This simplification resulted in temporal coarseness of the model, where irrigation
    was allocated to each growing stage or weekly time period. This lack of precision
    potentially results in sub-optimal performance and may restrict the application
    of numerical methods to real-time irrigation management. However, the mathematical
    programming strategies often considered uncertainty in rainfall and evapotranspiration
    which is practical in soil–plant–atmosphere systems. Artificial intelligence reduces
    the complexity of mathematical programming approaches while also optimising irrigation
    management at a daily time scale. Therefore, artificial intelligence-based control
    strategies are potentially more accurate than mathematical programming control
    strategies. Model predictive control iteratively executes crop models to optimise
    irrigation events over the prediction horizon. This strategy can use publicly
    available crop models (e.g. APSIM, McCown et al. 1996; DSSAT, Jones et al. 2003)
    rather than models in state space form. When used for this purpose, the crop models
    are ‘black-box’ because access is only provided to their inputs and outputs. The
    optimisation of irrigation using these ‘black-box’ models is inefficient compared
    with using numerical models; however, they are typically able to deal with complexities
    found in soil–plant–atmosphere systems (e.g. sprinkler spray patterns, English
    et al. 1992). Use of learning control requires that the variable being regulated
    be representative of overall plant status. This control strategy may require many
    irrigation events to achieve optimality because it is only learning from the measurement
    rather than also using prediction from a crop model. Hence, learning control is
    potentially less efficient than model-based control. In a real-time control system
    it is likely that model-based control systems would be integrated with weather,
    soil moisture and plant development sensing systems for model calibration. However,
    none of the strategies reviewed used this full data set to calibrate the model.
    Sensor considerations for advanced process control in irrigation Reviews have
    been conducted for soil moisture content sensors (Charlesworth 2004) and plant-based
    sensors (White and Raine 2008). These technologies either require direct contact
    or are non-contact and proximal (i.e. hand-held or machine mounted) or remote
    (e.g. airborne, satellite). Contact sensors provide a high temporal resolution
    of data for individual points in the field, whilst proximal sensors only provide
    information when the sensor passes over the field, either on an irrigation machine,
    tractor, aerial vehicle or satellite. Soil moisture sensors are typically fixed
    in the field, whilst plant sensors can be either fixed in the field or proximal.
    The combination of plant, soil and weather data that is used for irrigation control
    commonly depends on the sensor availability and grower preference. Similarly,
    the number of sensors that is required to monitor the in-field spatial variability
    depends on the type of sensor, amount of in-field variability and the grower’s
    preferences. No single sensor (either plant or soil) on its own will indicate
    the optimal water application volume for each irrigation event. Similarly, sensor-based
    irrigation control strategies that use only one data type (e.g. soil moisture
    or plant response) may not specifically optimise the water use or crop performance,
    but are required in situations of low data availability. In contrast, model-based
    control strategies using multiple sensors incorporate information from the soil–plant–atmosphere
    relationships that are defined in crop production models to identify optimal water
    applications. The spatial and temporal resolution of sensors required for site-specific
    advanced process control strategies is likely to depend on the type of control
    strategy. For example, model-based strategies may require measurements during
    each growth stage and following irrigation events to calibrate the model, whilst
    sensor-based strategies may require daily or sub-daily measurements to determine
    irrigation timing. Model-based strategies would be able to use the high spatial
    resolution and low temporal resolution data from proximal sensors. However, the
    higher measurement discrimination required by sensor-based strategies may only
    be achievable (at present) using fixed sensors. In a practical control system,
    a minimum number of fixed sensors would be installed in the field to minimise
    cost and labour but this might provide only low spatial resolution. Hence, soil
    sensors that are easy to install would potentially be appropriate for sensor-based
    strategies, e.g. the soil moisture sensor array reported by Vellidis et al. (2008),
    but such low-cost sensor arrays have yet to be proven adequate for sensor-based
    control. Model- and sensor-based control strategies typically have different data
    requirements. For example, the parameters of the models used by sections “Linear
    quadratic control”, “Artificial intelligence” and “Model predictive control” must
    be calibrated using measurements recognised by the model (e.g. soil moisture content,
    growth stage, plant height and crop coverage). In contrast, section “Learning
    control” uses measured responses to irrigation (e.g. soil moisture content, plant
    status measurements from infrared thermometers, Peters and Evett 2008). Development
    of sensors that measure parameters specifically for model calibration may be required,
    especially as the input parameters of models can vary depending on climate and
    crop type. Camera-based sensors have been proposed for irrigation management to
    measure plant parameters (McCarthy et al. 2009). Fundamental control concepts
    as they apply to irrigation The review of the current state of advanced process
    control systems for irrigation and sensor development in relation to control systems
    indicates that irrigation control strategies should be robust to (1) application
    hardware and water availability constraints; and (2) data availability limitations.
    Following Ogata (1990) the design of a control system that is practical in an
    irrigation environment requires consideration of stability, robustness and optimality,
    described below in order of significance in traditional control systems: 1. Stability
    is a primary requirement of control systems (Krstić et al. 1995) and characterises
    how a system reacts to disturbances (Hangos et al. 2001). A system is stable if
    the signals remain bounded (Isermann et al. 1992); however, stability is a difficult
    property to evaluate in adaptive control systems due to its dynamic nature (Friedland
    1996). 2. Robustness can be interpreted as stability under system disturbances
    (de Silva 2000). The robustness of a control system denotes the insensitivity
    to parameter changes, model errors (in model-based control) and disturbances (in
    input and control signals) (de Silva 2000). Robust control systems are able to
    account for uncertainty in the process parameters to guarantee the stability of
    the system (Landau et al. 1998). 3. The output of a control system should converge
    to the optimal value. Achieving optimality in control systems relies on optimisation
    techniques (Ogata 1990) and optimisation generally consists of searching the space
    of variable controller parameters as a function of the performance index to determine
    where the performance index is optimal (Ogata 1990). However, when considered
    in relation to the control of irrigation, the order of importance changes. Whereas
    control systems are traditionally designed with the greatest emphasis on stability
    (Åström 1990), it is anticipated that the most critical characteristic of systems
    designed for site-specific irrigation application will be robustness. This is
    because in any practical field implementation there are likely to be deficiencies
    in spatial and temporal data availability, and/or constraints on the irrigation
    system capacity or water availability. Optimality is likely to be the next most
    important principle in the design of an irrigation control strategy. To optimise
    automatic irrigation control, a performance index is typically optimised and the
    sensed variable/s used to calculate the performance index varies according to
    the strategy employed. For example, the irrigation applied may be optimised using
    daily measured data and for cotton this may involve determining the irrigation
    that maximises the square count (‘squares’ are flower buds on a cotton plant)
    or boll count after an irrigation event. Alternatively, predicted end of season
    characteristics (i.e. yield, water use efficiency) may be maximised using a process
    model. Stability is arguably the least significant of the control design principles
    in automatic irrigation control. This is because the soil–plant–atmosphere system
    has very slow dynamics compared with typical processes to which automatic control
    is commonly applied (namely electromechanical and many chemical processes) in
    which major changes often occur in less than a second. Although it is conceivable
    that an unusual change in the soil–plant–atmosphere system might cause some fundamental
    instability in the automatic control of irrigation, the system will not become
    unstable rapidly. Advanced process control approaches to irrigation The strategies
    of section “Advanced process control in irrigation: progress to date” and the
    control design principles of section “Fundamental control concepts as they apply
    to irrigation” can be applied to both uniform and site-specific irrigation control
    strategies. Smith et al. (2009) provides an introduction to the potential use
    of control systems to manage spatial and temporal variations in crop water requirements
    to improve the precision of irrigation applications. An advanced process control
    system utilised for irrigation must be robust to intermittent data availability
    and accommodate spatial variability. Irrigation control can be approached by adjusting
    the irrigation application either: (1) directly from the soil and/or crop response
    measurements (‘sensor-based control’); or (2) from responses simulated using a
    soil and crop production model (‘model-based control’). These strategies are suitable
    for both constant and site-specific irrigation, where the measurements taken represent
    the whole field or a smaller area of the field, respectively. Sensor-based irrigation
    control systems may be implemented as a simple feedback control system (e.g. iterative
    learning control: Ahn et al. 2007) which adjusts the applied irrigation volume
    according to the difference between the desired and measured response. An alternate
    implementation is to evaluate the response of multiple irrigation volumes and
    apply the irrigation volume with the best response (e.g. iterative hill climbing
    control, McCarthy et al. 2010a). There are a number of model-based control strategies
    that may be applicable to spatially varied irrigation. These include optimisation
    approaches (as reviewed in the foregoing sections “Mathematical programming”,
    “Linear quadratic control”, “Artificial intelligence” and “Model predictive control”).
    These are considered in this paper in the following sections. The irrigation control
    systems would be implemented in the field using the required sensors which may
    consist of one or a combination of the following: an automatic weather station,
    soil moisture sensors and plant sensors (possibly mounted on the irrigation machine).
    These sensors may transmit wireless data to a controller on the irrigation machine,
    or require manual upload and data transfer. Alternatively, the grower’s observations
    of the soil moisture and plant growth may be used in the control strategies. Similarly,
    the irrigation application may be adjusted at different spatial resolutions (where
    the management areas may be strips of the field or smaller sub-areas of the field),
    and either manually by the grower or automated by a controller. Iterative learning
    control Iterative learning control involves varying the irrigation application
    according to the error between the measured process output and desired process
    output after the previous irrigation. Because this strategy assumes the initial
    conditions are reset after each iteration, the irrigation events would be initiated
    when the crop water use since the previous irrigation event reaches a threshold
    value. The crop conditions would then be approximately the same before each irrigation
    event is initiated. For site-specific irrigation, the iterative learning control
    strategy can consider the irrigation system capacity by increasing the irrigation
    volume applied to cells (i.e. sub-areas) according to the additional crop water
    use (measured from soil moisture sensors or estimated from weather data) between
    the irrigation initiation and when the irrigation is actually applied. Iterative
    learning control also requires data input from each cell in the field; hence,
    measured field data must be kriged in situations of sparse input data to increase
    the spatial resolution of the input data (McCarthy et al. 2010b). Soil moisture
    or leaf area may be used as feedback to measure the system performance for an
    irrigation iterative learning control strategies. The crop water use must be measured
    or estimated each day to determine the irrigation timing. Hence, sensors with
    a high temporal resolution are required. Variable structure control concepts (Åström
    and Wittenmark 1989) may be applied to iterative learning control to ensure that
    the control system is robust to data gaps and deficiencies. This involves adjusting
    the irrigation decision method depending on the input data available. For example,
    if soil data input is not available in one area of the field then plant or weather
    data input may be used to determine the irrigation timing and/or volume. The control
    actions of the iterative learning control strategy use responses from every irrigation
    event in the season rather than from only one irrigation event. This would prevent
    major changes in application during by one irrigation event; hence, stability
    is not likely a major issue for iterative learning control. Iterative learning
    control determines irrigation applications using measurements of soil and/or crop
    response to target the desired soil and/or crop response. These objectives may
    not necessarily optimise final crop yield, profit or water use efficiency. Hence,
    iterative learning control may not reach optimality. Iterative hill climbing control
    A drawback of the iterative learning control strategy is the potentially inefficient
    system identification. This is because there are a limited number of irrigation
    events that occur during a crop season and only one irrigation volume is being
    evaluated in each cell during each irrigation event. Adaptive spatially-varied
    identification may be achieved by utilising site-specific combinations of plant,
    soil and weather data in different zones of the field. Likewise, adaptive system
    identification may be incorporated into an irrigation control system to account
    for the slow speed of crop dynamics and the frequency of irrigation events. The
    efficiency of control systems may be improved for irrigation by evaluating a range
    of inputs to the system at each irrigation event. This would be implemented for
    an irrigation control system by applying and evaluating a range of irrigation
    volumes on different cells in the field. This is similar to the dual adaptive
    control concept (Wittenmark 2002) where perturbation signals are used to learn
    more about the process. This method has been adapted to irrigation and named ‘iterative
    hill climbing control’. ‘Hill climbing’ involves changing the state of the system
    into one that is closer to the goal in the direction of steepest gradient (Russell
    and Norvig 1995). The strategy involves the following process (McCarthy et al.
    2010a): 1. The field is divided into zones according to a pre-measured variability
    map. 2. ‘Test cells’ are selected in each zone to evaluate different irrigation
    volumes. 3. Test irrigation volumes are applied to each test cell. 4. Before the
    next irrigation is applied the crop response to the previous irrigation volume
    is evaluated. A performance index is calculated for each test cell in each zone
    to evaluate the response of the soil and/or plant to the irrigation volume. Using
    plant data in the performance index calculation may involve maximising the square
    count and this is similar to the extremum adaptive control concept. The irrigation
    volume that was applied to the test cell with the highest performance index is
    then applied to the whole zone. 5. Steps 3 and 4 are repeated for each irrigation
    event. New test cells are also randomly selected in each zone after each irrigation
    event to ensure that the response of a test cell is indicative of the rest of
    the zone. Possible objectives of the iterative hill climbing control are to achieve
    a set soil moisture content or vegetative growth, or maximising yield indicators
    (e.g. square count for cotton). As per iterative learning control (section “Iterative
    learning control”), measurements to determine irrigation volume are only required
    before each irrigation event. However, irrigation timing may be determined after
    a set crop water use which requires data at a higher temporal resolution. Spatial
    data unavailability is generally not important for iterative hill climbing control
    as data input is only required for the test cells. However, if field measurements
    of a test cell are missing, kriging the available data would not show the response
    of the test cells to the test irrigation volumes. Hence, kriging is not appropriate
    for iterative hill climbing control and if critical data input is missing the
    control procedure will fail. As per the iterative learning controller, the irrigation
    system capacity may be considered by increasing the irrigation application according
    to the crop water consumed since the irrigation was initiated. The strategy should
    also be robust to data gaps by using the available streams of data if the desired
    data stream input is unavailable. For example, if plant measurements are not available
    for a strategy that aims to maximise square count, then the strategy will determine
    irrigation application to achieve a set soil moisture content. Also similar to
    iterative learning control, the irrigation volumes applied would have stability.
    This is because the crop coefficients evaluated in the test cells are offset from
    the crop coefficient of the previous irrigation. Hence, only progressive changes
    are made to the irrigation volume applied throughout the crop season, effectively
    dampening any changes to the irrigation application. Iterative hill climbing control
    can potentially aim to maximise plant variables (e.g. square count for cotton)
    which should lead to near-optimality. However, such variables may only be measurable
    towards the end of the crop season and the strategy used at the start of the season
    may not necessary optimise the irrigation application. Model predictive control
    Model predictive control involves using a calibrated model to evaluate a range
    of inputs and implement the input strategy with the best performance. For irrigation,
    model predictive control could involve using real-time field data to calibrate
    a crop and soil model (McCarthy et al. 2011) and then using the calibrated model
    to determine the optimum irrigation timing and volume. Soil and/or plant measurements
    are required to calibrate the model, ideally during each growing stage and in
    response to known irrigation volumes for accurate model calibration. Proximal
    plant sensors would be appropriate for model predictive control because the measurements
    are not necessarily required daily to calibrate the model. Mounting these sensors
    on an irrigation machine or farm machinery also enables data collection at a high
    spatial resolution. Model predictive control can be used to incorporate system
    level constraints into the optimisation algorithm. For example, the limitations
    of irrigation system capacity and seasonal water availability can be considered
    in determining the appropriate volume and timing of irrigation future irrigation
    applications. The model predictive control strategy may produce the same optimal
    crop water use and yield for various distributions of water during the crop season.
    If more than one irrigation volume has the same performance, then a water-efficient
    approach could be taken by selecting the irrigation volume and timing with the
    lowest quantitative volume to achieve the optimal simulated performance. An alternate
    approach is to use grower-specific preferences for the irrigation distribution.
    For example, the grower may have a preference for using lower amounts of water
    early in the season to provide soil water capacity for rainfall during the season.
    Because model predictive control uses a model’s simulations to determine irrigation
    application, variables that are not directly measured (e.g. final crop yield and
    water use efficiency) may potentially be controlled and optimised. In contrast,
    the iterative learning and iterative hill climbing control strategies determine
    irrigation applications using measurements of soil and/or crop response to target
    the desired soil and/or crop response. The performance objective that the controller
    uses depends on the specific objectives of the grower/manager. Model predictive
    control could be robust to cells with data gaps by spatially interpolating the
    available measurements and using these measurements to calibrate the unknown model
    parameters. Because the model is calibrated over the crop season and not just
    from one measurement, model predictive control would not be susceptible to major
    instability. Conclusion Advanced process control is applicable to irrigation which
    has slow dynamics, even though it was developed for relatively fast mechanical
    and chemical processes. This control technique has the capability to deal with
    the complexities of managing the soil–plant–atmosphere system using a range of
    irrigation systems and configurations (i.e. either constant or site-specific irrigation
    with manual or automatic actuation). This has been demonstrated by identification
    of three advanced process control strategies and their application to irrigation:
    iterative learning control, iterative hill climbing control and model predictive
    control. Investigation of the sensor requirements for each control strategy should
    be conducted in the development and analysis of any advanced process control system
    for irrigation. Irrigation control strategies should have minimal sensor requirements
    to ensure the system is practical for growers and enhance the future uptake of
    the technology. Sensor availability is at present a constraint on the automation
    of irrigation control, and it is expected that the requirements of advanced process
    control for irrigation will also drive sensor development. Future research needs
    identified include control strategy development and field evaluation with different
    irrigation systems and field conditions. Notes Optimal control is used to derive
    differential equations which determine the control action to be taken at any time
    for a given system to achieve the desired optimality criterion (Burns 2001). The
    fundamental derivation approach for optimal control is the ‘calculus of variations’
    which finds the path, curve or surface (in the form of differential equations)
    for which a given function has a stationary value which corresponds to the maximum
    or minimum, as required. Evolutionary algorithms are inspired by the process of
    biological evolution and involve an iterative procedure whereby a population of
    trial solutions (irrigation application schemes) is evaluated and each solution
    is assigned a fitness that indicates the performance. The population is then evolved
    and a new generation of solutions is created from the solutions of the previous
    generation with the highest fitness (Filippidis et al. 1999). References Ahn HS,

    occurs as a result of spatial and temporal variations in soil structure and fertility;
    soil physical, chemical and hydraulic properties; irrigation applications; pests
    and diseases; plant genetics; and local microclimate. This review paper argues
    that infield variability can be managed and the efficiency of irrigation water
    use increased by spatially variable application of irrigation water to meet the
    specific needs of individual management zones (areas of crop whose properties
    are relatively homogenous). Key areas identified requiring interdisciplinary research
    are the prescription of irrigated crop water requirements, strategies for quantifying
    and managing spatial variability, and the development of adaptive systems for
    control of water application at appropriate temporal intervals and spatial scales.

    drainage is a critical component of agricultural production in both arid and humid
    regions, but field drainage is often neglected and mismanaged as an important
    water resource. Innovative approaches for the integrated design and management
    of irrigation and subsurface drainage systems have tremendous potential to improve
    yields to help meet the rapidly emerging food demands and decrease total freshwater
    diversions to agriculture. Although irrigation system design and management have
    evolved tremendously in the past few decades, the design methodology and management
    criteria for subsurface drainage have not changed in the last 50 years. Thus,
    all aspects of agricultural drainage require serious reconsideration and reevaluation
    to be able to meet emerging needs. This manuscript evaluates the current design
    criteria and practices and suggests viable alternatives for the improvement of
    subsurface agricultural drainage systems to meet the demands of modern agriculture.
    Drainage water treatment, reuse, and disposal are significant problems for agricultural
    drainage and various alternatives are presented. Published 2015. This article
    is a U.S. Government work and is in the public domain in the USA. Introduction
    With the world population approaching 9 billion people by 2050 the demand for
    food and clean water will be a critical concern in all countries, but will be
    particularly acute in areas that utilize irrigation for production of food, feed,
    and fiber. Rising population, changes in dietary preferences and improved nutrition,
    increasing water withdrawals for urban, industrial, and recreational uses, and
    environmental protection have greatly increased the global demand for good quality
    freshwater and its competition among users (de Fraiture et al., 2010). Global
    climate change may further exacerbate these problems through changing temperatures
    and long-term variations in annual precipitation amounts and regional rainfall
    distribution patterns. This situation is compounded by economic concerns including
    escalating energy costs, rising cost of inputs, persistent soil erosion and salination,
    increasing climate variability and continuing loss of environmental integrity
    (National Research Council (NRC), 2010; Council for Agricultural Science and Technology
    (CAST), 2010; Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), 2011).
    Irrigated agriculture currently supplies 40% of the world food supply on approximately
    20% of the arable land in agricultural production (Postel, 1999). Irrigated crop
    production also provides much of the feed to sustain animals used for work or
    food in many parts of the world. It provides considerable food sources and foraging
    areas for migratory and local birds, as well as other wildlife. In addition, agriculture
    is also being asked to supplement the world''s ever-increasing energy needs by
    producing more bio-based fuels and lubricants. Because the world''s arable land
    base is declining due to soil salination, erosion and urbanization there is a
    need to substantially increase crop production in humid areas, while irrigated
    agriculture will be required to provide an even greater proportion of the food
    supply in both arid and humid regions. Freshwater diversions to irrigated agriculture
    are declining while the need to increase production is escalating rapidly. Subsurface
    drainage offers many benefits that will be necessary to meet these challenges
    in both humid and arid areas. In arid irrigated, as well as humid farming areas,
    removing excess water from the soil surface and the soil profile by natural and
    artificial means is a critical component in sustaining crop production. In many
    arid locations, irrigated crop production can only be physically sustainable if
    both soil salt concentrations and shallow groundwater elevations are adequately
    managed, whereas humid areas usually need field drainage to lower groundwater
    tables or intercept subsurface flows to prevent waterlogged conditions. Fortunately,
    compared to early irrigated civilizations, modern irrigation and drainage technologies
    in conjunction with advanced irrigation management options can control soil salinity
    and maintain sustainable crop production (Smedema et al., 2004). Agricultural
    drainage is a generic term describing the removal of excess water from the land
    surface and the soil profile to enhance its use. Surface drainage is typically
    land shaping and forming to facilitate overland flow and discharge of excess water
    from the land surface through a series of ditches and channels constructed for
    that purpose (Schultz et al., 2013). In some cases in low areas of a field, surface
    inlets are connected to subsurface drains to supplement surface drainage. Most
    of the surface drainage is reused in arid and semiarid areas to augment irrigation
    and urban water supplies. Subsurface drainage is the focus of this paper and is
    defined as the process of removing excess water from the soil profile through
    the use of open field drains (ditches) or buried perforated pipes that discharge
    into a pumped sump or ditch for disposal. The benefits of farm field drainage
    include improved crop production, improved soil aeration, better trafficability
    for agricultural equipment, enhanced soil salinity management, improved soil aeration,
    improved recreation, protecting infrastructure, and improving human health conditions
    by removing stagnant water that transmits water-related diseases, e.g. malaria,
    schistosomiasis. These benefits can accrue from both surface and subsurface drainage
    (Scheumann and Freisem, 2001). Drainage waters may also contribute to maintaining
    foraging areas and wetlands for wildlife and migrating birds as well as recreation
    and fisheries. Subsurface drainage will be part of the solutions to the world''s
    water security needs. This manuscript reviews the current state of the art, current
    and future needs, and presents some alternatives for sustainable subsurface drainage
    system design and operation. These include: (i) collecting the required data on
    soil variability, geologic, topographic and soil physical properties; (ii) characterizing
    existing and future design criteria, assessing strategies and developing management
    capability; (iii) discussing criteria for the treatment and potential reuse of
    drainage water: and (iv) providing appropriate practices for disposal of highly
    degraded drainage water (lost to the system). Alternative strategies to augment
    precipitation and irrigation water supplies and to reduce pollutant concentrations
    in return flows from existing and new agriculture drainage systems are also presented.
    This review will be the basis for making recommendations for future research and
    development in subsurface drainage system design and operation for both humid
    and arid areas. Forces for Change Climate change The effect of climate change
    on the distribution patterns, timing and intensity of rainfall will have to be
    considered in future designs. Previous research has indicated that climate change
    may have a minor impact on crop water use, but the drainage design criteria for
    flow will probably not be significantly impacted (Armstrong et al., 1992). The
    impact of climate change in arid areas may be increased rainfall during normally
    dry periods or more frequent or prolonged drought affecting surface water supplies.
    Each of these conditions requires a different response in terms of drainage design.
    In the first case there may be a requirement for additional drainage capacity,
    and in the second instance a need to store and manage deep percolation to augment
    crop water use. The question is whether the impact is sufficient to radically
    change the design criteria related to excess water. Environmental concerns Discharge
    of subsurface drainage water into surface water is a major environmental issue
    affecting the operation of subsurface drainage systems. The emergence of greater
    awareness and concern for the environment in combination with the unavoidable,
    critical need to ensure agricultural sustainability has made subsurface drainage
    waters a major concern and liability, but it may be possible to mitigate these
    concerns with new design criteria and management systems. While existing criteria
    and designs have served agriculture by maintaining productivity, they have inadvertently
    contributed to significant environmental degradation due to the discharge of salts
    (Ca, Na, SO4), toxic elements (Se, B), fertilizers (N, P), pesticides and herbicides
    into the surface water, which can have a devastating effect on the environment
    (e.g. selenium contamination of Kesterson Reservoir; San Joaquin Valley Drainage,
    1990), hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico due to N loading (Burkart and James, 1999;
    Rabalais et al., 2007; Greene et al., 2009). As a result of these impacts, the
    status quo for the design and operation of drainage systems is no longer acceptable
    and researchers must develop new strategies and tools that include integrated
    water table management plus the treatment and reuse of surface and subsurface
    drainage waters for each affected ecosystem. Crop water use Crop water requirements
    have been changing over the years with new drought- and heat-tolerant crop varieties
    and irrigation management strategies. In addition, better methods for calculating
    crop water requirements using weighing lysimeters, eddy covariance, Bowen ratio,
    and other emerging methods along with mathematical estimates using the modified
    Penman equation are commonly available (Allen et al., 1998). However, the potential
    for in situ crop water use from shallow groundwater can be substantial (Ayars
    et al., 2006a), but it is usually ignored in water balance calculations; and there
    is very limited information available on this topic because it is very difficult
    to measure. This component of the design may be transient if the source of shallow
    groundwater is overirrigation, but it can become an increasingly significant part
    of the water balance and lengthen the irrigation interval to conserve water and
    nutrients with appropriate management. If the source of shallow groundwater is
    external to the site then in situ use by the local crop is an alternative. The
    sources of shallow groundwater at each site need to be identified and quantified
    as part of the field investigations and design of a drainage system. In addition,
    crop water use values may change as new varieties are developed that are more
    tolerant to heat, drought, and soil salinity stresses. State of the Art of Agricultural
    Drainage As we go forward, it is important to consider where the science of drainage
    is today and how it has evolved. Smedema (2007) provides good insight into this
    question based on his review of drainage conferences and workshops held over the
    last 25 years by the Working Group on Drainage of the International Commission
    on Irrigation and Drainage (ICID) and the drainage committees of the American
    Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE). He observed a transition
    in research interests from technical to nontechnical issues. The early conferences
    focused on technical issues including: determining the input parameters for design
    of drainage systems, the materials used to construct a drainage system, and the
    mathematical basis for determining the depth and spacing of subsurface drains.
    The drainage design, construction, and installation methods developed several
    decades ago have been accepted as standard practices. There is a need to integrate
    these developed methods with new technologies (computer modeling, integrated management
    of drainage and irrigation systems) and concepts (statistical sampling for soil
    characterization, incorporating in situ water use by crops in the design). In
    later conferences, the issues became nontechnical and emphasis was on the sociology
    of drainage including; operation and maintenance, system management, stakeholder
    involvement, capacity building, environmental awareness, and sustainable agriculture.
    Studies in recent conferences have demonstrated that once the drainage system
    has been installed there is a lack of training for system operation and maintenance
    and technical and financial support for the maintenance and operation of these
    systems resulting in a gradual degradation of system operation (Schultz et al.,
    2013). The emergence of environmental constraints and the emphasis on sustainability
    of irrigated agriculture dictate that new and innovative technical concepts must
    be included in future design and operation of both existing and new subsurface
    drains. There needs to be a holistic approach to quantifying the system that incorporates
    the irrigation system design and management, the plant production system, the
    characterization of the soil profile, and a design approach for the drainage system
    that includes well-defined management strategies including treatment and reuse
    of drainage water that address environmental and social concerns, as well as crop
    production issues. Over the past few decades, there has been considerable progress
    in improving irrigation system design and management; however, there has been
    little research devoted to design and implementation of improved systems and integrated
    management for subsurface drainage systems. New approaches are needed that will
    require a critical look at existing methods of data collection, design, installation,
    and management of subsurface drainage systems with the goal of incorporating current
    and emerging technologies to meet identified future systems design and operation.
    Existing drainage infrastructure The future of subsurface drainage in agriculture
    faces several significant obstacles. For example, drainage infrastructure is generally
    neglected and many drainage systems have failed or are failing with no plans or
    resources to replace them. Scheumann and Freisem (2001) identified drainage as
    the forgotten factor in sustaining irrigated agriculture. Even though it is acknowledged
    as being required to sustain production in irrigated agriculture and provide salinity
    control, it is generally ignored when considering the future allocations of financial
    and management resources after installation, which is particularly true in developing
    countries. The beneficial and nonbeneficial effects of drainage on areas outside
    of agriculture are poorly understood and little investment is made in the maintenance
    of drainage systems. With the competing demands for funds, governments have demonstrated
    little interest in providing and maintaining drainage services and the training
    needed to operate them. This problem falls into the category of out of sight and
    out of mind, and the very large expense of renovating and improving these systems
    probably serves as another reason to ignore and delay addressing the problem.
    With the exception of open ditches, there is little of a subsurface drainage system
    that is visible and failure of the system is not apparent until a catastrophe
    occurs, e.g. the system fails and crop production in an entire river basin is
    threatened with high levels of waterlogging and soil salination. Lack of subsurface
    drainage infrastructure may also result in the destruction of highways and roads
    and the degradation of building foundations. In the end, it always comes back
    to who pays and what is the public benefit for maintaining or expanding agricultural
    drainage infrastructure. Drainage needs Smedema (2007) characterized three basic
    global drainage zones. The first is the temperate humid zone where the major concern
    is prevention of waterlogging to improve soil aeration and trafficability. The
    second zone is the arid/semiarid zone where the major concerns are aeration, waterlogging,
    and soil salinity management. The third zone is the humid/semihumid tropics where
    excess surface water control is the primary objective and prevention of waterlogging
    (aeration) is also a consideration. The need for subsurface drainage in the irrigated
    and rainfed agricultural zones has been summarized by Smedema et al. (2000) (Table
    1). They estimate that less than one third of all the irrigated lands needing
    drainage have been drained, which is a concern because drainage is critical for
    salinity management to sustain arid irrigated agriculture. Other estimates have
    placed the total drained area between 160 and 180 million ha. (Schultz, 2013,
    personal communication). Table 1. Summary of existing worldwide drainage and future

    suitable or environmentally sensitive land. To meet the challenge for increased
    food production during the next decades, rehabilitation and improvements to existing
    drainage systems must be made simultaneously with providing new drainage service
    to about 125 million ha of irrigated land identified in Table 1 as requiring additional
    drainage. The increased production on this land will vary depending on the existing
    conditions and extent of drainage required to optimize production. Similarly,
    providing advanced drainage service to 300 million ha in humid areas will also
    enable improved yields. In both cases, there needs to be considerable thought
    given to the advanced design and management of these systems. Drainage Design
    Considerations Historically, subsurface drainage systems have not been actively
    managed to achieve a particular agronomic goal. Instead, they were solely intended
    to remove excess water from the soil profile to sustain crop production. Subsurface
    drainage systems in arid areas have been designed to maintain the groundwater
    table below the crop root zone at the least cost by the uniform deep placement
    of the drain laterals with uniform wide spacing. This resulted in design criteria
    to maximize water removal rates. However, this practice has led to the problem
    of return flows containing relatively large amounts of dissolved materials polluting
    surface and subsurface water supplies. Increasing the lateral depth will increase
    the spacing while maintaining the same midpoint water table depth. However, a
    deeper lateral placement with wider drain spacing increases the depth of the flow
    lines into the soil profile into zones with the highest salt concentrations (Jury
    et al., 2003), and increasing the lateral spacing may have a significant effect
    on drainage water quality in arid areas. In arid areas the soil salinity often
    increases in concentration with depth (Ayars and Meek, 1994) as a result of reclamation
    and leaching, and deeper-placed laterals tend to have higher salinity water being
    discharged which results in an increased salt load being discharged in the drainage
    water. This mines salt and increases the drainage water salinity as well as resulting
    in excessive salt loading of surface water, and new approaches to implementing
    subsurface drainage in agriculture are clearly needed. Research has demonstrated
    a significant potential for in situ crop water use from shallow groundwater by
    a variety of crops and in conditions with a wide range of electrical conductivity
    and depth of the shallow groundwater (Ayars et al., 2006b). However, there has
    been little consideration of water table management to augment freshwater diversions
    to meet crop evapotranspiration needs in water-short areas as well as humid areas.
    Clearly new approaches to subsurface drainage are needed to address these shortcomings.
    It has been recognized for some time that subsurface drainage systems should not
    remove water that may contribute to crop growth beyond the point needed for adequate
    aeration (overdrainage) (Doering et al., 1982). Studies have demonstrated that
    in situ crop water use has a significant effect on lateral spacing (Ayars and
    McWhorter, 1985; Nikam et al., 1992; Upadhyaya and Chauhan, 2000). Incorporating
    crop water use from the groundwater table reduces the total flow to the drains
    which results in wider drain spacing for a given midpoint groundwater table position
    without having to increase the lateral depth. Thus, the depth of installation
    may be varied as part of the design process to determine the effect on water quality,
    if that is a criterion. An alternative strategy with deep drains is to control
    the groundwater table position using controls on the drain outlet (Wahba and Christen,
    2006). This reduces the depth of flow lines into the soil profile and reduces
    the salt load (Christen and Ayars, 2001). Doering et al. (1982) developed a shallow
    drainage system concept for arid irrigated areas as a method to control groundwater
    table position. They found that deep drain placement resulted in excessive drainage
    losses (overdrainage) and using a shallow drain placement conserved irrigation
    water. Other studies have demonstrated that groundwater table management provides
    significant benefits in the reduction of energy costs and the conservation of
    water (Benz et al., 1981). These studies were conducted in North Dakota, USA,
    with water that was low in salinity and in nonsaline soils, and salinity management
    was not an issue. Ayars et al. (1998) demonstrated similar results in the San
    Joaquin Valley on saline soils using low salinity irrigation water. Alternative
    lateral placement is another area for consideration as new criteria are developed
    for design and management of drainage systems. Drainage laterals have generally
    been placed at a single uniform depth within the soil profile and with a uniform
    spacing. As detailed knowledge of soil properties is developed, it will enable
    variable spacing which should result in reduced cost of construction, reduced
    drainage flow and improved management. Different designs and lateral placement
    have included bi-level drains with a pattern of both deep and shallow lateral
    placement (DeBoer and Chu, 1975; Hornbuckle et al., 2005). These designs can be
    applied in areas to provide benefits for improved groundwater table management
    if the design is coupled with an outlet control. In saline areas requiring reclamation
    deeper-spaced drains may be used in initial soil reclamation and the shallower
    drains used for control of the groundwater table position on an ongoing basis
    (Hornbuckle et al., 2005). Variable lateral spacing could also be coupled with
    bi-level installation to provide additional management opportunities. Thus, new
    management approaches will also require changes in the criteria used to establish
    the depth and spacing of drain laterals. For example, reducing the midpoint depth
    may be an alternative to increase the lateral spacing. The increased spacing may
    be a problem in areas with high salinity as noted above. However, the reduced
    flow with the shallower installation depth along with reduced depth of the flow
    path should reduce the total load being discharged (Ayars and Meek, 1994; Ayars
    et al., 2006a). Christen and Skehan (2001) also found that shallower depth placement
    and closer drain spaced laterals resulted in shallower flow pathways in the soil
    profile that mined less salt. Crop water use Studies in humid areas demonstrated
    that it was possible to actively manage subsurface drains to reduce flow and store
    water in the soil for crop water use (Doty, 1980; Skaggs, 1980). These studies
    were conducted in the flat coastal plain area of North Carolina, USA, and the
    topography facilitated a good control of groundwater table position from one location
    in the field (Doty et al., 1975). Similar types of groundwater control become
    more difficult as the field surface slope increases. This will require additional
    structures throughout the drainage system to provide groundwater table position
    control without inducing waterlogged conditions in a portion of the field. It
    may include a design that changes the drainage lateral placement relative to the
    surface slope such that a single control structure can be used for a large area
    (Ayars, 2003). Controlled drainage has also been used for control of subirrigation
    in humid areas (Skaggs, 1999b), In this mode good quality water is pumped into
    the drainage system to raise the groundwater table to facilitate in situ crop
    water use (Skaggs, 1999b). Subirrigation requires a different set of design criteria
    to facilitate the rapid removal of water in instances when rainfall may interact
    with subirrigation. Similar to pumping water into drains, subsurface drip irrigation
    could also be used to temporarily raise groundwater table depths for crop use.
    These systems have been demonstrated to conserve water. For example, Stanley and
    Clark (1991) reported that irrigation water requirements for tomato production
    in south Florida were reduced by 33–40% with subsurface drip irrigation as compared
    to conventional open-ditch subirrigation systems because of reduced runoff rates.
    Smajstrla et al. (1995) reported that potato yields were statistically similar,
    but 33% less water was applied for groundwater table control with a subsurface
    drip irrigation system compared to a conventional open-ditch subirrigation system.
    This highlights the challenge to include irrigation system design and operation
    in drainage system designs. In a radical departure from past design and management
    criteria, limited research has shown that relatively shallow and closely spaced
    subsurface drainage (i.e. tile drainage) systems can be used to increase crop
    production in humid areas by controlling groundwater table depths to provide water
    to crops in dry periods (Doty, 1980). In addition, some of leached nutrients that
    were previously lost to return flows remain available to the crops. There is a
    need to develop similar management approaches and strategies for subsurface drainage
    systems in arid areas that also mitigate soil salinity and augment irrigation
    water supplies to meet pressing demands for increased crop production on less
    land using less water and nutrients. Leaching requirement Leaching of salt from
    the crop root zone has long been considered a part of the seasonal water requirement
    for crops grown in saline areas in regions where rainfall quantity or timing is
    not sufficient for leaching. The leaching requirement (LR) is the minimum amount
    of water required to maintain soil salinity at a prescribed level. The LR is a
    function of the salinity of the irrigation water, the salt tolerance of the crop,
    and the desired soil salinity level (Hoffman, 1990).The leaching fraction (LF)
    is defined as the actual amount of water passing the bottom of the root zone and
    is generally greater than the LR. In the past with furrow irrigation it has not
    been a problem to meet the LR because the limited ability to precisely manage
    the application depth has resulted in excessive deep percolation losses and the
    LR was met without including it in the calculation of the crop water requirement.
    However, pressurized irrigation systems have the potential for better control
    of the depth, uniformity and distribution of applied water and the LR needs to
    be included in the crop water requirement calculation. These factors are critical,
    but there are indications that leaching of salts may not have to occur continuously
    and that salts might be stored indefinitely at high concentrations below the root
    zone, which may also reduce design flow rates and lower costs. There has been
    a significant shift in the thinking with regard to the theory of estimating the
    leaching requirement presented in Handbook 60 (United States Salinity Laboratory
    (USSL) (1954)) to the present. Research has shown that plants are significantly
    more salt tolerant than had previously been assumed, particularly later in the
    growing season (van Schilfgaarde et al., 1974; Letey and Dinar, 1986) and lower
    values of the LR will be required to maintain productivity. This is also true
    for salinity management in the soil profile where higher levels of salinity can
    be maintained in the profile in the lower portions of the crop root zone than
    previously thought (Cardon and Letey, 1992). Thus, salinity management can be
    transient, with root zone salinity increasing during the growing season and leaching
    occurring during fallow periods. The concern about soil salination from upward
    flow of saline groundwater remains, but research has demonstrated that the increased
    soil salinity in the root zone during the growing season can be successfully managed
    with preplant irrigation that provides adequate leaching (Ayars, 2003). Salinity
    management in the soil profile will be a critical component of future drainage
    system management, but the revised LR should result in a lower water requirement
    for salinity control and reduced drainage discharge. Research has also found that
    crop salt tolerance varies with growth stage, from being salt sensitive at germination
    to moderately tolerant to tolerant at maturity, e.g. cotton, sugar beet, tomato
    (Maas, 1990). This provides a management opportunity to match water quality to
    the crop salt tolerance from canal, well, drainage water, and mixed supplies.
    It also provides greater opportunities to manage the shallow groundwater to meet
    the crop water requirements. Initially, this will require extensive instrumentation
    and understanding of the system to be fully implemented. Extensive research is
    needed to reduce this to a manageable system for producers in many areas of the
    world. Nitrogen loading While drainage is a critical component of sustainable
    irrigated agriculture around the world, treatment, reuse, and disposal of drainage
    water are critical issues that need to be solved before additional drainage systems
    are installed. Degraded drainage water has the potential to create significant
    negative environmental impacts as a result of transporting nutrients (N, P), herbicides,
    pesticides, sediment, and toxic elements (B, Se, As) in both surface and subsurface
    drainage flow (Fausey and Palmer, 1987). In humid areas, transport of nitrate
    and phosphorus create significant environmental degradation in surface waters
    due to eutrophication and hypoxia, e.g. Gulf of Mexico (Burkart and James, 1999,
    Rabalais et al., 2007, Greene et al., 2009). While not generally considered part
    of the LR, nitrogen leaching to subsurface drains can be a significant problem
    in drainage water in both humid and arid areas. It appears that the nitrogen load
    is flow dependent, as is the case for salt loading, and reducing the water loss
    will reduce the pollutant load. Varying the drainage intensity has the largest
    impact on the total nitrate load (Sands et al., 2008; Nangia et al., 2010). This
    is often managed by increasing the lateral spacing and controlling the discharge
    during the winter months. Animal wastes and crop residues are additional sources
    of N that are used for fertilization, and agronomic strategies have to be developed
    (Ale et al., 2012b) to control the N load entering the soil (source control) and
    the drainage water. Since N is quite mobile in soil water, controlling transport
    is a larger challenge for humid areas where there is less control on the water
    supply compared to irrigated agriculture, and better N management must be part
    of the total package (e.g. more spoon-feeding of N to match plant needs rather
    than one or two seasonal applications). The objective is to optimize crop N use
    without limiting production and reduce the potential for transport from rainfall
    and irrigation. The use of alternative management strategies such as banding N
    placement with the row, timing of multiple applications, type and source of N,
    loading rates, cultivation practices, and cropping rotations will also be important.
    Site-specific applications of N on land or through the irrigation system to carefully
    match crop N needs in various portions of the field can also be a significant
    management tool. Drainage flow rates A critical input to drainage design is the
    estimation of the actual amount of excess water to be removed by the drainage
    system. In humid areas these values are based on the National Weather Service
    rain and snow data to characterize rainfall distributions and depths over time.
    The drainage requirement can be determined to manage drainage system outflow rates
    for excess rainfall or dry periods based on time of year and crop development.
    The situation in arid areas is not as complex as in humid areas because the excess
    water will be primarily a result of deep percolation from irrigation with little
    expected contribution from rainfall. Deep percolation can be estimated based on
    a water balance of crop water requirements and water supply and runoff with adjustments
    for soil salinity, and assumed irrigation efficiency and uniformity. In addition,
    pressurized irrigation systems and irrigation management have changed and expanded
    significantly over the past 50 years and the potential for large deep percolation
    losses has been greatly reduced in many areas with these systems. However, surface
    irrigation is still the predominate method of irrigation throughout the world
    and deep percolation losses can be large under these systems. Estimated efficiency
    of surface irrigation throughout the world is between 30 and 45%. Consequently,
    it is to be expected that deep percolation will still be a significant element
    in drainage design in arid areas that rely heavily on surface irrigation systems.
    Field characterization for design The basic soil and hydrology data needed for
    subsurface drainage system design have not changed, but less expensive and more
    rapid methods for collecting these data have advanced significantly (Lesch et
    al., 2005; Corwin et al., 2008). Basic data required for design and construction
    of surface and subsurface drains include surface topography, geology, soil type,
    soil hydraulic properties, salinity, deep percolation losses (irrigation, rainfall),
    lateral underground flow, and surface runoff (United States Bureau of Reclamation
    (USBR), 1993). All of these data can be extremely labor-intensive and expensive
    to collect. However, modern technologies offer lower-cost methods and procedures
    that provide reasonable accuracy and minimize the need for field and laboratory
    studies. Integration of these technologies into the planning and design process
    is needed to encourage the upgrading and expansion of field drainage across the
    world. For example, field topography data that previously required time-consuming
    surveying can be determined using aerial photography coupled with digital elevation
    maps (DEMs) and geographic information systems (GIS) mapping. Soil data have traditionally
    been collected using hand- and machine-driven augers in sampling schemes that
    may not adequately describe the variability of a field site with regard to texture
    and hydraulic properties. Soil physical and hydraulic parameters such as saturated
    hydraulic conductivity, porosity, specific yield, field capacity, bulk density,
    and permanent wilting point are determined using laboratory and field measurements.
    These investigations were generally done on a field-by-field basis except when
    a new irrigation project was developed that required different sampling approaches
    due to funding and time constraints. This often resulted in standardized designs
    for subsurface drainage systems in a region that did not provide adequate protection
    from waterlogging in some areas and additional modifications were required. One
    common solution to poor design was to reduce the lateral spacing by installing
    an additional lateral between two existing ones, which is a less than ideal situation
    because of the cost and loss of productivity due to waterlogging and salination
    prior to providing adequate drainage. In the United States, the Natural Resources
    Conservation Service (NRCS) has developed digital soil series maps covering the
    majority of the continental United States (http:websurvey.nrcs.usda.gov). These
    maps were originally developed based on extensive soil surveys and testing. These
    digital maps can be directly imported into GIS programs and used to provide a
    first estimate of the soil types and the soil hydraulic parameters associated
    with individual soil types for reconnaissance studies. These data can be combined
    with other information such as topography and land use using a geostatistical
    analysis to develop more economical soil-sampling strategies for better characterizing
    the variability of the physical and hydraulic parameters (Lesch et al., 2005).
    Indices from remotely sensed multispectral data (e.g. NDVI) and thermal mapping
    in midsummer may be able to indicate areas of drought and waterlogging in the
    field that might benefit from actively managed drainage systems. There is often
    a historical record of false color maps from these remotely sensed data that cover
    several years and may also provide valuable insight for improved designs. Electrical
    resistivity and electromagnetic techniques can be used to estimate some gross
    aspects and the variability of the underlying geology, soil salinity, water-holding
    capacity and other parameters at shallow depths instead of extensive manual sampling
    (Corwin et al., 2008). For example, electromagnetic (EM 38) methods make it possible
    to evaluate the distribution of soil types, layering and soil electrical conductivity
    (e.g., soil salinity) over large areas (Corwin et al., 2008). This will also reduce
    the total cost of the basic investigations by reducing the total number of samples
    per unit area evaluated and improve field characterizations. Direct determinations
    of field capacity, permanent wilting point, porosity, and saturated hydraulic
    conductivity have traditionally required laboratory determinations that are both
    expensive and time-consuming. However, alternative strategies to estimate these
    values using statistical approaches based on sand, silt, and clay percentages
    may offer a less expensive approach. Appropriate pedotransfer functions (Pachepsky
    and Rawls, 1999; Schaap et al., 2001) can be used to provide statistical estimates
    of soil hydraulic parameters based on particle size distribution as a minimum
    input as a first estimate on many soils (Rawls et al., 1981, 2007). The estimates
    of soil physical properties and hydraulic parameters improve as additional information
    is available on porosity, field capacity, and permanent wilting point pressures.
    Salazar et al. (2008) evaluated use of the ROSETTA pedotransfer function model
    to estimate the saturated hydraulic conductivity values for use in the DRAINMOD
    model. They found that the ROSETTA model and laboratory estimates of saturated
    hydraulic conductivity were within 15%, which is within the natural variability
    of soils in many fields. Their results suggest that the ROSETTA model could be
    used instead of laboratory values to predict drainage in coarse-textured soils.
    This begs the question as to whether similar results can be obtained on finer-textured
    soils and what percentages of sand, silt and clay restrict the use of pedotransfer
    functions as the basis for determining soil hydraulic properties with minimum
    verification from laboratory analysis. It may be possible to integrate other field
    data sets (e.g. EC) with texture data in the development of site-specific pedotransfer
    functions for heavier soils. Design Methods and Tools: The basic mathematical
    theory for the design of subsurface drainage systems was developed over many years,
    and before the advent of computerized models (van der Ploeg et al., 1999) required
    many simplifying assumptions to enable the mathematical solutions. The approaches
    used to design lateral spacing were characterized as either steady state or transient
    based on the assumed position of the groundwater table with time. The steady-state
    procedure assumes that over a long period of time the midpoint groundwater table
    position will remain at a specified depth below the soil surface in response to
    rainfall which reflects a balance between inflow and outflow in the system. The
    steady-state approach has been used almost exclusively in humid areas. This is
    considered a reasonable approximation for humid areas with rainfall occurring
    intermittently throughout the year, assuming that the critical time for groundwater
    table positioning is from early spring to harvest. The removal rate of excess
    water (drainage intensity) typically used in the design of subsurface drainage
    systems is millimeters per day. The criterion is met when the midpoint groundwater
    table position has returned to the design depth within a given time frame. Because
    the lateral spacing is related to the depth of placement, the spacing in humid
    areas is typically much narrower and shallower than in arid areas because the
    drainage response needs to be faster than what is required in arid areas. In humid
    areas, the targeted midpoint groundwater table depth is typically 60 cm below
    the soil surface and the lateral depths are on the order of 1 m. Another basic
    assumption in the current design process is that the soils are homogeneous and
    isotropic, which was necessary for the original mathematical development. However,
    with the availability of computers this assumption is no longer required. Mathematical
    models of two-dimensional flow (e.g. HYDRUS-2D; Šimůnek et al., 2008) are available
    that make it possible to incorporate layering and nonhomogeneity of soil parameters
    in the flow calculations. Another challenge is to collect these soil data cost-effectively
    and incorporate them into a large integrated set of models that can be used for
    designing a drainage system. Donnan (USBR, 1993) adapted the steady-state equation
    to irrigated areas by characterizing the average daily drainage requirement as
    the deep percolation losses during the peak irrigation season divided by the number
    of days between irrigation events. The estimated drain lateral spacing using this
    steady-state method was within 20% of the value determined by the transient method
    that is commonly used in irrigated areas and represented a good first estimate
    (USBR, 1993). The transient method is the principal procedure used to design drainage
    systems in irrigated areas. The US Bureau of Reclamation (USBR, 1993) transient
    method was based on a formulation developed by Glover (Dumm, 1954). The method
    assumes that the midpoint groundwater table height between subsurface drain laterals
    reaches its closest position to the soil surface at the end of the irrigation
    season. This is followed by a long period of drain discharge and groundwater table
    recession that increases the groundwater table depth prior to the beginning of
    the irrigation season. Following the recession and with the advent of irrigation,
    the groundwater table depth is reduced incrementally due to deep percolation losses
    associated with irrigation, such that at the end of the irrigation season the
    groundwater table returned to the initial position from the previous year (USBR,
    1993). If the groundwater table hydrograph peaks at other than the end of the
    irrigation season that time should be used as the starting point for the computation.
    In a transient design, the irrigation schedule, crop water requirements, and irrigation
    system application efficiency are used to estimate the deep percolation losses
    that are to be removed by the drainage system. Deep percolation losses due to
    rainfall are also included in the calculation but tend not to be a significant
    component except for possibly semiarid and semihumid areas. The midpoint groundwater
    table depth in arid irrigated areas is generally specified to be in the range
    of 1.1 m (USBR, 1993). This depth was selected based on the perceived need to
    control salinity in the root zone and minimize upward capillary flow from the
    groundwater table that transports salt into the root zone and ultimately the soil
    surface. In arid areas the cost criterion was also an important factor in the
    design and operation and resulted in installations with relatively deep placement
    of drainage laterals (>1.8 m) and wide spacing. In some regions (e.g. Pakistan,
    Egypt) with small landholdings and field sizes the drain lateral placement is
    reduced to ensure the system is located under the fields. In both the steady-state
    and transient design procedures the drainage lateral depth and spacing are revised
    through an iterative process until the design criteria are met. Current design
    criteria are limited to meeting the rate of removal of excess water, maintaining
    the design midpoint groundwater table position, and possibly a cost criterion
    (e.g. the cost of installation) is minimized. These criteria were established
    without considering any groundwater table or irrigation management strategy as
    part of the process. It was assumed that drains would be flowing continuously
    with the objective of removal of excess water in order to return the groundwater
    table position to its design depth within the established time criterion used
    in the design (e.g. 2–3 days in humid areas and a year in arid areas). Current
    drainage models for design Skaggs (1999a) reviewed drainage models and made the
    distinction between mathematical models (equations) and simulation models that
    are the implementation of the various equations traditionally used in drainage
    design. In the first case the solutions described a single event and in the second
    the solutions described day-by-day performance of a system. Computers have made
    it possible to complete the analysis of drainage system operation with detailed
    mathematical models that consider soil layering, spatially distributed properties
    for the soil, detailed hydrologic systems and plant variables. The downside of
    these models is the need for extensive input data sets for soils, hydrology, topography,
    climate, and plant variables. These models usually require an experienced user
    and are often only used in research settings. Despite the development of sophisticated
    mathematical models and large advances in computers, there have been very few
    models developed to design drainage systems as part of an integrated soil water
    management system. Skaggs (1999a) categorized the simulation models into two basic
    approaches. In the first, the Richard''s equation is solved for the unsaturated
    flow zone above the groundwater table and approximating equations are used for
    the saturated flow to the drains. In the second approach, a water balance approach
    was used to describe the flow and soil water regimes above the groundwater table
    and an analytical approach was used for the saturated flow below the groundwater
    table. The review focused on two models, SWATRE and DRAINMOD. The SWATRE model
    exemplified the first approach and DRAINMOD was the example for the second. The
    SWATRE model has been further developed and is currently known as the SWAP3.2
    model. The SWAP3.2 model is designed to simulate flow and transport processes
    at the field scale level during the growing season and for long time series and
    is available on the web (www.swap.alterra.nl/). It has also been adapted for regional
    models for use with GIS programs and methods. The model solves the Richard''s
    equation in one dimension (vertical) with the emphasis on the flow and transport
    processes in the unsaturated zone. The lateral flow in the saturated zone is computed
    using analytical drainage formulas (e.g. Hooghoudt''s equation). Model components
    include: soil water flow (vertical), soil heat flow, solute flow, crop growth
    and macropore flow. It has been used extensively in experimental analysis of field
    trials and evaluating irrigation and water management alternatives. It can be
    used in decision support when coupled with models for pesticide transport (PEARL)
    and nutrient cycling (ANIMO). From a drainage design perspective, the SWAP3.2
    model''s strength is its ability to provide a flux value to the groundwater table
    that may realistically reflect crop water use and transport within the unsaturated
    zone. However, there are many limitations of the analytical models for lateral
    flow estimation that still remain to be addressed. The best known and most extensively
    used drainage simulation model is DRAINMOD (Skaggs, 1999a) (http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/soil_water/drainmod.)
    It was developed for the design and evaluation of multi-component drainage and
    related water management systems (Skaggs, 1982) and conducts a water balance on
    a day-by-day and hour-by-hour basis. It calculates ET, drainage, surface runoff,
    subirrigation, deep seepage, groundwater table depth and soil water status within
    the profile at each time step. These results can be used to assess productivity
    and other agronomic characteristics (Skaggs, 1999a). The simulations are generally
    run for long time periods of 20–50 years to characterize the variability within
    the system. Multiple runs can be used to evaluate designs to determine the most
    profitable alternatives. DRAINMOD has been used extensively throughout the world
    primarily in humid areas (Sanoja et al., 1990; Breve et al., 1998; Ale et al.,
    2012a). It has been modified to include nitrogen transformation and fate (DRAINMOD-N:
    Ale et al., 2012b; Skaggs et al., 2012) and salt transport DRAINMOD-S (Chang et
    al., 1983; Kandil et al., 1995). While the focus of most applications has been
    in humid areas, it has also been applied in arid areas as well to characterize
    salt transport (Wahba et al., 2002; Wahba and Christen, 2006). It is used extensively
    by the USDA Natural Resource and Conservation Service (NRCS) to design and evaluate
    drainage systems in many areas of the USA. Management of Drainage Systems Current
    management of subsurface and surface drainage systems can be categorized as either
    passive or active (Fouss et al., 2007). Passive is the norm, with drains being
    allowed to discharge freely with no attempt to regulate the flow or to control
    the groundwater table position. For example, in response to recent drought and
    environmental issues, many farmers in the Midwest (e.g. Iowa, Illinois, and Minnesota)
    are manually plugging drains after planting and unplugging them before harvest
    in the fall. This is basically a modified passive management approach with highly
    variable results because the drainage systems were not designed for that purpose.
    There has been a considerable amount of research on actively managing drainage
    systems to control groundwater table position and regulate discharge (Doty, 1980;
    Fouss et al., 2007). In these cases, control is achieved by changing the elevation
    of the outlet structure relative to the invert of the drains or providing a valve
    at the outlet. This will result in the groundwater table increasing behind the
    structure. An alternative is to pump surface water into the buried drains to temporarily
    increase the groundwater table elevations. This becomes possible when the fields
    are almost level in lighter soils (Doty et al., 1975, Fouss et al., 2007). Implementation
    of the concept of active management of subsurface drains to control discharge
    and groundwater table position in arid areas is still in its infancy. It is a
    major departure from the past that will significantly affect the design and operation
    of a drainage system (Fouss et al., 2007). This concept was originally developed
    in humid areas (Doty et al., 1975) and recently was applied in arid and semi-arid
    areas where salinity management is a major issue (Ayars, 1999; Ayars et al., 2007).
    The need for control has been observed by farmers in Pakistan who have voluntarily
    plugged drainage laterals to prevent discharge and maintain the groundwater table
    (Khan et al., 2002). There is little doubt that future designs will require that
    active management of subsurface drainage systems, including monitoring and control
    structures, be a part of the total system design to address environmental and
    growing water availability issues. The benefits of active management will vary
    between humid and arid areas. In humid areas it will be possible to store water
    from rainfall to support crop growth. In humid areas with relatively flat topography
    the drainage system can have a dual use as a subsurface irrigation system and
    drainage system. In arid areas active management will require narrower spacing
    with shallower drain lateral placement than traditional criteria. This may have
    a significant positive impact on drainage water quality because the depth of flow
    path has been reduced but may increase installation costs (Christen and Ayars,
    2001). With integrated management comes the need to modify irrigation schedules
    to incorporate in situ crop water use from shallow groundwater (Ayars and Hutmacher,
    1994). In addition to the total seasonal water use, crop coefficients and estimating
    procedures will need to be developed for use in irrigation schedules that include
    direct contributions from the groundwater table and salinity effects on production.
    These studies will need to be continued for a wide range of crops in both humid
    and arid regions. Drainage Water Treatment and Disposal The difference in pollutants
    in drainage water outflows between humid and arid areas has resulted in different
    strategies for reuse and remediation of degraded water. In humid areas N loading
    and pesticide and herbicides are the principal pollutants, while dissolved salts
    are the principal pollutants although N loading is also a concern in irrigated
    agriculture. Point of discharge treatment and in-line biological reactors coupled
    with flow control are being evaluated for reducing N loading in drainage water.
    Treatment options can include the use of wetlands and vegetated ditches at the
    point of discharge to reduce N through plant uptake and volatilization and denitrification
    (Herzon and Helenius, 2008). Biological reactors with wood chips installed at
    the end of the system prior to discharge are also being evaluated for denitrification
    (Greenan et al., 2009). These are potentially viable solutions but additional
    information is required to quantify the efficiency of the systems based on the
    N loading, flow rates, effective lifespan, maintenance and potential design changes
    that may affect the operation. A sequential use biological system for reuse of
    saline drainage water was developed in response to the problem of disposal of
    saline drainage water. This system is called serial biological concentration (SBC)
    in Australia (Blackwell et al., 2005), and integrated on-farm drainage management
    (IFDM) in the United States (Cervinka et al., 1999; Ayars and Basinal, 2005).
    In this system subsurface drainage systems are designed to collect deep percolation
    and discharge it to a sump for use as supplemental irrigation on salt-tolerant
    crops. This procedure is repeated until the salinity of the deep percolate can
    no longer be used for irrigation. At this stage the water is discharged into an
    evaporation facility. The major weakness of this system is that the final disposal
    of the accumulated salts needs to be appropriately addressed. This system requires
    a system design that is capable of controlling the groundwater table position
    and collecting and controlling the discharge. Strategies have been proposed for
    blending saline drainage water with low salinity water to reduce the salinity
    and make it suitable for irrigation or alternating saline and good quality water
    for irrigation (Rhoades, 1989; Grattan and Oster, 2003). The option selected will
    depend on the available water supplies, crop salt tolerance and ability to manage
    the water supply. Continued research is needed to refine salt management strategies
    for integrated irrigation and drainage systems in light of new data on crop salt
    tolerance and potential strategies for salt management in the soil profile. Challenges
    One of the major challenges facing agriculture is to determine various institutional
    and on-farm management strategies to make more water available for crop production
    and still have a sustainable, integrated food production system (Oster and Wichelns,
    2003). It is clear that more effective subsurface drainage systems must be part
    of the solution and that integrated irrigation–drainage management strategies
    for arid and humid regions must be developed in this critical effort. Future design
    and management criteria should include in situ crop water use, and water quality
    considerations for concentration and pollutant loads of the drainage water (Ayars
    et al., 1997). Additional research is needed to develop and evaluate alternative
    systems for managing N in the system and for remediation and removal of nitrate
    and other forms of nitrogen in the drainage water at the point of discharge. Controlled
    drainage is a critical future component of sustainable water management in both
    humid and arid areas that will require active management of the drainage system
    operation. This will require the development of a decision support system (DSS).
    A DSS for adaptive control of integrated irrigation and drainage systems should
    include plant growth models. The principles of site-specific agriculture will
    need to be included in the design and operation of irrigation and drainage systems
    in the future (Sadler et al., 2005). New statistical processes will be required
    to integrate these extremely large soil data sets from diverse sources at multiple
    scales into the planning and design process, as well as for various active management
    strategies. With the ability to better characterize the spatial distribution of
    soil parameters, it will be possible to develop and quickly evaluate multiple
    alternative drainage system designs using computer models that better represent
    the distribution of soil types and layering within a field or region. Thus, only
    the most critical data will need to be collected, to more precisely determine
    the design criteria for the best alternatives which could also substantially reduce
    the collection and scope of field data. A major question to be answered is: what
    detail of soil characterization is necessary to achieve a specific goal (e.g.
    discharge intensity) and what is the impact on the design and potential operation
    of the system or are there other strategies that will get to the same result?
    Haan and Skaggs (2003) determined that lateral saturated hydraulic conductivity
    accounted for 81% of the uncertainty related to computed drainage volumes using
    the DRAINMOD model. Research is needed to determine which parameters are the most
    critical for design and what confidence intervals are required for each parameter
    in the design process. In irrigated areas alternative water supplies such as treated
    municipal wastewater, water from food processing, animal waste lagoon water, and
    other industrial sources may become a significant portion of the available irrigation
    supply. Use of these water supplies creates additional concerns for water quality
    and nutrient management. Infectious diseases, E. coli, heavy metals, phosphorus
    loads and pharmaceuticals are potential pollutants that may be found in the irrigation
    supply from these sources. Cracking soils and soils with large macropores provide
    a direct circuit from the applied water, either irrigation or rainfall, to subsurface
    drainage systems. Conventional thinking assumes that there might be significant
    remediation of some of these pollutants in the soil, but short-circuiting may
    be a real problem. Future drainage designs and management will have to consider
    these potential sources as well. Most of the discussion in this paper has centered
    on the technical issues associated with the design and operation of subsurface
    drainage systems as they relate to sustaining agricultural production and minimizing
    impacts on the environment. The environmental interface will be a critical component
    as we move forward with the deployment of advanced drainage systems. In many coastal
    areas wetlands were replaced by agriculture and the question is whether it was
    a viable trade-off. Should we consider restoration of some wetlands in areas that
    are difficult to manage in agriculture? One question for the future is what is
    the public is willing to pay to protect the environment? In some instances, wetland
    and coastal areas are significant sources of the population''s livelihood and
    need to be protected. A significant issue will be what to do with existing drainage
    systems. Should these simply be repaired and replaced as is or should these systems
    be modified to reflect a new reality of improving water quality and conserving
    water? What does this mean for future designs? If the recommendation is to replace
    an existing system for environmental improvement, whose responsibility is it to
    pay for these modifications? Is there a public benefit that should be shared?
    A particularly vexing question is who is then responsible for the construction,
    maintenance and operation of the facilities that are required for the discharge
    of water collected from farmers’ fields (Schultz et al., 2013). Farmers have made
    the decision to install and manage a drainage system for economic reasons, e.g.
    improve productivity, but this still serves a greater good, i.e. feed the world,
    lower food costs. While the farmer has the responsibility for a field drainage
    system that is a direct benefit to him, the question remains, what entity has
    the responsibility for the entire system? This will have to be resolved as part
    of the design process. Groundwater pumping by tubewells is practiced extensively
    throughout the world to provide irrigation as well as drainage (Siebert et al.,
    2010; Bouarfa and Kuper, 2012). This is true particularly in Pakistan and India
    where tubewell usage has increased significantly over the years to provide a supplemental
    water supply. These systems can be localized and operated to benefit a single
    grower and thus provide security and control. However, well drainage is not generally
    as effective as subsurface drainage lines in providing a uniform control of the
    groundwater table position. Additionally, there is a requirement for power and
    the operating costs may be considerably higher. While an important component of
    water management, groundwater wells were not the focus of this manuscript and
    need to be considered elsewhere. Conclusions The future needs of the world for
    food and fiber are readily apparent, the stakes are high, and drainage will be
    critical to meeting the demand. However, to do this it will require significant
    changes in the design and operation of future drainage systems. These will include:
    drainage water quality will be a necessary criterion for system design; active
    management of the groundwater table position and discharge to manage pollutant
    loads and to conserve water for crop use will be essential; improved methods are
    needed for collection of soil physical and hydrologic properties to provide better
    spatial characterization to improve designs; the design will be an iterative process
    that includes agronomic production and environmental values; methods of disposal
    of drainage water will have to be developed to minimize the environmental impact
    and maximize the use of the water resource; impacted water supplies will be the
    future for irrigation and will have to be considered in the design and operation
    of drainage systems; drainage in arid areas will become part of an integrated
    water management system that includes the design and operation of both the irrigation
    and drainage system to meet crop water requirements and provide maximum water
    productivity. Many of the components exist but much research is needed to refine
    them and integrate them into a single system. Meeting the above goals will only
    be possible through the development of decision support systems (DSS) that can
    be used to optimize the design and operation of drainage systems in humid areas
    and irrigation and drainage systems in arid areas. Acknowledgement ‘The US Department

    strategies were simulated in VARIwise. • Iterative Learning Control (ILC) produced
    highest yield with soil–water data input. • Iterative Hill Climbing Control (IHCC)
    performed best with soil-and-plant data input. • Both sensor-based strategies
    were superior to the industry-standard strategy. Abstract Feedback control systems
    offer opportunities to accommodate spatial and temporal differences in crop water
    requirement and to improve the automated irrigation of field crops via real-time
    data from in-field plant, soil–water and evaporation sensing. This paper describes
    two sensor-based strategies applied to irrigation control, ‘Iterative Learning
    Control’ (ILC) and custom-designed ‘Iterative Hill Climbing Control’ (IHCC), implemented
    in the control simulation and evaluation framework ‘VARIwise’. Simulation of an
    irrigated cotton crop using soils and merged 1999–2004 weather data of SE Queensland,
    Australia, and represented by the performance of the well-validated cotton growth
    and production model OZCOT, permitted the relative performance of differing sensor
    data types and availability to be evaluated (both as alternatives and in combination)
    in meeting the requirement to optimise either crop yield or water use efficiency.
    These simulations indicated that ILC would perform better at maintaining soil–water
    deficit, whilst IHCC would be better at maximising crop yield when plant and soil
    sensors were utilised in combination. This work demonstrates that the optimal
    choice of field sensor(s) and control strategy will be a function of the irrigation
    objective and the spatial and temporal availability and type of field measurements.

    pivotLateral moveSchedulingAutomationOZCOT 1. Introduction Irrigation application
    and crop water use efficiencies can be improved by scheduling the irrigation of
    crops using physical and agronomic principles (Evans, 2006). The irrigation management
    strategy determined using these principles may be automatically implemented using
    a control system. Irrigation control strategies can use historical or real-time
    quantitative measurements of the crop, weather and soil, either singly or in combination,
    to automatically adjust the irrigation application. Irrigation is traditionally
    applied uniformly over an entire field, although not all plants in the field may
    require the same amount of water at any given time. In these cases, differential
    irrigation application to meet the plant requirements at different positions in
    the field may improve operational performance. However, as the plant response
    and environmental conditions fluctuate throughout the season, control strategies
    which accommodate temporal and spatial variability in the field and which locally
    modify the control actions (irrigation amounts) need to be ‘adaptive’ (Smith et
    al., 2009, McCarthy et al., 2010). Site-specific irrigation is enabled for centre
    pivot and lateral move irrigation machines through commercially available variable-rate
    hardware (e.g. Design Feats, Zimmatic, Valley). These systems adjust the irrigation
    application within the field by varying the speed of the machine and/or pulsing
    solenoid valves on each dropper. According to the choice of water outlet- sprinkler
    head or Low-Energy Precision Application (LEPA) sock – differential application
    may be achieved at the <1 m2 scale. The performance of an irrigation control system
    will be limited by: (i) the attributes that are measured in the field; (ii) the
    spatial resolution of the sensor data for both static sensors (e.g. soil–water
    probes) and on-the-go sensors (e.g. infrared thermometers measuring foliage temperature);
    and (iii) the temporal resolution of these data inputs. However the performance
    delivered by the control system may also be affected by unexpected environmental
    conditions (e.g. mid-irrigation and spatially-varied rainfall) or exceptional
    operational changes (e.g. crop damage or a capacity constraint of the irrigation
    machine such that it cannot deliver the optimal irrigation volumes in time). It
    may be expected that adaptive irrigation control systems have differing robustness
    to these operating conditions, data availability and system constraints (Warwick,
    1993). In principle at least, adaptive control systems automatically and continuously
    re-adjust the controller to obtain the desired performance of the system (Warwick,
    1993). Their application to irrigation can potentially improve crop development
    and/or water use efficiency. In addition, adaptive control strategies may be used
    to accommodate the differing levels of data quality and availability normally
    found in irrigation practice, i.e. utilise the various combinations of weather,
    soil and plant data available (McCarthy et al., 2011). Potentially optimal adaptive
    control strategies that determine irrigation volume and timing may be identified
    by simulating alternate adaptive control strategies in a simulation framework.
    1.1. Adaptive control strategies Existing strategies developed typically utilise
    one of several approaches, namely: (i) mathematical programming on models of crop
    yield or soil–plant–atmosphere to implement objective functions and optimise water
    allocation or profit (e.g. Azamathulla et al., 2009, Ghahraman and Sepaskhah,
    1997, Rao et al., 1988); (ii) linear quadratic control, which utilises optimal
    control theory with objective functions to determine irrigation application timing
    that aims to achieve a final state (e.g. Protopapas and Georgakakos, 1990, Lewis
    and Syrmos, 1995); (iii) artificial intelligence which has lower computational
    requirements than optimal control or mathematical programming and often uses a
    subsurface flow model to calculate wetting profiles and train a neural network
    to provide irrigation parameters that achieve the desired soil moisture profile
    (e.g. Schmitz et al., 2002, Schmitz et al., 2007, de Paly et al., 2010); (iv)
    model predictive control which iteratively executes a model to optimise process
    inputs rather than numerically operates on the model which has been used to regulate
    soil moisture (e.g. DeJonge et al., 2007, Park et al., 2009); or (v) learning
    control that uses sensor feedback rather than a model to perform system identification
    that has been used to determine site-specific flow rate adjustments required to
    control water or concentration of nutrients in the soil (e.g. Moore and Chen,
    2006). 1.2. Application of adaptive control to irrigation Adaptive control strategies
    applicable to irrigation may be either: (i) ‘sensor-based’, for which the (simulated)
    irrigation application is directly adjusted according to the measurement response
    (e.g. learning control); or (ii) ‘model-based’, which use a calibrated soil and
    plant model for irrigation management (e.g. mathematical programming, model predictive
    control). These strategies differ fundamentally in their data requirements and
    their use of the crop model. The focus of this paper is the relative performance
    of two candidate sensor-based irrigation control strategies. A companion paper,
    McCarthy et al. (2014), reports the implementation and performance of model-based
    strategies. By definition, sensor-based strategies can be implemented with a range
    of input variables chosen to provide feedback for control, and the efficacy of
    each is likely to be crop-dependent. Hence, as an example, the specific objective
    of this paper is to determine the potential efficacy of ‘sensor-based’ adaptive
    control for the practical irrigation of cotton. This paper reports a simulation
    study to determine the appropriate input variable/s for two sensor-based control
    strategies and comments on the relative utility of each input combination. 2.
    The control simulation framework ‘VARIwise’ A simulation framework ‘VARIwise’
    was created to develop, simulate, evaluate and also implement (as a machine controller)
    uniform and site-specific irrigation control strategies for centre pivot and lateral
    move irrigation machines. Full details are presented in McCarthy et al. (2010):

    Fig. 1. The simulation framework VARIwise configured to evaluate (in simulation
    mode) the sensor-based adaptive control strategies. The items shown in grey/hatched
    are not implemented but would be present in a field evaluation.) This diagram
    is adapted from the full VARIwise flowchart presented as Fig. 2 of McCarthy et
    al. (2010). Within VARIwise, the field is divided into cells of minimum area 1
    m2 to accommodate spatial variability. The software allows for: • the inclusion
    of field-scale variations in input parameters (e.g. crop response, crop age, target
    yield and management constraints); • the input of data at a range of temporal
    scales; • the ability to apply the various levels of control strategies for variable-rate
    irrigation at different spatial scales; and • requires a crop model integrated
    within VARIwise. In the simulation mode this model provides feedback data which
    permits evaluation of any control strategy implemented. The well-established cotton
    growth model OZCOT (Wells and Hearn, 1992) has been utilised by VARIwise for the
    present study. The OZCOT model combines a temperature-driven model of fruit dynamics
    with a soil–water balance model, and original sub-models for: fruiting, leaf area
    generating, boll growth and elementary nitrogen (Wells and Hearn, 1992). The model
    was developed and validated for different soil types from agronomic experiments
    over a period of 30 years covering a range of Australian cotton growing regions
    (Hearn, 1994). OZCOT’s capacity to simulate yield, fruiting dynamics, nitrogen
    uptake and water use has been validated in the Ord Valley, Western Australia,
    for summer grown cotton during the 1960s and 1970s (Hearn, 1994). The model responds
    to different climatic situations, crop physiological characteristics, agronomic
    variables and management decisions, but does not account for the effects of insect
    pests, diseases, weeds and soil nutrient limitations other than nitrogen. The
    model does not simulate the effects of climate and management on fibre quality.
    The OZCOT model requires the parameters listed in Table 1 to be written into input
    files. After the OZCOT model has been executed, an output file is produced that
    contains estimates of the soil–water, fruit load and vegetation indices for each
    day of the predicted cotton season. Table 1. Agronomic factors used in cotton

    control strategies Following a review of candidate adaptive control strategies
    (McCarthy et al., 2013), the two sensor-based adaptive control strategies implemented
    in VARIwise are ‘Iterative Learning Control’ (ILC) and ‘Iterative Hill Climbing
    Control’ (IHCC). The two strategies are described below, and their implementation
    set out in the section following. In summary, these strategies refine the estimate
    of each successive irrigation volume applied by: [ILC] – iteratively adjusting
    the irrigation volume applied in each cell of the field using the incremental
    response, i.e. the OZCOT-determined plant growth arising from the change in particular
    field sensor information which has resulted from the previous water application,
    in each cell; or [IHCC] – similarly adjusting the irrigation volumes, but based
    on multiple sensor increment information, using a range of irrigation volumes
    applied within a group of homogenous cells. 3.1. Iterative Learning Control Iterative
    Learning Control (ILC) can be used to control repetitive processes, e.g. robot
    arm manipulators, repetitive rotary systems, and factory batch processes, where
    the process model is imperfectly known (Ahn et al., 2007). An irrigation system
    may be interpreted as a repetitive process because the irrigation machine iteratively
    passes over the field throughout the crop season; and, given the complexity of
    variable plant growth, is certainly imperfectly described from the control perspective.
    Hence, in principle, classical ILC can be used to improve the system performance
    by eliminating the effects of any unknown but repeating disturbance (Korovessi
    and Linninger, 2006). Applied to irrigation, an unknown feature of the crop response
    model that reoccurs as a consequence of irrigation may be regarded as a ‘repeating
    disturbance’. ILC requires that the process controlled by the strategy is reset
    to the same initial conditions after each iteration (Korovessi and Linninger,
    2006). Again, applied to irrigation, each iteration of ILC is an irrigation event,
    and the conditions may be approximately reset by scheduling the irrigations after
    a set amount of crop water use. Moore and Chen (2006) demonstrated an ILC strategy
    for a centre pivot irrigation machine to determine site-specific irrigation application
    volumes using soil–water as the feedback variable. The strategy was evaluated
    in simulations using a soil model with one dimensional flow. This soil model assumed
    constant crop water use irrespective of the crop stage, crop conditions and the
    daily and sub-daily weather dynamics. Hence, the model was reset to the same initial
    conditions after a fixed time delay and irrigation events were scheduled at regular
    time intervals. 3.2. Iterative Hill Climbing Control A drawback of the ILC strategy
    is the potentially inefficient system identification, and particularly so when
    applied to irrigation which has a ‘learning increment’ of typically several days.
    This is a result of only one irrigation volume being evaluated in each cell during
    each irrigation event. As an alternative, adaptive spatially-varied identification
    may be more rapidly achieved by utilising site-specific combinations of plant,
    soil and weather data in different sub-areas of the field, i.e. using aggregates
    of cells having similar properties. Likewise, adaptive system identification may
    be incorporated into an irrigation control system to account for the slow speed
    of crop dynamics and the low frequency of irrigation events. To meet these requirements
    and circumvent these limitations, an alternative, multi-dimensional approach was
    developed, as follows. The technique is designated ‘Iterative Hill Climbing Control’
    (IHCC), in which ‘hill climbing’ involves changing the state of the system into
    one that is closer to the goal in the direction of steepest gradient (Russell
    and Norvig, 1995). IHCC provides faster optimisation than ILC alone because it
    permits the evaluation of both: • a range of inputs to the system at each irrigation
    event (i.e. multi-dimensional ILC); and • a range of irrigation volumes on different
    ‘test cells’ in the field (within the particular group of cells) at each irrigation
    event. The responses of the test cells are compared to determine which irrigation
    volume resulted in the response closest to the desired response. This enables
    the control system to identify appropriate input options within a single irrigation
    event without using a process model. 4. Implementation of sensor-based control
    strategies in VARIwise The ILC and IHCC strategies were implemented in VARIwise
    to calculate the optimal irrigation application volumes for each cell. For the
    ILC strategy, the irrigation volumes are determined from previous irrigation applications
    and measured responses. For the IHCC strategy, the volumes to apply are determined
    by evaluating the response to a range of irrigation volumes previously applied
    to test cells within representative homogenous areas of the field. Homogenous
    areas within fields are referred to as a management ‘zone’ in this paper and zone
    boundaries may be determined using soil properties, crop or variety differences,
    topography or management constraints. The implementation of the control strategies
    within VARIwise involves six steps described in the following sections. Of necessity,
    the procedures differ for the ILC and IHCC strategies. In particular, the procedure
    for the calculation of irrigation volumes is fundamentally different (Sections
    4.6 and 4.7, respectively). 4.1. Select control areas The ILC and IHCC strategies
    require different spatial resolutions for irrigation application. ILC can be used
    to determine irrigation applications to each individual cell; however, for IHCC
    the field must be divided into a number of zones. The identification of zones
    for the IHCC strategy can be undertaken automatically by VARIwise using a measured
    field property (e.g. soil property). In this case, the property data assigned
    to each cell in the field is sorted in ascending order and then grouped into the
    user-specified number of evenly-sized zones. A small number of cells (i.e. a group
    of ‘test cells’) are then selected in each zone to evaluate different irrigation
    applications. The application of the various irrigation volumes to the test cells
    results in differential soil–water and crop responses. Hence, test cell responses
    are only indicative of the response in each zone for one irrigation event and
    the IHCC strategy requires the selection of new test cells in each zone for each
    irrigation. In VARIwise, this is achieved by a simple increment of the test cell
    number along with a requirement that the replacement cell still lies within the
    same zone and has not previously been used as a test cell. 4.2. Determine day
    of first irrigation The number of days until the first irrigation in each cell
    or zone is calculated by dividing the plant available water capacity (PAWC) of
    the soil by the daily crop water use or daily crop evapotranspiration (ETc). This
    procedure is described in McCarthy et al. (2010). 4.3. Calculate first irrigation
    volume For ILC and IHCC non-test cells, the first irrigation application volume
    is calculated by aggregating the daily ETc since the crop was sown. The daily
    ETc is calculated as evapotranspiration obtained from the weather data, i.e. via
    reference (potential) evapotranspiration ETo, and the appropriate crop coefficient,
    Kc, as published for each crop and growth stage, following the standard methodology
    of FAO 56, Allen et al. (1998). For IHCC test cells, the irrigation volume applied
    to each test cell is similarly determined using the ETo since the crop was sown,
    but with a range of crop coefficients imposed. These crop coefficients are offset
    from the zone crop coefficient (which is the crop coefficient used to calculate
    the irrigation volumes applied to the non-test cells). The crop coefficient offsets
    used are specified by the user as a percentage of the zone crop coefficient; for
    example, using a zone crop coefficient of Kc = 0.35, five test cells and an offset
    of 40%, the crop coefficients would be 0.07, 0.21, 0.35, 0.49 and 0.63 for each
    test cell, respectively (i.e. multiples of 40% on either side of the median crop
    coefficient, 0.35). 4.4. Check data availability In the simulation environment
    the model output data are obtained for the cells and days specified by the user.
    This enables the performance of the control strategy to be evaluated with input
    data at different spatial and temporal resolutions. In a field implementation,
    the currently-available datasets are kriged (i.e. spatially interpolated) across
    the field to ascribe a value to each cell in the field. This is because sensor
    data may be unavailable due to sensor failures or the installation of sensors
    being impractical (large numbers of infield sensors are often obstructive to growers).
    4.5. Determine day of next irrigation The irrigation events are scheduled when
    the crop has reached a user-specified cumulative crop water use since the previous
    irrigation event. The method of calculating the crop water use depends on the
    datasets available, thus: • If soil data input is used in the control strategy
    and update data are available, the crop water use is determined using the change
    in soil–water since the previous irrigation. • If soil and weather data inputs
    are used in the control strategy but update soil data are not available and update
    weather data are available, the cumulative crop water use is determined as the
    sum of the daily crop evapotranspiration (calculated using the weather data).
    • If soil data input is used but update data are not available, plus weather data
    are not available or not used, then the cumulative crop water use is calculated
    using historically averaged weather data. Since the crop water use may not be
    uniform across the field due to spatial variability, the irrigations are initiated
    when an arbitrary proportional of the cells in the field have reached the user-specified
    cumulative crop water use (e.g. 15%). 4.6. Calculate irrigation volumes – ILC
    For ILC the irrigation volume applied to each cell in the field is calculated
    using a common ILC algorithm (Ahn et al., 2007) which calculates the required
    system input (the irrigation volume to be applied) uk+1 at the forthcoming iteration,
    i.e. the (k + 1)th irrigation, according to: (1) where uk is the system input
    (irrigation volume) on the previous iteration (kth irrigation); γ the learning
    gain (a scalar factor); yk(Δ) the measured system output (i.e. sensor data value,
    kriged as necessary) after delay Δ; and yd(Δ) the desired system output (i.e.
    desired sensor data value) after delay Δ The delay in measurement after each irrigation
    Δ permits the crop to respond to that irrigation (typically one day for the sensing
    of soil–water change; longer for the sensing of a plant growth variable). In all
    cases the response delay Δ must be less than the interval between irrigations.
    The learning gain γ is chosen by iteration as a compromise between slow learning
    (low γ) and instability in the predicted uk+1 values (high γ). For each irrigation
    event and cell, the ILC algorithm of Eq. (1) calculates the volume to apply at
    the next irrigation event using measured field data and the desired value based
    on a single measured variable y. However, because more than one soil or plant
    measured variable may be applicable, an expanded ILC algorithm was implemented
    to accommodate for multiple variables. In this case, optimisation may be achieved
    by either one, or a combination, of the following (Liu et al., 2001): i. assigning
    a weighting to each optimisation objective (variable yi) and constructing a weighted
    sum of all the objectives, and/or ii. optimising each objective separately to
    explore trade-offs. where the separate optimisation objectives are driven by difference
    between the measured and desired variable values, yi,k and yi,d respectively.
    The multi-objective optimisation option (i) requires subjective selection of the
    weights for each objective; however the separate-objective option (ii) requires
    an additional decision-making procedure to determine which objective optimisation
    results in the desired performance for both objectives. The present VARIwise implementation
    for sensor-based irrigation optimisation aims to evaluate the effect of using
    multiple data inputs and the multi-objective optimisation option (i) was presumed
    sufficient with each objective equally weighed. Hence, the multi-objective ILC
    algorithm is: (2) where n variables are used in the control strategy and wi is
    the weighting of the ith variable for the control strategy (and all weightings
    sum to unity). 4.7. Calculate irrigation volumes – IHCC A performance index (PI)
    is calculated for each test cell in each zone. In VARIwise, the data used to determine
    the PI is specified by the user, and the type of data used to determine the PI
    affects how the PI is calculated. To optimise an output parameter, the PI can
    be calculated as the ratio of the current boll or square count to the maximum
    count of the test cells using: (3) For data that correspond to an optimal time
    series data set, the performance index is: (4) where t represents the day of the
    data collection. Multiple data variables may be incorporated into the PI by applying
    weights (ki) to the performance index of each data type (PIi) and summing the
    weighted indices (where there are n data inputs). Hence, the general form for
    the PI calculation with multiple data variables and weights is: (5) The PI for
    each test cell can then be evaluated to determine the crop coefficient and corresponding
    irrigation application for the ‘non-test’ cells in the subsequent irrigation event.
    This is achieved by identifying the crop coefficient that corresponds to the maximum
    PI and would be obtained by finding the maximum point of a quadratic equation
    fitted through points plotted on a PI versus crop coefficient graph. If the maximum
    point of the quadratic lies outside the range of feasible crop coefficient values,
    then the crop coefficient for the test cell with the highest PI is selected as
    the optimal crop coefficient. If all the test cells have the same PI then the
    crop coefficient is estimated from Table 12 of Allen et al. (1998). After the
    crop has consumed a user-defined cumulative crop water use, the non-test cells
    are then irrigated with an amount calculated using the aggregated ETo and the
    optimal crop coefficient. The volumes applied to the new test cells are calculated
    using the user-defined offset percentage applied to the optimal crop coefficient
    identified for the previous irrigation. 4.8. Practical considerations For centre
    pivot and lateral move machines, the machine capacity and application volumes
    affect the time taken to traverse the field, and hence the timing of irrigation
    applications to each cell. To minimise the impact of travel time, the irrigation
    application to individual cells is limited to an arbitrary maximum volume (e.g.
    25 mm) and the amount of water applied to individual cells is adjusted by the
    travel time and the daily crop water use. 5. Case study – Evaluation of sensor-based
    control strategies with cotton This section reports a case study using VARIwise
    to compare the performance of the ILC and IHCC strategies when different field
    sensor data (e.g. soil, plant and weather) were available, both singly or in combination.
    These strategies were also compared with the yield and water use performance produced
    for the equivalent crop irrigated according to an industry-standard irrigation
    management strategy. These strategies and sensor data input combinations were
    evaluated for both homogeneous and spatially variable fields. 5.1. Simulated crop,
    growing conditions and crop model The case study involved simulations of a whole
    season cotton crop grown on the Darling Downs, Australia with parameters as outlined
    in Table 1. The sowing data, soil properties and weather pattern was characteristic
    of cotton growing regions in Australia. The soil and plant parameters of the cotton
    model OZCOT were kept within the boundary values defined by Wells and Hearn (1992).
    The irrigation control strategies were initially assessed on homogeneous fields
    using different combinations of data input. This would enable separation of the
    impacts of the spatial and temporal variations. In these simulations, fields with
    uniform plant available water capacity of 60 mm, 150 mm and 200 mm were implemented
    for sand, clay loam and clay fields, respectively. Spatial variability in soil
    parameters was then introduced in each cell and the zones applied to the ILC and
    IHCC strategies are shown in Fig. 2. In the simulated field, the plant available
    water capacity (PAWC) ranges from 60 to 200 mm. This was selected to ensure the
    control strategies could deal with the different soil types that often exist within
    fields. The spatial variability in PAWC across irrigated broadacre fields in Australia
    can be 30–500% (Wong et al., 2006, Rab et al., 2009) because of differences in
    soil texture and root distribution. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 2.
    Soil variability for: (a) industry-standard, ILC and IHCC strategy simulation;
    and (b) the cells assigned to each zone using the soil variability data of 2(a).
    Averaged weather input was used when sensed weather data was not an input. This
    provided the model with the minimum set of weather information that could be generated
    which would enable the model to operate. The averaged weather dataset was generated
    using SILO (QNRM, 2009) climate datasets for the cropping period in the previous
    five years and calculating the daily average maximum and minimum temperature,
    solar radiation and rainfall such that each day in the season had the same weather
    conditions. A daily weather profile was obtained for the GPS location −28.18°N,
    151.26°E from an Australian Bureau of Meteorology SILO dataset (QNRM, 2009) for
    2004/2005. The weather profile is relatively hot and wet, late in the crop season.
    The weather profile (Fig. 3) was used as the weather data input for simulations
    that include weather in the input data combination, whilst the same weather profile
    (Fig. 3) was averaged daily and used as the weather data input for simulations
    without weather in the input data combination. Download : Download full-size image

    learning, iterative hill climbing control strategies. 5.2. Determination of the
    industry-standard (baseline) irrigation schedule An industry-standard irrigation
    management strategy was implemented as a baseline for the performance of the adaptive
    control strategies. This strategy applied a uniform irrigation treatment across
    the field where irrigation events were initiated when the soil–water deficit reached
    a set amount in one point in the field. The soil–water deficit was taken in the
    cell with the lowest plant available water capacity, as this is the most limiting
    soil (Fig. 2(a)). In this simulation, 25 mm was applied to the whole field when
    the soil–water deficit had reached 30 mm in the cell with sandy soil. 5.3. Adaptive
    control implementation The robustness of the irrigation control strategy to sensed
    data availability was evaluated by simulating the strategies using different combinations
    of data input (McCarthy et al., 2011). This indicated the control inputs that
    are most appropriate to each control strategy. The simulations used the same underlying
    crop model but different combinations of input variables for control. For example,
    the simulation evaluating the importance of sensed soil data to the ILC strategy
    involves adjusting the irrigation volume according to the error between the desired
    soil–water and the measured soil–water after each irrigation event. Irrigations
    were initiated when 15% of the cells had consumed 30% of the PAWC. 5.3.1. Methodology
    – ILC The ILC strategy was simulated using the five applicable input data combinations
    (Table 2). Weather-only input is not applicable for control as the weather data
    does not provide feedback on the crop response. When both weather and soil data
    were available, soil data was used instead of weather data to determine the crop
    water use. For the simulations with two input data variables, the weightings on
    each variable were chosen to be 0.5. Table 2. Simulations conducted to compare
    interactions between control strategies (labelled by ID#) and input variables

    plant (B) Averaged SILO data Target leaf area index Change in soil–water The simulations
    using plant data to determine the irrigation application used leaf area index
    as the input variable for control. This is because the ILC algorithm assumes that
    the refined input is adjusted in the same direction as the difference between
    the measured and desired value for a positive learning gain; whereas for a negative
    learning gain the refined input is adjusted in the opposite direction to the difference
    between the measured and desired value. For example, when the desired value is
    less than the measured value (and the difference is negative) and the learning
    gain is positive, then the irrigation volume applied is less than the previous
    irrigation volume. For many crops an applicable plant variable may be leaf area
    index since vegetative growth typically increases with increased water application
    and hence would require a positive learning gain. However, for cotton, the desired
    reproductive growth is maximised when the plant is under mild water stress (Gibb
    et al., 2004), hence the square and boll counts are not applicable for ILC. An
    optimal time series dataset is required for each input variable to compare with
    the measured output and calculate the next irrigation volume uk+1. The leaf area
    index (LAI) for an optimal cotton crop is shown in Fig. 4. The dataset was obtained
    from OZCOT for a high yielding simulation and the curve was smoothed using exponential
    smoothing with a smoothing factor of 0.85. For this case study, a 12.6 ha centre
    pivot irrigated field was automatically divided into 1266 cells of area 100 m2
    (with cell dimensions of 10 m wide and 10 m long). Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 4. Target leaf area index used for iterative learning control strategy
    for cotton in VARIwise (Wells and Hearn, 1992). The simulations using soil data
    used soil–water deficit as the controlled variable. In this case, the soil–water
    variable is calculated by subtracting the desired deficit from the full point
    (field capacity) of the soil. The simulations using soil data input adjusted the
    irrigation volume to achieve a deficit of 10% of the plant available water capacity
    in each cell following each irrigation event. Simulations for ILC were conducted
    in VARIwise using the agronomic factors in Table 1 and the underlying soil variability
    in Fig. 2(a). The desired LAI time series set of Fig. 4 was used. This cell size
    was selected to enable timely execution of the simulations and accommodate substantial
    in-field spatial variability of soil properties. The following values were used
    for the ILC parameters defined in Section 4.6: • the learning gain (γ) was unity;
    • the irrigations were initiated after the crop had consumed 30% of the PAWC;
    and • the time delay (Δ) between the irrigation event and the parameter measurement
    depended on the data input. The data for feedback in the control strategy were
    obtained from the OZCOT model on different days depending on the data type: the
    soil dataset was obtained one day after the previous irrigation event, whilst
    the plant dataset was obtained one day prior to next scheduled irrigation event.
    5.3.2. Methodology – IHCC Using weather, soil and plant input data, there are
    six possible combinations of data input for IHCC (Table 3). As with ILC, weather-only
    input is not applicable for control as the weather data does not provide a measure
    of the crop response. No data combinations with weather and soil data were used
    because soil data are used (if available) instead of weather data to determine
    the crop water use. The strategies with soil data input aimed to maintain a soil–water
    deficit equal to 10% of the plant available water capacity in each cell following
    each irrigation event. For the simulations with two input variables, the weighting
    on each variable was set to be 0.5. Table 3. Simulations conducted to compare
    interactions between control strategies (labelled by ID#) and input variables

    AND plant (B) Averaged SILO data Maximise square/boll count Change in soil–water
    The simulations using plant data to determine the irrigation application used
    square count as the input variable for control. This is because squares form earlier
    in the crop season than bolls (and can be controlled earlier in the crop season).
    Square count was used instead of leaf area index to maximise the reproductive
    growth of the cotton plant (which should maximise the final yield) rather than
    manage the vegetative growth. For IHCC strategies there must be sufficient cells
    in the field for the test cells to be replaced after each irrigation event in
    the crop season. For example, a field with three zones and five test cells requires
    15 test cells for each irrigation event. Because these test cells must be replaced
    with new test cells after every irrigation event, a minimum of 300 cells are required
    for a season with 20 irrigation events. The field of 1266 cells was automatically
    divided into three zones (Fig. 2(b)) and five test cells were used in each zone.
    The underlying soil variability of Fig. 2(a) was implemented. The feedback data
    were obtained from the OZCOT model one day after the previous irrigation event
    for soil responses and one day before the next scheduled irrigation event for
    plant responses. 5.4. Performance of control strategies 5.4.1. Performance using
    an industry-standard irrigation management strategy An industry-standard irrigation
    schedule was implemented with field properties as per Table 1 and involved applying
    25 mm between 14 October 2004 and 14 March 2005 when the soil–water deficit in
    a sandy cell reached 30 mm. Table 4 presents the results of the industry-standard
    irrigation control strategy simulated for three homogeneous fields and one spatially
    varied field. In these results IWUI is the ratio of the crop yield (e.g. bales
    of cotton) to the irrigation water applied (ML), whilst CWUI is the ratio of crop
    yield (e.g. bales) to the total water used by the crop (ML) (BPA, 1999). For the
    homogenous fields the yield was higher as the PAWC increased, while the water
    use was highest on the clay field and lowest on the clay loam field. This indicates
    that the application of a fixed amount (25 mm) to all three cells produces high
    yield on clay but low yield on sand. Hence, the site-specific irrigation volumes
    applied should be adjusted according to the PAWC of individual cells. Table 4.

    yield of the spatially-varied field was 9.1 ± 1.9 bales/ha with CWUI of 0.9 bales/MLtotal
    (total water in ML) and IWUI of 1.4 bales/MLirrigated (irrigation applied in ML)
    (Fig. 5). The total volume of water applied to the crop (including rainfall) was
    10.2 ML/ha, whilst the irrigation applied to the crop was 6.8 ML/ha. Variations
    reported in the average yield values are standard deviations of yield across the
    field (Fig. 5, Fig. 6). The spatially varied field produced yields consistent
    with the results of the irrigation of the individual soil types, with the yield
    approximately the average of the yield for the three sand, clay loam and clay
    soils. The irrigation applied to the spatially varied field was higher than that
    to the individual soil types. This is likely because the irrigation events were
    initiated according to the sand cells (which would be more frequent than the clay
    loam and loam cells). The applied water and yields produced by the simulations
    are consistent with local typical experience. Download : Download full-size image

    Performance using ILC Table 5 and Fig. 6 sets out the simulated outputs of the
    ILC strategies using the data input combinations described in Table 3. The yield
    and irrigation applied were generally lower for the sand and clay loam soil types
    than those averaged across the spatially varied field. This indicates that the
    ILC strategy irrigation events were initiated at sub-optimal timing for the sand
    and clay loam cells. The timing of the irrigation events was based on the crop
    water use relative to the PAWC. Table 5. Performance of the ILC strategies with
    different data input combinations for homogenous and spatially variable fields.

    produced the highest yield and water use efficiency with soil–water input (simulation
    #1). Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Irrigation volumes applied to
    sand, clay loam and clay cells for ILC strategies that target: (a) soil–water
    deficit (simulation #1); and (b) leaf area index (simulation #2). ILC produced
    lower yields with leaf area index input (simulations #2, #3 and #5) than with
    soil–water input (Fig. 6). The irrigation volumes applied were higher throughout
    the crop season for ILC targeting leaf area index than soil–water deficit (Fig.
    7). This indicates that the leaf area index is not proportionally related to irrigation
    application and that the leaf area index input is not effective to determine the
    crop water requirements for this crop. The leaf area index measurement also may
    not have detected whether the plant was actively transpiring or stressed. The
    irrigation volumes applied using leaf area index also exceeded the soil–water
    deficit (Fig. 8(b)); hence, ILC with leaf area index input could not adapt to
    the difference in soil–water for different soils. The leaf area index was also
    generally lower for ILC targeting leaf area index than ILC maintaining soil–water
    deficit (Fig. 9). This suggests that leaf area index is a less effective indicator
    of irrigation requirement than soil–water deficit for ILC. The additional input
    of plant data to the soil simulation (simulation #4) also reduced the simulated
    yield and water use efficiency (compared with simulation #1). Download : Download

    (simulation #6); and (d) maximise square/boll count (simulation #9). There were
    differences between the simulated and desired soil–water deficit for the strategy
    targeting soil–water deficit (#simulation 1, Fig. 8(a)). These were likely caused
    by the plant physiological response varying to each irrigation event during the
    crop season, while the ILC relies on process repetition to refine the irrigation
    volume and assumes that the crop conditions essentially ‘reset’ before the next
    irrigation event. In the spatially-varied fields the ILC strategies generally
    produced higher yields in the clay loam areas than sand and clay areas. This suggests
    that irrigating the different soil types during the same irrigation event did
    not lead to yield optimisation and could be caused by the crop undergoing either
    insufficient or too much water stress before irrigation events were initiated.
    The standard deviation in yield across the field was lower using soil data and
    not plant data. This is because plant data used in ILC could not effectively indicate
    the irrigation requirement. 5.4.3. Performance using IHCC The simulations described
    in Table 3 produced the yields and water use efficiencies in Fig. 10 and Table
    6. The yield was generally higher for the homogenous fields than the spatially
    varied field. This is because each test cell had the same properties and would
    have the same response to the test irrigation volumes, leading to a more accurate
    system identification procedure. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 10.

    2.0 Spatially variable 11.4 ± 1.8 11.6 7.3 1.0 1.6 IHCC produced reasonable yields
    and water use efficiencies for all data input combinations. The highest yield
    was simulated using the soil-and-plant input (simulation #9), whilst the lowest
    yields were simulated using plant-only input (simulation #7) and weather-and-plant
    input (simulation #8). The IHCC strategy that maximised square/boll count (simulation
    #9) resulted in a higher maximum square count than the strategy that attempted
    to maintain a fixed soil–water deficit (simulation #6) (Fig. 9). The simulations
    using plant input in combinations with weather or soil data (simulations #8–10)
    produced higher yields than those only using only soil data input (simulations
    #6). This suggests that square count indicated the plant status more accurately
    than soil response. The soil-and-plant strategy that targeted a soil–water deficit
    and maximised square/boll count (simulation #9) performed better than simulations
    that maximised square/boll count (simulation #10). This is because the first squares
    form approximately 60 days after sowing, and the strategy requires soil–water
    indicate crop water requirement during this early stage. IHCC with soil-and-plant
    input (simulation #9) applied less irrigation water than that with plant-only
    (simulation #7). This is because the fruit load input does not accurately identify
    the irrigation timing or volume of water to be applied and tends to over-irrigate
    during wet periods of the crop season (e.g. 63–86 days after sowing, Fig. 11).
    Including the soil data improves the accuracy of the application volume determination
    and hence, the efficiency of water application was higher using soil data in combination
    with the plant data. Download : Download full-size image Fig. 11. Irrigation volumes
    applied to sand, clay loam and clay cells for IHCC strategies that maximise square/boll
    count and determine irrigation timing using: (a) weather data (simulation #7);
    and (b) soil–water content (simulation #9). The spatial variability observed in
    the simulated yield (Fig. 10) was higher when a single sensor input (simulations
    #6 and #7) was used compared to a multi-sensor combinations. Spatial variability
    in yield was caused by both differences in the soil properties and the ‘test’
    irrigation volumes being applied to various cells across the field. The irrigation
    volumes applied to the clay loam and clay cells were generally larger than those
    applied to the sand cells (Fig. 11). The higher soil–water storage capacity on
    these soils was found to produce larger crops which then resulted in larger irrigation
    deficits at irrigation. It was also noted that the soil–water deficit at irrigation
    in the sand, clay loam and clay cells was generally closer to the target deficit
    (6 mm, 15 mm and 20 mm, respectively) using weather-and-soil input (Fig. 11(a))
    than using weather-and-plant input (Fig. 11(b)). As for the ILC strategies, IHCC
    strategies produced higher yields in the clay loam areas than sand and clay areas.
    This indicates that the yield was not optimised in all soil types of the field
    which could be caused by the crop undergoing either too little or much water stress
    before an irrigation event. The standard deviation in yield across the field was
    highest in the simulation using neither soil or weather data. This is because
    plant data could not effectively indicate the irrigation timing for IHCC. Deviations
    from the desired soil–water deficit were also caused by the test cells not being
    representative of all the cells in the zone, causing the ‘best’ response of the
    test cells to be inaccurate and the irrigation application of the whole zone to
    be inappropriate. It follows that the square count may not be maximised in each
    cell of the field because of the differences in properties of the test cells and
    non-test cells. Deviations may also have been caused by test cells being inappropriately
    chosen at the border between zones where the zone division is jagged and therefore
    less certain. Hence, the location of the test cells is important for the irrigation
    optimisation. 6. Discussion The Iterative Learning Control strategy generally
    produced higher crop water use efficiency performance indices than the Iterative
    Hill Climbing Control strategy for spatially varied fields. For homogenous fields,
    the IHCC strategies generally produced higher yields than the ILC strategies.
    This is because IHCC could optimise fruit development with repeatable system identification.
    This indicates that the consideration of fruiting rather than vegetative growth
    in the irrigation control strategy could produce significant yield improvements.
    The highest crop and irrigation water use efficiencies were achieved using ILC
    with soil–water data (simulation #1), whilst the highest irrigation water use
    efficiency using IHCC was achieved when soil-and-plant data (simulation #9) was
    used. Similar yields were obtained for the IHCC strategy with soil-and-plant input
    (simulation #9, 12.4 ± 1.6 bales/ha) and the ILC strategy with soil-only input
    (simulation #1, 12.2 ± 1.5 bales/ha). ILC adjusted the irrigation volume to achieve
    the desired soil–water deficit following the irrigation event for the different
    soil types in the field. The IHCC strategy was less effective at maintaining a
    target soil–water deficit than the ILC strategy (Fig. 8). With soil-only input,
    IHCC produced an average yield and crop water use efficiency (simulation #6, 11.2
    ± 1.8 bales/ha and 1.0 bales/MLtotal, respectively) lower than those of the ILC
    strategy with soil-input (simulation #1). The IHCC strategy can optimise parameters
    (e.g. through maximising square/boll counts) and target temporally-variable soil/crop
    responses, whilst the ILC strategy can only target temporally-variable soil/crop
    responses (e.g. soil–water deficit). Hence, leaf area index was selected for ILC
    and fruit load was selected for IHCC. ILC performed poorly with plant data (i.e.
    leaf area index) input. This suggests that IHCC may be more appropriate for weather-and-plant
    data input, whilst ILC may be preferable with soil-input only. However, the case
    study indicates that leaf area index input was not appropriate for ILC because
    of its lack of sensitivity to irrigation volume application. For the ILC strategy,
    there was no benefit in using multiple combinations of soil, plant or weather
    data. The irrigation refinement was most effective during dry periods of the season
    as rainfall was a (non-repeating) disturbance in the control system. However,
    ILC adapted rapidly to the new system state in dry periods following the rainfall.
    7. Conclusion Two sensor-based irrigation control strategies, ‘Iterative Learning
    Control’ (ILC) and custom-designed ‘Iterative Hill Climbing Control’ (IHCC) were
    simulated in the software VARIwise for a cotton crop ‘grown’ with the soils and
    merged 2004–2009 weather data of south-east Queensland, Australia, and represented
    by the performance of the well-validated cotton growth and production model OZCOT.
    These strategies were simulated for both homogenous and spatially variable fields.
    Both strategies produced higher simulated yields and water use efficiencies than
    an industry-standard irrigation management strategy. The optimal sensor combination
    and control strategy that should be used in the field will depend on the crop
    and water availability. • Where sensor data availability is non-limiting then
    for homogeneous fields, IHCC performed the best with plant and soil data input,
    whilst ILC performed the best with soil data input, where IHCC produced higher
    yields than ILC. • However, in spatially varied fields, the simulations indicated
    that there was no significant difference between the highest yield achieved by
    the ILC strategy using soil–water data and the IHCC strategy using soil and plant
    sensor data. • Where sensor data availability is limited then the results indicate
    that an ILC strategy would be preferable to optimise irrigated water use efficiency.
    The sensor-based control strategies simulated in VARIwise provide promising performance
    of site-specific adaptive irrigation. These strategies could be extended to other
    irrigation systems (e.g. drip, surface) by considering irrigation application
    hydraulics. Implementation of these in the field would require high resolution
    soil and plant sensing. Comparison of simulated control strategies potentially
    provides a driver for the development of particular types of sensors. Field validation
    remains a challenge (unless there are multiple fields and irrigation machines)
    but further work will involve field evaluations to compare the simulated and measured
    control strategy performance. Acknowledgements The authors are grateful to the

    References Media Tables Share Abstract A field study was conducted on sugar beet
    during a two-year period to investigate the effects and comparison of different
    irrigation methods and treatments on crop yield, irrigation water use efficiency
    (IWUE), and pan coefficient determination in a semiarid region with limited water
    resources. The experiments were in complete randomized blocks design. Three replications
    were used with different levels of irrigation water amounts (25, 50, 75, and 100%),
    evapotranspiration (ET) of sugar beet seasonal water requirement with surface
    drip tape (SDT), and conventional furrow irrigation method (CFI), with and without
    soil and water monitoring, and comparison with CROPWAT modeling. The variety of
    sugar beet was Rasool. The highest and lowest average irrigation water use efficiencies
    on the basis of root yield with 16.16 and 9 kg / m 3 , and sugar yield with 3.82
    and 1.33 kg / m 3 , for both experimental years was achieved under different irrigation
    treatments of T4 (25% ET) SDT and CFI, respectively. The results of this study
    showed that by using drip tape irrigation method with different treatments (100%
    ET), (75% ET), (50% ET), (25% ET), instead of conventional furrow irrigation method
    with and without soil, water, and root monitoring, (28.8, 46.6, 64.5, and 82.2%)
    and (38.4, 53.8, 69.2, and 84.6%) of sugar beet seasonal irrigation water requirement
    can be saved, respectively. The results also showed that sugar beet average annual
    water, requirement under conventional furrow irrigation method with soil, water,
    and root monitoring was almost 8.4% and 28.70% lower compared to CROPWAT modeling
    and conventional furrow irrigation without monitoring. Additionally, this study
    showed a pan coefficient ( K p ) equal to 0.80 for the investigated semiarid region.
    Introduction Drought stress is the main problem of agriculture improvement in
    the world and in the western parts of Iran, especially Kermanshah province with
    different climate facilities. This province with semiarid climate is one of the
    most important agricultural regions in the country producing sugar beet. Also,
    there are two sugar beet factories with total capacity of 3,500 t per day available
    in this province. Annually, approximately 30,000 ha of croplands in the province
    grow sugar beet. The existing water resources in some parts of Kermanshah province
    are strictly restricted. Also, the increasing water demand for domestic use has
    adverse effects on agricultural development, as the knowledge of local farmers
    on optimal water use is limited and common irrigation methods for most of the
    crops planting, especially sugar beet, are wild flooding, border, basin, and especially
    furrow irrigation methods with very low water efficiency and high water demand.
    Across the province, local farmers have faced several challenges during planting.
    Under such irrigation conditions, sugar beet is regarded as a high water-consuming
    crop, hindering its development in areas with limited water resource availability.
    Sugar beet is insensitive to water stress (Salter and Goode 1967) and tolerates
    moderate soil water stress (Hills et al. 1990). Sugar beet is adapted to a wide
    range of climatic conditions and soil salinity (Katerji et al. 1997). On the other
    hand, controlled deficit irrigation pattern has been shown as an efficient tool
    for further research (Hang and Miller 1986; English and Raja 1996; Pidgeon et
    al. 2001; Tognetti et al. 2003; Shrestha et al. 2010). Until today, much research
    on the effects of deficit irrigation water on quantity and quality of sugar beet
    have been performed in during the last few years by different researchers (Winter
    1980; Amaducci et al. 1989; Bazza and Tayaa 1999; Rahimian and Asadi 2000; Jahadakbar
    et al. 2003; Mahmoodi et al. 2008; Hoffmann et al. 2009; Hassanli et al. 2010).
    Additionally, much research needs to be conducted on sugar beet producing regions
    where sugar beet grows with a shortage of water resources during the growing period.
    Water requirements of sugar beet have not been studied yet for different pressurized
    irrigation systems that have been highly supported financially (US$2,000 per ha)
    by Regional Governmental Agriculture Organization in different parts of the Kermanshah
    province. Therefore, the main objectives of the present study can be summarized
    as: 1. To find and compare the sugar beet seasonal water requirement by different
    irrigation methods, including different surface drip tape treatments, conventional
    furrow irrigation method zwith and without soil, water, root monitoring, and CROPWAT
    modeling. 2. To introduce and propose a simple and suitable pressurized irrigation
    system with higher efficiency and different irrigation strategy instead of conventional
    furrow irrigation method with and without soil, water, and root monitoring. 3.
    To evaluate the effects of different irrigation water deficit strategy on root,
    sugar yield, irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE), and others sugar beet parameters.
    4. To determine the pan ( k p ) coefficient in semiarid regions for easy, quick,
    convenient, and practical estimation of actual evapotranspiration (ET) of sugar
    beet from class A evaporation pan in the investigated region with semiarid climate.
    Materials and Methods Field experiment was performed at the Irrigation and Water
    Resource Engineering Research Field Station at 47°9′N, 34°21′E, and elevation
    of 1,319 m at the College of Agriculture of Razi University in Kermanshah in western
    Iran over two years of crop growing season, from March to September 2006 and 2007.
    The experiments were aimed at investigating the different levels of irrigation
    water requirements of (25, 50, 75, and 100%) ET with surface drip tape (SDT) and
    conventional furrow irrigation method (100% ET), with and without soil, water,
    root monitoring, and CROPWAT modeling. Treatment field trials were arranged in
    randomized complete blocks design with three replicates (Fig. 1). The field climate
    was semiarid. The texture of different experimental field soil depths were Silty
    Clay, consisting of different clay, silt and sand percentage. Different chemical
    and physical properties of the experimental field soil depths consisting of the
    average EC, θ ( fc ) , θ ( pwp ) , pH, and bulk density are shown in Table 1.
    The values of θ ( fc ) , θ ( pwp ) , and bulk density of each soil depth was determined
    by pressure plate and sampling method separately. Irrigation water quality was
    C 2 S 1 based on Wilcox diagram. The chemical compositions of the irrigation water
    used in the study are given in Table 2. Fig. 1. Layout of surface drip tape and

    to15 m of the field areas were divided into three similar, equal subplots to apply
    different drip tape and conventional furrow irrigation treatments as shown in
    Fig. 1. Tape tubing with discharge 1.65 L / h , internal diameter of 16.5 mm,
    and emitters spacing at 30 cm, were used for different drip tape irrigation treatments.
    For the purpose of this study, sugar beet (cv. Rasool) was used as crop material.
    The sugar beet seeds were planted on March 12, 2006 and 2007. The planting seed
    density was 83,500 plants per ha in a continuously weed, insect, and disease-controlled
    environment. Different treatments were separated by and 2.5 m distance and a plot
    was foreseen in between treatments to minimize water movement among different
    treatments. Each experimental plot was designed as 15 m × 3 m (five rows per plot),
    and had a total area of 45 m 2 at sowing. The plants were grown 60 cm apart spaced
    20 cm each in rows. Additionally, for comparison of different drip tape irrigation
    treatments with the conventional furrow irrigation systems which used by local
    farmers in the region at the present time, two conventional furrow irrigation
    systems one with and the other without soil, water, root monitoring, were designed
    with a length of 15 m and row and plant spacing of 60 and 20 cm with irrigation
    interval 8 days, trapezoidal in shape, depth 25 cm, and slope of 0.20% during
    the whole growing season with the same as the local farmers irrigation scheduling
    in three replicates. The total concentration of fertilizer of N, P 2 O 5 , and
    K 2 O were 250, 50 and 50 kg / ha , respectively on the basis of soil lab advice.
    Half of N was applied preplanting, whereas the remainder was applied when 4 or
    5 leaves were observed on each plant. During the two experimental years, crop
    actual evapotranspiration under different irrigation treatments were determined
    using soil water balance equation as follows: ETa = ( R + IRD ) ± DS - Dp - Ro
    (1) in which ETa = actual evapotranspiration; R = rainfall; IRD = amount of irrigation
    deficit; DS = changes in soil water storage in the given period; Dp = deep percolation;
    and Ro = run-off. All parameters in Eq. (1) are in millimeters. Ro and deep percolation
    were zero because of drip tape and deficit irrigation treatments. For different
    drip tape experimental treatments, irrigation water was applied at the rates of
    100% ET (full irrigation), 75, 50, and 25% ET at the same day and time, and for
    furrow irrigation treatments, the amount of required irrigation water was applied
    at the rate of 100% ET. For each irrigation time, the net irrigation depth and
    also the irrigation volume of water was determined by using the following equations:
    ND = ( θ fc - θ w ) R × As (2) IRD = ( dn / n ) ( n + 1 ) (3) IRV = ( Dir / Ea
    ) A (4) in which ND = net depth of water required in the root zone (mm); θ fc
    and θ w = soil water contents at field capacity and at measuring time in (%),
    respectively; R = root depth (mm); As = bulk density ( g / cm 3 ); IRD = net irrigation
    water requirement at the irrigation time (mm); dn = net water required for providing
    the soil water deficit to field capacity condition in the root zone (mm); n =
    number of different days between the final and soil water measuring irrigation
    day; IRV = volume of irrigation water (L); Dir = net water requirement at the
    beginning of irrigation period (mm) or one day after soil water measurement (mm);
    and Ea = application efficiency. For the average Ea determination in different
    surface drip tape and furrow surface irrigation treatments, further experiments
    were carried out and Ea were determined by using the following equation: E a =
    V c + V s V r (5) in which Ea = application efficiency; Vs ( m 3 ) and Vc ( m
    3 ) = volume of water storage and the volume of water used in root zone, respectively;
    and Vr ( m 3 ) = volume of gross water applied between two irrigation intervals
    for drip tape irrigation method. The volume of water used in the root zone was
    determined by using of the relation below: V c = ( K c × E pan × K p ) × A (6)
    in which V c = volume of water used in root zone; and K c , E pan , and K p are
    crop coefficients, evaporation from Class A pan and pan coefficients. The values
    of K c and K p were selected from Allen et al. (1998) and Alizadeh (2002), respectively.
    The volume of water storage ( m 3 ) was determined by using the relation below:
    V s = D S × A (7) in which Vs = volume of water storage D S = ( P 2 - P 1 ) ×
    As × D / 100 (8) D s = equivalent depth of irrigation water storage in each soil
    layer in the root zone (m); P2-P1 is difference percentage of soil moisture in
    each soil layer before and after of each irrigation; As = each soil layer bulk
    density ( kg / m 3 ); D = different soil layer depths ( m ); and A = area under
    drip tape irrigation ( m 2 ). V r ( m 3 ) = volume of gross irrigation water applied
    between two irrigation intervals, which is measured by flow meter. The average
    Ea for surface furrow irrigation treatments was determined by using following
    equation: E a = V n Q × T c o (9) in which Ea = application efficiency; V n (
    m 3 ) = net irrigation water used between two irrigation periods; Q = discharge
    entrance to furrow in ( m 3 / min ), which is measured by flume; and T c o = final
    irrigation period in min. V n ( m 3 ) was determined from this formula: V n =
    Z req × A (10) Z req = ( θ fc - θ w ) R × As (11) in which Z req , θ fc , and
    θ w are net depth of water required in the root zone (m), the soil water contents
    at field capacity, and at measuring time in (%), respectively; R = root depth
    (m); As = bulk density of each layer ( kg / m 3 ); and A = area under furrow irrigation
    ( m 2 ). The average Ea for different tape and furrow irrigation treatments was
    determined as 90% and 80% separately (data not shown). For soil water content
    measurement, the soil samples for each treatment were taken from three replicate
    plots at depth intervals of 30 cm during each second irrigation. The samples from
    depths 0–30, 30–60 and 60–90 cm were taken from middle of tape laterals, and sugar
    beet rows. For each treatment from each 30 cm root depth, only one replicate was
    taken. The number of the samples for each treatment was different on the basis
    of the root depth growth. All samples were immediately weighed and oven-dried
    at 105°C during 24 h, then the soil moisture content ( θ w ) was measured for
    each treatment by using the gravimetric method. For sugar beet root depth determination,
    the profile wall method was used. For this reason, for each replication in each
    treatment, a profile with depth of 1 m and 30 cm away from the plant rows was
    dug. During each measurement at least three plants from each profile were selected
    for root depth measurement by metal ruler. Finally, for different drip tape and
    furrow irrigation treatments, every three and eight days, the volume of irrigation
    water was measured and applied by flow meters installed in the delivering pipes,
    1 L on the basis of Eq. (4). Irrigation water use efficiency on the basis of root
    and sugar yield was calculated as root and sugar yield as follows: IWUE = Y a
    I a (12) in which IWUE = irrigation water use efficiency ( kg / m 3 ); Y a = root
    or sugar yield ( kg / ha ); and Ia is the actual irrigation water applied in mm.
    All daily ET pan data were collected and ETo was calculated by using all daily
    meteorological data obtained from Synoptic Kermanshah meteorological station,
    which is located 1 km from the experimental station, and with the Cropwat Windows
    (Version 8) program (Allen et al. 2009). This program uses the FAO Penman—Monteith
    equation to calculate ETo. Crop water requirements were estimated by using the
    CROPWAT modeling (Penman–Monteith method), and were on the basis of 55 years of
    historical data from Synoptic Kermanshah meteorological station. Long time series
    were chosen for study because the long-period data show the usual climate of a
    region better than short-period data. The amount of rainfall was recorded during
    the two year experimental periods. Average long-term historical climate, soil,
    and crop data for the study area were input to the CROPWAT modeling. Crop data
    included crop type, sowing and harvesting dates, and four distinct growth stages
    for semiarid regions (Allen et al. 1998). However, at the investigation region,
    the length of the growing season was 190 days (not 205 days). Therefore, the modification
    on the basis of different parameters such as the percentage of canopy ground cover,
    and local experience, was applied for different sugar beet growth stages, including
    initial, development, mid- and late-periods 55, 50, 45, and 40 days, respectively.
    The pan coefficient ( k p ) was estimated with the following equation: K p = E
    T o E T pan (13) Adequate plants were hand-harvested randomly from each plot selecting
    five rows of 10 m in each year for yield components. Sugar yields, percentage
    of sugar content, and all other parameters were determined in the laboratory of
    Islamabad sugar beet factory (55 km distance from experimental station). The data
    were analyzed in terms of variance (ANOVA) by using statistical analysis system
    followed by Duncan’s multiple range tests, and terms were considered significant
    at P < 0.05 and 0.01 by MSTAT-C software. Results and Discussion Irrigation Water
    Use After crop establishment and during the crop growing period, the total irrigation
    water use for different treatments of surface drip tape method consisted of T1
    (100% ET), T2 (75% ET), T3 (50% ET), T4 (25% ET), and for conventional furrow
    irrigation treatment (100% ET), with soil, water, and root monitoring; total rainfall
    for both experimental years of 2006 and 2007, and estimated water requirement
    by CROPWAT modeling are presented in Table 3. As Table 3 shows, for the SDT control
    treatment T1 (100% ET), the total gross irrigation water uses were 9,666.5 and
    9 , 969.3 m 3 / ha for 2006 and 2007. The lowest irrigation water uses for 2006
    and 2007 were 2,416.6 and 2 , 492.3 m 3 / ha for treatments T4 (25% ET). For conventional
    irrigation treatments with monitoring, the total gross irrigation water uses were
    11,042 and 11 , 696 m 3 / ha for 2006 and 2007. The irrigation water requirement
    by using CROPWAT modeling were 12 , 410 m 3 / ha for both two experimental years
    2006 and 2007. Table 3. Comparison of Quantitative and Qualitative Parameters

    within the same column and factors, followed by the same letter using Duncan’s
    multiple range test are not significantly different ( P < 0.01 ). As shown in
    Table 3, the average less irrigation water use or water saving for different drip
    tape treatments T1 (100% ET), T2 (75% ET), T3 (50% ET), and T4 (25% ET) compared
    to conventional furrow irrigation treatment with soil, water, and root monitoring
    for both experimental years 2006 and 2007 were 13.7, 35.2, 56.8, and 78.4%, respectively.
    The comparison of results in Table 3 also shows that the average less irrigation
    water used or water saving for different drip tape treatments T1 (100%ET), T2
    (75%ET), T3 (50%ET), T4 (25%ET), and conventional furrow irrigation compared to
    CROPWAT modeling using the 55 year historical climatologically data were 28.8,
    46.6, 64.5, 82.2 and 26.7%. For the conventional furrow irrigation method without
    soil, water, and root monitoring, the average amount of total applied water for
    both experimental years 2006 and 2007 was 15 , 950 m 3 / ha , which is almost
    6 , 132.1 m 3 (38.4%), 8 , 586.6 m 3 (53.8%), 11 , 041.10 m 3 (69.2%), 13 , 495.6
    m 3 (84.6%), and 4 , 581 m 3 (28.70%) more than total irrigation water applied
    for different drip tape treatments T1 (100%ET), T2 (75%ET), T3 (50%ET), T4 (25%ET)
    and conventional furrow irrigation with monitoring. The results of total irrigation
    water applied by different irrigation methods show that there are big differences
    between sugar beet water consumption (conventional method) by local farmers without
    enough knowledge compared to different surface drip tape treatments and surface
    irrigation method with soil, water, and root depth monitoring. Moreover, in the
    point view of limited water resources available in semiarid area, the results
    show the benefits of seasonal irrigation application by using simple pressurized
    method such as drip tape and local conventional furrow irrigation with soil, water,
    and root monitoring compared to custom and conventional sugar beet irrigation
    with eight days interval by the local farmers and CROPWAT modeling, as shown by
    comparison in Fig. 2. Fig. 2. Average percent of water saving for different irrigation
    methods and strategies compared to CROPWAT modeling and conventional furrow irrigation
    with and without monitoring Root and Sugar Yield and Water Use Efficiency The
    results of total sugar beet root and sugar yield and irrigation water use efficiencies
    on the basis of root and sugar yield for all treatments and their Duncan test
    classes for two experimental years 2006 and 2007 are given in Table 3. The results
    show maximum root yields with 120.73 and 108.90 t / ha , and minimum root yields
    with 40.40 and 38.90 t / ha , were achieved under different treatments, conventional
    furrow irrigation with monitoring (100% ET) and drip tape treatment T4 (25% ET)
    for 2006 and 2007. The average sugar beet yield in Iran reported by Food and Agriculture
    Organization (FAO) (2002) as 29 t / ha . Therefore, the results show that in all
    experimental treatments, the yield of sugar beet was much higher than yields reported
    by FAO. The maximum sugar yields of 15.71 and 15.39 t / ha and minimum sugar yields
    of 9.58 and 9.14 t / ha were achieved under different drip tape treatments, T1
    (100% ET) and T4 (25% ET), for 2006 and 2007 respectively. The total results of
    root yield, root irrigation water use efficiency, sugar yield, and sugar irrigation
    water use efficiency for experimental years 2006 and 2007 are presented in Table
    3. The results show that the effects of different irrigation treatments on irrigation
    water use efficiency on the basis of root and sugar yield were significant ( P
    < 0.01 ) for both experimental years, taking into account their Duncan test classes.
    The highest average root irrigation water use efficiency with 16.72 and 15.61
    kg / m 3 , and the lowest with 10.93 and 7.05 kg / m 3 , were obtained under different
    treatments (T4 25% ET; and CFI 100% ET) for the years 2006 and 2007, respectively.
    The investigation showed that the primary reasons for strong root yield reduction
    during the second year (2007) probably could be attributed to higher average temperature
    (increase of 0.81°C) and 44 days of dusty air condition during the growing period,
    which resulted in lower sugar beet photosynthesis and yield compared to experimental
    year 2006. The highest and lowest average sugar irrigation water use efficiency
    with, 3.97 and 1.38 kg / m 3 for year 2006 and 3.67 and 1.27 kg / m 3 for year
    2007 were found for drip tape treatment T4 (25% ET) and CFI. A comparison of results
    showed a higher yield for both root and sugar water use efficiency for different
    drip tape irrigation treatments compared to conventional furrow surface irrigation,
    probably attributable to better and higher uniform water and nutrient distribution.
    Fig. 3 shows the average root and sugar irrigation water use efficiency for different
    irrigation methods and strategies. The average root and sugar beet irrigation
    water use efficiencies for different surface drip tape irrigation methods are
    higher than conventional furrow irrigation with monitoring. The sequence for average
    root irrigation water use efficiency was 16.17 kg / m 3 > 13.60 kg / m 3 > 11.85
    > kg / m 3 > 10.74 kg / m 3 > 9 kg / m 3 for different surface drip tape treatments
    T4 (25% ET), T3 (50% ET), T2 (75% ET), T1 (100% ET), and conventional furrow irrigation
    with monitoring. The sequence for average sugar irrigation water use efficiency
    was 3.82 kg / m 3 > 2.40 kg / m 3 > 1.87 > kg / m 3 > 1.59 kg / m 3 > 1.33 kg
    / m 3 for different surface drip tape treatments T4 (25% ET), T3 (50% ET), T2
    (75% ET), T1 (100% ET), and conventional furrow irrigation with monitoring, respectively.
    Fig. 3. Average root and sugar irrigation water use efficiency for different irrigation
    methods and strategies Panahei et al. (2006) conducted three years of lysimetric
    investigation and found an average annual sugar beet water requirement 10 , 660
    m 3 / ha . They reported that the total average root, sugar yield, and sugar percentage
    was 49.9, 6.37 t / ha , and 15.10%. They obtained a water use efficiency 5.01
    and 0.49 kg / m 3 for root and sugar yield. Hosainpoor et al. (2006) reported
    significant differences between different drip and surface sugar beet irrigation
    performances. They found the greatest root and sugar yield 83.05 and 9.34 t /
    ha for furrow surface irrigation (100%) and 71.16 and 8.73 t / ha for drip irrigation
    (50%). They found the lowest water use efficiency of 6.14 and 0.69 kg / m 3 on
    the basis of root and sugar for furrow, and highest water use efficiency of 18.3
    and 2.29 kg / m 3 on the basis of root and sugar for drip irrigation 50%. They
    reported total amounts of water uses of 3,923.5, 4,927.50, 6,068.50, and 13 ,
    528 m 3 / ha for 50, 75, 100% drip, and 100% furrow irrigation, respectively.
    Mirzaei and Firozabadi (2007) reported the lowest and highest water use efficiencies
    of 0.6 and 1.19 kg / m 3 for sugar beet plantation for drip (50%) and furrow (100%)
    irrigation systems. They found a total amount of water use equal to 5,679, 7,301,
    8,932, and 14 , 886 m 3 / ha for 50, 75, 100% drip irrigation, and 100% furrow
    irrigation, respectively. Shahabifar and Rahimian (2008) investigated three year
    lysimetric records of sugar beet performance. They reported that the total amount
    of sugar beet water use was 12 , 210 m 3 / ha whereas total sugar beet yield was
    56.50 t / ha with sugar percentage of 17.8%, and total water use efficiency 4.627
    and 0.823 kg / m 3 on the basis of root and sugar beet yield. Hassanli et al.
    (2010) reported that the highest root yield 79.7 t / ha was obtained by using
    surface drip irrigation, whereas the lowest root yield 41.4 t / ha was obtained
    by using furrow irrigation and fresh water. The highest irrigation water use efficiency
    in root yield production 9 kg / m 3 was obtained by using surface drip irrigation
    with effluence, whereas the lowest value 3.8 kg / m 3 by using furrow irrigation
    with fresh water. The highest IWUE of 1.26 kg / m 3 for sugar was obtained by
    using surface drip irrigation. Winter (1980) reported a high sugar root yield
    of 76.6 t / ha with total water use 10 , 100 m 3 / ha . Hills et al. (1990) found
    a water requirement of 11 , 850 m 3 / ha for sugar beet. Fabeiro et al. (2003)
    reported a significant difference of sugar beet water use efficiencies under different
    drip irrigation systems. Tognetti et al. (2003) reported that yield responses
    of sugar beets to drip irrigation with 75% of estimated ET matched in most cases
    those of low-pressure sprinkler irrigated with 100% of estimated ET, resulting
    in a potential 25% of water volume saving. The results obtained by this research
    and other similar studies have shown that root, sugar, and total water use efficiency
    vary on the basis of root and sugar yields owing to different reasons, including
    different irrigation water supply methods, soil type, climatological conditions,
    and different sugar beet water deficit resistance variety use. The results of
    this research showed that irrigation water consumption by sugar beet under different
    drip tape systems were lower, and water use efficiency was higher compared to
    the preceding results and results obtained by Winter (1989), Amaducci et al. (1989),
    Bazza and Tayaa (1999), Rahimian and Asadi (2000), Jahadakbar et al. (2003), Mohammadian
    et al. (2008) and Hoffmann et al. (2009). The lower water use and higher root
    and sugar yield obtained in this research can be attributed to higher drip tape
    irrigation efficiency, uniform water, and nutrient distribution in sugar beet
    root zone. The results of this study showed that sugar beet is well adapted to
    drip tape irrigation method. Therefore, farmers may consider using this system
    that is supported financially (US$2,000 per ha) by Regional Governmental Agriculture
    Organization for sugar beet production, to increase their yield and irrigation
    water use efficiency and renew their fields irrigation systems. Comparison of
    Different Sugar Beet Quality Parameters All measured sugar beet quality parameters
    under different irrigation treatments for two experimental years are shown in
    Table 4. The results show that by increasing water deficit, the sugar percentage
    increased. The lowest and highest sugar percentage, 12.62 and 23.73%) for 2006,
    and 13.68 and 23.53% for 2007, were achieved under different treatments drip tape
    T4 (25% ET) and conventional furrow irrigation. The results showed that the effects
    of different irrigation treatments on sugar percentage were significant ( P <
    0.01 ), and 75% of water deficit under different drip tape irrigation methods
    caused an increase of 8.93% of sugar percentage for both experimental years. Significant
    differences were found for sugar percentage between all treatments in 2006 and
    2007. Our results were different from results reported by Noorjo and Baghaekia
    (2004). They reported that 16.50% of water deficit caused a 13.3% increase of
    sugar percentage. Table 4. Comparison of Quantitative and Qualitative Parameters

    within the same column and factors, followed by the same letter using Duncan’s
    multiple range test, are not significantly different ( P < 0.01 ). Water deficit
    had a negative affect on the molasses sugar percentage. No significant difference
    was found between molasses sugar content for different treatments in 2006 and
    2007. No significant difference was found for the quantity of Na, K, N, and (
    N + K ) / Na of root for 2006 and 2007. As revealed by the results of this study,
    water deficit had a negative affect on the quantity of Na and the ratio of ( N
    + K ) / Na , whereas it has a positive affect on the quantity of K and N for 2006
    and 2007. Water deficit also had a negative affect on root alkalinity. The highest
    and lowest root alkalinity levels were obtained for different drip tape treatments
    T1 (100% ET) and T4 (25% ET), with 2.64 and 1.37 for 2006, and 2.46 and 1.17 for
    2007. Water deficit had a negative and significant ( p < 0.01 ) affect on the
    root length. The lowest and highest sugar beet root lengths were achieved for
    drip tape treatment T4 (25% ET) and conventional furrow irrigation with monitoring,
    with 25.4 and 50.40 cm for 2006, and 29 and 44.66 cm for 2007. The results of
    this research showed that the affect of water stress on sugar percentage and other
    different sugar beet quality parameters were similar to those reported previously
    (Carter 1986; Winter 1989; Rahimian and Asadi 2000; Fabeiro et al. 2003; Jahadakbar
    et al. 2003; Noorjoo and Baghaiikia 2004; Hossainpoor et al. 2006; Mohmoodi et
    al. 2008; Hoffmann et al. 2009). Pan Coefficients The seasonal k p value for this
    study was 0.80 as shown in Fig. 4, with the relationship equation y = 0.80 x and
    R 2 = 0.88 . The relationship for these values was statistically significant (
    p < 0.01 ). The k p value of 0.80 obtained in this study is different from the
    proposed range of values (0.35 and 0.85) reported in FAO 56 by Allen et al. (1998),
    and close to 0.79 as reported by Panahei et al. (2006). According to the results,
    the value of 0.80 for class A pan evaporation can be an acceptable and practical
    value for the actual evapotranspiration of sugar beet under semiarid climate condition.
    Fig. 4. The relationship between seasonal evapotranspiration (pan, measured; o,
    calculated) Conclusions As a result of a two-year field study on sugar beet in
    a semiarid region, sugar beet is well suited to drip tape irrigation methods compared
    to conventional furrow irrigation method for water saving and root and sugar water
    use efficiencies. Therefore, farmers may consider using these methods that are
    supported financially (US$2,000 per ha) by Regional Governmental Agriculture Organization
    for sugar beet production, to increase their irrigation efficiency and their yield
    instead of conventional furrow irrigation. It was concluded that drip tape irrigation
    method with different water supply treatments is a simple and suitable method
    to propose for sugar beet production by local farmers in semiarid regions with
    limited available water resources. The results emphasize that treatment T1 (100%
    ET) (full irrigated) with 38.4% of water saving compared to conventional furrow
    irrigation without monitoring method can be proposed for sugar beet grown in semiarid
    regions with sufficient water resources available. Moreover, treatment T2 (75%
    ET) surface drip tape with 53.8% water saving, compared to conventional furrow
    irrigation method without monitoring and higher root and sugar water use efficiency,
    compared to T1 (100% ET) can be proposed in area with partially limited water
    resources, because sugar beet can tolerate moderate soil water stress in areas.
    The results also showed that in the areas with moderately severe water resources
    restrictions, the reasonable treatment T3 (50% ET) with 69.2% water saving might
    be feasible. By using of those described irrigation methods and strategies, conventional
    low water efficiency irrigation method can be renewed and more irrigation water
    can be saved. This also leads to an increase of more land under sugar beet cultivation,
    job creation, and local farmers revenues. This study showed that by using drip
    tape irrigation method with different treatments (100% ET), (75% ET), (50% ET),
    and (25% ET) instead of conventional furrow irrigation method with and without
    soil, water, and root monitoring, (28.8, 46.6, 64.5, 82.2%) and (38.4, 53.8, 69.2,
    84.6%) of sugar beet seasonal irrigation water requirement can be saved, respectively.
    The results also showed that sugar beet average annual water requirement under
    conventional furrow irrigation method with soil, water, and root monitoring was
    almost 8.40% and 28.70% lower compared to CROPWAT modeling and conventional furrow
    irrigation without monitoring, which shows the benefits of soil, water, and root
    monitoring for water saving. The pan coefficients (kp) were determined to be 0.80
    in the semiarid investigated region. According to the results, 0.80 class A pan
    evaporation can be acceptable for quick, convenient, and practical estimation
    of actual evapotranspiration for sugar beet from class A evaporation pan under
    semiarid climate condition. Acknowledgments The writers wish to thank Razi University

    G. Evans, W. M. Iversen, Y. Kim Keywords:   Decision support, Water management,
    Automation, Adaptive control systems, Irrigation controls, Sprinkler irrigation,
    Wireless networks, Sensors The development of site-specific water management systems
    for sprinkler irrigation will be a major factor in future efforts to improve the
    various efficiencies of water-use and to support a sustainable irrigated environment.
    The challenge is to develop fully integrated management systems with supporting
    elements that accurately and inexpensively sense within-field variability and
    then optimally control variable-rate water application systems in ways that account
    for the spatial variability affecting water use. Recent advances in sensor and
    wireless radio frequency (RF) technologies have enabled the development of distributed
    in-field sensor-based irrigation systems to support site-specific irrigation management.
    Thus, integration of a decision-making process with a distributed wireless sensor
    network (WSN) and providing real-time input to site-specific controls is a viable
    option. This presentation reviews research on the implementation of in-field micrometeorological
    information that was fed from a distributed wireless sensor network (WSN) and
    displayed on a geo-referenced field map in a computer base station. Low-cost Bluetooth
    wireless RF communications from both a distributed WSN and the machine controls
    monitoring of sprinkler status and global positioning system (GPS) location were
    interfaced with a computer base station for processing by a decision support program,
    which updated the instructions to the variable rate irrigation controller for
    real-time site-specific control. The decision support was optimized to adapt changes
    of crop type, irrigation pattern, and field location for instructions for individual
    sprinkler heads on how much water to apply and where. A graphical user interface
    (GUI) with a simple click-and-play menu was used, which allowed growers to remotely
    access field conditions and irrigation status at the home or office via wireless
    RF communications. (Download PDF)    (Export to EndNotes) 14 Share Facebook X

    Warm-thermistor sensors are useful for making measurements of flow and the thermal
    properties of materials. This paper describes a log-antilog analog control circuit
    capable of monitoring a thermistor''s internal temperature in both ambient temperature
    sensing mode and self-heating mode, while maintaining infinite precision, wide
    dynamic range and fast sensor response. A single self-referencing thermistor is
    used to avoid the problems associated with having to match a thermistor pair in
    order to obtain an over-temperature signal. Instead, thermistor power levels are
    switched over a range of 1:1000, allowing measurement of both ambient temperature
    and heated thermistor temperature during the rise and fall of the heat pulse by
    a single thermistor at the center of the heat field. This provides a sensitive
    measurement of the thermal diffusivity and advective properties of the surrounding
    medium. In this paper, such a sensor is used to investigate the thermal properties
    of a grapevine cane under conditions of irrigation stress. Published in: IEEE

    Publisher: IEEE SECTION I. Introduction Climate change predictions and current
    drought conditions in many of the world''s irrigation districts have highlighted
    the need to improve the matching between water input and crop water requirements.
    Historically, evapotranspiration and soil moisture monitoring have allowed irrigators
    to apply sufficient water to maintain soil moisture levels within a range suitable
    for plant growth. Potential evaporation (\mbi{ET} _{\bf 0} ) measurements – based
    on weather station data or the Class-A evaporation pan – have provided broad estimates
    of crop water use that must be corrected for all sorts of local factors, such
    as crop canopy size, site aspect, soil properties, and so forth. Soil moisture
    monitoring sensors have provided more localized information about changes in soil
    water content or tension in a crop''s root zone. They are, however, only a surrogate
    measurement for determining how much water is transpired by the crop, as distinct
    from water lost through surface evaporation, runoff, and deep drainage. Water
    used by a crop passes from the root system to the plant canopy through vertically
    conductive “xylem” tissue that surrounds the plant stem''s inner core. Intuitively
    then, sap flow measurements should be an important irrigation scheduling tool.
    Three “thermal tracer” methods are available for the measurement of sap flow in
    plant stems and have been reviewed by Smith and Allen [13]; the stem heat balance,
    heat pulse velocity, and thermal diffusion methods. Heat pulse probes [16] and
    thermal diffusion sensors [4] “wound” the conducting plant tissue by drilling
    radially through the sap-conducting vessels in order to insert the necessary heater
    and temperature sensors. Heat-balance sap flow sensors (e.g., [1]) do not wound
    the plant, but their rigid “wraparound” casings require selection of a gauge to
    match a particular stem size. Helfter et al. [6] went beyond expensive laboratory-based
    magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques to find an alternate method of noninvasive
    measurements of sap flow. These authors – working on potted broadleaf saplings
    – used a heat-pulse technique based upon a 0.5 W 812 nm-wavelength laser to heat
    the stem surface and an IR camera as the noncontact thermometric probe. Despite
    the effort that scientists have put into the measurement of transpiration in whole
    plants, sap flow sensors have failed to become a standard tool for irrigation
    scheduling, which still relies heavily upon climate and soil moisture measurements
    rather than plant-based measurements. Loveys et al. [8] pointed out that – in
    grapevines at least – the adaptive control mechanisms that plants use to regulate
    their internal water balance mask irrigation stress by regulating transpiration
    (sap flow). The authors suggested that a far better indicator of plant water status
    is predawn leaf water potential (units: -MPa). However, this is most commonly
    measured by manual “pressure chamber” technology [17] that requires the operator
    to collect and analyze leaf samples in a sealed pressure chamber during the predawn
    hours when sap flow has ceased and the vine''s water status has equilibrated.
    Continuous nondestructive measurements of plant water status have been investigated
    by Klepper et al. [7] using LVDT dendrometers to measure stem size, which decreases
    as the vascular portions of the stem collapse under increasing internal water
    stress and declining stem tissue hydration. Peñuelas et al. [12] examined the
    reflectance from leaves in the 950–970 nm region as an indicator of plant water
    status. Gullo and Salleo [5] detected xylem cavitation and formation of embolisms
    by counting ultrasound (100–300 kHz) acoustic emissions as a continuous measure
    of plant stress. Loveys et al. [8] carried out field work on grapevines to access
    the efficacy of plant-based measurements as an indicator of irrigation requirements.
    Included in these trials were measurements of stomatal conductance (porometry),
    stem diameter, heat-pulse sap flow sensors, leaf and canopy temperatures, and
    miniature thermocouple psychrometers for the measurement of leaf water potential.

    in a one-year old grapevine cane. The SMD heater thermistor is the second from
    the bottom. The other three SMD thermistors monitor heat conduction and convection
    in the stem via the heat-pulse method. Later versions of this sensor were wrapped
    in Teflon tape to prevent electrical conduction through the watery tissue. Thermal
    contact was poor, however, and the device lacked adequate sensitivity. Show All
    None of these sensors have reached commercial irrigators in the form of affordable
    and rugged instrumentation, even though the need for such sensors is becoming
    increasingly vital in the management of dwindling water resources. This paper
    describes the use of low-cost thermistor technology as a means of learning something
    about plant water status once sap flow has ceased. Initial research centered on
    the use of surface-mounted SMD thermistor sensors for both heat-pulse sap flow
    monitoring and thermal diffusivity measurements as a surrogate for plant water
    status measurements. These PCB-mounted sensors (Fig. 1) were placed upon the green
    cane tissue of a grapevine to avoid the wound responses of insertion-type sensors
    described by Barrett et al. [2]. However, poor thermal contact resulted in inadequate
    sensitivity of these devices, although there was a positive correlation between
    the heating pulse response and plant water status. This paper describes the electronic
    control circuitry necessary to implement plant water status monitoring based upon
    a single glass-rod thermistor inserted coaxially into the central pith at the
    base of an excised lateral shoot of a grapevine (Figs. 2 and 3). This avoids the
    destruction of local sap conducting (xylem) tissue, while still allowing access
    to plant water status. A point-source constant-energy heat pulse was injected
    by the thermistor into the surrounding sap-conducting vessels and the rate of
    temperature change – dependent upon the thermal diffusivity of the woody-sap matrix
    – was studied during the onset of irrigation stress. Fig. 2. Cross section of
    a one-year old grapevine cane. The vascular system is organized into the water-conducting
    xylem tissue (pale green) on the inside around the central pith (white), and the
    phloem tissue (dark green-gray) towards the outside, which returns food and organic
    material from the canopy to the plant stem and root systems. Show All Fig. 3.
    A glass-rod thermistor (inset), operating as a constant-power single-point heat
    source, acts as a thermal diffusion sensor to measure grapevine water status.
    It is shown inserted into the central pith of a grapevine lateral that has been
    sliced off to allow access to the plant''s vascular system. The stub-end self-heals
    to reseal the xylem tissue around the butt-end of the glass-rod thermistor. Show
    All The thermistor control circuit – described herein in use as a thermal diffusion
    sensor – is of general interest to sensor engineers, as it is capable of monitoring
    sensor temperature in both ambient-sensing and self-heating mode. The use of analog
    circuitry provides the necessary precision and fast response, and this constant-power
    thermistor bridge provides generic circuitry valuable in other thermistor sensor
    applications such as very slow flow monitoring. SECTION II. Warm-Thermistor Control
    Circuits A. Limitations of Two- and Three-Thermistor Analog Bridge Control Circuits
    Thermistor temperature sensors have the advantage of rugged construction, inherently
    high resistance (simplifying measurement), and a resistance sensitivity to temperature
    an order of magnitude higher than metal temperature sensors. The hermetic glass
    encapsulation found in glass rod thermistors provides excellent sealing against
    water ingress. Historically, warm-thermistor sensors have been used by various
    authors to tackle the problem of continuous measurement of flow rates in open
    water bodies or closed pipe systems. The self-heated thermistor dissipates heat
    into the flow stream, and the control circuit adjusts the power level (the output
    signal) to maintain a set over-temperature condition with respect to the ambient
    fluid temperature. Many of these historical analog flow meter control circuit
    designs – Riedl and Machan [14], LaBarbera and Vogel [9], Briggs–Smith et al.
    [3], MacIntyre [10], and Yang et al. [18] – attempted to monitor and correct for
    ambient fluid temperature variations by inserting one or more extra thermistors
    into a bridge circuit. However, NTC (negative temperature coefficient) thermistors
    are more difficult to use than linear resistance elements (such as tungsten hot-wire
    anemometers) in a standard bridge circuit because of the thermistor''s high degree
    of nonlinearity (Fig. 4) described by the Steinhart–Hart equation [15] T(^{\circ}

    @25°C NTC thermistor measured with a 10 \mu {\rm A} excitation current. Show All
    In these early warm-thermistor analog bridge circuits, a low-resistance thermistor
    was self-heated in 1/2 of the bridge. Higher resistance (and therefore non self-heating)
    thermistors were used in the opposite half of the bridge to compensate for changes
    in ambient temperature, and to force a constant over-temperature condition \mbi{\Delta}
    \mbi{T} upon the warm thermistor. Some measure of the bridge''s power dissipation
    \mbi{P} was used to determine flow velocity \mbi{v} . These analog bridges all
    suffered from a limited operating temperature range, imposed by the necessity
    of matching two thermistors having different material curves and essentially operating
    at different temperatures and at different locations in the flow stream. These
    various bridge circuits were based on the original Riedl–Machan bridge (Fig. 5),
    which used three-thermistors in an attempt to extend the operating temperature
    range. While later designs (e.g., [10]) returned to simpler two-thermistor bridges,
    it is difficult to reduce error levels in such thermistor analog bridges to below
    0.1°C, even over a limited temperature range of approximately 30°C. A single thermistor
    sensor, on the other hand, is inherently self-referencing, and is far simpler
    to use as a point-source heater and temperature sensor over a broader temperature
    range in thermal diffusion and fluid flow applications. However, a more sophisticated
    control circuit is needed to output the thermistor''s temperature during both
    ambient and self-heating mode; such a circuit would then need a single temperature
    calibration. The ability of the circuit to monitor the rate of background temperature
    drift prior to the heated temperature measurement makes it possible to extract
    this small temperature drift error term from the change in the heated temperature
    signal over the interval during which the heat field is generated and measured.
    Fig. 5. The Reidl–Machan [14] Thermistor Bridge Flowmeter. These early flow-monitoring
    bridge circuits were always in self-heating mode, and were unable to report on
    the temperature of either the water or the heated thermistor. Instead, their output
    was proportional to power dissipated by the self-heated thermistor. Show All B.
    “Constant Power” Circuit Concepts The resistance \mbi{R} _{\mmb{T}} of a heated
    thermistor dissipating a constant amount of heat \mbi{P} into a flow stream or
    thermally conductive medium will respond simultaneously to changes in ambient
    temperature \mbi{T} _{\mmb{A}} and to changes in the surrounding fluid properties
    or velocity. So while the product of the thermistor''s voltage and current (the
    power dissipated) is fixed in a constant power heater circuit, the ratio of voltage
    to current (the resistance) is always varying, and must be continuously extracted
    to drive the feedback control loop. If the traditional reference thermistors of
    Fig. 5 are not used to correct for ambient temperature changes, one is forced
    to switch the control circuit between zero power and full power to obtain first
    the ambient and then the heated temperatures. Fig. 6 shows a typical V-I curve
    for a 1 {\rm k}\Omega @25°C thermistor having a nominal dissipation constant of
    4.1 {\rm mW}/^{\circ}{\rm C} in still water. Fig. 6. The voltage-current transfer
    function of a 1 {\rm k}\Omega @25°C NTC thermistor at a constant ambient temperature
    of 25°C. The device response is linear (constant resistance) at low-power levels
    (36.8 \mu {\rm W} ) and nonlinear at higher power dissipation levels (36.8 mW).
    Increased thermal diffusivity in solids or increased flow in liquids or gases
    increases the “dissipation constant” 4.1 to 6.1 {\rm mW} /^{\circ}{\rm C} covers
    the full flow range in water. Show All Ambient sensing thermistors operate in
    the linear “zero power” region, where negligible \mbi{I} ^{\bf 2} \mbi{R} heating
    (36.8 \mu {\rm W} ) results in negligible temperature rise, and the thermistor''s
    resistance is essentially unchanged by the measurement current flowing though
    it or by fluid movements around it. Warm thermistor flow meters operate in the
    nonlinear region of a NTC thermistor''s voltage-current transfer function. As
    operating power levels rise to 36.8 mW, \mbi{I} ^{\bf 2} \mbi{R} heating raises
    the thermistor''s internal temperature by 9°C, dropping the thermistor resistance
    from 1000 \Omega to 750 \Omega at \mbi{T} _{\mmb{amb}} =25 ^{\circ}\hbox{C} .
    Lower resistance leads to higher current flows until the thermistor reaches thermal
    equilibrium with the surrounding fluid. Too high a voltage across an NTC thermistor
    will result in thermal runaway and destruction of the device. C. Choosing a Thermistor
    The sensor thermistor shown inset in Fig. 3 is a hermetically sealed Honeywell
    120-102EAJ-Q01 mini glass probe thermistor. The thermistor has an electrical resistance
    \mbi{R} _{\mmb{T}} of 1 {\rm k}\Omega \pm 20\% at 25°C. A low-resistance thermistor
    was chosen to ensure that \mbi{V} ^{\bf 2} \mbi{/R} _{\mmb{T}} heat loss would
    be as high as practicable, given the limited drive voltage available in a 12 V
    battery-powered field measurement system. The thermistor is driven into self-heating
    mode by a voltage \mbi{V} _{\mmb{T}} chosen to maximize the voltage drop across
    the thermistor at the coldest expected operating temperature of 4°C, where the
    thermistor resistance \mbi{R} _{\mmb{T}} is as high as 2.7 {\rm k} \Omega . As
    the drive amplifier needs at least 2 V of headroom to operate, the maximum voltage
    drop across the thermistor at this temperature in a 12 V system is limited to
    about 10 V. Minimum thermistor current is then 3.68 mA, which sets the maximum
    power output \mbi{P} _{\mmb{T}} to 36.8 mW. At warmer ambient temperatures and
    lower thermistor resistances, current increases and voltage decreases but the
    power dissipated by the thermistor is held constant. D. A Log-Antilog Double-Bridge
    Circuit for Constant Power Control and Resistance Monitoring The control circuit
    of Figs. 7 and 10 measures and transmits the thermistor''s resistance, which is
    proportional to the thermistor''s temperature via (1). At the same time, the thermistor
    is driven by the control circuit''s output voltage \mbi{V} _{\mmb{T}} , which
    is forced to be equal to the square root of thermistor resistance \mbi{R} _{\mmb{T}}
    , such that power dissipated in the thermistor is proportional to \mbi{V} _{\mmb{T}}
    ^{\bf 2} \mbi{/R} _{\mmb{T}} , or the \mbi{(} \mmb{\surd} \mbi{R} _{\mmb{T}} \mbi{)}
    ^{\bf 2} \mbi{/R} _{\mmb {T}} , which is constant. Power levels can be switched
    over the range 1:1000 Fig. 7. A “double-bridge” control circuit, which forces
    constant power dissipation from a thermistor operating in either zero-heating
    or self-heating mode, while providing a separate voltage output that is proportional
    to the thermistor''s resistance in either operational mode. Sensor calibration
    allows this voltage output to be reported as a temperature. Changing the current
    flowing into the \mbi{I} _{\mmb{ref}} input by a factor of 1:\surd 1000 changes
    the power dissipated by the thermistor by a factor of 1:1000, driving the thermistor
    from ambient to self-heating mode. The circuitry implementing these basic functions
    can be found in Fig. 10. Show All The arithmetic functions of multiplication and
    division, square and square-root functions have traditionally been performed in
    analog log-antilog circuits (National Semiconductor Application Note AN222). Such
    circuits enable infinitely precise computation, wide dynamic operating range and
    fast response time, although their accuracy is limited to typically \pm 1\% ;
    these gain errors must be cancelled out in the calibration process. Use of analog
    circuits provides sufficient resolution over a wide dynamic range to compute very
    small temperature differences in the order of a few milliKelvins. in this double-bridge
    circuit (Fig. 10), three LM394 super-matched transistor pairs are used to continuously
    compute the square root of the thermistor voltage-to-current ratio (that is, the
    square-root of the thermistor resistance), while a further pair are used to compute
    the thermistor resistance. The underlying “constant power bridge” circuit equations
    are derived next. Log-antilog circuits make use of the natural logarithmic relationship
    between the collector current \mbi{I} _{\mmb{C}} of a bipolar transistor and its
    base-emitter voltage \mbi{V} _{\mmb{BE}} . This relationship can be written as

    \mmb{I} _{\mmb{S}} = reverse saturation current (≈5.30e-12 measured for LM394
    super-matched transistors). Of these terms, \mbi{k} and \mbi{q} are constants,
    such that the term \mbi{kT}\mbi{/}\mbi{q} is known as the thermal voltage of a
    semiconductor, and is cancelled out in the circuit design by the matched pairs
    of transistors on opposite sides of the bridge. Offsets created by the reverse
    saturation currents \mbi{I} _{\mmb{S}} of the transistors are also cancelled by
    pairing of the three LM394s across the input and output circuits on opposite sides
    of the double-bridge. Log circuits, in the input stage, function by adding and
    subtracting base-emitter voltages to do multiplication and division, respectively,
    and by doubling or halving base-emitter voltages to do square and square-root
    functions, respectively. Anti-log circuits, in the output stage, convert these
    voltages back to collector currents. The primary objective of this square-root
    circuit is to set up the output current \mbi{I} _{\mmb{out}} in terms of the input
    currents to satisfy the following equation \eqalignno{{I_{out}} =&\, {I_{ref}}

    is a reference current that the instrument''s microcontroller uses to switch the
    gain of the circuit between ambient and self-heating levels. Base-emitter voltages,

    used to impress these base-emitter voltages across both halves of the double-bridge
    circuit, and to convert the output current back to the single-ended “resistance
    output” voltage of Fig. 10. The performance characteristics of this analog circuit
    are detailed in Table I. Fig. 8. Sensor electronics for field use in a vineyard.

    used in the log-antilog square root and resistance calculation circuits. Reference
    current is switched and tuned using a 12-bit DAC in the microcontroller that is
    shown in the digital circuitry on the right-hand side. A second DAC is used in
    conjunction with an instrumentation amplifier to make high-resolution differential
    temperature measurements. The instrument uses stored calibration constants to
    compute all output variables locally. Instruments are connected in parallel along
    a three-wire cable providing power to all sensors and data exchange to a data
    logger via the SDI-12 digital bus. As many as 36 grapevines can be monitored along
    a 30 m cable. Show All Fig. 9. Traces of normalized temperature versus time for
    the thermistor heater buried in the stem pith; as the vascular system collapses
    under water stress conditions, the wood-to-water ratio increases and the constant
    heat output of the thermistor heater causes an increasing temperature rise over
    a fixed period. Show All E. Temperature Measurement and Control The control loop
    described thus far regulates the heat output of the thermistor at a level dependent
    upon the value of the reference current \mbi{I} _{\mmb{ref}} . The sensor''s microcontroller
    can switch the power level between “zero-power” and “heating-power” by simply
    changing the applied reference current \mbi{I} _{\mmb{ref}} to the reference circuit
    over a range of 1:\surd 1000 . This changes the power dissipated in the thermistor
    from 36.8 \mu {\rm W} to 36.8 mW. To measure the ambient and heated temperatures
    of the thermistor one needs a current proportional to the resistance of the thermistor,
    no matter at which power level the sensor is operating. Such a circuit has already
    been described by (10), except that one less transistor pair is required, deleting
    the divide-by-two function that creates the square root-of-resistance function

    circuit for maintaining constant heat output from a thermistor, RT1. The circuit
    reports the thermistor resistance as a voltage at the “Resistance Output.” Power
    levels are switched over a dynamic range of 1:1000, being either the low-power
    (ambient temperature) mode or the high-power (self-heating) mode, as determined
    by the Low-High Power Switch position. Super-matched transistor pair Q1A-Q1B convert
    the thermistor voltage and current signals into logarithmic signals V _{BEV} and
    V _{BEI} via op-amps U1B and U1A, respectively. These two signals feed parallel
    bridge circuits; one (Q2 and Q3 pairs) are in the feedback loop of the square-root-of-resistance
    circuit driving the thermistor excitation voltage, and the other (Q4) is in the
    open-loop Resistance Output circuit. Loop gain is set by R11 such that 10 V is
    applied across the thermistor resistance of 2700 \Omega at 4°C in high-power mode.
    This is set, in turn, by the reference current I _{\rm ref} selected by the Low-High
    Power Switch through 1:\surd 1000 reference resistors, to give a power shift of
    1:1000. The gain of the Resistance Output circuit is dependent upon both R15 in
    the output current-to-voltage converter circuit, and the internal loop gain set
    by the reference current derived from the +2.500 V reference voltage applied across
    the ground-referred resistor R12. The Current Sense circuit formed by U1C and
    U1D forces the bottom end of the thermistor to a virtual earth, while sinking
    current through the precision 100 \Omega current resistor R1. The voltage drop
    across R1 is inverted to become a positive voltage that drives the current-log
    circuit through R4. Diodes D1 and D2 prevent circuit lockup caused by an attempt
    to take the square root of a negative number. Op-amps U2B and U2C servo the bottom
    point of each bridge to force input logarithmic base-emitter voltage combinations

    A. Experimental Procedure Laboratory “cut-stem” tests were undertaken on a 2-meter
    long five-month old cane having a 10-mm cross-sectional diameter. The cane was
    cut from a well-irrigated 15-year-old black-sultana grapevine (Vitis vinifera).
    The aim of this laboratory work was to ascertain whether or not field trails of
    a thermal “plant water status sensor” were merited. Rather than report here on
    comparative measurements between this sensor and a pressure chamber, the sensor
    response is tracked qualitatively against the decline of the cut-stem over a 24-h
    period. The cane was harvested at 3.30 am under still conditions. It was then
    stored in a sealed polythene bag with the cut-end immersed in a small flask of
    pure water, transported to the laboratory and set up out of direct sunlight and
    draught. Six hours later, the glass rod thermistor was inserted into the freshly
    cut lateral shown in Fig. 3. Initial measurements were undertaken a further 6-h
    later at 3:30 pm on Day 1, at intervals of 15 min. The cane was allowed to stabilize
    for a further 17 h overnight, while the cut xylem vessels healed around the glass
    rod thermistor. Further readings commenced at 10:30 am the following morning at
    15-min intervals, with the cane fully irrigated from the water in the storage
    flask. Water was emptied from the storage flask at 11:30 am on Day 2, and readings
    continued until 5:15 pm that evening. B. Results Thirty-four sets of 1024 readings
    were made in all over a period of 24 hours. The resultant data was divided into
    “heating curves” and “cooling curves” and data-of-best fit determined using nonlinear
    regression routines. Data close to the switching points were discarded, as the
    high residual temperature gradients at these times gave poor fits. Cooling curves
    were fitted with the algorithm T(^{\circ} {\rm C}) = {a_{C}}.{e^{(- t/{b_{C}})}}
    + {c_{C}} \eqno{\hbox{(13)}} View Source where \mbi{a} _{\mmb{C}} is a dimensionless
    gain coefficient, \mbi{b} _{\mmb{C}} is the “time-constant” of interest, and the
    \mbi{c} _{\mmb{C}} is the “background temperature.” Time \mbi{t} was based upon
    the sampling rate and the measurement number of the K2000 voltmeter. Analysis
    was performed on data between 10 and 30 s after the heat pulse was switched off.
    The proportion of variance explained (\mbi{r} ^{\bf 2} ) was better than 99.90%
    for all 34 sets of data. However, the temperature variation over this 10 s of
    measurement was typically only 0.4°C due to the rapid decay in the temperature
    reading. Heating curves were fitted with the algorithm T(^{\circ} {\rm C}) = {a_{H}}.\ln
    (t) + {b_{H}}.\ln {(t)^{2}} + {c_{H}} \eqno{\hbox{(14)}} View Source where \mbi{a}
    _{\mmb{H}} and \mbi{b} _{\mmb{H}} are dimensionless gain coefficients and \mbi{c}
    _{\mmb{H}} is the “background temperature.” Data analysis was performed on data
    between 1 and 21 s after the heat pulse was switched on. The proportion of variance
    explained (\mmb{r} ^{\bf 2} ) was better than 99.96% for all 34 sets of data.
    For both heating and cooling data, readings were first normalized by subtracting
    the background temperature “\mbi{c} _{\mbi{x}} ” and regenerating the normalized
    curves (e.g., the heating curves of Fig. 9), based upon the remaining coefficients
    and terms of the equation. An integral of the sensor temperature rise or fall
    was derived from these normalized curves by simply averaging the temperature over
    the time intervals of 20 and 10 s, respectively. The vine cane stayed well hydrated
    over the 32-h period between its removal from the vine and the removal of the
    water storage flask at 11:30 am on the second day, after which point wilting was
    rapid and irreversible. There was only a poor correlation between time constants
    using the cooling curve data, while there was a much stronger result from the
    longer time constants in the heating curves. The processed data from the heating
    curve data set [Fig. 11(a)] shows that the vine cane was slowly losing moisture
    throughout the 18-h overnight period. Once the water flask was removed, the change
    was more rapid, leading to the death of the vine cane by wilting/water stress,
    as evidenced by the accompanying photographs in Fig. 11(b). The average temperature
    rise was used as the sensor signal over the heating period of 20 s. SECTION IV.
    Discussions and Conclusion Loss of leaf turgor is a consequence of vascular collapse
    within the vine cane as moisture is lost through the stomata on the underside
    of the leaves and through the stem. Photographs of a small cluster of new leaves
    on the cane above the sampling point were taken at various intervals to record
    this change in leaf turgor [Fig. 11(b)]. These photographs show the irreversible
    wilting and death of the cane as the internal water balance declined. A log-antilog
    analog double-bridge has been presented as the basis for experiments using a single
    self-heated thermistor sensor for measuring the thermal properties of materials
    in a variety of applications. The high-precision output of the instrument represents
    the internal temperature of the thermistor in either ambient-sensing or constant
    heat output mode. Thermal diffusion measurements using a constant-power “temperature
    rise” measurement largely remove the common-mode background temperature value
    from the result. Fig. 11. (a) Changes in the plant water status of a grapevine
    cane, as recorded by the thermal diffusion sensor of Figs. 3 and 10. As the cane
    tissue loses moisture, the wood-to-water ratio increases, and so the constant
    energy heat pulse creates an increasingly warmer integral temperature rise at
    the sensor tip. (b) A qualitative record of increasing plant water stress can
    be seen in this gallery of photos of a small cluster of leaves on the grapevine
    cane above the cut. The first two photos (left, top), taken 18 h apart, show only
    a small decline in leaf turgor overnight, as the cane was kept well hydrated in
    a beaker of water during this period. The remaining photos, in chronological sequence
    (left-to-right, top-to-bottom), show the collapse of leaf and stem turgor once
    the vine cane was removed from its water supply, and as it loses moisture through
    transpiration. Show All However, background ambient temperature changes during
    the actual measurement are a source of error. The double-bridge circuit (unlike
    earlier bridge circuits) can be switched over a power dissipation range of 1:1000.
    Prior measurements of background “thermal drift rate” are, therefore, possible
    using the very low power ambient temperature measurement mode. Extrapolation can
    then be used to correct for the small proportion of the temperature change in
    the sensor''s output that is due to natural external temperature changes during
    the 21-s measurement cycle. As a single self-referencing thermistor has been used,
    there are no thermistor matching errors common to earlier designs. This allows
    the instrument''s calibration to hold true over a wider temperature range, although
    the instrument supply voltage and the 25°C thermistor resistance value set the
    low-temperature limit. The thermal diffusion sensor was shown to be capable of
    detecting the changes in internal hydration levels that accompany irrigation stress
    in grapevines. Basic measurements in the laboratory have shown that the sensor
    could detect a cut-cane response to a “forced event” such as the removal of the
    cane''s hydrating water flask. Rather than insert a sensor into the grapevine
    cane by drilling radially through (and damaging) the sap conducting vessels, a
    glass rod thermistor was successfully inserted coaxially into the pith of an excised
    stem, and the stem allowed to self-heal behind it. Injecting heat radially into
    the surrounding xylem tissue resulted in a rate of temperature rise dependent
    upon the plant''s internal water status. This thermal diffusivity measurement
    works because of the difference between the heat capacity and thermal conductivity
    of water compared to that of plant tissue. Grafting and pruning techniques are
    well established in viticulture, and this method of gaining access to the internal
    tissue of a living grapevine cane is well within the capabilities of irrigators.
    This paper has not sought to address major drawbacks that are likely to limit
    the method''s reliability under field conditions. The average temperature rise
    that is used as the sensor output signal depends on many more parameters than
    the cane moisture content, such as the growth-dependent geometry of the cane cross
    section, changes in the thermal properties of the pith and the lignification of
    plant tissue as the growing season progresses. While the first steps have been
    taken to prove a much-needed new approach to making continuous plant water status
    measurements, much fieldwork – in conjunction with irrigators and plant physiologists
    – will be needed to validate this new principle and the associated sensor insertion
    technique. It is very likely that irrigation decisions will at first be dependent
    upon “relative changes” in thermal diffusion measurements over the growing season
    of a crop, and that no initial calibration will hold up throughout the entire
    season as the plant grows and the woody matrix lignifies. Authors Figures References

    \ food demand and a growing human population, agriculture is the primary food\
    \ supplier and the most \nprominent labor user. It is also one of the essential\
    \ areas in a country's economy, according to gross domestic \nproduct (GDP) [1],\
    \ [2]. Water availability is an essential factor in optimizing the growth of crops\
    \ so that water \nscarcity can threaten food security. This reason makes water\
    \ conservation an essential factor in overcoming water \nshortages while increasing\
    \ yields. [3, 4]. Moreover, the development of agricultural technology and more\
    \ efficient \nagricultural management can produce productive crops and quality\
    \ harvests through greenhouse technology. \nDeveloping greenhouses for agriculture\
    \ can increase crop yields and improve water use efficiency [5].  \nAround 3.5%\
    \ of the world's agricultural land uses greenhouse and hydroponic systems to conserve\
    \ water use and \nother benefits such as crop protection and quality yields. A\
    \ greenhouse is a building with a wooden or metal \nfoundation covered with nets\
    \ or transparent material. Since 1960 the greenhouse has evolved from a building\
    \ that \nonly protects plants into a system for studying plant growth in a controlled\
    \ environment [6, 7]. Changes in \nagricultural land usage, lower irrigation water\
    \ output in primary, secondary, and tertiary canals, and global \nmicroclimate\
    \ changes contribute to the rising use of greenhouses in world agriculture [8].\
    \  \nAgricultural ecosystems (soil, nutrients, temperature, humidity, sunlight,\
    \ wind, and air composition) can be adapted \nto the needs of the plants planted\
    \ in greenhouses to extend productive plant life, change planting seasons, \n\
    increase crop yields and improve harvest quality. [9, 10]. Moving crops from their\
    \ natural environment to \ngreenhouses protect plants from weather and microclimate\
    \ uncertainties. On the downside, a greenhouse is a \nplace that can store solar\
    \ heat and requires resources to manage the microclimate according to plant needs,\
    \ \nespecially in countries with tropical climates. [4, 11]. Crop growth problems\
    \ arise in agriculture that depends on rain \nand drought; runoff and erosion\
    \ problems also arise during heavy rains. Water control is needed to meet crop\
    \ \nwater needs while conserving water [12]. The water control system functioned\
    \ as a regulator for water flow \naccording to the plant's needs in its growth\
    \ phase [13, 14]. \nConventional irrigation systems use a uniform amount of water\
    \ to fields from one corner to another during their \ngrowth period regardless\
    \ of the type of plant and its water needs. The result is water-wasting, where\
    \ one side of \nthe land has sufficient water, while the other can have excess\
    \ or lack of water [15]. Therefore, a control system \nknown as an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system is needed to support plants' water needs while saving water.\
    \ The way the \nsystem works, in general, is to adapt to the type of plant and\
    \ then automatically calculate the water needs of the \n657 \n \nIrfan Ardiansah,\

    \ supply based on the plant growth phase [16]. Intelligent irrigation systems\
    \ are suitable for \nuse in a greenhouse because a greenhouse has an enclosed\
    \ structure to reduce or eliminate parameters affecting \nplant growth, such as\
    \ seasons, rainfall, climate change, plant pests and diseases, and environmental\
    \ changes [17, \n18]. \nIntelligent irrigation systems are part of precision agriculture,\
    \ also known as smart farming, which integrates \ninformation technology, communication\
    \ technology, and control technology to automate various agricultural \nactivities\
    \ that humans initially did. With an intelligent irrigation system, the irrigation\
    \ process can run optimally in \nmanaging water to meet the needs of plants [19].\
    \ Intelligent irrigation systems can manage water needs based on \nvarious parameters\
    \ such as microclimate conditions, weather, sunlight, water quality such as acidity\
    \ (pH), turbidity \n(TDS), and electrical conductivity (EC), along with plant\
    \ growth phases through the Internet of Things (IoT) devices. \nAn intelligent\
    \ irrigation system can improve irrigation decisions to achieve water savings\
    \ and increased yields [20–\n22]. \nThe intelligent irrigation system is one of\
    \ the best systems in managing and saving water while maximizing \nharvests; water\
    \ is distributed evenly to each plant according to its needs and minimizes wasted\
    \ water [23]. This \nsystem can also mix nutrients and water and help deliver\
    \ them directly to the root zone, ensuring it is always in \noptimal moist conditions,\
    \ minimizing surface runoff, preventing root rot, and eliminating percolation.\
    \ The advantage \nis increased crop productivity, and better harvest quality also\
    \ ensures optimal water efficiency. Nevertheless, good \nintegration between IoT\
    \ devices, monitoring, control, and data acquisition can be done automatically\
    \ with minimum \nintervention to get an optimal and efficient, intelligent irrigation\
    \ system [24, 25]. \nIn the intelligent irrigation system, the controller can\
    \ process input data, present information, and manage irrigation \nbased on greenhouse\
    \ conditions, especially crop conditions to prevent water deficit. Nevertheless,\
    \ in addition to \nsystem automation, it is necessary to present current and past\
    \ system conditions to users, both plant responses to \nthe system and vice versa.\
    \ This method ensures that water management runs smoothly, and users can study\
    \ \nhistorical data as a reference for the next planting period and ensure optimal\
    \ farming [26–29]. This process \nrequires real-time monitoring, sophisticated\
    \ control systems, and precise instruments. The difference between a \nmonitoring\
    \ system and a control system is that the control system regulates the hardware\
    \ according to conditional \nconstraints. The control system manages the hardware\
    \ and software by defining the output and input parameters \nprecisely. The input\
    \ is microclimate parameters, plant properties, weather conditions, water quality,\
    \ and other \nsensors collect helpful information [30–33]. \nMany articles published\
    \ on IoT focus on agriculture, as discussed by [30, 34]. IoT is one of the best\
    \ inventions of \nthe 21st century in agriculture. In addition, review articles\
    \  [21], [35] discuss IoT opportunities in agriculture or \nintelligent farming\
    \ and how the connection between IoT, data mining, data science, and machine learning\
    \ \nsustainability supports agriculture. [36] describes the automation model for\
    \ monitoring and controlling the \nagricultural sector and predicting information\
    \ based on past data. There are currently no review studies that explore \nthe\
    \ monitoring and control strategy of intelligent irrigation systems in greenhouses,\
    \ necessitating the formation of \nintelligent irrigation system review articles\
    \ that focus on integrating various monitoring and control materials. As a \n\
    result, this study will cover intelligent irrigation system monitoring and control\
    \ mechanisms and their relevance to \ngreenhouses and irrigation. \nThis study\
    \ aims to classify the results of previous research, identify the results, and\
    \ bridge them with future trends \nto identify future research. Chapter 2 discusses\
    \ research methodology, and Chapter 3 discusses various irrigation \nmethods used\
    \ by intelligent irrigation systems. In contrast, Chapter 4 discusses monitoring\
    \ and controlling \nstrategies for IoT and then continues to Chapter 5, discussing\
    \ the integration of artificial intelligence. The last \nchapter discusses future\
    \ directions and trends in intelligent irrigation. \n2 REVIEW METHODOLOGY \nThe\
    \ methodology applied in selecting published literature with the theme of intelligent\
    \ farming focuses on the topic \nof intelligent irrigation systems and their control\
    \ systems by using an extensive search on several online libraries of \nmultidisciplinary\
    \ journals as Google Scholar, ScienceDirect, Springer, MDPI, and IOP, as well\
    \ as online \nengineering libraries as Agricola and IEEE Xplore. This technique\
    \ produces many research articles relevant to \nintelligent farming and irrigation\
    \ systems and their relationship to monitoring and control. That is why it is\
    \ essential \nto check the reputation of the publisher's journal before using\
    \ the article through the SCOPUS and ScimagoJR \nwebsites. This review's selection\
    \ of relevant articles emphasizes the latest journal articles in the last eleven\
    \ years \n(2011 - 2021); it can be seen in Figure 1a that in 2020 there was a\
    \ surge in articles discussing monitoring, control, \nand artificial intelligence\
    \ in agriculture. Other conditions are that all articles must be published in\
    \ SCOPUS indexed \njournals and conference proceedings. As shown in Figure 1b,\
    \ which shows the percentage of articles indexed by \nSCOPUS with articles with\
    \ Quartile 1 dominating research in this field means that the research is internationally\
    \ \nrecognized and has the best quality content. All articles used are smart farming,\
    \ intelligent irrigation system, and \nprecision agriculture. Articles are carefully\
    \ selected by reading and summarizing them to ensure continuity of ideas.  \n\

    \ \npositions \n3 TYPES OF IRRIGATION \nPlants need water at regular intervals\
    \ to grow and develop; in agriculture, this watering technique is called \nirrigation.\
    \ Irrigation has two methods, namely conventional and modern. Conventional agriculture\
    \ usually uses rain \nand surface irrigation to irrigate its land [37, 38]. The\
    \ problem is how to predict rain accurately, and surface \nirrigation does not\
    \ continuously irrigate the entire land with a uniform discharge. Surface irrigation,\
    \ classified as \nconventional irrigation, works by distributing water from springs\
    \ or rivers to the ground surface following gravity; \nmonitoring is done manually\
    \ by looking at the water level without IoT and automation [37].  \nDeveloping\
    \ countries generally use surface irrigation, for example, Indonesia. It uses\
    \ it to irrigate paddy fields by \nconstructing furrows that connect water sources\
    \ with rice fields and irrigate them. However, this method requires a \nlevel\
    \ ground surface to ensure adequate water distribution [39]. On the other hand,\
    \ surface irrigation results in high \nlevels of water loss due to evaporation,\
    \ uncontrolled water discharge, and percolation, which can reduce soil \nnutrient\
    \ levels resulting in sub-optimal crop yields [37]. There are two commonly used\
    \ surface irrigations: (1) \nFurrow irrigation is interpreted as water flowing\
    \ through small furrows made on the land slope. Water enters the soil \nfrom the\
    \ bottom and sides of the furrow and moves laterally and downwards to moisten\
    \ the soil and simultaneously \ncarry dissolved salts, fertilizers, and herbicides\
    \ [40]. Good tillage with uniform slopes can give better results from \nthis method.\
    \ Furrow irrigation is suitable for various soils, slopes, and crops especially\
    \ row crops. Crops that will be \ndamaged if water covers the stems or crowns\
    \ should use furrow irrigation [40, 41]. Furrow irrigation is also suitable \n\
    for tree crops. In the early stages of tree planting, using one furrow beside\
    \ the tree row may be sufficient, but as the \ntree grows, creating two or more\
    \ new furrows is necessary to provide sufficient water [42]. (2) Flooding Irrigation\
    \ is \nan irrigation method commonly used to provide water in lowland rice cultivation\
    \ and generally, water carried out \ncontinuously. Flooding is carried out continuously\
    \ at the same height throughout plant growth, starting from planting \nuntil several\
    \ days before harvest [43]. The use of flooding irrigation depends on sufficient\
    \ water to flood the land \nsurface with 10 cm of water. The disadvantage is inhibiting\
    \ plant growth and water wastage [44]. Because flooding \nirrigation uses water\
    \ excessively, flooding irrigation evolved into intermittent irrigation by flooding\
    \ and drying the \nland alternately from planting season until one week before\
    \ the flowering. The water level is maintained at 3 to 5 \ncm during flowering.\
    \ Giving water this way can reduce water usage up to 30 percent without reducing\
    \ crop yields \n[43–45] \n Modern irrigation offers uniform discharge for each\
    \ plant, including nutrients and saving water, mainly when \nplanting is carried\
    \ out in a greenhouse, making it easier to monitor water quantity and quality\
    \ and regulate water \nsupply schedules [46, 47]. The amount of water delivered\
    \ is determined by the plant's demands, irrigation method, \nand type of growing\
    \ medium. The choice of irrigation method influences the type of nutrients, the\
    \ number of \nnutrients, the rate of infiltration, evaporation, water absorption,\
    \ and drainage [12]. \nModern irrigation uses less water and is more efficient\
    \ than conventional irrigation, and this method saves more \nenergy and water.\
    \ It is an effective method for use in areas where water is scarce or has irregular\
    \ rains. This \nmethod allows farmers to cultivate crops consistently, creating\
    \ a reliable food supply [3, 11]. Modern irrigation relies \non water from wells,\
    \ lakes, and reservoirs stored in water tanks and then irrigates plants using\
    \ gravity or water \npumps [12]. The method of giving water is even more specific,\
    \ such as spraying water through a sprinkler or \ndripping water through an emitter\
    \ onto plants. [39] developed an automatic irrigation data communication system\

    \ Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nthrough the General Packet\
    \ Radio Service (GPRS) and Zigbee module and built a microprocessor-based gateway\
    \ \nto better control water discharge with water efficiency than conventional\
    \ irrigation systems, with the difference \nbetween conventional and modern irrigation\
    \ can be seen in Figure 2. \n \nFig 2. Types of irrigation \n3.1 \nSprinkler Irrigation\
    \ \nFarmers use sprinkler irrigation to mimic precipitation patterns. They used\
    \ small sprinkler nozzles connected to an \nextensive piping system to ensure\
    \ comprehensive irrigation coverage and used pumps to spray high-pressure \nwater\
    \ onto the air [48]. The advantage of sprinkler is that it minimizes runoff, is\
    \ suitable for all types of soil, and has \na water-saving rate of between 30\
    \ - 50%. Sprinkles can be mixed with fertilizer solutions and used in close \n\
    cropping and high plant population [28]. However, this method has high operating\
    \ costs for cleaning sprinkler \nnozzles and maintaining high-pressure pumps and\
    \ pipes. In addition, sprinkler irrigation is unsuitable for use in \nwindy areas\
    \ because wind gusts and evapotranspiration cause high water loss rates. Moreover,\
    \ regular \nmaintenance of the pipes and their connections to avoid leaks or clogs\
    \ can reduce the water spray pressure, \nreducing water distribution to the plants\
    \ [37, 48]. \n3.2 \nDrip Irrigation \nIn drip irrigation, the water source moistens\
    \ the soil or planting media through the holes in the pipes and flows \nthrough\
    \ a hose connected to the emitter with low pressure. The focus of water droplets\
    \ is a small part of the soil or \ngrowing medium that covers the root zone by\
    \ adjusting it to get water droplets [49]. Drip irrigation is the most \nefficient\
    \ irrigation because it can distribute water and nutrients simultaneously to the\
    \ root zone, which results in \nbetter nutrient uptake. Due to the circulation\
    \ of water in the roots through the capillary principle, the pores of the \nsoil\
    \ or planting medium remain dry so that air circulation is maintained and soil\
    \ moisture is at field capacity. \nProduces a root zone capable of breathing more\
    \ intensely during its growth cycle [25, 37, 50]. \nDrip irrigation uses dripping\
    \ water delivered at a rate of between 2 - 20 liters per hour. The application\
    \ of this \nmethod is to place an emitter on each plant. It is suitable for use\
    \ on vegetables and fruit, but farmers usually only \nconsider high-value plants\
    \ because the investment value is relatively high [37, 49]. This method supports\
    \ various \ntypes of soil by adjusting the speed of water application. Hefty porous\
    \ sandy soils need a fast drip-rate; conversely, \nclay soil needs a slow drip\
    \ rate to avoid water logging and runoff [25, 37]. \n4 MONITORING AND CONTROLLING\
    \ STRATEGIES \nA total of 30 papers were used to examine the irrigation system's\
    \ monitoring and control method. These \npublications provide ways for regulating\
    \ irrigation by employing sensors to measure changes in microclimate, water \n\
    quality, and soil moisture values. The paper's distribution is represented in\
    \ Figure 3 below. \nAn effective and efficient monitoring system is needed to\
    \ collect different plant growth parameters. Monitoring in an \nintelligent irrigation\
    \ system involves collecting data representing the latest microclimate data and\
    \ water and soil \nconditions around the irrigation area through a microcontroller\
    \ connected to the IoT [51], shown in Figure 4. The \ndevelopment of real-time\
    \ monitoring devices was made possible due to the rapid development of microcontrollers\
    \ \nand sensors, low-cost hardware (Arduino UNO, ESP8266, Raspberry Pi), and fast\
    \ internet, which enhanced the \nperformance of monitoring and control systems\
    \ [17, 52]. There are two types of internet connections: wired and \nwireless;\
    \ Wired connections make the internet connection stable, but with fixed hardware\
    \ location. Wireless \nconnection makes flexible hardware placement but has signal\
    \ interference [53]. \n \n660 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview of IOT based\

    \ \n \n \n \nFig 3. Distribution of papers on monitoring and controlling strategies\
    \ \n \nFig 4. Block diagram of IoT based Smart Farming \nAll devices and sensors\
    \ are connected directly to the server via a cabling system in a wired connection\
    \ case. This \nsystem is only effective when a few parameters are measured and\
    \ use a small greenhouse; it is crucial because \nthe more connected devices,\
    \ the more cables are used. So, the wired greenhouse system is not suitable for\
    \ large \nor commercial greenhouses. The advantage is that data transactions are\
    \ safe and have minimal interference [51, \n53, 54]. WSN is the latest technology\
    \ in intelligent farming that can be expanded and scaled up without modifying\
    \ \nthe greenhouse infrastructure. Its wireless form makes it easy to receive\
    \ and transmit data between nodes using \nlow-power frequencies. Unfortunately,\
    \ interference and signal loss are common problems because of the high \nfrequency\
    \ in the air. However, the increase in greenhouse size, the number of parameters,\
    \ sensors variety, node \nsize, and devices distant is not a problem because an\
    \ additional WSN only needs to be attached to an existing \nnetwork. Another advantage\
    \ is Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) technology, wirelessly connected sensor nodes\
    \ \nnetwork to sense and send various data, and extensible [36, 54, 55]. \nThe\
    \ implementation of WSN in agriculture itself is extensive, with sensors, RFID,\
    \ cameras, drones, and cloud \nservices connected seamlessly for data acquisition\
    \ and transmission. Cloud computing serves data collection and \nanalysis to generate\
    \ visualizations, decision support, and commands; system users (farmers or researchers)\
    \ can \nthen access data remotely via their devices to gain real-time insights\
    \ [19, 56]. Thus, monitoring and controlling the \nintelligent irrigation system\
    \ can be effective, efficient, convenient, and optimal yields. [55] proposed the\
    \ approach \nwith WSN and gateway node to collect soil moisture values in plants\
    \ by taking soil and cultivated plants images. \nThe challenges in building a\
    \ system that can accommodate these two technologies are sensor coverage, \ncommunication\
    \ between devices, computational process efficiency, and electricity usage. [57]\
    \ also offers UAVs for \naerial monitoring of vegetation and irrigation areas.\
    \ \nAppropriate control techniques in intelligent irrigation systems can increase\
    \ crop water supply precisely to improve \nthe efficiency of water use, energy\
    \ savings, harvest optimization, proper use of nutrients, and effective use of\
    \ labor. \n11\n5\n14\n0\n5\n10\n15\nMicroclimate\nWater Quality\nSoil Moisture\n\

    \ Engineering Science- Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nTherefore,\
    \ a control system can manipulate several irrigation parameters, like air circulation,\
    \ air temperature, \nrelative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation [58–60].\
    \ A technology that can analyze the surface temperature \nof agricultural land\
    \ without touching it using thermal imaging was proposed by [61] to determine\
    \ which areas of \nland are in dire need of water because the non-uniformity of\
    \ soil moisture can inhibit spinach growth. Studies by \n[56, 62–64] also state\
    \ that it is possible to use thermal imaging for nurseries, forecasting crop yields,\
    \ pest and \ndisease disturbances, maintenance of agricultural machinery, and\
    \ irrigation scheduling. \n4.1 \nMicroclimate based  \nMonitoring and controlling\
    \ the microclimate in the greenhouse is a critical factor to account for water\
    \ loss due to \nevaporation. Air temperature, relative humidity, solar radiation,\
    \ and wind speed need precision measurements to \nmeet crop water requirements\
    \ [30, 65]. The Raspberry Pi, various Arduino models, connected to WSN, and cloud\
    \ \nservers are popular hardware. WSN implementation is an efficient way to interconnect\
    \ various sensors placed far \napart in the greenhouse. The system performs accurate\
    \ system monitoring, collects data, and presents charts, and \ncontrol devices\
    \ are activated, referring to predefined threshold values compared with real-time\
    \ data [30, 36, 66]. \n[59] presented a technique for evaluating microclimate\
    \ parameters in two tropical greenhouses before planting \ntomatoes using LoRa\
    \ wireless and IoT sensors. The comfort ratio model (CftM) and scenario analysis\
    \ show that \nenvironmental conditions can adapt to the growth phase of tomato\
    \ plants. The microclimate before and during \nplanting was analyzed using the\
    \ Simulink app. Also, a study by [67] showed that a microclimate parameter \n\
    measurement device in a greenhouse could yield comprehensive data for temperature,\
    \ humidity, CO2 levels, \nlighting levels, soil moisture, acidity, irrigation\
    \ water conductivity, and airflow velocity. In winter, the greenhouse \nbehavior\
    \ was studied by [68] using fuzzy logic control (FLC) due to uncertainty in the\
    \ greenhouse environment. The \nfuzzy set was developed based on experts in greenhouse\
    \ thermal behavior. Fuzzy control manages decisions \nbased on weather forecasts\
    \ and user interactions. [54] also took a similar approach to measure leaf temperature,\
    \ \nair temperature, and soil moisture using three connected sensors to assess\
    \ the level of microclimate in a \ngreenhouse and use Zigbee to transmit sensor\
    \ data. \nControlling the microclimate in the greenhouse by using fan ventilation\
    \ and fan-pad ventilation can also be an \noption. This forced ventilation can\
    \ prevent plants from overheating even if the greenhouse does not use an \nevaporative\
    \ cooling system. Greenhouses can produce good harvests in the spring, and the\
    \ data show a \nrelationship between the greenhouse microclimate and water uptake\
    \ that minimizes drainage [69]. [70] built a \nmonitoring system using an open-source\
    \ platform to collect microclimate variables (air temperature, humidity, soil\
    \ \ntemperature, and soil moisture). Communication between devices uses Bluetooth\
    \ and obtain electricity supply \nthrough solar panels. [71] has proposed improvements\
    \ to the greenhouse IoT-based system by adding color \nspectrum monitoring using\
    \ a camera system to get photos of the plant canopies translated into color (RGB,\
    \ HSL, \nand brightness), plant texture, thermal (plant temperature), and plant\
    \ morphology. The system works with NFT to \nirrigate lettuce plants in the greenhouse,\
    \ automatically recording data and identifying plant stress levels. \n4.2 \nWater\
    \ Quality-based \nWater quality safety is a challenge in the 21st century because\
    \ of the many pollutants, which are predominantly \nartificial such as environmental\
    \ damage, packaging waste, or chemical waste. Overexploitation of natural \nresources,\
    \ rapid industrial development, and agricultural expansion are the leading causes\
    \ of the problem. [72]. \nWater quality is affected by direct and indirect sources\
    \ of pollution such as sewage, factory waste, agricultural and \nurban runoff.\
    \ The need for human involvement in water quality management is essential [73,\
    \ 74]. Water quality \nmanagement is a way to regularly collect water quality\
    \ information in a location to find out its current condition. \nWater quality\
    \ management aims to measure water quality variables such as microbial content\
    \ physical and \nchemical properties, provide an early warning system and provide\
    \ decision support for further treatment [75, 76]. \nWSN and IoT are inevitable\
    \ to manage variables over a wide area for larger areas such as lakes or oceans.\
    \ \n[75] has proposed a system that assesses irrigation water quality with IoT\
    \ by detecting potential hydrogen (pH), \nelectrical conductivity (EC), turbidity,\
    \ and salinity in real-time using different sensors to maintain plant health status.\
    \ \nAlso, [77] undertook a study to build a continuous water quality monitoring\
    \ system using open-source hardware \nand low-cost sensors. Preliminary results\
    \ show that the device can produce accurate results at a lower cost than \nexisting\
    \ technologies with proper calibration. \n4.3 \nSoil Moisture-based \nFarmers\
    \ need to consider soil conditions because moist soil means the plant still has\
    \ enough water for growth [11]. \nMonitoring soil moisture content becomes vital\
    \ as the basis for irrigation scheduling. Raspberry Pi and Arduino \nUNO have\
    \ commonly used devices in developing low-cost IoT-based soil moisture management\
    \ interfaced using \nvarious sensors [30, 60, 75]. The sensor used is a capacitive\
    \ type and transmits electricity without conduction; it \ncan measure soil moisture\
    \ changes by planting them into the soil and measuring its volumetric water content.\
    \ The \nTime Domain Reflectometry (TDR) sensor is a more precise option for measuring\
    \ soil moisture, consisting of two \nmetal rods embedded at the depth at which\
    \ the humidity is to be measured. Works by sending pulses to the soil \nand then\
    \ calculating the response of the soil as soil moisture content. Due to its good\
    \ quality in measuring soil \nmoisture, this TDR sensor is quite expensive to\
    \ use in large-scale greenhouses [78, 79]. \n662 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An\
    \ overview of IOT based intelligent irrigation systems for greenhouse: recent\
    \ trends \nand challenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science - Vol.20,\
    \ No 3, 2022 - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \n[80] proposed a soil moisture\
    \ control system for measuring water content in soil at different soil depths,\
    \ soil types, \nand air temperatures using various sensors integrated with Arduino\
    \ UNO. The ESP8266 wireless module is then \nlinked to the Arduino to upload data\
    \ to the cloud server. A similar study by [81] succeeded in developing an IoT-\n\
    based field control system integrated with cloud-based data monitoring and analysis.\
    \ The analysis results help \npredict water consumption for better crop yields.\
    \ [82] approach to controlling soil moisture uses wireless technology \nutilizing\
    \ GSM networks and push notifications to automate water supply for plants. A system\
    \ proposed by [83] \npresents an Android application-based humidity monitoring\
    \ method, where an Arduino interface sensor connected \nto Wi-Fi sends state data\
    \ to a smartphone. Another monitoring approach is carried out by [60] using IoT\
    \ and soil \nnutrient sensors to detect nutrient adequacy for plants. The decision\
    \ support system then receives the data \nparameters and processes them as a farming\
    \ decision. \n[84] implemented a user-friendly system, representing the soil moisture\
    \ level with colors. These colors have helped \nfarmers visually identify and\
    \ manage soil moisture content without understanding the values displayed. Likewise,\
    \ \n[85] proposed a soil nutrient control system that can manage the concentration\
    \ of nutrients in the soil by planting \nsensors in the soil to map nutrient variability.\
    \ Also, [86] developed an innovative device that uses a camera-\nintegrated drone\
    \ for field mapping. Images are analyzed to generate soil moisture and nutrient\
    \ values and use \nthem for irrigation planning and scheduling. \n5 ARTIFICIAL\
    \ INTELLIGENCE IN IRRIGATION SYSTEM \nArtificial intelligence in intelligent irrigation\
    \ systems was the subject of 25 papers. These studies concentrate on \ndeveloping\
    \ decision support systems, fuzzy logic models, and artificial neural network\
    \ models that can take \ndecisions automatically in response to changes in field\
    \ conditions. The distribution of articles based on the theme \nof artificial\
    \ intelligence is shown in Figure 5 below. \n \nFig 5. Distribution of papers\
    \ on artificial intelligence in irrigation system \nArtificial intelligence (AI)\
    \ is a branch of science concerned with creating machines that can understand\
    \ and act in \nthe same way as humans. Machine learning is a burgeoning sub-domain\
    \ of AI that explores patterns in large \namounts of data [58, 87]. The popularity\
    \ of machine learning is due to more and more data generated by various \napplications\
    \ and IoT. The system can generate helpful information for making decisions or\
    \ becoming input to other \nsystems by studying data patterns. The need for agricultural\
    \ products is directly proportional to the increase in the \nearth's population,\
    \ so agroindustry and innovative agriculture technology get the spotlight in the\
    \ industrial revolution \n4.0 [16, 46].  \nAI has the potential to solve nonlinear,\
    \ multiparameter, and time-varying problems in managing intelligent irrigation\
    \ \nsystems. By applying AI algorithms to specific problem areas, the system tries\
    \ to imitate human logic, thought \nprocesses, and decision making through the\
    \ application of Fuzzy Logic, Support Vector Machine (SVM), k-Nearest \nNeighbor\
    \ (kNN), Decision Tree and Random Forest by using past data to feed AI and provides\
    \ new knowledge to \nthe system [58, 61]. [88] has researched by applying different\
    \ regression and machine learning algorithms to \nseveral sensor datasets to develop\
    \ weekly irrigation plan predictions. \nA study implementing an intelligent irrigation\
    \ system shows many advantages, such as minimizing soil stress to \nchanging microclimate\
    \ conditions, efficient water use, and reducing human interaction. This solar\
    \ panel-powered \nsystem has a Sensor Layer, Central Layer, and Valve Layer running\
    \ together. The function of the Central Layer is \nto control the process that\
    \ produces input (sensor layer detects moisture content) and output (valve layer\
    \ opens to \nprovide water). The system also enables fertilizers and pesticides\
    \ by calibrating other sensors according to the \nrequired input [89]. \n5.1 \n\
    Decision Support System \nWater management for irrigation requires extensive and\
    \ comprehensive data on dispersed and spatial agriculture. \nIn general, farmers\
    \ have difficulty processing their data because they do not have the experience\

    \ -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \nmake irrigation management decisions; this is\
    \ where the decision support system (DSS) comes in [76, 90]. DSS \nhas a framework\
    \ that can represent complex systems with an efficient and robust approach that\
    \ is easy to \nunderstand generates additional information and new perspectives\
    \ to improve the quality of irrigation management. \nDSS is an information system\
    \ that analyzes data and represents it to make decisions quickly. The primary\
    \ purpose \nof DSS is to support and improve decision-making [28, 76]. Figure\
    \ 6 shows a DSS logic diagram that consists of \nfour connected components: Database,\
    \ model base, knowledge base, and user interface. \n \nFig 6. Block diagram of\
    \ Decision Support System \nThe Database in irrigation DSS collects and manages\
    \ air temperature, relative humidity, crop water requirements, \nirrigation records,\
    \ and solar radiation. The knowledge base has three parts: fact base, rule base,\
    \ and inference \nengine used to analyze data, solve uncertain problems and draw\
    \ conclusions. The model base creates optimization \nmodels, integrates numerous\
    \ decision models, analyzes them to create crop water simulations, and offers\
    \ farmers \nirrigation scheduling. [71, 76]. \nDeveloping and utilizing a decision\
    \ support system in irrigation management is essential for scheduling water \n\
    delivery based on crop needs. The main problem is how moist the soil is and how\
    \ much water the plants need \nbased on the type of plant, planting technique,\
    \ availability of water, amount of fertilizer applied, microclimate \nconditions,\
    \ and stage of plant development [91]. With DSS, farmers can manage their farms\
    \ daily using plant \ndatabases and water supply strategies to perform irrigation\
    \ calculations and fertilization adjustments to obtain \noptimal yields. There\
    \ are times when a system has a crop suggestion feature that advises farmers to\
    \ plant a crop \nthat yields the highest profit under certain constraints [92].\
    \ \nThe problem is that the characteristics of crops, soils, and microclimatic\
    \ conditions in agriculture are dynamic and \nnot linear, varying with seasons.\
    \ Therefore, setting the proper irrigation schedule will directly influence plant\
    \ growth. \nThe core of DSS includes monitoring different parameters using different\
    \ sensors and configuring their rules. DSS \nmanages sensor readings stored in\
    \ the cloud to adjust irrigation scheduling to maintain irrigation system efficiency\
    \ \nroutinely [76, 90]. An intelligent irrigation DSS must have the ability to\
    \ adapt to changes in transient and spatial \nplant dynamics, such as uncertainties\
    \ in microclimate conditions, nutrient requirements, and environmental \nchanges.\
    \ Researchers have proposed many studies on DSS applied to irrigation systems,\
    \ such as [93], who \ndeveloped an automated irrigation system using a single\
    \ lateral pipe covering a large area to manage water at \nvarying speeds. \nSprinkler\
    \ irrigation developed by [94] uses an automatic linear moving sprinkler system\
    \ with WSN based DSS. The \nsystem can adapt to crop types, irrigation requirements,\
    \ and planting locations to command individual sprinkler \nheads how and where\
    \ water must be applied. Similarly, [76] built a DSS integrated fertigation simulator\
    \ for \ndesigning drip or sprinkler irrigation for on-site olives and grapes farms.\
    \ The system has a database, simulation \nmodel, and user interface that shows\
    \ the ranking of design alternatives through multicriteria decision-making \n\
    (MCDM). The scope of the calculation of this system includes land analysis, water\
    \ requirements, and plant \nnutrition. \n664 \nIrfan Ardiansah, et al. - An overview\

    \ - www.engineeringscience.rs \n \n \n5.2 \nFuzzy Logic Model \nA fuzzy logic\
    \ model is a data-driven technique with easy-to-understand logical rules. [50,\
    \ 68, 95] proposed a fuzzy \nlogic-based irrigation scheduling by enforcing control\
    \ rules to microclimate data, evaporation data, and soil \nconditions. The process\
    \ flow can be seen in Figure 7. \n[96] succeeded in building and testing a rule-based\
    \ Fuzzy Logic application to assess the water stress index of \nplants in a greenhouse;\
    \ the application accepts three input variables, namely air temperature, solar\
    \ radiation, and \nwater pressure. Results show that Fuzzy Logic eliminates the\
    \ need for air aerodynamic resistance data, making \nthis system more straightforward.\
    \ \n[95] developed fuzzy logic using the LabVIEW application to create a graphical\
    \ user interface (GUI) for a drip \nirrigation control system in a greenhouse.\
    \ The input parameters used are air temperature and soil moisture and \nprocess\
    \ them using fuzzy rules to produce information of irrigation duration. The test\
    \ results show that fuzzy logic \ncontrol can efficiently estimate irrigation\
    \ schedules in an automated system, and greenhouse managers can \nmonitor real-time\
    \ data and devices that are easy to manage, even for ordinary users. [97] research\
    \ also designed \nan irrigation control based on fuzzy logic applying the Penman-Monteith\
    \ equation for rice cultivation with a \nparameter model in the difference between\
    \ actual and target evapotranspiration following the plant growth phase. \nEach\
    \ phase has its water requirement. The research aims to develop an intelligent\
    \ system that helps irrigation \nmanagement and produces a system that can work\
    \ better than conventional irrigation systems. The results showed \nthat the control\
    \ system saves water, improves irrigation performance, improves crop quality,\
    \ and saves labor.  \n \nFig 7. Fuzzy Logic-based Intelligent Irrigation System\
    \ \nAlso, [50] developed a fuzzy logic system that evaluates the irrigation system\
    \ based on the variable availability of \nirrigation water during the planting\
    \ period on the level of farmers' income which results in the efficiency of the\
    \ \nirrigation system performance. To assist in making decisions on irrigation\
    \ distribution. [98] conducted similar \nresearch by developing an intelligent\
    \ irrigation system to turn on and off the irrigation system using input \nparameters\
    \ of water use, water and air temperature, and soil moisture. They implement WSN-based\
    \ monitoring to \nsend data on fuzzy logic, which then performs irrigation scheduling\
    \ by applying fuzzy rules. The system can \nmaintain soil moisture content at\
    \ the specified limit to save the use of electrical energy, water, and runoff.\
    \ \n5.3 \nArtificial Neural Network Model \nOne application of AI in agriculture\
    \ is Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithms, which can predict using elements\
    \ \ninterconnected and work in parallel. The advantage of neural networks is that\
    \ they can be trained, for example, to \ndistinguish grass from rice or to compare\
    \ tomatoes to peppers [71]. The ANN system can predict with high \naccuracy when\
    \ fed reliable and precise data. A trained ANN is considered an expert in a category\
    \ of data. This \nexpert can then predict possible future conditions and prepare\
    \ what-if scenarios [73, 87]. Other advantages of ANN \nare (1) Adaptive learning,\
    \ the ability to learn and carry out tasks based on the data provided, (2) Self-organization,\
    \ \nthe system can independently compile and build information representations\
    \ during the learning process, and (3) \nReal-time operations, computations are\
    \ carried out in parallel, so it is faster to get calculation results [99]. \n\
    The ANN model is a simple model consisting of three primary neurons distributed\
    \ in the input layer, multiples of the \nhidden layer, and the output layer. ANN\
    \ development requires necessary basic steps, namely datasets, ANN \nmodel training\
    \ data, and ANN model test data for evaluation. Using quality data, the ANN model\
    \ has a mechanism \nfor self-study and solving complex problems. Input neurons\
    \ receive parameters, then hidden neurons perform \n665 \n \nIrfan Ardiansah,\
    \ et al. - An overview of IOT based intelligent irrigation systems for greenhouse:\
    \ recent trends and \nchallenges \n \nJournal of Applied Engineering Science-\
    \ Vol.20, No 3, 2022 -www.engineeringscience.rs \n \ncomputations, and output\
    \ neurons send signals to other network layers; and interconnect neurons using\
    \ linear and \nnonlinear functions [26, 87, 99, 100]. \nThe following Figure 8\
    \ shows the ANN process flow. In general, the use of ANN includes problem-solving\
    \ in system \noptimization, process control, pattern classification, forecasting,\
    \ and prediction. The main components of an ANN \nmodel consist of neuron nodes,\
    \ a hidden layer containing weights between parameters and distribution rules\
    \ to \ngenerate information for learning rules and independent learning skills\
    \ through experience. There are two types of \nANN models based on their input\
    \ choices: feed-forward and feed-backward networks [99]. \n \nFig 8. The flow\
    \ of feed-forward artificial neurons \nEvapotranspiration is essential information\
    \ that needs to be known to optimize plant growth, especially in water \nmanagement\
    \ and sustainable irrigation systems. Knowledge of the parameters of air temperature,\
    \ relative \nhumidity, wind speed, hours of sunshine, and latitude can optimize\
    \ the management of ET0 in a greenhouse [97]. \nANN research on intelligent irrigation\
    \ systems is applied to scheduling and irrigation discharge to achieve savings\
    \ \nin irrigation water use. [87] conducted a study to estimate the value of soil\
    \ moisture in rice farming land using \nminimal micro and macro climate data by\
    \ applying two ANN models. The first model predicts the value of ET0 \nusing the\
    \ minimum, maximum and average air temperature variables. The second model does\
    \ the same thing but \nuses air temperature, precipitation, and solar radiation.\
    \ The test results show that both models produce reliable and \naccurate soil\
    \ moisture estimates. \nA study by [101] has developed an ANN model to calculate\
    \ evapotranspiration (ET0). After testing, they concluded \nthat the ANN model\
    \ predicts evapotranspiration better than the conventional ET0 equation. Similarly,\
    \ [90] \ndeveloped an ANN to calculate ET0 and compared it with the Penman-FAO\
    \ equation and Penman-Monteith model \nusing four and six microclimate variables\
    \ as inputs. The test indicates that the three models provide accurate \nresults\
    \ using six input parameters. In contrast, the test results with four parameters\
    \ show that only the ANN model \ncan accurately predict the ET0 value. This research\
    \ shows that building an ANN model is possible even with limited \nmicroclimate\
    \ data.  \nIn addition, irrigation control system automation was also proposed\
    \ by [102] using the ANN cluster and closed-loop \ncontrol, which resulted in\
    \ better performance than time-based irrigation control. However, they did not\
    \ provide \ninformation regarding the irrigation method used and the percentage\
    \ of water savings. [100] developed an \nintelligent irrigation system for evapotranspiration\
    \ using the ANN model and a photovoltaic system to predict \nirrigation scheduling\
    \ based on cropping moisture distribution data; this study reported better daily\
    \ water and \nelectrical energy savings also better crop yields. The application\
    \ of ANN in irrigation water management has also \ndiscussed prediction of water\
    \ salinity, water quality, rain runoff, and forecasting of surface irrigation\
    \ infiltration,  \n[73] proposed two ANN models to predict Biochemical Oxygen\
    \ Demand (BOD) and Dissolved Oxygen (DO) for \nirrigation water originating from\
    \ rivers; the conclusion is that water quality management in other areas can also\
    \ use \nthis ANN model. Similarly, [103] uses the ANN model to design an intelligent\
    \ system to manage water systems for \nagriculture and fisheries. [104] explained\
    \ that the greenhouse environment has dynamic and complex \ncharacteristics, making\
    \ it difficult to use conventional control methods as a solution. Radial Basis\
    \ Function Neural \nNetworks (RBF) algorithm and nonlinear adaptive controllers\
    \ become solutions to control greenhouse microclimate. \n[74] discusses the use\
    \ of ANN in drip irrigation systems to predict the distribution of subsurface\
    \ irrigation water. \nThe development of the ANN is to model the continuous wetting\
    \ pattern after the water droplets from the emitter \ntouch the ground surface.\
    \ \n6 FUTURE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES \nThis review explored the various studies\
    \ and progress to improve irrigation water use efficiency, nutrient \noptimization,\
    \ and crop yields. The aim is to improve and increase food availability by implementing\
    \ IoT-based \nmonitoring and control on agricultural land, especially greenhouses.\

    \ of the latest IoT technologies for environmental conditions monitoring, data-driven\
    \ \ncontrol, and artificial intelligence. Nowadays, there is an increase in research\
    \ that develops techniques and models \nfor developing irrigation control systems.\
    \ The trend is due to the emergence of various sensors and controls on the \n\
    market; this provides vast opportunities for the development of precision agriculture,\
    \ especially for making \nintelligent predictions of agricultural processes such\
    \ as crop yields, crop water requirements, and microclimate \nconditions. Researchers\
    \ also need to explore other factors that influence irrigation scheduling planning,\
    \ especially \nin large agricultural areas, because researchers generally conduct\
    \ studies on a laboratory scale. Research from \ndifferent perspectives will enrich\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems and result in inaccurate predictions that can\
    \ advise \nfarmers regarding their farming activities and notify them when anomalies\
    \ occur. \nFurthermore, researchers need to test various control systems in the\
    \ irrigation systems discussed, focus on \nadaptive control, and combine it with\
    \ real-time monitoring. It is essential to build systems that can adapt to dynamic\
    \ \nparameters of microclimate, soil, and plant. At the same time, ensure the\
    \ intelligent irrigation system runs optimally. \nIn addition, it is essential\
    \ to develop intelligent irrigation systems that are increasingly complex and\
    \ digital-based so \nthat the technology is suitable, affordable, and stable for\
    \ smallholders. The hope is to increase water use efficiency \nand solve water\
    \ scarcity. \n7 CONCLUSION \nLimited water has become the biggest challenge for\
    \ farmers, and efficiency must solve water scarcity in irrigation \nmanagement.\
    \ The main objective is to control the amount and frequency of irrigation so that\
    \ the amount of water \nreceived by plants is sufficient to keep the root zone\
    \ moist. Farmers who are generally ignorant about the \ncomplexity of optimal\
    \ irrigation management need a system that can facilitate big data processing\
    \ analysis tools \nand transmit quality information quickly and efficiently. The\
    \ system must be able to provide recommendations \naccording to the conditions\
    \ of the agricultural environment to increase the experience and decision-making\
    \ of \nfarmers. \nThis problem challenges researchers to increase efforts to develop\
    \ sophisticated monitoring and control strategies \nfor intelligent farming that\
    \ minimize irrigation water use. This review draws on previous relevant studies\
    \ on \nagriculture water saving. The review results describe research trends in\
    \ intelligent irrigation systems monitoring \nand control strategies and assess\
    \ research opportunities to ensure water availability and savings. We hope this\
    \ \nreview provides insight and inspiration for researchers to continue research\
    \ on irrigation monitoring and control to \nachieve food security and water savings.\

    • Traditional rice farming in Italy relies on labor-intensive flood irrigation.
    • Research explores the use of remotely controlled gates for efficient irrigation.
    • Non-linear predictive control enhances water level coordination and conservation.
    Abstract Rice is one of the most important staple foods in the world. In Europe,
    Italy is the main producer of rice, with almost all production concentrated in
    the northeast of the country. Traditionally, rice is grown in fields that are
    flooded from before planting until just before harvest. This water management
    technique requires a great deal of labour for farmers who have to manually adjust
    the inlet and outlet gates to maintain a constant ponding water level in the fields,
    especially when there is fluctuation of water supply at the farm inlet, for example
    as a result of rainfall. In addition, the practice of flood irrigation is very
    water-intensive. New technologies based on remotely and automatically controlled
    gates are being studied to increase the efficiency of this irrigation method.
    The objective of this work is to explore the potential of a coordinated and intelligent
    system of gates for efficient farm irrigation management and ponding water level
    maintenance. Based on information and measurements from a real case study consisting
    of a 40-hectare paddy rice farm located in northern Italy, where automatic gates
    and water level sensors were placed at strategic points of the farm canals and
    fields, respectively, a proportional-integral (PI) and a non-linear model predictive
    control (NMPC) of water levels were implemented and compared through modelling
    and simulation experiments. The results show that the proportional-integral control
    reproduces the actions that the farmer uses when faced with situations of surplus
    of water in the fields or a shortage of water in the farm canal. In particular,
    the general coordination of the gates is lost, and the individual binomial field-gate
    prevails as an independent system in the farmer''s operation. Conversely, non-linear
    predictive control coordinates the gate operation to obtain a uniform ponding
    water level in the fields when there is a shortage of water, or significant water
    conservation when there is an excess of water as a result of rainfall. In conclusion,
    a nonlinear predictive control model seems to be a suitable strategy to advance
    irrigation management in rice farms, allowing rice farmers to continue the tradition
    of flooding while increasing its performance. Previous article in issue Next article

    control model 1. Introduction Rice is the third most produced crop in the world
    and a staple food for more than half of the world''s population, mostly living
    in developing countries (Fukagawa and Ziska, 2019). In this context, Italy is
    the leading rice producer in Europe, accounting for more than half of the total
    production of this high-value crop (Facchi et al., 2018). Typically, rice is grown
    in fields that are flooded from planting to pre-harvest, and this traditional
    irrigation technique (i.e., continuous submergence) is considered an important
    sink of water resources. This technique is dominant in most areas and is characterized
    by low irrigation efficiency (Cesari de Maria et al., 2016). In addition, irrigation
    management requires a lot of human labour, as it is still based on maintaining
    a predetermined water level in the paddies by manually regulating the irrigation
    inflow rate (Masseroni et al., 2017). In this context, the application of flexible
    and automatic control devices for irrigation management in paddy rice farms appears
    to be a viable solution that can be exploited to (i) increase the water use efficiency
    of rice cultivation and (ii) reduce the effort dedicated to irrigation flow rate
    regulation at field and farm scale, without changing the traditional irrigation
    flooding practices. More specifically, hydraulic infrastructures based on a system
    of coordinated gates located at strategic points of the farm irrigation network
    can allow to maintain optimal water levels in the farm channels and rice plots,
    providing more consistent and reliable irrigation flows through the farm service
    points. A recent review on the identification of smart automatic irrigation techniques
    for sustainable rice environments shows that there is a great potential for water
    conservation through the use of automatic and coordinated gate systems in permanently-flooded
    rice farms, with benefits in terms of both increasing the quality and quantity
    of crop production (Champness et al., 2023). Nevertheless, the review highlighted
    that these systems applied in paddy rice contexts are still in an embryonic stage
    and their application is limited to individual rice plots (Masseroni et al., 2018).
    Table 1 shows the degree of automation and sensor components developed in the
    main automated gravity surface irrigation system experiments for rice. In general,
    all have successfully developed a desktop-based system for remote control of irrigation,
    but only Masseroni et al. (2018) have developed a system using commercially available
    infrastructure in a commercial-scale. Table 1. Summary of the components and capabilities

    aimed to improve the sustainability of agricultural water use has indirectly stimulated
    irrigation modernisation projects. For example, the Lombardy region (the most
    important region in Italy from an industrial and agricultural point of view, with
    over 7000 km2 of irrigated land) is promoting bottom-up initiatives in the form
    of "information and pilot project actions". The main aim of these initiatives
    is to demonstrate the potential of innovative irrigation management systems at
    farm and district level, and to promote a shared understanding of modernisation
    objectives. In this study, we analyse and reflect on the results achieved in one
    of these pilot initiatives. Specifically, the project represents a pioneering
    example of the transition to a flexible and harmonised approach to irrigation
    management in paddy farms. In particular, a new modelling framework adopted for
    a coordinated and centralized flowrate regulation is described. The control algorithm
    implemented to maintain a predetermined ponding water level in the fields according
    to site-specific conditions is presented and tested under two different scenarios
    of shortage and surplus of water supply to the farm. The impact of this new centralised
    management of farm gates on water conservation was compared with the impact of
    a traditional decentralised management of gates, which roughly simulates the operations
    carried out manually by the farmer. The results may provide indications for improving
    flood management in rice cultivation, taking into account the effects of climate
    change on freshwater availability and rainfall patterns. 2. Control strategies
    for a sustainable agricultural water management Advanced but still little explored
    strategies for achieving coordinated control of complex systems of physical devices
    for irrigation (e.g. gates, valves, pumps) are those represented by proportional-integral-derivative
    (PID) or predictive controls (van Overloop et al., 2005, Bertsekas, 2005). The
    first class of controls offers a mid-point between simple bang-bang controls (i.e.
    feedback controllers that switches abruptly between two states - on or off - when
    a desired target (setpoint) has been reached) and model-based controls such as
    predictive ones (Huang et al., 2022). In agricultural water management, PID control
    has been mainly used for real-time control of soil moisture (Harper, 2017), management
    of sprinkler irrigation equipment (Jacob et al., 2019), and control of irrigation
    canal operations (Litrico et al., 2007). A good description of the application
    of predictive control in the field of water resource systems is provided by Castelletti
    et al. (2023). In particular, they consider three main areas of interest in the
    application of the model predictive control (MPC), namely the water reservoir,
    the open channels and the urban water network. In the first case, reservoirs are
    usually multi-purpose systems serving power plants, irrigation districts, urban
    and industrial water users, as well as contributing to other objectives such as
    flood control, environmental management, navigation, water quality, etc. Traditionally,
    reservoir control is implemented by a human operator who can act on the basis
    of static control curves or control actions proposed in real time by a decision
    support system (DSS). In this case, the predictive control strategy can help to
    decide the release from the reservoir at time t + 1 depending on the release decision,
    the storage and the net inflow (usually affected by potential disturbances) to
    the reservoir at time t. In the second case, open channels are stretches of water
    between two control structures. Actuators are hydraulic infrastructure, such as
    gates, weirs and dams, available for water control purposes. Finally, nodes represent
    channel junctions, i.e. locations where a stream flows into or branches off from
    the main stream (these are known as tributaries and distributaries, respectively).
    The dynamics of open channels are best described by the Saint-Venant equations,
    a set of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. In this case, the predictive
    control strategy can help, for example, to maintain a pool between two actuators
    (to limit fluctuations in water diverted by tributaries). It can also support
    a bottom-up approach to gravity water distribution for irrigation, where the actual
    irrigation requirements of the fields are incorporated into the gate operations
    on the irrigation canals and ultimately the release function from the reservoir.
    In the third case, the urban water network is affected by the integrated urban
    water cycle, which consists of several infrastructural and operational components,
    including water source management, water treatment, water transport and distribution,
    sewerage/sewage collection and rainwater/stormwater drainage systems, with the
    main objective of providing water for human needs reliably, efficiently and safely,
    and then returning it to the environment with the least possible impact. Taking
    water transport and distribution networks as an example, an optimal control problem
    (possibly involving a predictive control strategy) is typically formulated as
    an optimal pump operation and valve setting control problem, aiming at resource
    and economic savings in energy consumption and associated costs, while ensuring
    that water is delivered to end users to meet their water needs. The main application
    of predictive control strategy (Bwambale et al., 2023) in irrigation management
    is in water, energy and fertiliser conservation. In particular, this strategy
    has largely been applied in the areas of irrigation canal flow control and regulation
    (Álvarez et al., 2013), while limited experiences were found in irrigation scheduling
    (Abioye et al., 2021), soil water potential regulation (Chen et al., 2020), soil
    moisture regulation (Ayaz et al., 2020) and lastly prediction of precipitation
    and evapotranspiration (Guo and You, 2018). Nothing to the author''s knowledge
    has been found on the application of predictive control model on irrigation management
    at field or farm scale and in particular on paddy rice. 3. Material and methods
    3.1. The pilot case study The flexible and coordinated irrigation management system
    was implemented at Cascina Ca'' Granda Milano, a rice paddy farm (40 ha in size)
    located in the south of Milan, consisting of 10 fields with an average size of
    about 4 ha each (Fig. 1). The fields are characterized by a toposequence (from
    north to south), which facilitates the irrigation procedures. More specifically,
    the fields are divided into five different blocks (i.e., bc, d, ehi, fg, lm),
    which are characterized by a single point of entry of the water flow. For example,
    in block bc, the only entry point is located in b. From b, the water flows into
    c, since it is topographically lower than b. According to the toposequence, the
    fields are irrigated as follows: block bc is irrigated first, followed by block
    d, third block ehi, then block fg, and finally block lm. Download : Download high-res

    farm canal network is indicated by blue arrows. Subdivision of fields [b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,l,m]
    in block is shown in red. All the fields have been sown with rice (Leonida variety)
    and the irrigation practice adopted is continuous flooding. In particular, rice
    is sown in dry soil at the end of April and the fields are flooded when the rice
    is around the three-leaf stage (i.e. about one month after sowing). Harvesting
    is typically scheduled for mid-September, while the fields are drained at the
    end of August. Eleven boreholes were drilled within the fields to determine soil
    hydraulic properties. On average, the soils are characterized by a silt loam texture
    with slight variability between blocks. The low conductivity layer thickness was
    approximately 30 cm, characterized by an average saturated hydraulic conductivity
    of approximately 1.8 mm/h. The nominal flow rate delivered to the farm by the
    irrigation agency is about 200 l/s continuously during the irrigation season (i.e.,
    April to September). The water is delivered to the farm from the north, i.e. upstream
    of points P1 and P2. There are no drainage points in the fields, while only one
    farm canal drainage point is activated in case of overflows. 3.1.1. Equipment
    At strategic points of the farm canal (P1–4 in Fig. 1) four automatic and remote
    controlled PikoMeter® gates (Rubicon Water, AU) were installed (Fig. 2a) to control
    the irrigation within the blocks. The PikoMeter® consists of three main components:
    an ultrasonic level sensor inside the gate frame, a flow meter and a steel gate.
    The flow meter measures the flow rate across the gate; hence the volume integrating
    the flow rates during irrigation. This meter consists of a cylindrical box with
    20 ultrasonic transducers in 5 measurement planes. The flow meter can measure
    with an accuracy of + /- 2.5% for velocities greater than 25 mm/s. The water level
    obtained by the ultrasonic level sensor is measured with an accuracy of 0.5 mm
    and a resolution of 0.1 mm. The gates are equipped with adaptive control software
    that allows their operation to be managed through three different setpoint configuration
    levels, i.e. maintaining a fixed (i) gate opening, (ii) upstream water level (U/S)
    or (iii) downstream flow (D/S). Download : Download high-res image (359KB) Download

    known as Ferit®, are depicted in the upper right corner of the image. In addition
    to the PikoMeter®, five ultrasonic water level sensors (Ferit®) were installed
    in each field block (Fig. 2b). The position of the Ferit® in the field was decided
    according to the farmer''s experience, i.e. where its measurement would be representative
    of the water level in the block (L1-L5 in Fig. 1). Each Ferit® continuously monitors
    the water level in the rice field (with a resolution of +/- 1 mm) and sends the
    information to a master control system (FarmConnect® Gateway - Rubicon Water AU).
    The FarmConnect® Gateway can potentially provide a cellular network interface
    between PikoMeter® and Ferit®, but it has not yet been developed to control the
    gate operations. This interface uses the Telstra NextG protocol to routinely upload
    the data [via a Global System for Mobile Connection (GSM)] to a host server for
    remote monitoring and control. Biophysical parameters were continuously measured
    over the agricultural season by a standard agro-meteorological station of the
    Regional Environmental Protection Agency (ARPA), located a few kilometres from
    the rice farm. 3.2. Rice farm modelling framework The main elements of paddy rice
    farm (i.e. fields, canal, gates) were modelled using the Modelica simulation environment
    (Modelica Association, 2021). Modelica is an object-oriented, declarative, multi-domain
    modelling language for component-oriented modelling of complex systems. There
    are two main differences between Modelica and common object-oriented programming
    languages such as C+ + or Java. First, Modelica is a modelling language, not a
    traditional programming language: Modelica classes are not compiled in the conventional
    sense, but are translated into objects which are then exercised by a simulation
    engine. Second, Modelica is essentially based on equations, not assignments, although
    algorithmic components are still allowed, such as algorithms in programming languages
    or blocks in causal simulation environments (e.g. Simulink). In other words, Modelica
    allows an acausal approach to physical modelling: equations have no predefined
    causality and can have expressions on both the right and left sides. The simulation
    engine symbolically manipulates the equations to determine the order in which
    they are solved, as well as to determine the overall inputs and outputs of the
    model. Because of these features, the Modelica language allows a truly modular
    approach to the modelling of complex systems. This improves the readability, modifiability,
    and reusability of plant component models (Mattsson and Elmqvist, 1997), as well
    as the extension of the packages of physical domains by adding models of new components.
    In addition, models can be assembled graphically by dragging, dropping and connecting
    component icons, taking advantage of the graphical capabilities of the adopted
    (open source) interpreter, OpenModelica. The basic modelling components of the
    pilot rice farm were collected in a Modelica library (Field_Package). It contains
    definitions of constants (e.g. atmospheric pressure, gravity acceleration, water
    density etc.), classes (e.g. connectors), and subpackages (e.g. fields, canals,
    gates). Each element included in the Field_Package is described in detail in the
    Supplementary Material, whereas at the link https://github.com/looms-polimi/Field_Package
    the reader can freely download the rice farm Modelica library. In Fig. 3 the general

    Additional information about the symbols can be found in the Supplementary Material.
    Since in the control theory the number of control and controlled variables must
    be equal (Glasser, 1985), only the blocks d (6 ha), ehi (4.9 ha), lm (8.9 ha)
    and fg (13.2 ha) were considered in the modelling experiment. These blocks are
    directly irrigated by the water flows through P1, P3, P4 and by the difference
    of the flow rate derived between the gate P2 and the combination of P3 and P4.
    For simplicity, the blocks d, ehi, lm, and fg will be referred to as Field 1,
    2, 3, and 4, respectively, and the gates P1, 2, 3, and 4 will be referred to as
    gate G1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. The core of the rice farm modelling is the
    field water balance. Rainfall, irrigation, evapotranspiration, and percolation
    were considered as dominant water fluxes, while surface drainage was neglected
    because each field has no outflow. The details of the field water balance are
    entirely reported in the Supplementary Material. The water balance was calibrated
    based on ponding water level measurements in the fields under a condition of near
    steady flow into the fields. Specifically, the calibration involved adjusting
    the percolation flux (through a percolation coefficient) so that the simulated
    ponding water level matched the real one. Fig. 4 shows the comparison between
    the measured and modelled ponding water levels within Field 3, the latter obtained
    with different percolation coefficients. We found that the range of percolation
    coefficient between 0.01 and 0.04 allowed a good fit between the observed and
    simulated ponding water levels in all fields. However, in the modelling framework
    we decided to use a single percolation coefficient equal to 0.01 for all fields.

    level, c – percolation coefficient. 3.3. Control strategy The goal of the control
    system is obviously to regulate the ponding water level within the fields. This
    is done by modulating the opening of the sluice gates (G1–4). The controlled variables
    are therefore the water levels within the fields, while the control variables
    are the opening height of the gates. The main disturbances are essentially the
    rainfall, percolation, evapotranspiration, and the flow rate in the canal. All
    states of the model are measured, including the farm canal levels. Therefore,
    there was no need to implement state estimators. A first simple approach to the
    design of the control system was to consider the binomial field-gate as an independent
    system. This approach can be defined as a decentralized control strategy. The
    interactions that occur mainly through the connection between fields and farm
    canal can be neglected with this approach (i.e. canal water is not considered
    a limiting factor for field water supply). For this strategy, a Proportional-Integral
    (PI) controller was used to control the ponding water level within the fields
    (Ang et al., 2005). However, the decentralized control system based on PI regulators
    suffers from three main drawbacks. First, each control system tries to achieve
    its goal independently of the others, which would be plausible under conditions
    of dynamic decoupling and unlimited water availability, while in reality the water
    availability in input to the farm could be reduced as a results of upstream regulations
    controls or water scarcity. Secondly, the adoption of anti-wind-up algorithms
    makes it possible to manage the return from saturation conditions of the control
    variables, but it is obviously not able to predict or avoid them. Finally, the
    decentralized controllers act on the error, i.e. the consequence of any disturbances,
    only after these disturbances have produced their effect, which does not allow,
    for example, to exploit perturbation forecast systems and thus anticipate the
    control action. To overcome the above drawbacks an advanced centralized control
    strategy was implemented. For this strategy, the Non-linear Model Predictive Control
    (NMPC) was used (Blanco et al., 2010), since it is suitable to deal with nonlinear
    systems with slow dynamics such as represented by the management of rice irrigation
    during flooding period (Ding et al., 2018). NMPC is a control strategy based on
    the sequential, online resolution of multiple open-loop optimal control problems
    defined over a finite, receding time horizon (Bertsekas, 2005). At each time step,
    the resolution of an NMPC problem yields a sequence of optimal control actions
    (i.e., gate openings) over the future horizon, given a predicted trajectory of
    the disturbances over the same horizon. The optimization is generally formulated
    considering a single objective; when the problem involves multiple objectives
    (e.g., water supply, hydropower production, flood control, environmental protection,
    irrigation, transport, etc.), these are generally aggregated using a scalarization
    function (e.g., weighted combination) or via the lexicographic goal programming
    technique in cases where there is a clear hierarchy of priorities across the objectives
    (e.g., Horváth et al., 2022). The online optimization scheme is reiterated forward
    in time over a receding horizon during the operational life of the system. After
    each optimization, only the control action in the current time step of the optimized
    control sequence is actuated, before reiterating the optimization at the next
    time step. Through this reiteration of the model-based optimization, NMPC determines
    the control law implicitly in a closed-loop form, as it computes the optimal control
    action at each time step t based on the observed state of the system. The flexibility
    to directly use any models available for the systems to be controlled is one of
    the main advantages of this approach, especially for the control of highly nonlinear
    systems, while the flexibility to work with (nonlinear) constraints, either explicit
    physical constraints (e.g. limits of actuators) or legal constraints, is another
    advantage of MPC compared to other control methods. The Supplementary Material
    provides the mathematical details of each control strategy applied to the Cascina
    Ca’ Granda pilot case study. 3.4. Simulation experiments The performances of the
    decentralized and centralized controls, based on Proportional Integral (PI) and
    Model Predictive Control (NMPC) strategies, respectively, were evaluated in terms
    of the system''s adaptive capacity to respond to external requirements or disturbances,
    using three different modelling experiments. The objective of the first experiment
    was to verify the correct operation of the two control systems under standard
    flood management conditions. Specifically, the modelling exercise simulates a
    theoretical situation in which the control system works to change the ponding
    water level in the fields from an initial condition to a new reference one (in
    this example from 4 cm to 5 cm). This is a typical operation that could occur
    when the ponding water level needs to be adjusted during an irrigation season.
    The simulation assumes no external disturbances, such as the presence of rainfall
    events, and a constant nominal flow rate at farm inlet of 200 l/s. The second
    experiment examined the response of the control systems to a reduction in the
    flow rate at the input to the farm. In particular, starting from a standard water
    level within the farm canal and rice plots, the effect of reducing the nominal
    flow rate at farm inlet (200 l/s) to 100 l/s on the ability of both control systems
    to maintain a uniform ponding water level within the blocks is investigated. This
    scenario can happen if water becomes scarce during the agricultural season (dry
    season), or if the water supply changes as a result of gates being maneuvered
    on irrigation district channels upstream of the farm. The response of both control
    systems to an external disturbance derived from a rainfall event was evaluated
    in the third experiment. Specifically, the possibility of taking advantage of
    rainfall forecasts and using them to predict the advance status of water levels
    in farm canals and rice blocks was used to evaluate the adaptive capacity of the
    control systems. Specifically, the selected event occurred in the 2021 agricultural
    season on the case study and consisted of a rainfall volume of about 33 mm and
    duration of 10 h, with a peak of 18 mm. In this case the nominal flow rate was
    maintained at 200 l/s in input to the farm. The potential water conservation of
    the PI and NMPC strategies was also investigated. Specifically, using the decentralized
    strategy (i.e., PI control) as a benchmark, the benefits of adopting centralized
    control (i.e., NMPC) in terms of water conservation were estimated as additional
    information on the performance of a coordinated system of gates. 4. Results 4.1.
    Performance of PI and NMPC under standard conditions of flood management The performance
    in time of both control strategies (i.e. PI and NMPC) under standard conditions
    of flood management are presented in Fig. 5. In particular, the comparison between
    the PI and NMPC approaches was evaluated for (i) the ponding water level in the
    fields, (ii) the opening height of the gates and finally (iii) the water level
    in the farm canal. In general, both control strategies respond effectively to
    bring the system to the new ponding water level configuration (i.e., from 4 cm
    to 5 cm). The new ponding level is reached gradually for both control strategies
    in a similar time horizon (about 10 h), depending on real inertias observed in
    the field system. The objective of increasing the water level in the fields led
    to the initial opening of the gates and their subsequent gradual adjustment. In
    both strategies, because the area of each field is different and therefore the
    flow rate needed to raise the ponding water level in each field is different,
    the initial gate opening height was different for each field. The adjustment of
    the gate opening after the initial moment is managed in a different way by the
    control action for each gate, both for PI and for NMPC. This is due to the need
    to have different flow rates in the input to the fields in order to reach the
    new ponding water level. However, since the opening height of the gates is similar
    at the end of the control action, both strategies can be considered coherent.
    Finally, the increase in the flow rate required to reach the new pond level in
    the fields influenced the water level in the farm canal, which at first quickly
    dropped below its initial height (about 1 m) and then returned to a level suitable
    to meet the water needs of the fields, since the inflow to the farm is not limited.
    In this case, the differences between the two control strategies are particularly
    evident. PI causes the water level in the canal to fall by approximately half
    compared to the initial condition, while the fall in the water level is less pronounced
    with NMPC. The return to the initial state of the water level in the canal takes
    twice as long for PI than for NMPC. Download : Download high-res image (169KB)

    and centralized (NMPC) control strategies on (i) Ponding Water Level (PWL) adjustment,

    in the farm canal (CWL). Scenario 1: standard condition of flood management. The
    effects of both control actions on the ponding water level of the other fields
    and on the other gate opening are presented in Appendix 1. 4.2. Performance of
    PI and NMPC under limited water supply conditions Often the water supply at the
    head of a farm is not constant over time. This can happen when a dry agricultural
    season is expected. Fig. 6 shows for the Field 1 the performance of PI and NMPC
    control actions on ponding water level and gate opening when the nominal inflow
    rate to the farm canal was rapidly reduced from 200 l/s to 100 l/s. The ponding
    water level in the field decreases as a result of the inflow rate reduction. At
    the end of the simulation time, the levels reached are very similar (2 mm of difference).
    The PI control action responds to the falling of ponding water level in the field
    by opening the gate to draw as much water as possible from the farm canal. The
    gate changes its opening height up to the maximum allowed (i.e. 1), since the
    gate operates independently of the others and responds only to the needs of its
    own field. The gate takes about 20 h to saturate. In the other fields and gates,
    similar behaviour was observed. The general effect of this action is to remove
    almost all the water from the canal, which is reduced to a water level of a few
    centimetres. It follows that, the new inflow rate (i.e. 100 l/sec) is not sufficient
    to maintain the reference water level inside the fields (i.e. 5 cm). As a result,
    at the end of the control action, the ponding water level was lower than the reference
    threshold. Download : Download high-res image (168KB) Download : Download full-size

    strategies on (i) Ponding Water Level (PWL) adjustment, (ii) gate opening height
    and (iii) water level in the farm canal (CWL). Scenario 2: limited water supply.
    The ponding water level inside Field 1 (and thus for the other fields as well)
    was also lower than the reference threshold at the end of the NMPC control action.
    However, the NMPC uses a completely different strategy to reach this new configuration.
    The gate does not only look at the state of its own field, but also at the state
    of the other gates and at the farm canal. This integrated approach ensures that
    the gate does not saturate when it opens (i.e. it never reaches the maximum opening
    height) and the water level in the farm canal is not drastically depleted (as
    properly shown in Fig. 6). Furthermore, the gate opening equilibrium was achieved
    in about half time with respect to the PI control. The effects of both control
    actions on the ponding water level of the other fields and on the other gate opening
    are presented in Appendix 2. A positive feature of the NMPC strategy is that it
    allows for compensation of flood conditions among fields even when ponding water
    levels cannot be maintained at the target level for the reduced inflow rate in
    input to the farm. This is clearly shown in Fig. 7, which compares the effects
    of PI and NMPC approach on the ponding water level within the fields. A decentralized
    control action approach results in different ponding water levels within the fields,
    while a centralized control action approach makes the ponding water level between
    the fields uniform (although lower than the target water level). Download : Download

    Water Level (PWL) adjustment with respect to the target (PWL target), and (ii)
    gate opening height of all fields (Field 1–4)and gates (Gate 1–4). Scenario 2:
    limited water supply. It is interesting that a uniform PI controller response
    corresponds to a varying ponding water level between the fields. In fact, every
    gate responding to a field''s request for water opens and gets saturated (Fig.
    7). Conversely, a tailored control action by the NMPC system for each gate results
    in a uniform ponding water level between the fields. In this case, the opening
    height of each gate is related to the water demand of the field, which in this
    case study strictly depends by the field area. In fact, the opening height of
    gate 4 (which serves Field 4 - of about 13 ha in size) at the end of the control
    action is about three times greater than the opening height of gate 2 (which serves
    Field 2 - of about 4 ha in size) and two times greater than the opening height
    of gate 3 (which serves Field 3 - of about 6 ha in size). In the NMPC strategy,
    the gates are not saturated (i.e., the gates do not reach their maximum opening
    height), but are opened only to the extent necessary to meet the predictive water
    request. 4.3. Performance of the PI and NMPC in the presence of an instantaneous
    water supply The effect on ponding water level and gate operations of the decentralized
    (i.e. PI) and centralized (i.e. NMPC) strategies stressed by an instantaneous
    water supply disturbance to the farm generated by a rainfall event is presented
    in Fig. 8 for the Field 1 and Gate 1. The PI approach works only when the precipitation
    starts. In particular, when rainfall begins, the gate begins to close until the
    opening height is equal to zero (i.e. gate completely closed) when rainfall has
    reached the peak. The ponding water level in the field increased up to 7 cm (i.e.
    2 cm above the reference target), with a peak around the moment of maximum rainfall
    intensity. At the end of rainfall event the ponding water level within the field
    return to the target value. The same behaviour was observed in the other fields
    and gates as reported Appendix 3. The PI strategy reproduces the behaviour of
    a farmer and the effect it has on the water level in the fields when it rains.
    In fact, the farmer operates on the gates only when he sees that the water level
    in the fields is changing. This difficulty in adapting the system before the rain
    starts leads to a significant perturbation in the ponding water level inside the
    fields, as a consequence of the inertia that a real system composed of large fields
    has in recovering the initial configuration after a disturbance. On the contrary,
    the NMPC approach tries to prevent the additional volume of water supplied to
    the fields before the rainfall event, modifying the state of the system so that
    it can absorb the disturbance without excessive change in the ponding water level.
    Specifically, the forecasting model that constitutes the NMPC works by closing
    the gates in anticipation of the onset of rain (about 5 h on average before the
    rain, but the beginning of the gate closing action can vary between fields). The
    ponding water level drops a few centimetres below the target and then rises when
    it rains. However, the increase of ponding water level is less than about 20%

    (Field 1–4). Scenario 3: presence of an instantaneous water supply as a result
    of rainfall event. By integrating the water flows entering each field over time
    of rainfall event, the potential water conservation operated by NMPC with respect
    to the PI action has been calculated. Specifically, the NMPC results in 11% on
    average of water conservation with respect to PI strategy. This conservation is
    due to the anticipation of closing the gates in preparation for the rain event.
    The NMPC control action was further stressed by assuming an hour advance or delay
    in the rainfall event. This simulation was used to investigate the response of
    the NMPC strategy when potential errors in the weather forecasts occur. The results
    of these two additional simulations are presented in Fig. 11, where the effects
    of NMPC strategy on ponding water levels and gate opening heights are shown for
    all fields and gates. The advance of the rainfall event has no significant effect
    on the control action, except for the anticipation of the closure of the gates.
    Conversely, the delay of the rainfall event leads to a temporary opening of the
    gates due to the fact that in the window of the prediction horizon (i.e. 15 h
    - see Supplementary Material) the forecast of the rainfall evolution pattern was
    not fully included. In fact, the model is not able to predict what will happen
    after the prediction horizon, so since the ponding water level decreased excessively,
    the control action ordered the opening of gates. However, when the rainfall increase
    was detected, the controller sent a signal to close the gates again. Download

    challenges for the future of sustainable rice irrigation is to cope with climate
    change and adapt to fluctuations in freshwater availability. Without improvements
    in irrigation management (data-driven modelling and management of irrigation interventions,
    flexible and predictive gate operation, real-time flow control, etc.), traditional
    rice irrigation practices of flood irrigation may be abandoned in favour of other
    less water-intensive irrigation techniques (Lampayan et al., 2015). Although the
    modelling framework presented in this paper offers the possibility to safeguard
    the traditional method of rice irrigation (i.e. flood irrigation), in practice,
    the transition to a new irrigation technique does not affect the ability to use
    the automatic technologies and control approaches presented in this paper. The
    ability to well regulate the ponding water level within rice fields during the
    season has potential water saving and environmental benefits. In the case of the
    rice water balance (see Supplementary Material), it shows a proportional relationship
    between ponding water level and percolation flux (Toung et al., 1994). This relationship
    illustrates how a good control of the ponding water level within the fields can
    provide direct control of hydrological losses at field/farm scale by minimising
    the latter. This could be seen as an important achievement of the coordinated
    control approach, as hydrological losses are beyond the control of the farmer.
    Finally, previous studies have shown that continuous submergence and good control
    of ponding water levels during the rice growing season are more effective in controlling
    weeds, reducing herbicide use and improving the environmental sustainability of
    flooding practices. (Aravinth et al., 2023). Therefore, the NMPC could enable
    this weed control at farm level more efficiently than the PI approach, as shown
    in scenario 2, where the centralised control of the gates attempts to equalise
    the ponding water level within the fields. Given these examples, the introduction
    of automatic control into current flooding management practice could increase
    the sustainability of traditional rice irrigation. This would require the installation
    of a new hydraulic infrastructure (automatic gates) to replace the manual one,
    capable of accepting control software. The costs of this modernisation are relevant
    but sustainable, as already shown by Masseroni et al. (2018), and will become
    even more so as the cost of water increases. Concerning the modelling framework
    presented in this work, it has some simplifications, which can be more detailed
    if the Modelica library would really be included in the gate control software
    of the pilot farm. One of them is the choice of a single percolation coefficient
    for the fields. In our results, the differences in the control effect between
    the fields are exclusively due to the different field size, while specific characteristic
    of each field could be included in the water balance model equations. In this
    respect, it must be pointed out that the OpenModelica generated Functional Mock-up
    Unit (FMU) can already be used to calibrate uncertain model parameters (i.e. percolation
    coefficients), through Python optimization routines, thus paving the way to adaptive
    NMPC, while the use of the aforementioned FMU for the solution of the optimal
    control problem, also based on (open source) Python functions, is currently being
    studied. Additionally, predictions are the key feature for an intelligent control
    action achieved by NMPC strategy. In our modelling experiments, only rainfall
    forecasts are included in the NMPC, while better control performance could be
    obtained if temperature forecasts (which affect crop development) were included
    in the centralized control strategy. For this purpose, the correct choice of the
    prediction horizon can help to avoid unexpected opening and closing of the gates
    during their operation, increasing water conservation. Long-term forecasts of
    biophysical variables could also be included in the model. However, this could
    increase both the uncertainty in the reliability and robustness of the control
    action and the computational time. Therefore, it would be optimal to combine the
    control action with the farmer''s experience. The latter could, for example, help
    decide which fields should maintain the target ponding water level in case of
    water shortage, instead of having a uniform ponding water level between fields
    but below the threshold. Lastly, the ponding water level target could be variable
    during the agricultural season, following the flooding best practices for the
    specific rice cultivar or crop phenological stages, or to practice alternate wetting
    drying flood management (Rejesus et al., 2011, Mayer et al., 2019, Gilardi et
    al., 2023). 6. Conclusion This paper presents an advanced control technique for
    precision flood irrigation in paddy rice farms. The proposed technique has been
    tested on a real case study through a series of simulation experiments in the
    Modelica environment and is based on a nonlinear model predictive control strategy.
    This strategy has been compared with that obtained by a proportional-integral
    control action, which roughly reproduces the traditional farmer gate operations.
    Simulation reveals that the nonlinear model predictive control strategy can accurately
    control ponding water level within the fields both under standard conditions of
    flood management and under limited or instantaneous water supplies to the farm.
    Furthermore, its application to a real rainfall event showed that nonlinear model
    predictive control has the potential to significantly reduce water consumption
    compared to proportional-integral control. Therefore, the nonlinear model predictive
    control strategy appears to be a viable solution for improving the performance
    of flood irrigation in paddy rice farms, although some slight improvements in
    the modelling algorithm should still be made before implementing this technique
    in a real system of sluice gates. Implementing the nonlinear model predictive
    control strategy in the gate management software and testing its operation under
    different agricultural seasons will be the next step. Declaration of Competing

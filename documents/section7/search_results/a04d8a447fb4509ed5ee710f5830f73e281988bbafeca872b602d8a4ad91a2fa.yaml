    Get rights and content Highlights • First literature review paper of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. • Four applications of blockchain
    technology are identified. • Six challenges for applying blockchain technology
    are identified. • Research gaps and future research directions are proposed. Abstract
    Agri-food value chain is an area of significant importance because of providing
    sustainable, affordable, safety and sufficient food, feed, fibre and fuel to consumers,
    it is critical to ensure these value chains running smoothly and successfully
    by applying advanced internet technologies. Blockchain technology is a new digital
    technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0 to ensuring data integrity
    and preventing tampering and single point failure through offering fault-tolerance,
    immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability of the stored transaction
    records to all agri-food value chain partners. This paper used systematic literature
    network analysis to review the state-of-the-art blockchain technology including
    its recent advances, main applications in agri-food value chain and challenges
    from a holistic perspective. The findings suggest that blockchain technology together
    with advanced information and communication technology and internet of things
    have been adopted for the improvement of agri-food value chain management in four
    main aspects: traceability, information security, manufacturing and sustainable
    water management. Six challenges have been identified including storage capacity
    and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost and regulation problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. Based on the critical analysis of literature,
    research gaps and future research directions are proposed in this paper regarding
    the applications and challenges of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management. This study makes contributions to the extant literature in the field
    of agri-food value chain management by discovering the potential of blockchain
    technology and its implications for agri-food value chain performance improvements
    such as food safety, food quality and food traceability. Previous article in issue

    1. Introduction The agri-food value chain is a complex system responsible for
    the circulation of agri-food products from the initial stage of production to
    the final stage of consumption. In the circulation process, value chain members
    play a critical role in meeting the consumers’ demand for agri-food products and
    maintaining the quality and safety of products [1]. Simultaneously, with the rapid
    development of internet technologies in the value chain area, a large number of
    emerging technologies such as advanced information and communication technology
    (ICT) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have been applied to the agri-food value
    chain [46]. However, almost all the systems applied to the agri-food value chain
    are centralised, monopolistic, asymmetric and opaque, and may result in serious
    trust problem. Therefore, consumers’ confidence towards food safety has been broken
    after a series of food safety risk incidents and scandals over the last decades
    [46], such as mad cow disease, horsemeat scandal [2], toxic milk powder, genetically
    modified food and trench oil [3]. Consequently, detailed information of agri-food
    products from farm to fork is increasingly requested by consumers. Furthermore,
    how to build fault-tolerance, immutability, trust, transparency and full traceability
    of agri-food value chain [4], regulations and customers’ expectations towards
    food quality and food safety [5], the complexity of agri-food value chain [6],
    and the current applications of technologies and their potential issues/pitfalls
    [7] have attracted increasing attention from academics and practitioners. A potential
    solution to alleviate the above issues and concerns is usage of blockchain technology,
    which is a new digital technological approach underpinned by the Industry 4.0
    to ensuring data integrity and preventing tampering and any single point failure.
    Four special elements - decentralised, immutable, consensus, and democratic that
    are unique to blockchain networks that make the technology more attractive in
    promoting trust and transparency in the agri-food value chain fraught with errors,
    duplication and redundancies [68]. Crosby et al. [8] underlines that blockchain
    is essentially a distributed database system that records transactional data or
    other digital events that have been executed and shared among value chain participants.
    It enables agri-food value chain participants to establish a decentralized consensus
    on the sequence of events and the current status of the transaction [9]. Blockchain
    technology uses a combination of different technologies that have been applied
    in computer science such as public/private key cryptography, cryptographic hash
    functions and database technologies [10], which provides an innovative solution
    to achieve food traceability, transparency, safety and security [11]. Two prominent
    benefits of blockchain technology are that it provides a permanent transaction
    records which are grouped into individual blocks and cannot be tampered with;
    and it can replace those traditional paper tracking systems and manual monitoring
    systems, so as to prevent the traditional way of the value chain from suffering
    the inaccurate impact [39]. The academic interest in investigating the application
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management has been progressively
    expanded, with a rapid increase in the contributions of academic experts covering
    this aspect [[11], [12], [13],38]. Moreover, blockchain technology used in the
    agri-food value chain seems to be a promising research stream for future research,
    especially in the era of Industry 4.0 [14,83]. However, only a limited number
    of studies analyse the current applications and future research directions of
    blockchain technology in different industries. We found three reviews concerned
    with the blockchain technology and its impact on the social and economy, drawn
    up, respectively, by Anascavage and Davis [15], who identified 16 areas that blockchain
    technology could be applied to, including food security; Tama et al. [16] acknowledge
    four areas that blockchain technology has been applied to and considers that blockchain
    technology plays an important role in guaranteeing the traceability of the agri-food
    value chain; and finally Yli-Huumo et al. [17] conducted a systematic literature
    review (SLR) on current research of blockchain technology including security,
    wasted resources, usability and privacy. These reviews are, however, relatively
    general, and given the current research and applications of blockchain technology,
    none of the reviews addresses the application of the blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management. Therefore, there is a lack of up-to-date
    reviews that offer a comprehensive overview of the main issues related to current
    applications, challenges and future research directions of the blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain management. Considering the above arguments, the
    main objective of this study is to fill this gap by offering a systematic literature
    network analysis (SLNA) of the recent contributions of blockchain technology in
    the agri-food value chain management, highlighting the research that has been
    developed over time, and identifying the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    to the agri-food value chain management, and proposing the most promising research
    directions for the future. The remainder of this paper is organised as follows.
    The methodology adopted in this paper is described in Section 2, while the application
    of the research methodology to the context under study is provided in Section
    3. Then, the current applications of blockchain technology in the agri-food value
    chain management are presented in Section 4 followed by the challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain that are presented in Section
    5. The research gaps and proposed future research directions are presented in
    Section 6. Finally, conclusions and research limitations are drawn in Section
    7. 2. Research methodology: systematic literature network analysis Systematic
    literature network analysis (SLNA) is constituted with two methods: systematic
    literature review (SLR) and citation network analysis (CNA). The purpose of integrating
    these two existing methodologies (SLR and CNA) is to maximize the advantages related
    to each of them: SLR provides a reproducible and rigorous method that is applied
    in this study to select the most relevant and high-quality studies from previous
    literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through
    synthesising of the literatures, the state-of-the-art of applications and the
    challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    will be revealed. Simultaneously, why blockchain technology matters in agri-food
    value chain management is also disclosed. CNA offers an evidence-based approach
    to identifying the most-cited studies from the selected databases, revealing the
    contributions on blockchain technology theory building in the agri-food value
    chain management as well as suggesting future research directions that can facilitate
    the application of the blockchain technology to the agri-food value chain management
    [18]. The process of SLNA from the combination of SLR and CNA is shown in Fig.
    A1. 3. Applying the SLNA to the area under study The process of how to apply SLNA
    to the area of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management is described
    in the following five sub-sections. 3.1. Formulating the research questions The
    first stage of conducting SLNA is to formulate research questions. It is important
    to have well-specified, informative and clearly formulated research questions
    to avoid bias, error and ambiguity [19]. Therefore, the research questions were
    formulated based on the following process: (1) Brainstorming all types of applications
    of blockchain technology that can be used in agri-food value chain management;
    (2) Consulting with three experts in academia and agri-food industry to evaluate
    whether it is possible to apply the blockchain technology in these areas; (3)
    Examining possible applications of blockchain technology that can be applied to
    the agri-food value chain management. Based on the above processes and principles,
    the following research questions were formulated: RQ1. What are the main applications
    of blockchain technology that have been developed in agri-food value chain management?
    RQ2. What are the key challenges for applying blockchain technology to agri-food
    value chain management? RQ3. What are the research gaps and future research directions
    for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain management? 3.2. Locating
    study Denyer and Tranfield [20] proposed that a comprehensive list of core contributions
    is necessary to answer the review questions by searching the most relevant and
    high-quality studies. Eight databases were selected for literature search, including
    ScienceDirect, Web of Science, Scopus, Taylor & Francis Online, Wiley Online Library,
    Emerald, Google Scholar and IEEE Xplore. The rationale for selecting these databases
    is that they include the top science and technology journals, conference proceedings
    and business research journals. Consistent with other SLR papers in blockchain
    technology (e.g. [17,21,22]), the identified keywords were used as the search
    criteria in our review. Since the aim of this research is to identify the main
    issues relating to the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management, a combination of “blockchain” and “agri-food value chain management”,
    with all the related terms were used for searching the title, keywords and abstract
    in the selected electronic academic databases. These keywords were combined later
    through Boolean connectors to constitute different search strings to be applied
    in the databases. Furthermore, consultation with various practitioners and academics
    in the relevant field was conducted to confirm whether search strings were also
    necessary. Finally, a total of 45 search strings were identified by the authors
    to be included in the search process. A full list of search strings is shown in
    Table 1. Table 1. Search strings for databases search. Keywords “blockchain”,
    “information security”, “information transparency”, “agriculture”, “agricultural”,

    OR “food value chain management” OR “agriculture value chain management” OR “agri-food
    value chain management” OR “agriculture trade”) 3.3. Study selection and evaluation
    As a very recent and new research area, as discussed earlier, the term of blockchain
    technology was first coined in 2008 [16]. In fact, the idea of blockchain technology
    was hardly discussed before 2008. Therefore, we use the year 2008 as the starting
    point to search relevant publications. Further, to find more relevant and important
    studies to be included in the analysis, various reference types such as journal
    papers, conference papers and book chapters were included in the systematic review.
    Simultaneously, the identification of key articles and book chapters that provide
    background information on blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    were found from different sources, including colleagues working in the same field.
    The initial search with the specified keywords and open access in the selected
    eight databases from 2008 to 2018 resulted in a preliminary sample of 632 contributions.
    Afterwards, each study was checked by three authors by carefully analysing the
    abstracts, introductions and conclusions to reduce any subjective bias and enhance
    validity. Moreover, relevant book chapters and other publications that were not
    covered by the databases were then identified through carefully searching the
    references used in the previous literature (e.g. [17,21,22]). The review of the
    work of influential authors in the field of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain management was also carried out by the same three authors. A series
    of inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to include/exclude papers (Table
    2), which were built through a brainstorming session among these three authors.
    Studies that do not meet the inclusion criteria or duplicates or non-relevant
    studies were eliminated. As a result, 62 studies were finally selected. Table
    2. Criteria for inclusion or exclusion studies. Inclusion criteria Rationale Articles
    were published in peer-reviewed journals, conference proceedings and book chapters
    in English Peer-reviewed journals, conference papers and book chapters are considered
    to have better quality than non-peer-reviewed articles Articles were published
    between 2008 and 2018 The year 2008 was selected as the starting point as the
    term blockchain was coined in 2008 [16] The selected articles contain at least
    one keyword in their title or abstract Abstract or title focusing on the applications
    of blockchain technology was selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining
    abstract, introduction and conclusion The remaining abstract, introduction and
    conclusion focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain were selected Judge relevance by fully reading all remaining articles
    Articles focusing on the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain were selected All selected 62 studies were read entirely by the three authors
    independently. By cross-referencing all the citations and references and talking
    with experts in the experts from academia and the agri-food industry, nine additional
    studies were identified and added, resulting in a total of 71 academic peer-reviewed
    journal papers, conference papers and book chapters to be included in the analysis.
    The search and selection process is presented in Fig. A2. 3.4. Citation network
    analysis (CNA) CNA is an effective and efficient way to reveal the articles that
    represent the basis of the field and to identify which articles were used by many
    other authors for the development of their contributions [18]. The citation data
    (author, title, year, cited reference, source, time cited etc.) were collected
    from the Web of Science Core collection. Then, the software Gephi was used to
    build a citation network among the selected studies. Gephi is the leading visualization
    and exploration software for all graphs and networks, which can be applied to
    six main areas such as exploratory data analysis, link analysis, social network
    analysis, biological network analysis, and poster creation [23]. The rationale
    for this choice is that Gephi can provide large information handling capacity,
    friendly graphical user interface and high-quality output formats [24]. As shown
    in Fig. 1, a network consisting of 71 nodes was constructed. It comprises 47 connected
    components and 24 isolated components. Download : Download high-res image (822KB)

    the Fig. 1, we can see that the connected components were divided into seven clusters
    according to their citation information. For example, the orange cluster summarized
    the opportunities that blockchain technology could be applied in agri-food value
    chain management such as blockchain combined with IoT to be used in agri-food
    value chain, as well as used in agri-food value chain traceability. It is important
    to note that most of the papers included in this cluster were literature review
    papers [17,25,26]. A detailed analysis of benefits, opportunities and challenges
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT were discussed in the cluster of
    black. There were four clusters (Light green, purple, red and blue) mainly discussed
    how to use blockchain technology to increase the agri-food value chain traceability
    and manufacturing conceptually and empirically. Simultaneously, different traceability
    models were proposed and tested. Finally, the green cluster represents how blockchain
    along with other technologies such as Big Data, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and
    Internet of Things served as an engine of the 4th industrial revolution, and how
    these technologies can revolutionize the current agri-food value chain management
    [27,28]. The detailed information of each cluster is shown in Table 3. Table 3.

    has gained increasing attention from researchers and practitioners, in 2016 Yli-Huumo
    et al. [17] proposed an SLR on blockchain technology by highlighting current research
    topics, challenges and future research directions from a technological perspective.
    Their research results indicate four research gaps existing in the current study:
    (1) Lack of high-quality journal papers, most of the papers are published in conferences,
    symposiums and workshops; (2) The majority of current research is conducted in
    Bitcoin environment, rather than in other blockchain environments; (3) Lack of
    research on usability; (4) No research on the challenges for applying blockchain
    technology, such as latency, throughput and bandwidth. Following Yli-Huumo et
    al. [17], a series of research articles attempt to fill the research gaps. Tian
    [38] and Faye [39] have explored the field of blockchain technology in the context
    of the agri-food value chain from a traceability perspective. The issue addressed
    is how to embed blockchain technology in the current traceability system to increase
    the transparency and security of the agri-food value chain. With the evolution
    of research in the blockchain-based traceability system, some researchers tried
    to examine some generic models for facilitating the development of blockchain-based
    traceability system, such as the “TRADE” model proposed by Maouchi et al. [36].
    Concerns about integrating blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain
    need to be addressed from a single company perspective firstly, therefore, Hamida
    et al. [40] provided a detailed analysis on enterprise blockchains of its applications,
    challenges and opportunities. It is interesting to note that within these studies,
    the paper An agri-food supply chain traceability system for China based on RFID
    & blockchain technology proposed by Tian [38] is the most frequently cited paper,
    which has been cited 16 times by other authors among the selected papers (Table
    4). At the current stage of research in blockchain technology for traceability,
    most researchers (e.g. [[38], [39], [40]]) considered blockchain technology as
    a competitive advantage for agriculture value chain participants to gain trust
    from customers. Finally, most of these articles focus on addressing blockchain-based
    traceability system from the perspective of conceptual development. Table 4. Most

    of research examines how to combine blockchain technology with the IoT that can
    be applied in agri-food value chain management. Christidis and Devetsikiotis [41]
    noted that the combination of blockchain technology with IoT would allow agri-food
    value chain participants to get automated time-consuming workflows in a new and
    unique way, as well as to reduce significant costs in the process. Following Christidis
    and Devetsikiotis [41], many researchers have tried to contribute the theory-building
    of integrating blockchain technology with IoT from different perspectives. Hammi
    et al. [49] explored how to improve trust relationship among agri-food value chain
    members by designing a blockchain-IoT application. Reyna et al. [50] investigated
    how blockchain technology could potentially improve the IoT. Finally, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed a blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT to
    enable grape value chain. The research trends on blockchain-based IoT has been
    from generally discussing the challenges and opportunities for combining blockchain
    technology with IoT to how to design a blockchain-based IoT system for solving
    the trust issues among agri-food value chain members, which facilitate to build
    a distributed peer-to-peer systems to interact with agri-food value chain participants
    in a trust and auditable manner. The trends towards stricter rules on food safety
    and food quality leads some researchers to explore potential applications of blockchain
    technology in other fields of agri-food value chain management, such as how to
    apply blockchain technology in food manufacturing [43] and how to use blockchain
    technology to increase the water sustainability [59]. Regarding the performance
    of applying blockchain technology in the agri-food value chain management, just
    a few papers measure the performance from the perspective of reducing tracking
    time to improve the traceability [4] and increasing the efficiency of the traceability
    in the agri-food value chain [13]. Simultaneously, several literature review papers
    investigated how blockchain technology has been applied in different industries
    such as agri-food industry, financial service and healthcare [8,16]. They provide
    insights on the development of blockchain technology in different industries and
    facilitate researchers to investigate how to transfer the knowledge from theory
    to practice. 3.5. Thematic analysis Braun and Clarke [51] stated that “thematic
    analysis is a method for identifying, analysing and reporting patterns (themes)
    within data, which provides core skills that will be useful for conducting many
    other forms of qualitative analysis”. Holloway and Todres [52] underlined that
    thematic analysis can be seen as a foundational approach for qualitative analysis.
    In this paper, thematic analysis was used to allow blockchain themes being generated
    by six phases of analysis: reading the whole paper collected from SLR, generating
    initial codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, defining and naming themes,
    and finally presenting the results. Following the process of thematic analysis,
    we divided the literature of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management
    based on the following themes: (1) current applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management; (2) the challenges for applying the blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. The detailed results from thematic
    analysis are presented in Section 4. Tama et al. [16] conducted a literature review
    on the blockchain technology and its current applications, where the majority
    of literature was concerned with the blockchain technology theory building and
    conceptual development. However, the findings in our study show that the trend
    has been gradually shifted from theory building trying to use blockchain technology
    in practice. Although the number of studies on how blockchain technology can be
    used in agri-food value chain management is increasing, there are a limited number
    of studies on how blockchain technology can be executed. 4. Current applications
    of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management The first application
    of the blockchain technology was Bitcoin – a peer-to-peer electronic cash system
    [53]. Then, blockchain technology evolved towards smart contracts with the ability
    to provide transparency and trust to the system [41]. A smart contract is a kind
    of computer program that stores on the blockchain and executes by all consensus
    nodes in the network. It can translate contractual clauses into code and store
    them into the storage file, and operate them automatically and independently in
    a prescribed manner based on the data that was included in the triggering transaction
    [54]. Through operating the smart contracts, the need for trusted intermediaries
    between partners can be minimized and the occurrence of malicious or accidental
    exceptions can be reduced. Thus, blockchain technology has been generalized and
    applied in different domains such as finance [55], smart city [56], healthcare
    [57] and agri-food value chain [43]. However, as reviewed by Yli-Huumo et al.
    [17], more than 80% of the academic papers on blockchain technology focused on
    the Bitcoin system, while less than 20% deal with other blockchain applications.
    Although it is a relatively new technology, blockchain is rapidly advancing and
    developing. Lucena et al. [58] stated that there was a huge opportunity for blockchain
    applications to global trade. Blockchain market is estimated to grow from 210.2
    million USD to 2312.5 million USD in the period from 2016 to 2021 based on the
    Global Opportunity Report [90]. Due to its potential increase in the global market,
    it is expected that blockchain technology will play a critical role in facilitating
    future industry development and revolution. However, Poberezhna [59] argued that
    the key challenge for blockchain was to be considered as a simply disruptive technology,
    rather than as an innovative integrative solution that could provide a value proposition
    across a number of business process. In the following four sub-sections, we analyse
    the literature of the applications of blockchain technology in agri-food value
    chain management by classifying them in four distinctive themes: traceability,
    information security, manufacturing and sustainable water management. 4.1. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability According to Murki
    [60], different value chains need to embed blockchain technology in the current
    traceability system to create more agile value chains and closer customer relationship.
    Tse et al. [11] hold a similar view that the application of blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain may have been the optimal choice to fulfil the requirements
    of supervision and adaption of the fast-growing food market. More specifically,
    Kumar and Mallick [61] construe that blockchain technology has wider applications
    in agri-food value chain such as food delivery and shipping data records, food
    online ordering and transaction data, and food quality assurance data. To integrate
    blockchain technology in the existing traceability system of agri-food value chain,
    many researchers have tried to explore the options from different perspectives.
    Tian [38] proposed an agri-food value chain traceability system based on RFID
    (Radio-Frequency IDentification) and blockchain technology for helping Chinese
    agri-food markets to enhance their food safety and food quality during the logistics
    process. In their proposed traceability system, RFID was used for acquiring and
    sharing data in the agri-food value chain, meanwhile, blockchain technology was
    used for guaranteeing the data shared and published in this traceability system
    is reliable and authentic. However, some researchers argue that RFID technology
    and blockchain based traceability system has some defects in solving the counterfeit
    issues. For example, RFID tags can be cloned which can cause counterfeit parts
    to be circulated in the agri-food value chain [62]. To overcome the drawbacks
    of RFID, Boehm et al. [37] proposed an updated traceability system using blockchain
    technology combined with Near Field Communication (NFC) and verified users. In
    their proposed traceability system, users must provide valid user credentials
    if they want to update a product’s history on the blockchain. Thus, various changes
    of an agri-food product can be reported, and the capabilities of other members
    can be restricted at the same time. Therefore, holistic tracking agri-food products
    with higher transparency and security can be achieved. Faye [39] underlined that
    the application of blockchain technology in agri-food industry would foster more
    transparency and thus customers’ confidence towards agri-food products would be
    re-established. Although blockchain technology has great potential for revolutionizing
    current agri-food value chain traceability systems, it still has some inherent
    defects such as scalability that needs to be tackled, especially when we face
    mass data in the real world. Recent innovations in blockchain, such as scaling
    would change this working manner that requires every computer in the blockchain
    to process every transaction [63]. Croman et al. [64] argued that a scaled blockchain
    could accelerate the transaction process, without sacrificing high security, by
    determining the optimal number of computers to validate each transaction and divide
    work efficiently. Therefore, Tian [46] investigated a value chain traceability
    system based on HACCP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point), blockchain
    technology and IoT. In their proposed new decentralized traceability system, HACCP
    was used to prevent food risk occurrences, and IoT combined with blockchain technology
    was used to continuously deliver massive real-time food-related information to
    all value chain partners in an effective, safe and efficient manner. Then, a case
    testing experiment was used to check whether the system was feasible or not. The
    research results indicate that food safety, value chain efficiency and transparency
    have been effectively improved. Badzar [65] emphasizes that openness and unchangeable
    attributes of blockchain ensure high transparency, stability and reliability of
    agri-food value chain, as well as provide liquidity, more accurate record-keeping
    and high transparency of ownership [66]. To have deep understanding of knowledge
    on how blockchain technology can be used to enhance agri-food business, Rabah
    [28] conducted a review on the applications of big data and blockchain technology
    in the agri-food industry. Their research results reveal that blockchain technology
    played a critical role in creating secure and transparent ledger that was available
    to all the involved participants within the agri-food value chain including the
    producers, manufacturers, logistics service providers, wholesalers, retailers
    and regulators. They provide insights into the effects of blockchain technology
    on the current traceability system, and facilitate the development of blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain management. Finally, Biswas et al. [67]
    propose a blockchain based wine value chain traceability system where every transaction
    is recorded as a block in the chain and is visible to relevant value chain members
    such as the grape grower, wine producer, bulk distributor, transit cellar, filler/packer,
    finished goods distributor, wholesaler and retailer entity. One of the most important
    features of their proposed system is that anyone can trace the purchase history
    of the wine by inputting the product ID in the system. However, their work just
    examines an example, rather than a practical application of blockchain technology
    in the wine value chain. Maouchi et al. [36] argue that although various approaches
    have been proposed to create a decentralized traceability system for agri-food
    value chain, these works do not state the feasibility of their work and their
    application for the agri-food value chain. Due to the great potential benefits
    of applying blockchain technology to agri-food value chain traceability system,
    several agricultural industry enterprises around the world have evaluated the
    effect of blockchain technology. For example, Walmart plans to invest $25 million
    over five years from 2017 to establish one food safety collaboration centre in
    Beijing to build a completely new food traceability system with blockchain technology.
    Their mango blockchain solution pilots reduced the time for tracking mango origins
    from seven days to 2.2 s, thus, more transparency and greater efficiency have
    been achieved in Walmart’s food value chain. Then, a pork value chain traceability
    system combined with barcode has been built based on the mango blockchain solutions
    [13]. Yiannas [68] states that the biggest advantage of this system is that it
    allows any trusted users to verify the traceability and authenticity of the product
    at any point of the pork value chain. Despite the increasing emphasis on applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain traceability system, recent studies
    conducted by Kshetri [69] show that just a few researchers have begun to systematically
    assess the effects of blockchain technology on current agri-food value chain traceability
    system. Caro et al. [4] introduced an AgriBlockIoT traceability system for agri-food
    value chain management. It was constituted with three main components, a REST
    Application Interface with the responsibilities to integrate with the existing
    software system, a controller equipped with the abilities to query and convert
    the data records stored in the blockchain, and blockchain involved with smart
    contracts as a gateway to the blockchain itself. It is important to note that
    smart contracts can fire autonomously; hence creating records whenever anomalies
    are detected. Then, two different implementations, namely Ethereum and Hyperledger
    Sawtooth were used to do the performance analysis of traceability. Their research
    results indicate that Hyperledger Sawtooth has better performances than the Ethereum
    counterpart and may be more suitable for IoT devices, because Etherum is quite
    CPU-intensive. Based on the case study for grain quality assurance tracking, Lucena
    [58] finds out that quality measurement throughout the transportation for grains
    along the value chain is always accompanied with fraud, poor monitoring and delay
    to final destinations. Their findings indicate that using blockchain technology
    in the grain value chain traceability system is the best way at present to reduce
    disputes among business partners and information asymmetries. Finally, Kumar and
    Iyengar [70] demonstrated a blockchain based traceability framework for rice value
    chain management. In their proposed framework, blockchain was used to record all
    related issues happening within the rice value chain and monitor the security
    and quality of rice in the transportation process. It is important to note that
    all members in the rice value chain should register themselves and match their
    unique identities and digital profiles in the blockchain system. The research
    result indicates that the security of rice in the transportation process and the
    efficiency of the rice value chain have been greatly improved. 4.2. Applying blockchain
    technology in the agri-food value chain information security Under the background
    of Industry 4.0 and distributed computing, the characteristics of information
    system in agri-food industry have experienced substantial changes. Blockchain
    technology has inherent benefits such as recording transactions in real-time,
    no intermediary, immutability and distributed ledger, which becomes the first
    choice for agri-food value chain managers to enhance information security [60].
    Tse et al. [11] construed that blockchain was a well worthy technology for helping
    agri-food value chain participants to record and transfer transactions authentically.
    Leng et al. [1] proposed a public blockchain for agricultural value chain system
    along with double-chain architecture. The research results reveal that the proposed
    agricultural business resource blockchain not only can increase the security of
    transaction information and privacy of enterprise information, but also can enhance
    the credibility of the public service platform and facilitate overall increase
    of efficiency across the whole value chain system. Neisse et al. [71] explored
    a blockchain-based approach to achieve data accountability and provenance tracking.
    Their findings indicate that for the dynamic data frequently shared among value
    chain members such as the transaction record in agri-food value chain, which have
    strict scalability and performance requirements, controllers or processors should
    manage a contract that registers all subjects accepting all or part of usage conditions.
    Recently, with the advancement of IoT, machine-to-machine (M2M) connections is
    estimated to increase to 3.9 billion to 2022 [72]. More and more agri-food value
    chain participants are being equipped with interconnected electronic devices and
    protocol suites to increase the connectivity and sophisticated data gathering
    and analytics capabilities [50]. However, most of the IoT solutions are dependent
    on the centralized server-client paradigm, connecting to the cloud servers through
    the Internet [26]. Decentralised architectures such as building a large Peer-to-Peer
    (P2P) Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) may cause privacy and security issues to the
    users [73]. Thus, effective tools to ensure information security need to be supported
    by agri-food value chain participants to meet the requested security requirements.
    Currently, around 50% of agri-food practitioners have been experimenting blockchain
    technology with creating proof-of-concept, and 17% of agri-food practitioners
    have been preparing to deploy and use it in their business [74]. Hammi et al.
    [49] proposed a public blockchain-based approach in which devices can communicate
    with each other in a completely secure and efficient way by creating a secure
    virtual zone. After a series of tests, the research results indicate that the
    blockchain-based system demonstrated high resilience towards attacks. Iansiti
    and Lakhani [42] underlined that blockchain technology could provide secure, irreversible,
    distributed, transparent and accurate information sharing service. After conducting
    research on blockchain-based distributed cloud/fog platform for IoT, Davcev et
    al. [30] proposed that holistically using these blockchain-based ICT technologies
    has a positive effect in increasing the quality of agri-food products. 4.3. Applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food manufacturing In today’s highly competitive
    and knowledge-based economy, managing massive amount of information and services
    is the basic requirement for successful food manufacturers. As the information
    and services are diversified, growing in an accelerating velocity, and highly
    complex, an increase number of food manufacturers have difficulties in acquiring
    and managing them alone. Wang et al. [75] state that it is necessary for food
    manufacturers to work together and sustain their competitiveness. To address this
    issue, some researchers have started integrating blockchain concept into manufacturing
    practices. Li et al. [35] proposed a decentralized framework to manage the knowledge
    and services shared between different enterprises based on the blockchain application
    involved smart contracts and edge computing. In their proposed framework, edge
    computing acted as a foundation for providing distributed network, storage and
    computing capabilities in the manufacturing environment. The smart contracts played
    as interfaces between enterprise and its partners for successfully interact. Thus,
    a signed secure and controllable connection between the enterprise and the partner
    could be built with the transaction record and the status were updated on the
    blockchain. A case study was used to examine the effectiveness of the decentralized
    framework. The case study results indicate that manufacturers can develop scalable
    and flexible businesses at a lower cost, and ultimately the overall quality, efficiency,
    and effectiveness of manufacturing services can be improved. Furthermore, Zhao
    et al. [76], built a model of manufacturing service information based on blockchain
    principle and cloud computing, which theoretically solves the problems of sharing
    and securing the manufacturing resources, recalling the product data and guaranteeing
    the quality of the processing. Finally, Kumar and Mallic [61] reported that blockchain
    technology could be used in various perspectives of manufacturing, such as manufacturing
    management, production data, product warranty information and product assurance.
    Although blockchain technology has been seen as a critical element in the manufacturing
    sector in recent years, the role of blockchain technology for promoting resilience,
    scalability, security and autonomy of manufacturing service has been relatively
    overlooked [14]. 4.4. Applying blockchain technology in sustainable water management
    The agriculture productivity is highly dependent on water resource management.
    How to use water resources effectively and efficiently is crucial for agriculture
    development. To drive the sustainable development of water, it is critical to
    address water scarcity aspects that are deeply interrelated with agri-food development.
    Therefore, Civic Ledger [77] considered to develop a blockchain-enabled peer-to-peer
    trading platform (Water Ledger) that would allow more irrigators to participate
    in the platform that entitles and allocates water securely and transparently,
    further boosting the overall efficiency of water resources. Though creating new
    digital identity for irrigators and digitizing the water assets in agri-food value
    chain will cost a lot of money, Poberezhna [59] argues that blockchain combined
    with smart contracts can potentially help water companies and government bodies
    to access real-time data regarding market shares, consumption patterns and management
    of utility bills of consumers, thus, greater transparency to regulators and auditors
    can be achieved. Their research also indicates that recordkeeping will be significantly
    reduced when the blockchain platform is applied in water trading. 5. The challenges
    for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain Blockchain technology
    is still in testing phase and its implementation in agri-food value chain management
    has some issues that need to be tackled. Therefore, in this section, we will scrutinize
    the challenges to apply blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.
    A review of the literature indicates that there are six main challenges for applying
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management: storage capacity and
    scalability issue, privacy leakage, regulation problem, high cost problem, throughput
    and latency issue, and lack of skills. 5.1. Storage capacity and scalability Storage
    capacity along with scalability issues have been deeply questioned in the blockchain.
    Koteska et al. [25] stated that one of the main challenges for blockchain implementation
    is scalability. To provide theoretically proven security, it is necessary to have
    a large number of full nodes (a node that can fully validate transactions and
    blocks) in the blockchain implementation. The nodes in the blockchain network
    are expected to validate each transaction of each block [50]. Otherwise, blockchain
    implementation in agri-food value chain management might result in a less decentralized
    system. Koteska et al. [25] proposed that scalability negatively affected three
    dimensions of the blockchain, the size of the data on the blockchain, the transaction
    processing rate and the latency of data transmission on the blockchain. Although
    only full nodes store the full chain, storage requirements are also significant
    [50]. For example of the Bitcoin, the blockchain is always growing with a rate
    of 1MB per block every ten minutes and store a large amount of data in every node
    that no interest for them [26]. As the number of transactions increase in the
    agri-food value chains, the amount of data becomes larger, and the loading of
    store and computing accompanied with data becomes harder, which results in the
    blockchain becoming bulky [78]. Simultaneously, every participant in the agri-food
    value chain needs to constantly store all transaction data to validate them on
    the blockchain because they need to check if the source of the current transaction
    is unspent or not [83]. Thus, with the node size increasing, additional resources
    are required by the nodes. Finally the system’s capacity scale is reduced and
    synchronization time for the new user is increased [50]. 5.2. Privacy leakage
    In the blockchain, each transaction can be traced, checked and audited and every
    user can be identified by their public key or its hash. Undoubtedly, blockchain
    technology provides a new level of transparency and helps to build trust. However,
    it also has negative effect on protecting users’ privacy [50]. Kosba et al. [79]
    stated that blockchain could not guarantee the transactional privacy even with
    the permission management because the information on blockchain was available
    to all participants who belonged to the blockchain network. Lu and Xu [80] underlined
    that every member could access all information on the blockchain because there
    were no privileged users. Maouchi et al. [36] argued that some agri-food value
    chain members might be competitors with each other and they did not enjoy the
    transparent traceability system. Therefore, many efforts for protecting privacy
    in blockchain has been done such as obfuscation on the transaction relationships
    to prevent linking or tracing analysis, hiding the identifies of the sender and
    the receiver through complicated cryptographic schemes, and blinding the transaction
    content whilst retaining the verifiability and computability [81]. In order to
    ensure transactions are not easily to be traced to any given person or computer,
    Monero [82] applies ring of signatures scheme to guarantee transactions untraceable.
    Other schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring Signature,
    Homomorphic Encryption, Zero-knowledge-proof have been used in blockchains to
    improve privacy, but no schemes can hide the sender, the receiver and the amount
    at the same time [40]. Kosba et al. [79] tackled these privacy issues differently
    through using encrypted transactions. The Hawk – a decentralized smart contract
    is responsible for translating the generic code written by programmers into cryptographic
    primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs that retaining transactional privacy.
    After researching in the wine value chain traceability system, Biswas et al. [67]
    stated that there were two drawbacks of the blockchain technology: one is the
    transaction speed; the other one is privacy as neither companies nor individuals
    would like to publish all information onto a public database. 5.3. High cost problem
    Lin and Liao [83] proposed that agri-food value chain participants would need
    a lot of money and time to embed blockchain technology in the current agri-food
    value chain traceability system. Yli-Huumo et al. [17] noted that when blockchain
    became more complex, the computational power would be another critical issue,
    as it required more computational power to confirm more blocks. Simultaneously,
    energy consumption also needs to be taken into consideration [39]. After conducting
    a case study on blockchain-based traceability system, Lu and Xu [80] pointed out
    some public blockchains inherent with a proof-of-work consensus mechanism wasted
    a lot of electricity. Most of the electricity is consumed in two different ways:
    (1) a large amount of electricity is used for the mining process, which involves
    a consensus algorithm that consists in a sort of brute force search for a hash;
    (2) another amount of electricity is consumed in peer-to-peer communications because
    it requires an edge device to be powered [26]. 5.4. Regulation problem Agri-food
    value chains are extended across the globe. Hence, applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management needs to be considered from a global perspective.
    However, blockchain is a new technology that involves different people from various
    countries without any legal or regulation to follow. Additionally, the absence
    of a central authority and the non-existent of censorship in the current blockchain
    system, this situation creates many uncertainties [50]. Atlam et al. [29] stated
    that this was a serious problem for both agri-food manufacturers and service providers.
    Therefore, it is necessary to introduce new laws or regulations to monitor and
    regulate blockchain applications in the agri-food industry for compliance [8].
    After conducting a case study on grain quality assurance tracking-based on blockchain
    technology, Lucena et al. [58] found a controversial issue when using blockchain
    technology regarding its legal value. Their research also indicates that complex
    agri-food value chain scenarios involving international trade and arbitration
    laws are yet to be proven. 5.5. Throughput and latency issue In the context of
    agri-food value chain management, due to the original restriction of block size
    and the time interval used to generate a new block, the current processing capacity
    of blokchain cannot fulfil the requirements of processing millions of transactions
    in real-time. Aste et al. [84] (p.26) stated that “a system that could handle
    large transaction volumes would require large blocks or mechanisms in which multiple
    blocks are validated simultaneously”. All the above issues will cause a big problem
    for clients when running a blockchain-based system. After investigating an RFID
    and blockchain based traceability system for agri-food value chain, Tian [38]
    stated that there were two obstacles for applying blockchain technology: (1) the
    transaction capacity of blockchain is restricted to seven transactions per second
    due to the restricted size of block; (2) how to deal with storage and synchronization
    issues with the growing size of the blockchain. Regarding latency, it is critical
    to note that current blockchain system needs some time to process transactions.
    For example, in the case of Bitcoin, block creation times follow a Poisson distribution
    with an average of ten minutes (10-minute block interval with 6-block confirmation)
    [26]. As for Ethereum, it is estimated around 3 min for 14-second block interval
    with 12-block confirmation [85]. Jindal et al. [86] construed that the time required
    for generating blocks and validating transactions is increases with an increase
    in the number of transactions. Sharma et al. [87] evaluated the performance of
    a blockchain-based distributed framework involved with Proof-of-Work algorithm
    and found that additional cost in computing sources and more processing time is
    required in case of network delays. 5.6. Lack of skills Given that blockchain
    is a new technology, a limited number of people have in-depth knowledge and skills
    about how blockchain can be used in agri-food value chain management [29]. To
    obtain general knowhow in blockchain technology and expectations of the technology
    in the context of agri-food value chain, Ge et al. [10] conducted numerous interviews
    and meetings with agri-food value chain stakeholders. They found that a considerable
    level of scepticism existed among stakeholders with low know-how of blockchain
    technology, partly due to the way blockchain was portrayed as panacea to all information
    problems, partly due to a series of technical issues that remained to be resolved.
    Therefore, Iansiti and Lakhani [42] proposed that applying blockchain technology
    in the agri-food value chain was likely to be a long process. Simultaneously,
    a widespread lack of understanding on how blockchain works in other areas also
    exists [88]. 6. Discussion: research gaps and future research directions Below,
    we summarized the research gaps and future research directions on blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management based on our systematic review of the literature.
    6.1. Future research directions for the applications of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management The analysis of the applications of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management allows us to better understand
    how blockchain technology has been applied and evolved in agri-food value chain
    management. Several directions for future research about implementing blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are suggested and summarized in
    the following. • In the context of applying blockchain technology in agri-food
    value chain traceability, various researchers proposed different blockchain-based
    traceability system that involved different technologies such as RFID, IoT, NFC,
    cloud computing, and big data, as well took different agri-food value chain entities
    into consideration (see Table 5). It is interesting to note that the traceability
    system proposed by Davcev et al. [30] could provide a comprehensive function for
    monitoring the land status, vegetable status, as well as to help to achieve the
    transparent and secure agri-food value chain. Therefore, should be implemented
    in reality. However, most of the proposed traceability systems are staying in
    conceptual phase and there is little empirical research to suggest which one is
    most applicable to the reality. Additionally, just few researchers considered
    third-party regulators/authority organizations in their proposed traceability
    framework. Therefore, one of the priorities for researching the blockchain-based
    traceability system is to conduct empirical research involving third-party regulators/authority
    organizations on different context of agri-food value chains to assess the performance
    of the blockchain-based traceability system. Thus, future studies can evaluate
    the proposed blockchain-based traceability framework effects from different perspectives,
    such as computation costs, transaction processing speed, storage capability, and
    the overall efficiency of agri-food value chains. Table 5. Blockchain technology

    for using blockchain technology to improve agri-food value chain information security:
    one is using blockchain technology alone; the other one is using blockchain technology
    combined with other technologies such as IoT (see Table 6). Obviously, double
    blockchain architecture has it unique advantages such as efficiency, transparency
    and privacy can be achieved with more data can be stored in the blockchain. Key
    technical components such as decentralized storage, mining hardware, and consensus
    mechanisms are easily to be achieved. However, it needs more effective consensus
    mechanism to deal with large amount of nodes and resources that stored in public
    service platform. Therefore, future research should investigate which consensus
    algorithm is more effective compared with others (Proof-of-Work, Proof-of-Stake,
    etc) in the same context. IoT applications have its own drawbacks such as they
    generate large volume of data and require connectivity and power for long periods.
    Besides, there are other limitations in memory, computer capacity, networks and
    limited power supply. In order to alleviate above issues, one important future
    research direction is to decide where the interactions will take place when combining
    blockchain technology with IoT, for example, inside the IoT, or blockchain, or
    a hybrid approach involving blockahin and IoT. It will need to discuss the advantages
    and disadvantages of these blockchain-IoT based applications through comparative
    analysis. This area is open for future researchers to investigate the impact and
    relative importance, and identify which one is the optimal choice to enhance agri-food
    information security. Table 6. Blockchain technology used for agri-food value

    because involved more devices • Another finding of this study is a new trend of
    focusing on blockchain technology to achieve a higher level of sharing knowledge
    and services among agri-food manufacturers. Current agri-food manufacturing ecosystem
    is changing from integrated and centralized systems to shared and distributed
    systems. Most of the proposed framework for achieving higher performance were
    based on the blockchain technology and cloud computing, which aimed to provide
    a secure, low energy consumption and high efficiency systems to agri-food manufacturers.
    However, it still has some drawbacks. For example, unstable data transmission,
    lack of uniformed technology standard and low internet speed, etc. Blockchain
    technology integrated with edge computing provide a new way to achieve a higher
    level knowledge sharing performance through developing a distributed, sharing,
    standardized, and secured framework. Key technological components such as communication
    protocol, decentralized storage, smart contracts, edge cloud are all needed to
    build this system. However, there are questions remaining about the combination
    of blockchain and edge computing in enhancing overall efficiency and effectiveness
    of agri-food manufacturers. Thus, future studies should apply the blokchain technology
    and edge computing in different agri-food manufacturers using empirical and analytical
    tools to assess its effect on agri-food manufacturing. • A new trend emerging
    in the literature is the application of blockchain technology in sustainable water
    management. A few studies discussed how to apply blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability. However, these studies just considered how to enhance water
    sustainability from irrigator’s perspective and water company’s perspective, rather
    than taking the whole agri-food value chain stakeholders into consideration. Therefore,
    future work should holistically consider how to use blockchain technology to enhance
    water sustainability from the whole agri-food value chain perspective. 6.2. Future
    research directions for addressing the challenges of applying blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management From our systematic literature review, six
    key challenges emerged for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    management, they are storage capacity and scalability, privacy leakage, high cost
    problem, regulation problem, throughput and latency issue, and lack of skills.
    Although a growing body of literature is available on discussing these challenges,
    a number of challenges still exist. The purpose of this section is to highlight
    the main challenges identified in the literature and propose future research directions
    for unsolved problems. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management are summarized in Table 7. • One
    of key challenges for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain
    is the storage capacity. Although some researchers broadly investigated several
    methods that could enhance the storage capacity, for example, store part of the
    data on-chain and part of the data off-chain [85], build a multi-layers blockchain
    architecture with different purposes [40], and develop a new algorithm involved
    deep learning concept [12] (see Table 7). It is easily to find that more computational
    power is required when implementing these solution methods. Therefore, future
    work should investigate how to appropriate solve the data storage problem without
    increasing the computational power. Specifically, integrating the deep learning
    concept or artificially intelligence concept with current algorithms such as ant
    colony algorithm to achieve computational power efficiency and systematically
    eliminate the irrelevance data of blockchain provide a new route for solving the
    storage problem. Furthermore, comparative analysis of implementing these possible
    solutions in the context of agri-food value chain should be conducted empirically
    and analytically. • Most of the researchers investigated how to solve privacy
    leakage issues from single blockchain architecture perspective, and have applied
    different schemes such as Stealth Addresses, Pedersen Commitments, Ring signature,
    Homomorphic encryption, Zero-Knowledge-Proof to protect privacy of users. Few
    researchers investigated how to protect privacy from a double blockchain architecture
    perspective, that is, one for public, one for agri-food value chain participants.
    Therefore, future work should investigate how to design and evaluate double chain
    structures for blockchain. Further, conduct experiments to check how to combine
    the above-listed data privacy schemes to maximum the performance of data privacy
    mechanisms. • As for the high cost problem, different consensus algorithms have
    been proposed by various authors such as Proof-of-Stake and delegated Proof-of-Stake
    algorithm. Though these two algorithms have various advantages such as reducing
    the computing time, less nodes will be involved in the block validation, etc.
    However, no one have conducted comparative analysis using these two algorithms
    in empirical study in the context of agri-food value chain. This area is open
    for future researchers to systematically investigate the impact and relative importance
    of different mechanisms using empirical and analytical tools. • As discussed earlier,
    blockchain is a new technology which neither has any legislations or regulations
    to follow, nor has a defined way of how to insert the implications arising from
    blockchain technology into a norm setting. Although the application of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain is currently still in its infancy, it can
    be expected that more initiatives will be taken by various agri-food organizations
    [10]. Therefore, more work should be taken from theory and empirical perspectives
    to check the effects of blockchain technology on the agri-food value chain, especially
    to check its effect in the international agri-food trade, and then formulate corresponding
    standards based on the research results. • As for the throughput and latency issue,
    some researchers proposed different methods to solve this problem such as implementing
    Bitcoin-NG algorithm and increase the size of each block [17,89]. However, both
    of methods are not perfect enough which will have side effects such as larger
    blocks make full nodes more expensive to operate, and the latency is limited by
    the propagation time of the network, etc. Therefore, how to choose appropriate
    algorithm and block size without side effects become very important in solving
    the throughput and latency issue of blockchain. It is necessary to holistically
    consider this problem with continually experiments and get an optimal solution.
    • Finally, concerned with the lack of skills, we did not find many publications
    that gave us clear answers on this challenge. Only Ge et al. [10] proposed two
    learning objectives for solving the challenge of lacking skills: (1) learn general
    knowledge of blockchain technology; (2) identify how to benefit from blockchain
    technology. Table 7. The identified solutions for the challenges of blockchain
    technology in agri-food value chain management. Main challenges Possible solutions

    7. Conclusions In this study, we conducted an SLNA to review existing work on
    blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. Through question formulation,
    locating studies, study selection and evaluation, we identified 71 publications,
    including journal papers, conference proceedings and book chapters. Then, we used
    software Gephi to build a citation network based on the citation data collected
    from Web of Science, which helped us to identify current trends and future research
    directions of blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management. The target
    publications of this study covered a broad spectrum of themes such as blockchain-based
    information security and traceability system, and blockchain-based water sustainability
    and food manufacturing. By synthesising the literature of blockchain technology
    in agri-food value chain management within a 10-year timeframe (2008–2018), this
    paper makes contributions to existing knowledge in three aspects: (1) The paper
    provides an overall picture of the evolution of blockchain technology and its
    application in agri-food value chains. (2) The paper elicited key challenges and
    proposed initial solutions for applying blockchain technology to agri-food value
    chain. (3) Research gaps have been identified and future research directions were
    suggested for applying blockchain technology in agri-food value chain management.

    blockchain technology is attracting significant attentions in various agricultural
    applications. These applications could satisfy the diverse needs in the ecosystem
    of agricultural products, e.g., increasing transparency of food safety and IoT
    based food quality control, provenance traceability, improvement of contract exchanges,
    and transactions efficiency. As multiple untrusted parties, including small-scale
    farmers, food processors, logistic companies, distributors and retailers, are
    involved into the complex farm-to-fork pipeline, it becomes vital to achieve optimal
    trade-off between efficiency and integrity of the agricultural management systems
    as required in contexts. In this paper, we provide a survey to study both techniques
    and applications of blockchain technology used in the agricultural sector. First,
    the technical elements, including data structure, cryptographic methods, and consensus
    mechanisms are explained in detail. Secondly, the existing agricultural blockchain
    applications are categorized and reviewed to demonstrate the use of the blockchain
    techniques. In addition, the popular platforms and smart contract are provided
    to show how practitioners use them to develop these agricultural applications.
    Thirdly, we identify the key challenges in many prospective agricultural systems,
    and discuss the efforts and potential solutions to tackle these problems. Further,
    we conduct an improved food supply chain in the post COVID-19 pandemic economy
    as an illustration to demonstrate an effective use of blockchain technology. Agricultural
    stakeholders, including producers, logistic companies, manufacturers, retailers
    and financial institutions, can be involved to create blockchain applications...View

    I. Introduction Current agricultural development and reform are calling for new
    techniques and innovations to create a more transparent and accountable environment
    in the agriculture sector. One of the emerging tools is blockchain technology.
    Unlike conventional centralized and monopolistic agricultural management systems,
    blockchain provides a decentralized data structure to store and retrieve data
    that are shared with multiple untrusted parties. In this way, it could potentially
    resolve a number of serious problems in current systems caused by the following
    reasons: (i) hackers can easily attack the centralized system to tamper data integrity;
    (ii) insider manipulation of the centralized database could compromise data integrity;
    (iii) a supply chain management system is over-reliant on the centralized database
    (single point failure problem); and (iv) high costs when involving a third party
    to verify and monitor transactions. To solve these issues, distributed database
    enhanced by advanced cryptography is proposed in the past few decades. Among these,
    blockchain is one of the most predominant emerging methods to solve trust related
    issues generated by the invention of Bitcoin in 2008 [1]. In blockchain technology,
    many advanced computational and cryptographic techniques are integrated into distributed
    data structure to achieve a digital trust system in an untrusted environment [2].
    In particular, hash function, as an algorithmic way to generate unique IDs, is
    used as the key element for data authentication. Hash values can be embedded into
    a format of stored chain to verify whether the stored data are tampered to ensure
    data integrity. Digital signature is used to verify real identities of data senders
    and receivers in stored transactions. In addition, consensus mechanism is designed
    to involve all computer nodes thus minimizing potential risks of data being manipulated
    by minority attackers. Blockchain applications in agriculture enhance diverse
    aspects in agricultural systems, especially supply chain [3] and Internet of things
    (IoTs) based systems [4]. These applications include food safety [5], food security
    [6], food quality monitoring and control [7], traceability for waste reduction
    [8], reliable operational data analysis [9] and efficient contract exchanges and
    transactions to reduce economic costs [10], thus supporting small-scale farmers
    [11]. These applications can be developed by using existing blockchain platforms
    to facilitate easy and quick developments. Based on different deployment scenarios
    of these applications, different computational and cryptographic techniques can
    be plugged to provide flexibility to meet desperate user requirements. In this
    paper, we present a comprehensive survey on the blockchain based agricultural
    applications and current innovations to promote blockchain techniques. We first
    explain basic concepts of blockchain technology, illustrate the current data storage
    ecosystem and analyze existing popular platforms by which the developed applications
    are implemented. Then we provide a comprehensive survey on diverse blockchain
    applications in agriculture related projects. After the survey, we further discuss
    the prospective of the emerging technology and how current challenges could be
    solved in deployment of the systems. Further, an illustration is presented to
    demonstrate how blockchain can be improved to build a more reliable and efficient
    food supply chain in future. This research is based on existing literature. We
    have used a comprehensive literature search strategy. We first gather all relevant
    survey papers by complying with the systematic procedure via searching the relevant
    subjects in Google Scholar and many electronic databases, including Open Athens,
    IEEE Xplore and Science Direct. The search terms used to collect the relevant
    works are: blockchain for agricultural applications, blockchain for supply chain
    management, blockchain for IoT, data integrity, traceability, provenance, and
    IPFS with blockchain. All these terms are used in multiple search combinations
    to ensure the completion of data gathering. The comprehensive literature review
    is crucial for us to answer the following three main research questions: (1) What
    are the current standard blockchain applications in agriculture related projects?
    (2) What are the main challenges that these blockchain applications face in their
    deployments? And, how could these challenges be met? (3) How blockchain can be
    improved to build a more reliable and efficient food supply chain in the future?
    The contributions of our work can be highlighted as: (i) we make an insight investigation
    of the existing applications of blockchain in agriculture and highlight potential
    uses of the technology, (ii) we suggest suitable blockchain schemes in the agricultural
    sector by an illustration of the technical details of the key components in blockchain
    technology, (iii) we further identify the key challenges in many novel agricultural
    applications and discuss alternative solutions, and (iv) we present a post COVID-19
    pandemic blockchain based supply chain system to improve the resource allocation
    when dealing with unexpected event emergency. Although there are many new blockchain
    survey papers published in recent years [12]–[21], our work provides a comprehensive
    study in the agricultural context. In the work, both technical details and applicative
    aspects are covered so that our insights could be used to suggest suitable techniques
    and platforms for individual applications in their own agricultural scenarios.
    The structure of this paper is organized as follows: In Section II, computational
    and cryptography algorithms used in blockchain technology are explained in details.
    In Section III, the latest blockchain applications are categorized and critically
    reviewed. Following the review, the challenges and prospective of combining blockchain
    with other emerging technologies are discussed in Section IV. Further, we present
    an illustration how blockchain can be deployed in a real-world scenario in Section
    V. Finally, the conclusion is drawn and future work is suggested in Section VI.
    SECTION II. Blockchain Techniques As a formal definition, blockchain is a distributed
    ledger to share transactions or sensitive data across untrusted multiple stockholders
    in a decentralized network [22]. A basic blockchain structure is illustrated in
    Fig. 1. The data are recorded in a sequential chain of hash-linked blocks that
    facilitate the data distribution in a more manageable manner comparing to other
    traditional data storage formats. The blocks are verified and uploaded into the
    chain-like system by selected nodes via an agreed consensus protocol. This consensus
    mechanism allows all the parties to engage in the monitoring process when adding
    data/information flow on-chain. In addition, the duplicates of these data are
    stored in all involving nodes to ensure their tamperlessness. In this section,
    a high-level review of blockchain ecosystem and technical details of the implementation
    are provided before the investigation of current blockchain applications in the
    agricultural sector. FIGURE 1. The data structure of a blockchain. Show All A.
    Data Storage Ecosystem Data storage and retrieval solutions are playing a centric
    role in agricultural systems. The ecosystem of data storage is illustrated in
    Fig. 2. Typical systems are still using conventional databases, such as MySQL,
    Oracle SQL and Postgres, to store and use data in a centralized way. They assume
    that data are synchronized well and shared among trusted parties. However, it
    is hard to hold the assumption in most real-world systems. Information asymmetric
    problem emphasized in [23] is a major issue to hinder the efficient allocation
    of resources in typical agricultural supply chains. As a variety of untrusted
    parties with different geographic locations are involved to generate data in a
    supply chain, it requires a more tamper-free system to protect the sharing of
    data across parties. The robust and decentralized features of blockchain offer
    one of the most suitable solutions by improving data transparency as well as data
    integrity without paying a third party to verify the process. FIGURE 2. The data
    storage ecosystem. Blockchain is playing an important role in the ecosystem. Show
    All Apart from the centralized solutions, blockchain systems dominate the distributed
    database solutions. Three types of blockchain systems are defined based on the
    accessibility and security level of applications: (1) public blockchain; (2) consortium
    blockchain; and (3) private blockchain. Public blockchain system can be joined
    by any nodes across the world with internet connection. The public blockchain
    is fully transparent so that data are difficult to be tampered by any internal
    or external attackers. However, the high decentralization trait of these systems
    generates large redundancy as well as less efficiency when considering the burden
    of sharing large amount of data. Therefore, the public blockchain is more suitable
    to applications with relatively small number of transactions (or data) to store
    into the blockchain system. Typical public blockchains include bitcoin [1] and
    Ethereum [24]. The private blockchain is deployed by a single party. It shares
    many similar characteristics to those centralized solutions but with a blockchain
    architecture. Although it is argued that private blockchain systems can be replaced
    by conventional solutions, it offers advantages over the centralized data storage
    when they are attacked by insiders. The consortium blockchain refers to a solution
    to keep data privacy and fast on-chain speed but involving more than one party
    for data storage. It is the most popular type in agricultural supply chain applications
    since having a balance performance, it fits most user requirements in this sector.
    Many blockchain platforms, such as Hyperledger Fabric [25], MultiChain [26], Quorum
    [27] and Corda [28], can be used to deploy either consortium or private blockchain
    systems. B. Blockchain Technical Components Several essential techniques, including
    hash, asymmetric cryptography, digital signature, Merkle tree and consensus are
    utilized in the blockchain design to achieve a secure ledger with decentralized
    management. Specifically, each block has a block header and a block body. In block
    header, several elements are included, such as previous block hash value, nonce,
    Merkle tree root hash, and other information, e.g., block version and Timestamp.
    Block body holds the actual data that are either transaction records or the protected
    data. 1) Hash Function Hash function is a key technique in blockchain, which is
    used for multiple purposes, including address generation, digital signature and
    consensus. Through hash function, arbitrary size data can be easily mapped to
    fixed-size values. While inversely, it is difficult to restore the original data
    from its hash value. For example, with a given large data x , its corresponding
    hash value can be obtained by irreversible hash function, Hash(x) . If x is modified
    to x ′ in an unintended manner, the hash result Hash( x ′ ) is completely different
    from Hash(x) . Two most common hash functions used in blockchain include message
    digest 5 (MD5) and SHA256 based on the complexity of data [29]. During network
    transmission, data integrity can be verified by cryptographical hash technique.
    For example, assume Alice sends data x to Bob. Along with data x , the encrypted
    hash value Encrypt(Hash(x)) , is also enclosed. After Bob receives the data, he
    can verify data integrity by calculating the hash value from received data x ′
    , Hash( x ′ ) , and comparing it with the expected hash results decrypted from
    the received Encrypt(Hash(x)) . If Hash( x ′ )=Hash(x) , it means data is transmitted
    properly, x ′ =x . Otherwise, if Hash( x ′ )≠Hash(x) , it means data integrity
    has been broken, so Bob may ask Alice to transmit the data again. 2) Asymmetric
    Cryptography To implement verifiable transaction in distributed system, asymmetric
    cryptography technique [30] is used along with hash function to enforce digital
    signature technique. In asymmetric cryptography, each user has a pair of keys,
    i.e. private key k and public key K . The private key is kept confidentially and
    known only by the owner, while the public key could be known by the others. The
    public key can be calculated from the private key, but with given public key,
    private key cannot be obtained in reverse. The public key K and the private key
    k can encrypt and decrypt data in pairs. For example, as shown in Eqn. 1, data
    x encrypted by public key K can be decrypted by corresponding private key k .
    On the other hand, data x encrypted by private key k can also be decrypted by
    corresponding public key K . Decryp t k (Encryp t K (x))=Decryp t K (Encryp t
    k (x))=x (1) View Source Targeting different security requirements, asymmetric
    cryptography can be flexibily applied. Again, assume Alice is sending data x to
    Bob, and both of them have a pair of asymmetric key. Note, Alice and Bob know
    each other’s public key whereas their private keys are only known by themselves,
    individually. To ensure confidentiality, Alice can encrypt data x through Bob’s
    public key, Encryp t K B (x) . Hence, only Bob can decrypt the data by using his
    private key. On the other hand, to ensure authentication and non-repudiation,
    Alice should send data x encrypted by her own private key, Encryp t k A (x) .
    In this case, after receiving the transmitted data, Bob can attempt to decrypt
    it by Alice’s public key. If successful, these data are indeed sent by Alice and
    she cannot deny it. 3) Digital Signature For each blockchain transaction, digital
    signature [31] is required to avoid issued transaction being modified or denied.
    Technically, digital signature is an integrated technique utilising both hash
    function and asymmetric cryptography. Like the signature for paper documents,
    a valid digital signature ensures that an unaltered data is sent by a known sender,
    which cannot be repudiated. For this purpose, the file is firstly hashed to a
    fixed length and then encrypted by sender’s private key, and the result refers
    to the digital signature of this sender. Since only nominated sender has his own
    private key, the asymmetric cryptography technique ensures authentication and
    non-repudiation of this signature. Meanwhile, because anyone can obtain the sender’s
    public key, the integrity of signature can be verified by anyone through calculating
    the hash value from the data and comparing it with the hash value decrypted from
    the signature. Moreover, if confidentiality is also required, the data can also
    be encrypted by the public key of nominated receiver. 4) Merkle Tree Once the
    number of transactions becomes larger, doing verification by downloading all the
    antiquated transactions in blockchain consumes a large amount of storage resource.
    To address this issue, Merkle Tree technique is used to reduce the storage data
    without breaking the block’s hash [32]. Merkle Tree is a binary tree consisting
    of leaf hash nodes, intermediate hash nodes and a root hash node. In each block,
    leaf hash nodes are the hash values of individual transactions. For example, assume
    there is a block with transaction data T A , T B , T C and T D . Here comes a
    Markle Tree with 4 leaves, i.e. Hash( T A ) , Hash( T B ) , Hash( T C ) and Hash(
    T D ) . As the parents of these leaves, two intermediate hash nodes, Has h AB
    and Has h CD , are calculated as follows. Has h AB = Has h CD = Hash(Hash( T A
    )+Hash( T B )) Hash(Hash( T C )+Hash( T D )) (2) (3) View Source Finally, the
    value of root hash, which is included in the block header, is calculated by hashing
    the value of intermediate nodes, as shown in Equ. 4. Has h ABCD =Hash(Has h AB
    +Has h CD ) (4) View Source To this end, by stubbing off branches of the tree,
    old blocks can then be compacted to reduce the size of the blockchain. 5) Distributed
    Consensus Schemes Byzantine general problem [33] has been raised as a trust issue
    in distributed systems. It refers to the data tamper caused by some dishonest
    nodes under the blockchain context [34]. The consensus mechanism is proposed to
    solve the problem and protect the data from minority attacks by allocating the
    responsibility of updating data blocks to random candidates selected from all
    the nodes. The popular consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof
    of Stake (PoS), Delegated Proof of Stake (DPOS), Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
    (PBFT), and Proof of Elapse Time (PoET). PoW is the first proposed scheme in the
    bitcoin to achieve consensus in peer to peer management [1]. The nodes across
    the network compete with each other to solve a cryptographic puzzle to add the
    next block into the blockchain with a small amount of incentives. This is called
    ”mining” in blockchain based cryptocurrency. Although the scheme is remarkable
    to protect the blockchain system from malicious attacks, it is a time-consuming
    and energy consumption process. Therefore, the on-chain speed (transactions per
    second) is low in the systems by using this scheme. PoS is a mechanism to use
    validators instead of miners to update the blocks [35]. The nodes must prove their
    stakes by depositing certain amount of coins in the system. The key advantage
    of the PoS over PoW is the significant reduction of the computational power. However,
    the main issue is that the nodes who have large proportion of stakes are more
    likely to become the validators of the blocks. Delegate Proof of Stake (DPoS)
    [36] is an improved version of PoS by restricting the number of validators to
    further improve the scalability of the blockchain. Block producers are voted by
    all the users who have a number of votes calculated based on their stakes on the
    network. A block is generated if two third of producers reach an agreement. Practical
    Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) algorithm was initially proposed to target on
    the Byzantine general problem [37]. It highlights that the PBFT requires 3f+1
    nodes to make a correct decision if f nodes are faulty/dishonest nodes in the
    network. The algorithm has been adopted into a blockchain system as one alternative
    consensus scheme [34]. In the scheme, a block proposer is first selected based
    on a robin-round manner. The proposer will then broadcast and collect 3f+1 nodes
    in the network. If two third of the validators agree on a block proposal, the
    block is valid to commit into the blockchain. Proof of Elapsed Time (PoET) is
    a more efficient mechanism compared to other consensus schemes [38]. It was developed
    by Intel on top of the SGX technology. After signing attestation, each node participates
    in a randomized lottery selection by receiving an object timer from the trusted
    code. The node who wakes first will lead the next block creation. However, the
    SGX is made by Intel which is a third-party company. This has a potential to compromize
    the principle of blockchain to remove the intermediaries. Overall, consensus scheme
    design is still an open challenge in blockchain research [39]. The selection of
    the scheme relies on the application context to balance the block on-chain speed
    as well as the robustness to against various types of attacks. C. Blockchain Generation
    Process Blockchain data on-chain process has several stages to secure data integrity.
    An example of a transaction record on-chain process is illustrated as follows:
    Stage I:Before each transaction, payee address is firstly generated, and the payer
    makes payment to that address. After the payer finishes the payment, the transaction
    is digitally signed by both the transactions parties and broadcasted to all the
    participants (i.e. peers) in the network. From the participant side, after receiving
    a new transaction, the transaction is firstly verified, and if valid, collected
    into a block. Stage II:Every participant packs the collected transaction records
    during a period into a block, and make an effort to upload his block to the blockchain.
    Regarding which participant can stand out from the peers, various distributed
    consensus schemes are introduced in previous section. Stage III:When the new uploaded
    block is connected with the existing chain, it is broadcasted to all the other
    participants in the network. After receiving the block, other participants can
    verify all transactions in the block to ensure data integrity. Since each block
    in the chain requires the hash value of the previous hash, the participants can
    express their acceptance of specific chain by using its hash to create the next
    block. With repeating these stages, all the data can be stored in the decentralized
    database sequentially. It provides a transparent environment for all the stakeholders
    so that a trusted system is built across the network. SECTION III. Blockchain
    Applications in Agricultural Sector During recent years, blockchain has attracted
    significant increasing attentions in agricultural sector. This trend is driven
    by the major concerns in several important aspects, i.e. food contamination and
    fraud issues [40], data security and safety in smart farming [41] and IoT based
    precision agriculture [3], trust and efficiency issues in financial transactions
    in the agricultural supply chain [42] and data transparency and integrity of agriculture
    related information management systems [43]. The regulation and governance seek
    for more innovations on adopting blockchain techniques to achieve better data
    transparency and accountability with flexible, costly and sustainable solutions.
    As illustrated in Figure 3, all the stakeholders involved in agricultural production
    and transaction can secure their data integrity in blockchain based systems. Thus,
    users have high confidence when using the products or the services offered by
    them. FIGURE 3. Agricultural stakeholders, including producers, logistic companies,
    manufacturers, retailers and financial institutions, can be involved to create
    blockchain applications to build up trust of data users, e.g., goverment supervisors,
    consumers, and other AI and machine learning based systems. Show All A. Application
    Categories In this subsection, a comprehensive investigation has been made to
    identify how the blockchain technology are deployed to achieve efficiency and
    integrity of agricultural applications. Based on these targeted issues, we categorize
    uses of blockchain into four groups: (i) provenance traceability and food authentication;
    (ii) smart farming data management; (iii) trade finance in the supply chain management;
    and (iv) other information management systems. 1) Provenance Traceability and
    Food Authentication: The most popular use of blockchain technology in agriculture
    is the traceability and provenance function in product supply chain management.
    It is the most efficient way to enhance food safety, and reduce fraud and food
    scandals since all relevant data related to the product origin and its movements
    can be stored with minimal tampering risk [44]. When each product item is produced,
    a corresponding digital token is attached to the item in order to ensure that
    it is tracked at a real-time manner. The developed applications include tracing
    Pork and Mango sold in Walmart supermarket [45], egg distribution from farm to
    the fork at midwestern U.S. [46], Brazilian grain export [47], the certificate
    verification of table grape shipped from Africa [48], the use of RFID tags to
    trace cold chain food [49], and the use of IoT sensor to trace products in supply
    chain [50]. Walmart is one of the pioneers to deploy blockchain on food traceability
    [45]. It worked closely with IBM to deploy two pilot studies by using Hyperledger
    Fabric. These two studies include the traceability systems for pork in Chinese
    market and mangoes in the American market. E-certificates including agricultural
    treatments, ID numbers, manufacturers, security issues, permissions and safety
    related records are all stored in the log files. With blockchain technology, procurement
    managers can trace all the information online in time, so that they can easily
    pinpoint the individual tainted products without recalling all the products. The
    systems can not only make the safety traceability much more quickly but also cut
    the recall cost by allowing to trace the items instead of batches [45]. Data and
    transactions collection procedure in the blockchain traceability systems are designed
    based on requirements of the applications. In [51], different event types defined
    in the Electronic Product Code Information Services (EPCIS) specification [52],
    including ObjectEvent, AggregationEvent, QuantityEvent and TransactionEvent, are
    uploaded into the blockchain to ensure the better information traceability as
    the items and their main transaction events have unique codes. In [48] and [53],
    certification documents of the products are embedded into the transactions to
    satisfy the compliance with health and safety regulations. In other traceability
    systems, such as [49] and [50], using IoT sensors or RFID tags to automate the
    data collection could further reduce the manual mistakes for data integrity and
    improve the efficiency of data on-chain process. 2) Smart Farming Data Management
    In addition to the previous mentioned traceability systems, IoT techniques have
    also been widely used in smart farming for better productivity control and management
    [54]. In these IoT sensor-based systems, management and control decisions are
    made based on data collected from sensor networks. In [55], robotic swarm control
    is proposed as a key concept in future smart farming and precision agriculture.
    Simply put, UAVs and land robots could make either distributed or collaborative
    decisions based on data collected from robotic swarms and communications between
    them. Thus, data privacy and integrity are the most important component in such
    systems. There exists an increasing trend of migrating IoT network data from centralized
    database to blockchain systems for many applications [56], [57]. Many agricultural
    projects have benefited from the convergence of IoT and blockchain techniques.
    For example, IoT based irrigation systems are proposed in [58] and [59] and blockchain
    is deployed to keep sensing data privacy and integrity. In [60], a private blockchain
    is adopted to secure monitoring and control data in a fish farm so that all the
    control decisions are accountable. In [61], Kawakura et al. uses Corda to build
    an IoT data recording system to store data that farmers operate hoes with small
    data transaction time-delay. With the analysis on these data, farming operations
    can be optimized to increase productivity. In these applications, farmers can
    build up their trust on the automated controllers as all decisions are accountable.
    3) Efficiency Improvement of the Trade Finance in the Supply Chain blockchain
    was originally proposed to improve the financial efficiency, and reduce transaction
    cost by removing intermediaries and audit cost via improved accountability in
    trading business process [72]. This feature is powerful to support small scale
    farmers who are suffering from high cost of trade transactions and accidental
    losses caused by environmental disasters or other uncertainties [73]. Therefore,
    the straightforward use cases of blockchain in agriculture is to explore its financial
    functions to make these agricultural producers profitable. Many agriculture related
    companies are developing blockchain systems to support trading parties in supply
    chain management. In [23], an integrated food trading systems with consortium
    blockchain, called FTSCON, was built to facilitate costly and easy trading of
    agricultural products in Shandong province, China. Based on the trial between
    2014 and 2017, it was found that the total profit of different enterprises in
    the region increased significantly. In [64], a detailed solution of implementing
    a trading system in soybean supply chain was presented. It emphasized that this
    system could provide proof of delivery, automated payments and dispute handling.
    In [66], a case study was made by CBH group in Australia to secure the seven days
    payment terms via a Quorum based blockchain system. The blockchain technology
    is also under development to support agricultural finance by many financial institutions
    and commercial banks. In [67], several case studies of blockchain systems which
    were jointly developed by banks and IT companies to illustrate that the blockchain
    systems provided the letter of credit from the banks efficiently to speed up the
    trading process with much shorter period. In [65], State Farm and USAA jointly
    developed a system to facilitate the automatic insurance claims from farmers to
    reduce the fraud risk as well as improve the claim efficiency. All these innovations
    have motivated farmers to produce more products by increasing their profit margins.
    4) Other Agriculture Related Data Management Systems blockchain technology is
    considered as the next generation information infrastructure promoted by many
    countries [74]. It has made significiant impacts on both industrial and research
    projects. In food manufacture industry, a food quality monitoring system is built
    by combining smart contract and evaluation models to increase reliability of peach
    juice production process [68]. On the agricultural research side, it is also calling
    for more transparent ways to increase confidence on research results when multiple
    collaborators are involved in a project. For example, food science research society
    proposes to use blockchain to store and share collected research data [70]. Blockchain
    based systems have also been deployed in many other agriculture related information
    management systems as the backbone infrastructure. For example, in [69], a decentralized
    ledger-based contract management system is built to provide legal protection of
    the temporary agricultural workers in Italy. In addition, the payment of the salary
    can be settled via the cryptocurrency in this integrated system. In [71], Plastic
    Bank uses a blockchain based token to encourage the plastic waste collection and
    recycle to provide an innovative solution for agricultural land cleaning. B. Application
    Platform As many cryptographic techniques are used in blockchain technology, it
    is a time-consuming task to build a blockchain system from scratch for practitioners
    and researchers. As a result, many open source and commercial platforms are provided
    to simplify and speed up the decentralized application (DApp) development in agriculture
    related projects. The predominant platforms used in these blockchain practices
    are discussed as follows. Ethereum was initiated in 2014 and it is the most active
    blockchain platform in the world for blockchain practitioners and researchers
    [24]. It is a permissionless blockchain that is friendly to public blockchain
    based APP development. The access control can only be added via the smart contract
    that is limited. Many proof-of-concept agricultural traceability systems, such
    as [49], [51], [62], [63], finance trading systems, such as [23], [64], and some
    information management systems, including [68], [69], are deployed on top of the
    platform. However, there are some disadvantages of using the Ethereum platform
    for development: as shown in Table 2, the platform uses PoW as its consensus scheme,
    thus the on-chain speed is relatively low, i.e. ~20 tps [75]. Another constraint
    for DApp development on the platform is the cost when committing data and transactions
    on the blockchain via ETH gas, a unit to measure the computational use [76]. When
    building a system with intensive on-chain data, it is not economic to use this
    platform. Hyperledger is endorsed by Linux foundation to provide several distributed
    ledger frameworks, e.g., Fabric, Sawtooth, Indy, and Burrow [77], for the enterprise
    level blockchain development. In these frameworks, Hyperledger Fabric [25] and
    Hyperledger Sawtooth [78] are the two most popular platforms for the development
    of the agricultural related projects. The examples include [45], [47], [53] by
    using Fabric and [46], [50] by using Sawtooth. The default consensus scheme in
    the Fabric is PBFT while in the Sawtooth, PoET is set as the default consensus
    scheme. In addition, these are flexible to adopt any other schemes to further
    improve the on-chain speed efficiently. Regarding the performance, both platforms
    have higher on-chain transaction throughput comparing to the Ethereum. In [79],
    it uses Fabric to achieve 20,000 tps with delegate design of the architecture.
    The difference between these two platforms is that Fabric supports permissioned
    blockchain but Sawtooth support both the permissioned and permissionless blockchain
    development. Thus, the use of Hyperledger frameworks is increasing significantly
    in agricultural applications. Quorum was created by JP Morgan to target on enterprise
    level blockchain systems [27]. It provides an Ethereum based platform to support
    applications of finance, supply chain, and retails with extra protection on the
    privacy of transactions and contracts. The transaction data are encrypted to preserve
    data privacy. In addition, it offers centralized enforcement on the access control
    so that it is more suitable for private/consortium blockchain systems. Although
    the platform is built on top of Ethereum, it uses either Raft [80] or Istanbul
    BFT [81], as its consensus scheme. Therefore, the average transaction speed can
    reach ~500 to ~700 tps in average [27]. Examples of agricultural systems developed
    by using the platform include AgriDigital [66] and insurance claim [65]. TABLE
    1 A Comprehensive List of Blockchain Based Agricultural Systems and Their Implementation
    Platforms TABLE 2 Table to Summarize the Main Features and Attributes of the Popular
    Blockchain Platforms to Deploy Agricultural Applications Although there are many
    other platforms for blockchain based system development, such as Multichain [26],
    R3 Corda [28] and BigChainDB [82], these four platforms have been widely chosen
    for the deployment of agricultural systems. The main features and attributes of
    these platforms, including transaction throughput, consensus, supported smart
    contract languages, state database and access control, are summarized in Table
    2. In addition, a more comprehensive list of agricultural projects by using these
    platforms are presented in Table 1. C. Smart Contract 1) Smart Contract and Its
    Implementation Smart contract refers to a computerized program which is consisted
    of states, values, addresses and logical functions that are required at the business
    model layer in a system [83]. The idea was initialized by Nick Szabo in [84] to
    automatically execute contracts to improve efficiency of business models involved.
    As illustrated in Fig. 4, smart contract plays a key role in a blockchain system
    implementation. In specific, once it takes the transaction requests as input to
    trigger the business logic, it uses defined policy to get the endorsement from
    peers in the blockchain network. After receiving all the endorsements, it calls
    the ordering services to verify the endorsement and add the verified transactions
    into blocks of the blockchain. The records stored in the blockchain is immutable
    so that no one could tamper the on-chain data. In addition, DApps can query the
    states of accounts or transactions via the smart contract. FIGURE 4. Smart contract
    plays an important role in transaction endorsement and verification. Show All
    To support the fast blockchain application development, most blockchain platforms
    support the programming of smart contracts to fulfil the different business logics
    behind these applications. Ethereum platform and its extension platform Quorum
    provides Turing complete smart contracts: they compile either Solidity and Serpent
    code into Ethereum virtual machine (EVM) bytecodes and the EVM takes responsibility
    to track state changes to ensure Turing completion. As the most active platforms
    in Hyperledger family, Hyperledger Fabric and Sawtooth uses Golong, Java, Python
    and Javascript as the main programming languages for smart contract development.
    2) Challenges of Smart Contracts The challenges of smart contract is the key focus
    when blockchain technology is deployed in agricultural systems [93]. In [94],
    these challenges are summarized based on the smart contract life cycle, which
    includes creation, deployment, execution and completion stages. In the creation
    stage, function and readability issues are faced by the developers and practitioners.
    Developing human readable code and achieving expected functionality are crucial
    for accountability of smart contracts. Further, good smart contract design could
    solve the problem of under-optimized code, which could lead to extra costs in
    transactions, or under-priced operations resulting denial of service (DoS) attacks.
    In the deployment stage, contract correctness and control flow are two major factors
    that ensure high quality of smart contract. Many methods, such as bytecode analysis
    [95], formal verification [96], and graph-based analysis [97], are proposed to
    check correctness and control flow of smart contracts for deployment. In the execution
    stage, execution efficiency of smart contract must be garanteed. In [98] and [99],
    concurrent execution of smart contracts by proposing Software Transactional Memory
    based approaches can significantly improve the execution efficiency. In the final
    completion stage, security of smart contract is the most crucial factor. As discovered
    in [95], 8,833 out of 19,366 smart contracts deployed on Ethereum have serious
    security bugs that can be easily exploited. Further, 12 types of vulnerabilities
    in smart contracts are summarized in [100]. Nevertheless, it is difficult to reduce
    these secruity risks and vulnerabilities without automated tools due to the diverse
    levels of blockchain programmers. Therefore, many security analysis tools, including
    SECURIFY [101], OYENTE [95], or SMARTINSPECT [102], are developed to ensure high
    level of smart contract security for the developers [103]. For example, a decentralized
    smart contract system, the Hawk [104], provides a promising solution to compile
    a contract into a cryptographic protocol automatically. For another example, in
    [101], a publicly released security analyzer for Ethereum smart contracts is developed
    as a fully automated tool to prove whether contract behaviors are safe. D. Technical
    Review of Innovative Agricultural Blockchains Recently, blockchain technologies
    have been integrated with many other advancements in IoTs, cloud computing and
    cloud storage to provide better services in agriculture. The convergence of blockchain
    and IoT, which is defined as Blockchain of Things (BCoT) in [105], has become
    one of the most useful frameworks in blockchain applications. In many data intensive
    applications, e.g., tracking and recording continuous signals from IoT devices,
    achieving optimized performance is challenging. This is due to various theoretical
    limitations and bottlenecks of blockchain. For example, conventional blockchain
    systems have a low on-chain speed due to their decentralized feature and consensus
    schemes [106]. Once the volume of real-time captured data are higher than transaction
    capacity, low throughput hinders the practice of blockchain technology. Thus,
    many novel agricultural blockchain systems with technical innovations are proposed
    to ensure better integration to enhance data throughput, security and fast retrieval
    of the shared data in agriculture sector when keeping the main features of blockchain,
    i.e. traceability, immutability, and data integrity. Some key studies are highlighted
    in the Table 3. These studies are categorized into three areas. TABLE 3 A Summary
    Table of Representative Technical Innovations in Agricultural Blockchain Applications
    First, many studies aim to improve the underlying elements of blockchain technology,
    focusing on the following key ideas: (1) nodes are grouped into clusters to improve
    the scalability of the BCoT architecture [87], [88]. In [88], Qu et. al. propose
    the reduction of data storage to tackle scalability related issues. It clusters
    the nodes into geometric groups so that data partitioning scheme can be deployed
    to reduce data redudancy. (2) Double chain architecture is used to store data
    in different types of blockchains [51], [85]. In [85] and [51], DoubleChain, a
    hybrid system of on-chain and off-chain data storage, is proposed to solve the
    throughput bottleneck. (3) smart contract filtering algorithm is designed to reduce
    the on-chain data. For example, in [60], a smart contract-based data filtering
    algorithm is proposed to build a blockchain based fish farming solution on top
    of a legacy database system. With the filtering algorithm, only important data
    are uploaded into the blockchain blocks. (4) consensus schemes that are too complex
    to be handled well in large IoT networks are improved to further boost blockchain
    performance. In [87], a Distributed Time-based Consensus algorithm (DTC) is proposed
    to reduce the processing overhead. While in [23], Mao et al. design an improved
    (iPBFT) scheme to make the consensus better suited for relatively higher throughput.
    Secondly, combining different data storage techniques is another important strategy
    to tackle the exponentially increasing data storage used in many agricultural
    applications. InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer distributed
    data storage system in which data content is stored in distributed peers and its
    hash value is used to ensure data integrity [107]. The combination of IPFS and
    blockchain has become a popular approach to tackle the weakness of blockchain
    technique to store large amount of data [64], [89], [90]. For instance, as multimedia
    data have increased significantly in agricultural applications, IPFS has been
    used in [64] to store videos and images to complement with blockchain so that
    the multimedia evidence, including images and MPEG videos, can be stored securely
    to resolve rebuttals in soybean transactions. In addition, mixture with decentralized
    database cluster is another option to solve the high volume storage problem. In
    [91], Golden Seed Breeding Cloud Platform (GSBCP) is designed to ensure the safe
    storage of crop breeding. A decentralized database cluster is used to store the
    raw data collected from multiple sensors; and the database addresses and relevant
    metadata are uploaded into the blockchain, thus maintaining data integrity. Thirdly,
    blockchain privacy and security is another focus of recent research. In many agriculture
    related applications, enhanced privacy and security components are added in their
    systems, e.g., [86], [91], [92]. In [91], the summary of breeding data is encrypted
    by using proxy encryption server before uploading into the blockchain. In [86],
    an improved partial blind signature algorithm is proposed to protect data privacy.
    In [92], an architecture with decentralized access control is proposed to enhance
    security of IoT device data. SECTION IV. Challenges and Potential Solutions The
    major technological challenges can be summarized as the following aspects: (i)
    scalability issue when integrating with data intensive technology, such as IoT.
    The throughput of blockchain is much lower than the conventional centralized databases,
    which can achieve tens to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. Therefore,
    the data-intensive applications, e.g. monitoring and controlling farming by sensor
    network, require fast storage speed and low network latency; (ii) integration
    with existing legacy systems. Many organizations have deployed their own management
    systems for years and it is hard to migrate their entire systems to the emerging
    blockchain which could cause disruption to their current services; and (iii) security
    and privacy. Blockchain encourage the decentralized infrastructure which increases
    the data transparency but compromise the data privacy. Although most recent blockchain
    platforms allow the uploading of encrypted transaction records on-chain, more
    security features would enhance the data security and privacy to a higher level
    due to various types of attacks [108]. Based on the technical innovations discussed
    in the previous section, the potential solutions for solving these challenges
    are summarized and illustrated in Figure 5. FIGURE 5. The alternative solutions
    to target on several challenges in state-of-the-art frameworks. Show All As illustrated
    in Figure 5a, the use of a hybrid architecture solution by combining centralized
    databases or other data storage systems with blockchain is proposed in many studies
    [85], [91], [109], [110]. Although some applications focus on designing light-weight
    data structure to reduce the on-chain data amount [51], [86], the mixture and
    links of blockchain with other storage systems, such as IPFS, provides a more
    scalable and sustainable way to deal with the exponential increase of data that
    most modern storage solutions are facing. The hybrid architecture can solve the
    demand of high throughput data storage requirement while maintaining data integrity.
    Integration with legacy systems is another challenge when promoting blockchain
    technology in agricultural organizations. In [13], it is highlighted that the
    blockchain systems are difficult to seamlessly integrate with legacy systems.
    We believe that the popular use of cloud services in most enterprises could potentially
    solve this issue. As illustrated in Figure 5b, when data from legacy systems in
    individual companies are uploaded in cloud services, service providers can easily
    extend their services to blockchain based systems if any business needs are proposed
    between multiple parties. In addition, the organizations could save the cost to
    enhance data privacy and security as the risks could be efficiently controlled
    and managed by the service providers. To further enhance blockchain privacy and
    security, an infrastructure level solution is more suitable for tackling the challenge.
    As illustrated in Figure 5c and 5d, two types of blockchain structure changes
    could potentially enhance data privacy and security. In Figure 5c, a hierarchical
    blockchain based system is proposed as the private blockchain has better characteristics
    to maintain data privacy. Only data required by legislation or regulation bodies
    are stored into a consortium blockchain. Figure 5d offers another enhanced version
    in Figure 5c. It uses efficient chain-to-chain communication technology to remove
    the consortium blockchain, thus further maintaining data privacy in private blockchains.
    Of course, the communication scheme across multiple private blockchains need be
    secured as proposed [111]. In addition to these technical challenges, there are
    other challenges in environmental, social and organizational aspects [112] to
    promote blockchain technology in agricultural sector. There are still lack of
    regulatory and legal requirements to reinforce the deployment of blockchain based
    systems. Thus, some enterprises are reluctant to adopt the technology if their
    current systems can satisfy their business needs. Further, it requires knowledge
    and skills on both agriculture and blockchain to develop these applications. However,
    it is predictable that the use of blockchain to build trustable systems would
    be predominant in many countries and these challenges would need to be addressed
    in near future [113]. SECTION V. An Illustration of Essential Food Supply in Post-COVID-19
    Pandemic In this section, we present an illustration to demonstrate a blockchain
    based food supply chain management system in agricultural applications. The ongoing
    COVID-19 pandemic has brought a huge crisis on the global food supply [114] despite
    many existing blockchain systems in agricultural supply chain. During this period,
    shortage of essential food, such as rice, fresh vegetables, flour, and eggs, has
    caused panics among suppliers and shoppers due to disruptions in supply networks.
    Producers, manufacturers and distributors have limited information when customers’
    shopping behaviours change abruptly. It takes weeks, even months, to adjust resource
    allocation in order to recover the operations of food product supply to a normal
    level. Further development of blockchain based supply chain systems is required
    to improve the situation by tackling issues related to asymmetric information.
    There are at least three key lessons that we could learn from COVID-19 related
    global food supply disruptions. These include: (1) we need real-time accurate
    information for parties involved. When panic buying occurs, the supply network
    lacks of accurate information to reflect the purchase behaviours, thus making
    quick responses impossible. (2) More efficient coordination among parties at a
    global scale is necessary in order to generate quick and appropriate responses
    in real-time. (3) Efficient process is needed to reduce time in bureaucracy procedures.
    These lessons motivate us to reform the existing blockchain based supply chain
    systems to provide better services in future. As shown in Figure 6, we illustrate
    an improved blockchain based supply chain system that can be deployed in post
    COVID-19 era. The blockchain technique will be seamlessly integrated with machine
    learning methods to achieve a more efficient system. Like other existing blockchain
    system, the provenance of products, including essential information and certificates,
    is stored in the blockchain for traceability. In such a system, retailers are
    information consumers not providers. In this improved system, the main distinctive
    and unique feature is the integration of retailer and customer data into the blockchain.
    Insight analyses of key weaknesses of current supply chain management systems
    have identified that the involvement of these retailer/consumer data is valuable
    to boost the effectiveness of the blockchain based system. If shopping data can
    be uploaded into the system, up-chain parties, including producers, manufacturers
    and logistic companies, could explore these data for better coordination and resource
    allocations. Thus, a closed loop could be formed when retailers/customers’ data
    are stored into the blockchain. The main features are highlighted as follows.
    FIGURE 6. Use Case - Improved post-COVID-19 blockchain based supply chain solution.
    Show All Using AI based retail sales prediction to reduce on-chain data. Retail
    forecasting has offered an oppotunity to optimize retailers’ planning to maximize
    their profitable margins by setting reasonable inventory level based on popularity
    of products [115]. Recent research has shown some extent of success in product-level
    demand forecasting at a high granularity level. The demanding prediction of products
    can be integrated as a filtering method to reduce on-chain data of the proposed
    blockchain system. In Algorithm 1, the pseudocode of data registration function
    in RetailerData smart contract is used as an example to show how data collected
    from retailers can be uploaded on the blockchain system. Here, the AL refers to
    the authentized list that all registered retailer units can upload their data
    to improve the up-chain strategical optimization, and the p refers to individual
    products that supply process need to be optimized. With an AI module filtering
    normal sales prediction, the on-chain data can be reduced significantly. At the
    same time, any anomaly or significant customer behaviour changes are recorded
    into the blockchain so that up-chain parties could explore the data for efficient
    planning. SECTION Algorithm 1 Data Registration Function in RetailerData Smart
    Contract Input: Message sender (msg.sender), authentification list (AL) of retailer
    units, product object (p) including all sales infomation of the product, current
    time (t). Output: Data registered 1: if msg.sender ∈ AL && abs(p.real_sale−ai_module.predict())>th
    then 2: register(msg.sender,p,t) 3: else if msg.sender ∈ AL then 4: register(msg.sender,p.id,normal_flag,t)
    5: else 6: Revert contract state and show error 7: end if 8: return p The blockchain
    retailer data facilitate better planning and operation of upchain stakeholders,
    such as suppliers, manufacturers and logistic companies. As illustrated in Fig.
    7, up-chain parties could request these retailer data to feed into their AI modules
    to optimize their planning and operations. For examples, logistic companies could
    request data of retailer units and their demands of products to make routing optimization
    based on the geographic distribution of demand; manufacturers could use the data
    to adjust their raw material processing to meet urgent market demands; and farmers
    could make better planning for future productivity. FIGURE 7. The retailer/consumer
    data are important to improve efficiency of the food product supply chain. Show
    All The blockchain retailer data improve work priority of government and regulation
    bodies. As illustrated in Fig. 7, once government and regulation bodies have the
    permission to access regional data on demand, policy makers could set priorities
    and coordinate with all involving parties more efficiently to deal with unexpected
    events like COVID-19. Further, as shown in Fig. 6, quality control agents and
    food administration agency could work closely with producers and manufacturers
    so that a lengthy quality monitoring and auditing process can be simplified. SECTION
    VI. Discussions and Conclusion Blockchain technology, as a part of the emerging
    e-agriculture system, is reshaping the whole sector to solve food crisis in new
    century. It plays key roles from the farm to the folk in many aspects: it ensures
    data privacy and integrity by combining smart farming and precision agriculture
    techniques to improve farm productivity; it creates a more efficient food supply
    chain by establishing trust among involving parties, thus simplifying the process;
    and the last not the least, it enables farmers to maximize their profit via a
    trusted platform. Overall, it adds great values to all stakeholders in the entire
    agricultural sector. In this paper, to promote blockchain techniques, especially
    their various uses in the ecosystem of agricultural products, we have presented
    a comprehensive survey on current blockchain based agricultural applications and
    innovations. We have explained various concepts of blockchain technology, including
    its data storage ecosystem and its several popular application platforms. We have
    offered a detailed investigation of desperate blockchain applications in the agricultural
    sector. Then, we have considered several key challenges in the current use of
    blockchain related technologies in agricultural applications and provided some
    possible solutions. These challenges include: (1) scalability, (2) integration
    with existing legacy systems, and (3) security and privacy. Simply put, our suggested
    solutions can be viewed in a holistic fashion as a redesign of the system architecture.
    Further, we have indicated possible future developments and applications of blockchain
    in this sector via an illustration, i.e. the current COVID-19 global food crisis.
    In future, we wish to provide further discussions on various aspects of blockchain
    and explain in detail how current challenges as indicated in this paper can be
    resolved in future development of blockchain in agricultural systems. Potentially,
    our illustration could be further extended to be a much fuller case study, which
    could then be evaluated via a series of emperical tests. Authors Figures References

    I. Introduction II. IoT and Multimedia IoT Architecture III. Applications of M-IoT
    IV. Performance Metrics for M-IoT V. M-IoT Computing Paradigm Show Full Outline
    Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: The immense increase
    in multimedia-on-demand traffic that refers to audio, video, and images, has drastically
    shifted the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) from scalar to Multimedia Internet
    of Things (M-IoT). IoT devices are constrained in terms of energy, computing,
    size, and storage memory. Delay-sensitive and bandwidth-hungry multimedia applications
    over constrained IoT networks require revision of IoT architecture for M-IoT.
    This paper provides a comprehensive survey of M-IoT with an emphasis on architecture,
    protocols, and applications. This article starts by providing a horizontal overview
    of the IoT. Then, we discuss the issues considering the characteristics of multimedia
    and provide a summary of related M-IoT architectures. Various multimedia applications
    supported by IoT are surveyed, and numerous use cases related to road traffic
    management, security, industry, and health are illustrated to show how different
    M-IoT applications are revolutionizing human life. We explore the importance of
    Quality-of-Experience (QoE) and Quality-of-Service (QoS) for multimedia transmission
    over IoT. Moreover, we explore the limitations of IoT for multimedia computing
    and present the relationship between the M-IoT and emerging technologies including
    event processing, feature extraction, cloud computing, Fog/Edge computing and
    Software-Defined-Networks (SDNs). We also present the need for better routing
    and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols for M-IoT. Finally, we
    present a detailed discussion on the open research issues and several potential
    research areas related to emerging multimedia communication in IoT. Topic: Mobile

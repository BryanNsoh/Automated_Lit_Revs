    15 March 2024 Introduction In the nineteenth century, coffee cultivation in Brazil
    began to expand into the Cerrado region. The Cerrado is a vast region of savanna
    with poor soils. However, Brazilian coffee farmers developed new techniques for
    improving the soil, such as using lime and fertilizer. As a result, the Cerrado
    is now the world''s largest coffee-producing region. The components nitrogen,
    phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, Sulphur, and iron can all be found
    in soil that is considered fertile1. The optimal soil for growing coffee is loamy
    soil, found in the state of north Karnataka, India which has a good combination
    of texture, drainage, and water retention. Coffee plantation soil requires well-drained
    soil to prevent waterlogging and root rot. Coffee plants have extensive root systems
    that extend deep into the soil to absorb nutrients and water2. The presence of
    nutrient-rich soil serves as the fundamental basis for the optimal growth and
    development of coffee plants, hence facilitating the production of superior-grade
    coffee beans. Fertility refers to the soil''s ability to provide essential nutrients
    for plant growth, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Healthy soil leads
    to healthier coffee plants, which produce higher yields of high-quality beans.
    Coffee plants thrive in slightly acidic soil with a pH of 5.0–6.5. Crop covering,
    composting, organic fertilizer, reduced tillage, water conservation, and shade
    management are ancient soil fertility strategies. Restoration of dry land to rich
    soil using IoT sensors to monitor and enhance coffee plantation soil health is
    creative and successful3. Soil sensors measure nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
    Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects plant growth and nutrient
    uptake. Farmers can protect coffee plants from extreme temperatures by tracking
    soil temperature patterns. Soil temperature sensors show how temperature affects
    plant growth and nutrient uptake. Analyzing soil temperature patterns protects
    coffee plants from extreme temperatures4. IoT sensors help farmers optimize irrigation,
    fertilization, and other soil management activities for healthier soil and higher
    crop yields by giving real-time soil data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are
    a type of artificial neural network (ANN) that are well-suited for processing
    sequential data like IoT sensor time-series data. RNNs are useful for time series
    prediction, anomaly detection, and natural language processing because they can
    learn and understand temporal patterns and interdependencies in datasets. Recurrent
    neural networks (RNNs) provide the capability to analyze records of soil moisture
    data, enabling the prediction of forthcoming moisture levels. Conduct a comprehensive
    examination of soil nutrient data to predict potential nutrient deficits, hence
    facilitating the efficient and effective application of fertilizers by farmers.
    This research gap identifies characteristic patterns in soil sensor data, with
    a special emphasis on sudden changes in moisture and nutrient levels. Regular
    soil monitoring will monitor the alterations in soil condition and prompt safeguards
    will be implemented5. Develop predictive models that provide suggestions for optimal
    irrigation, fertilization, and other soil management practices. The limited scope
    of traditional soil testing often focuses on soil organic matter, microbial activity,
    and soil structure. However, the use of organic improvement in soil may result
    in delayed progress. Generalized suggestions derived from past data may not consider
    the particular soil characteristics, regional climate, or contemporary methods
    of management. The information provided Erroneous interpretation of soil test
    findings and suggestions might result in misguided conclusions and unproductive
    actions. Insufficient historical analysis, which fails to account for previous
    management techniques and local environmental conditions, can have an influence
    on evaluations of soil health status and long-term patterns. This paper is organized
    as follows: “Literature review” section presents a review of related work in Recurrent
    Neural Networks with the Internet of Things using deep learning. “The proposed
    model” section describes the proposed RNN-IoT approach in detail. “Results and
    discussion” section presents the experimental setup and results. “Conclusion”
    section discusses the results and compares RNN-IoT with existing methods. “Challenges
    and future possibilities” section concludes the paper and discusses future research
    directions. Literature review Aarthi, R., Sivakumar, D., et al., proposed the
    optimal watering schedule and fertilizer application rate. IoT software platforms
    that can be used to develop smart soil property analysis systems such as Thing
    Speak, Blynk, Cayenne, Node-RED, and Azure IoT Hub. Smart soil property analysis
    systems can provide real-time soil conditions data, allowing farmers to respond
    quickly to any changes. Future work is to develop more sophisticated machine learning
    models to improve the accuracy of the predictions6. Na, A., Isaac, W., Varshney,
    S, et al., proposed an Internet of Things (IoT)-based system for remote monitoring
    of soil characteristics a system that employs sensors to collect data on soil
    properties, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), moisture, temperature, and
    then communicates this data to a cloud platform or another remote location. These
    soil qualities include electrical conductivity (EC), pH, and temperature7. Jain,
    N., Awasthi, Y et al., proposed an IoT-based soil analysis system using optical
    sensors and multivariate regression is a system that uses optical sensors to measure
    the color and reflectance of soil and then uses multivariate regression to predict
    soil properties, such as pH, organic matter, and nutrient content. IoT-based soil
    analysis systems can be made small and portable, making them ideal for field use.
    Future work on IoT-based soil analysis systems could focus on making IoT-based
    soil analysis systems more affordable and accessible to small-scale farmers8.
    Patil, P et al., proposed the implementation of IoT to determine the level of
    bicarbonate in the soil a system that uses sensors to measure the pH and electrical
    conductivity (EC) of soil and then uses this data to calculate the bicarbonate
    level. IoT-based bicarbonate detection systems can provide users with the data
    they need to make informed decisions about irrigation, fertilization, and other
    agricultural practices9. Adrian Z et al. proposed integrating soil pH measurement
    into an Internet of Things (IoT) application a concept that involves using sensors
    to measure soil pH and then transmitting this data to a cloud platform or other
    remote location using a wireless communication protocol. The dataset collected
    by IoT-based soil pH measurement systems typically includes soil pH, Temperature,
    Humidity, Electrical conductivity (EC), and Timestamp10 as illustrated in Table
    1. Table 1 Literature review for soil health based on different proposed models.
    Full size table IoT (Internet of Things) is a key enabling technology for smart
    agriculture, as it allows for the collection and analysis of data from sensors
    in real-time. IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems can provide real-time
    data on soil parameters, which allows farmers to respond quickly to changes. Future
    work on IoT-based soil parameter measurement systems could focus on making the
    systems easier to set up and maintain18. The materials and methods section describes
    how the soil is fertilized using IoT sensors and Cloud storage. The proposed model
    The primary objective of this research study was to monitor the overall condition
    of the soil and to design an advanced algorithm called RNN-IoT. The present techniques
    for measuring soil health based on existing and past guidelines have yielded inaccurate
    results. The suggested approach has successfully addressed all of the aforementioned
    limitations and obtained a predictable outcome in transforming barren land into
    sustainable and rich soil suitable for coffee cultivation. Build an IoT sensor

    As demonstrated in Fig. 1, the N95S31B NB-IoT outdoor temperature and humidity
    sensor accurately measures air temperature and relative humidity. Figure 1 Working
    prototype for testing soil fertility. Full size image It subsequently sends data
    to an IoT server over NB-IoT. CO2 sensors measure CO. The waterproof, sturdy CO2
    concentration transmitter outputs 0–10 V. Nordic nRF9160 SiP is a low-power, single-chip
    cellular IoT solution. Its Arm Cortex-M33 CPU, low-power RF transceiver, and multiple
    ports make it adaptable. The Nordic nRF9160 SiP''s ADC peripheral measures soil
    moisture. SiP receives soil moisture sensor data20. The Soil EC NPK PH Sensor
    monitors NPK, EC, and pH. Soil electrical conductivity (EC) may indicate salt
    concentration. Higher EC values imply plant-harming soil salt. Growing plants
    need nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. It means 20% nitrogen, phosphorus, and
    potassium in the soil. Soil pH indicates acidity or alkalinity. Acidic soils have
    pH < 7, while alkaline soils have pH > 7. Electrical conductivity sensors detect
    soil solution. NPK sensors evaluate soil solution light absorption at different
    wavelengths. This data can track soil health trends and identify areas that need
    specialist soil management. LDR soil color sensors like the MNS2-9-W2-CM-020 improve
    coffee plantation soil health monitoring21. The Maxim Integrated DS3231 time stamp
    may improve coffee plantation soil health monitoring in numerous ways. Plantation
    operators can use time stamps to find patterns and trends in soil health data
    as indicated in Fig. 2. Figure 2 Virtual abstract for proposed system. Full size
    image Protocol for interfacing serial technology (IST) Soil moisture sensors measure
    volumetric water content. Two electrodes detect soil electrical resistance, which
    fluctuates with water content. Sensor output is usually a soil moisture-proportional
    voltage or frequency as indicated in Eq. (1). Where VWC is the volumetric water
    content which finds the percentage of soil volume occupied by water, can be calculated
    based on the weight of the wet soil minus the weight of the dry soil which divides
    the weight of the dry soil. εa is the apparent dielectric permittivity of the
    soil, εb is the dielectric permittivity of dry soil, εc is the dielectric permittivity
    of water. Where ρn is the neutron count rate in the soil, ρd is the neutron count
    rate in dry soil, and ρw is the neutron count rate in water as indicated in Eq.
    (2). $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{a}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{b}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {\\upvarepsilon {\\text{w}} -\\upvarepsilon {\\text{c}}} \\right)$$
    (1) $${\\text{VWC}} = \\left( {\\uprho {\\text{n}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)/\\left(
    {\\uprho {\\text{w}} -\\uprho {\\text{d}}} \\right)$$ (2) $${\\text{VWC}} = {\\text{M}}
    + {\\text{N}}*{\\text{R}}$$ (3) where R is soil electrical resistance and M and
    N are calibration constants from Eq. (3). A soil temperature sensor is needed
    to understand soil activity and plant growth22. It employs thermistors or thermocouples,
    whose resistance changes with temperature. Equation (4) shows that the sensor''s
    voltage or current output is proportional to soil temperature. Where T is soil
    temperature, R is thermistor electrical resistance, and A and B are calibration
    coefficients. $${\\text{T}} = {\\text{A}} + {\\text{B}}*\\ln \\left( {\\text{R}}
    \\right)$$ (4) Water level indicators assess soil water table depth. It employs
    a pressure transducer or ultrasonic sensor to detect water-induced pressure or
    sound reflection. Sensor output is generally a water level-proportional voltage
    or frequency. An NPK color value indicator evaluates soil nitrogen, phosphorus,
    and potassium levels. It measures soil extract color with a colorimetric sensor.
    Sensor output is generally an RGB color value or a numerical NPK level value.
    A GPS sensor locates the soil monitoring spot. GPS satellites inform it of its
    latitude, longitude, and altitude. The sensor sends NMEA messages with location
    coordinates as indicated in Eqs. (5), (6), and (7). $${\\text{Latitude}}={\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left({\\text{sin}}\\left({\\upvarphi
    }\\right),{\\text{cos}}\\left({\\upvarphi }\\right)*{\\text{cos}}\\left(\\uplambda
    \\right)\\right)$$ (5) $${\\text{Longitude}} = {\\text{ArcTan}}2\\left( {\\sin
    \\left(\\uplambda \\right),\\cos \\left(\\uplambda \\right)*\\cos \\left( {\\upvarphi
    } \\right) - \\sin \\left( {\\upvarphi } \\right)*\\sin \\left(\\updelta \\right)}
    \\right)$$ (6) $${\\text{Altitude}} = {\\text{R}}*\\left( {\\sin \\left( {{\\upvarphi
    } - {\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right) - \\left( {{\\text{R}}_{0} + {\\text{h}}} \\right)/{\\text{R}}*\\sin
    \\left( {{\\upvarphi }_{0} } \\right)} \\right)$$ (7) where \\({\\upvarphi }\\)
    is the geodetic latitude, \\(\\uplambda\\) is the longitude, \\(\\updelta\\) is
    the sun’s declination, R is the Earth''s mean radius (6371 km), R0 is its equatorial
    radius (6378 km), h is the GPS antenna’s height above the Earth’s surface, and
    \\({\\upvarphi }_{0}\\) is the reference ellipsoid’s latitude (43.66° LDRs (light-dependent
    resistors) measure soil color to determine nutrient content. It usually uses an
    LDR, which changes resistance when exposed to different wavelengths of light.
    Sensor output is generally a resistance value that fluctuates proportionately
    with soil color as indicated in Eq. (8). $${\\text{R}}=({\\text{Cr}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})/({\\text{Cw}}+{\\text{Cg}}+{\\text{Cb}})$$
    (8) where R is the reflected light, Cr is the red light component of the incident
    light, Cg is the green light component of the incident light, Cb is the blue light
    component of the incident light, and Cw is the white light component of the incident
    light. Soils with higher organic matter content tend to reflect more red light
    and less blue light, while soils with lower organic matter content tend to reflect
    more blue light and less red light. A pH sensor monitors the acidity or alkalinity
    of the soil. Typically, it employs a glass electrode that generates a voltage
    that varies by the pH of the solution that it is surrounded by. The output of
    the sensor is often in the form of a voltage, and its magnitude is typically proportional
    to the pH of the soil as shown in Eq. (9). $${\\text{pH}}=-{\\text{log}}10\\left({\\text{aH}}+\\right)$$
    (9) pH is soil acidity or alkalinity and pH+ is hydrogen ion activity in the soil
    solution. Each soil health measurement is timestamped. Even when the gadget is
    off, its real-time clock (RTC) preserves precise time. Synchronizing soil health
    data with other sources and tracking changes requires the timestamp. Table 2 estimates
    dry land-rich soil in coffee plantations2. IoT sensors may be connected to Arduino
    using IST. The simple and efficient IST protocol is ideal for connecting many
    sensors to an Arduino microcontroller. It includes Master Out Slave, in Master
    in Slave Out, Slave Select, and Serial Clock. SCLK synchronizes master–slave data
    transfer. MOSI and MISO signals send data from master to slave and slave to master.
    The owner chooses the slave via SS. A start condition from the master device starts
    IST communication with the slave. Most starts are high-to-low SS signal changes.
    After supplying the start condition, the master device can send a MOSI bit per
    SCLK clock pulse to the slave device. The slave device receives MISO data and
    delivers a bit to the master device for each SCLK clock pulse. Stop signals from
    master devices to slave devices halt IST communication. SS signals typically rise
    during a standstill. Arduino microcontroller board with enough computing power
    for data handling and communication interfaces. Use appropriate cables to connect
    each sensor to the microcontroller board for proper pinout and voltage. In Algorithm
    1, each sensor''s communication protocols are configured for data acquisition.

    an Arduino microcontroller to a Node MCU to the cloud Arduino microcontrollers

    communicating with linked sensors, reading output values, and processing sensor
    data as requested. Arduino microcontrollers gather soil health data from sensors
    as the main data-collecting unit communicating with linked sensors, reading output
    values, and processing sensor data24. The Node MCU stores data in the cloud and
    uses AWS IoT Core for visualization, and these services are accessed through the
    Node MCU as indicated in Fig. 4. Figure 4 The connection between Arduino board

    tools to monitor the uploaded sensor data in real time or over time. The data
    can be analyzed to identify patterns, trends, and anomalies, providing valuable
    insights into the monitored environment or process. Analyzed sensor data can be
    used to trigger actions, such as sending alert messages based on soil health conditions.
    Recurrent neural network The raw data was delivered to the input layer, where
    it was often preprocessed and normalized to ensure network interoperability. Load
    the CSV file into Panda’s data frame. Preprocess the data by performing necessary
    steps such as cleaning, handling missing values, and feature selection. Sequence
    formation has sequence length is a variable that determines the length of each
    sequence to be created. An empty list called sequences is initialized to store
    the generated sequences. Formula for GRU-based Soil Health Monitoring where, h_t
    is the hidden state of the GRU at time step t, h_{t − 1} is the hidden state of
    the GRU at time step t − 1, h_t̃ is the candidate hidden state at time step t,
    gate_update is the update gate, gate_reset is the reset gate. $${h}_{t}=gat{e}_{update}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+gat{e}_{reset}*{h}_{\\widetilde{t}}$$
    (10) The update gate controls which information is allowed to flow into the hidden
    state from the previous time step where W_h is the weight matrix for the hidden-to-hidden
    state connection, U_x is the weight matrix for the input-to-hidden state connection,
    b_h is the bias vector for the hidden state, x_t is the input at time step t.
    $${h}_{\\widetilde{t}}=tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{h}\\right)$$
    (11) Loops from 0 to len(data)—sequence length + 1. This loop generates dataset
    sequences. Unfold the RNN into interconnected layers with input, forget, cell,
    and output gates. Input the current input into the input gate to regulate information
    flow into the hidden state. Apply the forget gate on the previous hidden state
    to determine how much to remember. Update the cell state depending on the input
    gate, forget gate and previous hidden state cell state that stores sequence long-term
    memory. $${C}_{t}={f}_{t}*{C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{i}_{t}*tanh\\left({W}_{h}*{h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}+{U}_{x}*{x}_{t}+{b}_{c}\\right)$$
    (12) Consider Ct as the cell state at time step t, \\({C}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    at time step t − 1, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\) as the forget gate
    \\({i}_{t}\\) is the input gate, tanh is the hyperbolic tangent activation function,
    \\({W}_{h}\\) and \\({U}_{x}\\) are the hidden-to-hidden and input-to-hidden weight
    matrices, respectively. At time step t, \\({b}_{c}\\) is the bias vector for the
    cell state, \\({x}_{t}\\) is the input, and \\({h}_{\\left\\{t-1\\right\\}}\\)
    is the hidden state. Use the output gate to create the current time step output
    that passes cell state information. Gated recurrent units (GRUs) architecture
    trains the dataset properly depending on soil prediction features. At each time
    step, calculate the error between expected and actual output. Back propagates
    the error via the unrolled RNN to calculate weight error gradients. Update weights
    to reduce inaccuracy. Prediction and Analysis in the RNN model increase warnings
    and suggestions by predicting soil health metrics from real-time sensor inputs.
    Historical sensor data, growth trends, and FFNN soil health results train the
    model25. Change specifics to simulate scenarios. Counter-factual recommendation
    generation Parameters within historical data to represent various ‘what-if’ situations.
    It compares with the actual generated out with historical data to generate recommendations.
    They are comparing the recommendation using three ways Present data—Historical
    data, Historical data—Historical data, and Present data—Present data as illustrated
    in Fig. 5. Figure 5 Counter-factual recommendations. Full size image For example,
    let us contemplate a hypothetical situation in which a soil health monitoring
    system, based on feedforward neural network (FFNN) architecture, provides a recommendation
    for the optimal application rate of fertilizer for a particular agricultural area.
    Counterfactual suggestion has the potential to be employed to generate alternative
    fertilizer recommendations. Manhattan distance, often known as taxi cab distance,
    is calculated by adding the absolute coordinate differences of two places. Imagine
    traveling solely horizontally or vertically in Manhattan’s grid. Distance is calculated
    using present and historical data. Consider N points in K-dimensional space, where
    2 <  = N <  = 10^ {5} and 1 <  = K <  = 5. Find the location with the lowest Manhattan
    distance from the N places. Manhattan distance is two points measured along right-angle
    axes. It is |x1 − x2| +|y1 − y2| on a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2,
    y2). Sorting the points in all K dimensions and outputting the middle components
    of each dimension reduces the Manhattan distance. $$Manhattan\\;Distance = \\left|
    {s1 - s2} \\right| + \\left| {r1 - r2} \\right|$$ (13) The Manhattan Distance,
    which indicates the dissimilarity between the current suggestion and several alternative
    fertilizer options, may be calculated as shown in Eq. (13), where |s1 − s2| denotes
    the absolute difference between the two points’ s-coordinates. |r1 − r2| is the
    absolute difference in r-coordinates. The calculation considers nutritional content,
    application rates, and environmental effects. The system may create counterfactual
    suggestions with Manhattan Distances below a threshold. This keeps alternate options
    comparable to the original advice while allowing for varied perspectives. The
    implementation phase collects and analyzes data. Results and discussion The field
    implementation of the AI-powered system involved deploying IoT sensors in selected
    infertile agricultural fields to collect real-time soil data. These sensors continuously
    monitor soil properties such as moisture, temperature, pH, nutrient levels, and
    electrical conductivity. XG-booster is used for the pre-training model for predicting
    specific soil properties (e.g., nutrient content, and moisture levels) based on
    sensor data. The collected data was then fed into the AI system, which employed

    False Negative, True Positive, True Negative, and False Positive metrics using
    the Recurrent Neural Network and Counter-Factual Recommendation Generation. Field
    setup for improving soil fertility Enhancing the fertility of the soil is essential
    for achieving sustainable agriculture and achieving maximum crop yields. To evaluate
    and enhance the fertility of the soil throughout a range of monitoring periods,
    this experiment describes a field design that makes use of several land portions.
    Datasets are collected in real-time from Madikeri, Coorg, Karnataka total of 640,
    monthly monitoring based on historical data from the past three years recorded
    around 300582. Performance evaluation compared with RNN A proposed model is compared
    to existing models to determine its accuracy. Table 3 shows random forest, SVM,
    K-means clustering, GAN, and feed-forward neural network. This performance is
    measured using several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1
    score. Accuracy is the most straightforward metric, measuring the proportion of
    correct predictions made by the model. Precision measures the proportion of correct
    positive predictions. Recall, also known as sensitivity, measures the proportion
    of actual positive instances that are correctly identified as positive. Table
    3 Performance analysis for the proposed model. Full size table $$Accuracy = (True\\;
    Positives + True \\;Negatives) / (Total\\; Samples)$$ (14) $$Precision = True\\;

    * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)$$ (17) $$Specificity = True \\;Negatives
    / (True \\;Negatives + False\\; Positives)$$ (18) The proposed method achieves
    94.25% accuracy, while random forest, SVM, K-means clustering, GAN, and FFNN obtain
    81.22%, 81.66%, 82.12%, 88.12%, and 89.73%. Existing approaches take longer to
    calculate all datasets. Figure 7 shows that the suggested technique detects events
    better than current methods. High EC and TDS readings indicate excessive salinity,
    which can stress and reduce coffee plant output. Most of the 30-day monitoring
    period had optimum EC and TDS values. NPK levels reflect coffee plant nutrient
    availability. Low nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) levels can decrease
    coffee plant output. The reduction in NPK levels from day 11–30 suggests dietary
    replenishment. During days 1–10, the soil moisture was a little dry, but otherwise,
    it was excellent. The rain prevented soil desiccation and reduced coffee plant
    stress. Figure 8 shows that soil temperature also affects coffee plant development.
    Coffee plants like soil temperatures between 20 and 25 °C. During the monitoring
    period, soil temperature stayed within the optimal range, promoting root growth
    and nutrient absorption. Figure 7 Result analysis for the proposed approach. Full
    size image Figure 8 Mobile application. Full size image Optimization of the model
    To keep the coffee plants healthy and the farm skiing, it is important to monitor
    the soil health of the plantations. Beans with more robust scents and tastes are
    a product of soil that is both healthy and well-tended. Farmers may maximize water
    and fertilizer efficiency and cut down on production expenses by learning what
    their soil requires to be healthy. To maintain healthy and fertile soil over the
    long term, it is important to evaluate it regularly for signs of nutrient imbalances.
    Weekly data analysis utilizing the RNN model is used to monitor soil conditions,
    and farmers are updated on health-related information and comments about soil
    quality. For a more precise prediction, we compare the soil condition from the
    second week of monitoring with that from the first week. In a similar way comparing
    week 2 with week 1 generates correct results, comparing week 3 with week 2 and
    so on also yields accurate results. Measurements taken to enrich the soil of coffee
    plantations in arid regions When substantially monitoring and tracking various
    essential indicators such as electrical conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids
    (TDS), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), soil moisture, soil temperature,
    carbon dioxide (CO2), and soil pH, agricultural practitioners can promptly detect
    potential issues and implement appropriate measures to uphold an optimal ecosystem
    for their coffee crops. The soil solution''s EC and TDS levels indicate salt content
    as indicated in Table 4. Table 4 Measurement Range to fertile the coffee plantation
    soil from dry land. Full size table CO2 levels rose somewhat from day 11–20, indicating
    a healthier soil microbial community. Coffee plants thrive best at 5.5–6.5 soil
    pH as illustrated in Fig. 9. The soil pH remained within the correct range during
    the monitoring period, ensuring that coffee plants could easily obtain nutrients
    as shown in Table 5. Rainfall is vital to soil hydration. The monitoring period
    was without significant precipitation from day one to day fourteen. This shows
    that irrigation was needed to maintain soil moisture levels throughout this era.
    Day 15 brought 15 mm of rain, restoring soil moisture. Coffee plant soil health
    measurements were within optimal levels for most of the 140-day monitoring period
    from week 1 to week 20. Figure 9 Weekly monitoring using the IoT Platform. Full

    Full size table Counter-factual recommendation RNN-IoT model uses historical data
    and real-time sensor readings to predict future soil states and potential crop
    threats. Based on these predictions, the system generates counterfactual recommendations—alternative
    actions your farm could take to achieve desired outcomes. Mobile application sample
    The mobile application was created with the open-source Google framework Flutter,
    employing JavaScript. The RCNN model has been integrated and implemented, resulting
    in the generation of recommendations. These recommendations are created using
    Counterfactual suggestions. Figure 10 is a discussion based on the question raised
    by the agriculturist from various parts of the coffee plantation growers. Soil-rich
    mobile-based applications will provide recommendations after analyzing sensor
    data. Agriculturist question was “How do soil conditions that are too dry, too
    wet, too cold, or too hot affect coffee plants”. The recommendation is generated
    as High or low soil pH can make it difficult for coffee plants to absorb nutrients.
    Solution: Apply soil amendments to adjust the pH to the optimal range. The specific
    type of soil amendment to apply will depend on the current soil pH and the desired
    pH range. Similarly, “How does rainfall affect coffee plants, and what can coffee
    growers do to mitigate the negative effects of extreme rainfall events”. The recommendation
    is generated as Insufficient or excessive rainfall can lead to water stress or
    soil erosion. Irrigate during periods of low rainfall and implement erosion control
    measures during periods of high rainfall. Monitoring rainfall patterns is important
    to ensure that coffee plants receive the right amount of water26. The proposed
    model is trained using the Training Set, which enables it to discover hyperlinks
    and patterns in the data. To minimize loss and enhance predictions. To evaluate
    the model''s performance and adjust its hyper-parameters, a validation set is
    utilized during its development. Evaluates the model''s ability to be extrapolated
    to new data, which helps avoid excess fitting. The testing set is utilized for
    the final and unbiased evaluation of the model''s performance once all training
    and hyper-parameter adjustments have been finished. Ensures the model''s ability
    to apply knowledge to unfamiliar data and offers an accurate evaluation of its
    capabilities as shown in Fig. 11. The total dataset is divided into 60% for training,
    20% for validation, and 20% for testing. The difference between predicted and
    actual values is computed using a loss function by mean square error. The loss
    is propagated backward through time, updating model parameters (weights and biases)
    to minimize the loss. Figure 10 Farmer’s query-based recommendation. Full size

    recommendation. Full size image A confusion matrix is an illustrative format that
    exhibits the success of a proposed theory27. The data represents the observed
    vs projected results for each week of monitoring. Within the realm of soil fertility,
    weekdays may be classified as several tiers of fertility. For instance, weeks
    1–7 exhibit low fertility, weeks 8–14 demonstrate medium fertility, and weeks
    15–20 showcase high fertility, making them suitable for cultivation as shown in
    Fig. 12. Figure 12 Multiple confusion matrix for monitoring soil accuracy. Full
    size image By using IoT sensors to track soil moisture, temperature, pH, and nutrient
    levels, coffee farmers can gain valuable insights into their crops'' health and
    needs. Figure 13 data can then be used to make informed decisions about irrigation,
    fertilization, and other agricultural practices—a 20-week soil monitoring study
    that tracks the soil condition in a coffee plantation. The study was conducted
    in a coffee plantation in Madekari, Coorg, and Karnataka, India. Ten IoT sensors
    were installed on the plantation, and data was collected every hour for 20 weeks.
    The sensors measured soil moisture, temperature, and pH at a depth of 10 cm throughout
    20 weeks. Due to heavy rainfall in the early weeks of the research, soil moisture
    was maximum. Dry weather diminished soil moisture. The study''s soil temperature
    peaked in the first weeks and then dropped as the weather cooled. pH was almost
    consistent throughout the investigation. Figure 13 IoT sensors monitoring land
    view. Full size image 20-week. The investigation produced soil moisture, temperature,
    and pH maps. These maps helped identify under and over-watered crop regions and
    regulate the irrigation system. The maps were also utilized to identify acidic
    and alkaline soil on the farm and adapt the fertilization program. Conclusion
    The foreseeable future of coffee production demands beyond merely cultivating
    a diverse range of coffee beans; it involves establishing a sustainable and lucrative
    coffee business that will endure for future generations. Utilizing sophisticated
    sensors allows for the monitoring of environmental variables, including precipitation,
    humidity, and temperature, to optimize agricultural productivity. Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices have the potential to accurately assess the levels of water
    and nitrogen present in soil. Furthermore, by assessing the CO2 concentration
    in agricultural areas, it is possible to accurately monitor evapotranspiration
    rates, therefore enhancing the monitoring of soil health. This requires equipping
    coffee growers with the necessary tools and expertise to develop intelligent soil—a
    flexible and robust ecosystem that supports the growth of healthy coffee plants
    while reducing environmental harm. Farmers are provided with immediate updates
    on the condition of their soil and receive alerts on any potential issues. This
    enables farmers to promptly address any early signs of soil degradation. The Recurrent
    Neural Network and Counterfactual Recommendations utilize advanced algorithms
    to forecast future trends and provide tailored soil cures for youthful agriculturists.
    Knowledgeable farmers make well-informed choices regarding their soil, leading
    to higher crop production, better quality, and more profitability. The proposed
    method has overcome all of the above drawbacks and achieved the predictable result
    for converting infertile land to fertile land sustainable for coffee plantations.
    The future direction is moving towards installed outside Internet of Things devices
    are subject to severe weather, dust, wind, temperature, and other environmental
    hazards. This is one of the main issues with these devices. Unexpected mechanical
    failure of the complex devices could occur as a result of unfavorable environmental
    circumstances. Therefore, the raw materials used to construct the Internet of
    Things (IoT) devices used in smart farming must be able to endure such harsh climatic
    conditions. This will ensure that the devices last longer and provide more consistent
    results. Coffee cherry early detection and recommendation based on advanced deep
    learning technology which empowers farmers to cultivate a sustainable future for
    coffee, one smart earth revolution at a time. Challenges and future possibilities
    Global research on the Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor-based smart farming
    have revealed positive results. It is employed in several small-scale agricultural
    domains a rural farm, where farmers have less technological expertise, may provide
    more challenges. Even so, the execution of the project on a broad scale is still
    awaiting completion. An obstacle of great importance is the financial burden associated
    with the deployment and installation of IoT-tagged sensors and accessories in
    vast agricultural areas. Furthermore, there is ambiguity regarding the expenses
    associated with implementation and the monetary benefits that may be obtained.
    Deploying IoT-enabled technology incurs substantial expenses for hardware, software,
    and system operation. Supplementary costs may encompass energy usage, system upkeep,
    service enrollment, and labor fees for operating combined hardware and software.
    Enhancing farmers'' digital literacy on a global scale is crucial to facilitating
    the extensive use of IoT technologies. Lack of comprehension and consciousness
    of IoT-based technologies in agriculture might result in the underutilization
    of intelligent systems in farming28. Government policymakers should develop economic
    strategies to facilitate the successful and efficient implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology by farmers in agricultural areas. Data privacy and
    security issues might hinder large-scale IoT and smart system adoption. Attackers
    can manipulate cloud server data to harm automated agricultural activities in
    farmlands. Attacks can negatively impact agricultural output and prevent good
    environmental management. IoT data security concerns contribute to the sluggish
    adoption of smart farming systems. Encryption is crucial for protecting critical
    data and digital systems in smart farming from global cyberattacks. Integrating
    cryptography with strong keys can reduce cyber threats on cloud systems. Additional
    methods, such as integrating multiparty computing with homomorphic encryption
    or block-chain, can yield accurate results. Experimental statement No plants and
    Animals are disturbed for research work. All image datasets information regarding
    plant-based processes or applications was obtained from publicly available and
    ethically sourced data and publications. Plant Collection materials are complying
    with institutional, national, and international guidelines and legislation. So
    we confirm that all methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines/regulations/legislation.

  description: Underwater concrete structures face significant challenges due to their
    complex living environment, among which cracks are a critical factor. According
    to the fundamental principles of water irrigation and electric heating method,
    we introduced a novel approach that leveraged the cooling law of the point heat
    source in the monitoring tube to estimate the flow velocity along the irrigation
    pipe, to further detect cracks based on the variations in axial flow velocity.
    Numerical simulations were initially conducted to investigate the effects of factors
    such as the size effect, flow velocity along the irrigation pipe, combination
    scheme of the monitoring tube and irrigation pipe, and heating power on the cooling
    law of the heat source, to further determined an optimized monitoring scheme.
    A series of model tests was then conducted based on this optimized scheme. First,
    the relationship between cooling discrimination index and axial flow velocity
    was calibrated. Then, by adjusting the water pressure, the leakage rates under

    concrete structures face significant challenges due to their complex living environment,
    among which cracks are a critical factor. According to the fundamental principles
    of water irrigation and electric heating method, we introduced a novel approach
    that leveraged the cooling law of the point heat source in the monitoring tube
    to estimate the flow velocity along the irrigation pipe, to further detect cracks
    based on the variations in axial flow velocity. Numerical simulations were initially
    conducted to investigate the effects of factors such as the size effect, flow
    velocity along the irrigation pipe, combination scheme of the monitoring tube
    and irrigation pipe, and heating power on the cooling law of the heat source,
    to further determined an optimized monitoring scheme. A series of model tests
    was then conducted based on this optimized scheme. First, the relationship between
    cooling discrimination index and axial flow velocity was calibrated. Then, by
    adjusting the water pressure, the leakage rates under different crack widths could
    be obtained, allowing for the derivation of a fitting formula to estimate the
    crack width using the water pressure and leakage rate. Finally, in double crack
    specimen, the proposed multi-crack identification method, along with the calibration
    relationship and fitting formula, was used to perform the crack inversion. The

    tracer methodCrack width 1. Introduction The development and utilization of underwater
    space have become increasingly important for convenient transportation, resource
    regulation, and energy development due to improved social production efficiency.
    Underwater structures such as sea-crossing bridges, water pipelines, dams, and
    offshore platforms are continuously constructed, and these underwater structures
    extensively use concrete due to the excellent compressive performance and cost-effectiveness
    of concrete [1]. However, wading-concrete structures face numerous challenges
    in their complex living environment, especially the occurrence of cracks. Underwater
    concrete is prone to cracking due to the corrosive nature of seawater, coupled
    with wave loads and temperature differentials inside and outside the structure
    [2]. These cracks not only accelerate the corrosion of underwater concrete and
    the reinforcement but also reduce the durability of the concrete, thereby compromising
    the integrity and load-bearing capacity of the overall structure [3], [4]. The
    timely detection and monitoring of cracks and their development status is crucial
    to preventing significant economic losses and safety hazards. Therefore, crack
    detection in underwater concrete is critical for maintaining the normal use of
    structures and ensuring their safety. Non-destructive testing (NDT) techniques
    have been widely used for the preventive maintenance of underwater structures.
    Traditional NDT methods primarily rely on visual inspection by human inspectors,
    who must dive underwater to visually examine the structure''s surfaces within
    close range. This method poses personnel safety risks and requires a high level
    of expertise, potentially leading to errors and missed defect detection [5]. In
    recent years, underwater robots have been developed and used for the crack detection
    of underwater concrete structures [6], [7], [8]. Inspectors can remotely operate
    these robots from shore, eliminating personnel safety risks while increasing the
    inspection scope in terms of time and spatial coverage. By combining digital image
    processing techniques, crack detection from images collected by underwater robots
    has become more efficient, intelligent, and robust compared to traditional methods.
    Notably, underwater robot positioning and maneuverability still pose challenges
    [9], [10], especially in complex terrains and environments. Moreover, factors
    such as water turbidity, aquatic flora and fauna, and cleanliness of the structure
    surfaces can affect the quality of the collected images. However, image processing
    of underwater cracks faces several challenges. Traditional digital image processing
    methods cannot accurately identify underwater cracks due to image distortion [11].
    Deep learning algorithms [12], [13] have shown more efficiency and robustness
    compared to traditional methods, but have limitations in terms of calibration
    and scene restrictions, limiting their widespread use in engineering applications.
    Other mainstream NDT methods for underwater structure analysis include ground-penetrating
    radar (GPR)[14], ultrasonic testing [15], and alternating current field measurement
    (ACFM)[16], [17]. However, these methods also have limitations. For example, the
    effectiveness of GPR will depend on the propagation medium of electromagnetic
    waves underwater and will be susceptible to environmental interference. Additionally,
    the attenuation and scattering effects of electromagnetic waves during propagation
    limit the depth range of GPR detection. Ultrasonic testing will be susceptible
    to noise interference underwater. When using ultrasonic imaging technology [18],
    [19] to detect defects in underwater structures, the sensors need to be in close
    contact with the concrete surface. However, detection efficiency remains relatively
    low, even in multi-channel imaging systems. As a recently developed NDT method,
    ACFM can detect defects by analyzing the influence of alternating current flow
    on the magnetic field distribution near the flaws. Furthermore, owing to its excellent
    noise resistance and sensitivity, this method can be used to detect welds in underwater
    structures. However, ACFM technology relies on the electrical conductivity of
    the material under test, and its direct application on concrete surfaces remains
    a challenge due to the low conductivity of concrete. Embedded sensors [20] have
    been widely utilized in the field of structural health monitoring (SHM), enabling
    the long-term and real-time monitoring of the internal structure condition, differentiating
    them from NDT methods that focus on surface and near-surface inspections. Among
    these sensors, fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors [21], [22] have been extensively
    used due to their high sensitivity, real-time capabilities, and long-term stability,
    and monitoring approaches based on lead zirconate titanate piezoelectric (PZT)
    sensors have been increasingly assessed for underwater concrete structures [23],
    [24]. As such, by leveraging the piezoelectric effect of the materials, the qualitative
    identification of cracks can be achieved by analyzing the differential electrical
    signals generated at crack locations [25]. However, these embedded sensors have
    limited measurement coverage and cannot be easily repaired or replaced, making
    large-scale deployment challenging in engineering projects. A new approach for
    crack monitoring has been proposed by taking advantage of the unique environment
    of underwater concrete structures. This method involves embedding monitoring components
    that induce changes in thermodynamic parameters or heat transfer boundary conditions
    around the crack locations and utilizes heat transfer principles for crack identification.
    Chen et al. proposed a temperature tracing method based on thermal conduction
    theory, and this specific approach involved embedding a series of monitoring tubes
    with porous casings near the concrete surface [26]. Cracking of the concrete led
    to an increase in the water content within the porous casings, resulting in an
    increase in the thermal conductivity of the medium surrounding the cracks. The
    crack location could then be identified based on the difference in cooling rates
    of the heat source before and after cracking. However, this method exhibited lower
    sensitivity, with the accuracy of crack localization depending on the spacing
    of the casings, and the crack width could not be determined. Zhu et al. addressed
    these limitations by using hollow casings instead of porous casings, which increased
    the difference in cooling rates before and after cracking, thus, enhancing sensitivity
    [27]. Zhang et al. further conducted test studies on crack width monitoring using
    hollow casings and showed that this method could only identify the crack width
    in a flowing water environment, and the monitoring sensitivity depended on the
    distance between the measurement points and the crack. However, the method performed
    poorly when the crack width was less than 1.0 mm [28]. To address these issues,
    Chen et al. proposed a water irrigation and electric heating method, where the
    irrigation pipe was placed adjacent to the monitoring tube [29]. By actively creating
    a post-crack seepage environment using water pressure, the heat transfer boundary
    conditions were altered. Crack localization was then determined according to the
    distribution characteristics of the cooling discriminant index, and crack width
    could be determined based on the relationship between leakage rate and crack width.
    Compared to the casing method, this method improved the range of crack identification
    and localization accuracy. However, this method showed difficulty identifying
    the width of each crack when multiple cracks were present along a monitoring line
    when based solely on the total leakage rate. Therefore, based on the correlation
    between the flow velocity along the irrigation pipe and the cooling law of the
    heat source in the monitoring tube, in this study, we proposed a multi-crack identification
    method. This method not only allowed for systematic and efficient crack localization
    and width identification but also enhanced the measurement accuracy of the monitoring
    system, filling the gap in temperature tracing for the measurement of multi-crack
    widths. To achieve this, the monitoring scheme of water irrigation and electric
    heating method was optimized, by building upon a systematic study of the influencing
    factors on the cooling law of the heat source in the monitoring tube. A series
    of model tests was then conducted using the optimized monitoring scheme, which
    verified the effectiveness of this method for identifying multiple cracks. 2.
    Monitoring system and process 2.1. Monitoring system and principle The monitoring
    system used for water irrigation and electric heating consisted of a heating system,
    a temperature-measurement system, and an irrigation system, as shown in Fig. 1.
    The heating system was comprised of ceramic heating tubes within the sensing-heating
    elements, a heating series circuit, and a regulated power supply. The temperature-measurement
    system consisted of FBG sensors, a sensing series circuit, and an FBG demodulator.
    The irrigation system was composed of an irrigation pipe connected to a water
    tank, which provided constant water pressure, and the constant-pressure tank could
    be replaced by an automatic water supply, boosting the device in actual projects.
    For new construction projects, the monitoring tube and the irrigation pipe were
    embedded in the interior of the structure during the concrete pouring stage. For
    existing structures, they could be embedded by slotting on the concrete surface
    or fixed on the surface of the structure with plain concrete covering. The irrigation
    pipe was composed of a brittle material, such as ceramic or corundum, to ensure
    that it ruptured when the concrete cracked, while the monitoring tube required
    high tensile strength to prevent damage after concrete cracking. The monitoring
    tube was pre-filled with water, and the integrated sensing-heating circuit could
    be dragged to move the sensing-heating element to the designated position for
    measurement. In addition, the sensing heating element could be removed for maintenance
    or replacement, in the event of a malfunction. Download : Download high-res image

    underwater concrete structures [29]. When the sensing-heating element was located
    at P3, as shown in Fig. 1, heat transfer from the heat source to the surrounding
    medium occurred through thermal conduction, as the water within the irrigation
    pipe remained stationary below the crack. The conduction heat transfer could be
    described by the following differential equations: (1) where T is the temperature;
    t is the time; k denotes the thermal conductivity of the medium in different directions;
    ρ is the density of the medium; c is the specific heat of the medium; and Sh is
    the heating power per unit volume of the heat source. According to Equation (1),
    the cooling rate of the heat source at P3 primarily depended on the temperature
    gradient and thermal conductivity of the surrounding medium. When the sensing-heating
    element was located at P1 in Fig. 1, the heat from the heat source could be transferred
    through both conduction and convection, and the differential equation for convective
    heat transfer within the fluid could be expressed by (2) where ρw is the density
    of water, cw is the specific heat of water, v is the velocity of water, and Φ
    is the viscous dissipation function, related to the viscosity coefficient of water.
    According to Equation (2), the cooling rate at P1 was not only related to the
    temperature gradient and thermal conductivity of the surrounding medium but was
    also dependent on the flow velocity of water inside the irrigation pipe. Under
    other constant conditions, a higher flow velocity resulted in a faster cooling
    rate from the heat source. When the sensing-heating element was located at P2,
    as shown in Fig. 1, the rupture of the irrigation pipe caused water to flow along
    the surface of the monitoring tube, increasing the range of convective heat transfer.
    At this point, the heat transfer from the heat source was influenced by the convective
    heat transfer effect in both the v0 and vc flow directions. Therefore, the cooling
    rate at P2 was faster compared to P1. Based on the temperature tracing principle
    mentioned above, the heat transfer modes of underwater concrete would differ between
    locations close to and far away from the cracks, resulting in cooling rate variations
    of the heat source. Therefore, crack localization and width identification could
    be achieved by analyzing the cooling law of the heat source at the measurement
    points. Chen et al. assessed the cooling law of the heat source and defined a
    discriminant index, denoted as ξv, to reflect its cooling rate, as represented
    by Equation (3)[30]. Linear fitting was performed on the period, which showed
    good linearity of the time history curve of lg(T-Tθ), and the absolute value of
    the slope ξv of the fitted line increased with the acceleration of the cooling
    rate of the heat source, serving as a cooling discriminant index: (3) where T
    is the temperature of the measuring point, T0 is the initial temperature for cooling,
    and Tθ is the ambient temperature. 2.2. Identification process for multiple cracks
    When multiple cracks occurred along a monitoring line, as shown in Fig. 2, P1,
    P2, and P3 were considered the measurement points located further away from the
    cracks. The cooling rate of the heat source at these points was not influenced
    by the flow velocity inside the cracks but primarily depended on the flow velocity
    along the irrigation pipe. A higher axial flow velocity resulted in a faster cooling
    rate of the heat source, and as a result, a larger absolute value of the discriminant
    index ξv. Therefore, based on the calibration relationship between ξv and the
    axial flow velocity, the flow velocities v1, v2, and v3 at the corresponding positions
    of P1, P2, and P3 could be determined. The velocities followed the order v1 >
    v2 > v3. Based on this characteristic, we preliminarily inferred that cracks existed
    between P1 and P2, as well as between P2 and P3. Subsequently, the sensing-heating
    integrated circuit was dragged to change the positions of the measurement points,
    and mobile distributed measurements were conducted in the areas where cracks were
    likely to occur. By analyzing the distribution characteristics of ξv at the measurement
    points, the precise location of the cracks could be determined. Download : Download

    multiple cracks along a monitoring line. After inversely estimating the axial
    flow velocities at measurement points P1 and P2, based on the calibration relationship,
    the seepage rates qw1 and qw2 at cracks #1 and #2 could be determined according
    to the principle of mass conservation, respectively, as shown in the following
    equation: (4) where Af is the cross-sectional area of the irrigation pipe. According
    to Equation (4), a linear correlation was observed between the seepage rate and
    axial flow velocity. Therefore, the axial flow velocity could be indirectly calibrated
    through the calibration relationship between ξv and the seepage rate (ξv-qw).
    When the water pressure was constant, the seepage rate would increase with the
    widening of the cracks. Similarly, when the crack width was the same, the seepage
    rate increased with increasing water pressure. Mutual influence was observed among
    the seepage rate, crack width, and water pressure. Consequently, when the seepage
    rate and water pressure were constant, the crack width could be inversely estimated
    based on the calibration relationship between the seepage rate, crack width, and
    water pressure (qw-w-pg). A flowchart for multi-crack identification is illustrated
    in Fig. 3. First, cracks were preliminarily identified through the variation of
    water level within the irrigation pipe. Following cracking, the irrigation pipe
    underwent a transition from an initially dry state to a water-filled state due
    to seepage through the cracks. Subsequently, the sensing-heating element was moved
    to different measuring points along the monitoring circuit for measurements, enabling
    crack localization based on the distribution characteristics of ξv at measuring
    points. Finally, utilizing two pre-calibrated relationships, namely ξv-qw and
    qw-w-pg, facilitated the inversion of multi-crack widths. Download : Download

    factors on the cooling law of the point heat source in the monitoring tube, and
    to optimize the monitoring scheme, a finite element numerical analysis was conducted
    for the fluid–solid coupled heat transfer in the region far from the cracks, and
    the ANSYS Fluent platform was used to solve the heat transfer calculation model.
    The simplified diagram of heat transfer in the region far from the cracks is shown
    in Fig. 4. The water inside the irrigation pipe was assumed to as constant-viscosity
    and an incompressible fluid. When heat transfer was involved, in addition to solving
    the mass and momentum conservation equations, an additional energy conservation
    equation had to be solved. The governing equations for the computational model
    shown in Fig. 4 could be expressed by Equation (5): (5) Download : Download high-res

    the viscosity coefficient of water, f is the volume force, and cp is the specific
    heat capacity at constant pressure. 3.1. Numerical model The numerical model for
    heat transfer in the region far from the cracks was established based on Fig.
    4, with the cross-section of the concrete structure consisting of a square with
    a side length of 150 mm, and the longitudinal length of the model was 300 mm.
    An outer fluid layer was created around the concrete structure to simulate the
    external water environment, with a sensing-heating element located in the middle
    of the monitoring tube, and the distance from the center of the sensor to the
    surface of the concrete was 40 mm. The numerical model for the region far from
    the cracks, as well as the corresponding dimensions, are shown in Fig. 5. Download

    Numerical model for the region far from the cracks and corresponding dimensions.
    The model was divided into different regions, including the addition of a boundary
    layer for the fluid domain inside the irrigation pipe. A polyhedral meshing technique
    was used with a maximum mesh size of 5 mm. After diagnosing the mesh quality,
    finite element analysis calculations were conducted using Fluent software. The
    following assumptions were made. First, the water inside the irrigation pipe was
    incompressible and exhibited steady flow. Second, the thermodynamic parameters
    of the materials and the viscosity of the water did not vary with temperature,
    pressure, and time. The initial conditions were set as follows. (1) The wall surfaces
    were treated as adiabatic boundary conditions; (2) the inlet consisted of a velocity
    inlet, while the outlet was a pressure outlet with the gauge pressure set to 0;
    and (3) the ambient temperature Tθ was set to 300 K. The thermodynamic parameters
    of various materials in the model are shown in Table 1. Due to the significant
    influence of thermal conductivity on heat transfer efficiency, the selection of
    simulation materials for the monitoring tube and the irrigation pipe primarily
    considered the magnitude of the thermal conductivity. The values of relevant parameters
    were referred from literature [27] and the standard material library built into
    Fluent. Table 1. Thermodynamic parameters of the materials corresponding to the

    on the monitoring performance, five different cases were designed by modifying
    the material, cross-sectional shape, and wall thickness of the monitoring tube
    and irrigation pipe, as shown in Table 2. The material parameters for the monitoring
    tube and irrigation pipe corresponding to each case are listed in Table 1. Table

    were the same for each case, according to the following steps. (1) During the
    heating stage, constant power was applied to the ceramic heating tube, which was
    then stopped after 180 s. (2) Transitioning to the cooling stage, the temperature
    at t = 180 s was taken as the initial temperature for the cooling stage at the
    monitoring point, and the calculation concluded at t = 1000 s. (3) By altering
    the inlet velocity, the above calculation steps were repeated to obtain the temperature–time
    data during the cooling stage for each case at different flow velocities. The
    following settings were applied for the model calculations, according to the above
    computational steps. (1) The pressure solver was selected with a transient time
    type, without considering gravity effects. (2) The energy equation was enabled,
    employing the Realizable k-ε turbulence model. (3) The material properties were
    assigned to each element, and the ceramic heating tube element was designated
    as a heat source with a time-varying power function (P = 1 × 107 W⋅m−3 for 0 ≤
    t ≤ 180 s, and P = 0 for t > 180 s). (4) The center point of the ceramic heating
    tube element was designated as the monitoring point, and the temperature–time
    data at this point was recorded. (5) The Simplic algorithm was employed, and the
    calculations were executed after initialization. The time step size was set to
    1 s, with a total of 1000 time steps. 3.2. Factors affecting the cooling law of
    the heat source 3.2.1. Size effect The boundary conditions of the model were assumed
    as adiabatic walls. In practice, consideration of the heat transfer range of the
    heat source will be necessary to ensure the rationality of the model size. As
    a result, the cross-sectional dimensions of the numerical model were modified
    to investigate the size effect by comparing the simulation results. The distance
    between the center of the heat source and the near surface of the concrete was
    maintained at 40 mm, while the side length of the cross-section of the concrete
    was increased to 300 mm. Fig. 6 presents the schematic diagram of the size variation
    for Case 5. Download : Download high-res image (84KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Schematic diagram of the size variations in Case 5. The models with
    two different cross-section sizes in Case 5 were successively simulated, and the
    temperature contours of the profile at the monitoring point under different flow
    rates were obtained at a cooling time of 800 s. Fig. 7(a) presents the temperature
    contours of the model with a size of 150 mm, when the water in the irrigation
    pipe was stationary, and Fig. 7(b) and (c) show the temperature contours when
    the water in the irrigation pipe was flowing. We observed that during the cooling
    stage, heat gradually diffused from the heat source to the surrounding medium,
    and the flow of water in the irrigation pipe significantly accelerated the cooling
    rate of the heat source. Moreover, the faster the flow rate in the irrigation
    pipe, the faster the cooling rate of the heat source. After 800 s of cooling,
    the internal temperature of the model approached the ambient temperature of 300
    K, and heat transfer remained within the computational domain. Download : Download

    to the calculation steps, the time history curves of lg(T-Tθ) during the cooling
    stage were obtained at the monitoring point for the enlarged size model (300 mm)
    and the original size model (150 mm). A comparison of the simulation results is
    presented in Fig. 8. The simulation results of the two models were highly consistent,
    and the calculated discriminant indices were identical. Therefore, we determined
    that assuming an adiabatic boundary condition for the wall surface was appropriate
    when the cross-sectional size of the model was taken as 150 mm. Download : Download

    the cooling stage. 3.2.2. Flow velocity along the irrigation pipe Six different
    flow velocities were simulated for each case to investigate the effect of flow
    velocity along the irrigation pipe on the cooling law of the point heat source
    far from the cracks, corresponding to flow rates of 0, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000
    mL·min−1. By following the calculation steps, the time-course data of temperature
    T at the monitoring point under different cases could be obtained, and the time
    history curves of lg(T-Tθ) during the cooling stage were determined for each case.
    The simulation results for Case 5 are shown in Fig. 8(a). We observed that a higher
    flow velocity inside the irrigation pipe led to a faster cooling rate at the monitoring
    point, with 0 mL·min−1 corresponding to the stagnant state of the water inside
    the irrigation pipe and serving as a reference for determining the magnitude of
    flow velocity. During the 200 to 500 s cooling interval, linear fitting was applied
    to the time history curve of lg(T-Tθ), as shown in Fig. 9. The results indicated
    that the R-squared values of the fitted lines for the 200 to 500 s cooling interval
    were above 0.99, suggesting that the slope of the fitted line in this interval
    could be used as the discriminant index ξv to characterize the magnitude of flow
    velocity inside the irrigation pipe. Download : Download high-res image (167KB)

    scheme of irrigation pipe and monitoring tube The irrigation pipe and monitoring
    tube combination schemes are presented in Table 2. In Case 1, which corresponded
    to the original setup in [29], both the irrigation pipe and monitoring tube were
    cylindrical and had linear contact, and the sensitivity of the monitoring system
    was relatively low. Therefore, in subsequent cases, both the irrigation pipe and
    monitoring tube were changed to square tubes to increase the contact area and
    enhance the convective heat transfer effect. Additionally, Case 2 differed from
    Case 3 in terms of the irrigation pipe material, Case 3 differed from Case 4 in
    the wall thickness of the irrigation pipe, and Case 3 differed from Case 5 in
    the monitoring tube material. Simulations were conducted for these five cases,
    and the temperature–time data at the monitoring point were obtained under different
    flow rates. Finally, the time history curves of lg(T-Tθ) were obtained, as shown

    cases under different flow rates. When the water inside the irrigation pipe was
    stagnant, as shown in Fig. 10(a), the cooling trend at the monitoring point was
    slow, indicating that heat conduction was the dominant heat transfer mechanism.
    When the water inside the irrigation pipe started to flow, as shown in Fig. 10(b)
    and (c), the cooling trend at the monitoring point accelerated with increasing
    flow rate. In Case 1, the contact area between the monitoring tube and irrigation
    pipe was small, resulting in the weakest convective heat transfer effect and the
    slowest cooling rate compared to the other cases. In Cases 2 and 3, the irrigation
    pipes were composed of ceramic and corundum, respectively. Corundum had a higher
    thermal conductivity compared to ceramic, where the higher the thermal conductivity,
    the stronger the heat conduction effect, resulting in a faster cooling rate in
    Case 3 compared to Case 2. In Case 4, the irrigation pipe wall thickness was reduced
    by 1 mm compared to Case 3. The thermal conductivity of water was lower than solid
    materials. Although the convective heat transfer area increased in Case 4, the
    flow velocity was lower under the same flow rate. Therefore, the cooling trend
    in Case 4 was basically consistent with Case 3. In Cases 3 and 5, the monitoring
    tubes were composed of carbon fiber and stainless steel, respectively. The thermal
    conductivity of the stainless steel was significantly higher than carbon fiber.
    When the water inside the irrigation pipe was stagnant, the cooling curve of Case
    5 exhibited the fastest initial descent rate. When the water inside the irrigation
    pipe was flowing, Case 5 presented the most significant cooling trend change.
    3.2.4. Heating power To investigate the effect of heating power on the cooling
    law of the heat source, three input powers were set, namely, 0.5 × 107, 1 × 107,
    and 2 × 107 W⋅m−3. The temperature contours of the profile at the monitoring point
    for Case 5 were obtained after heating for 180 s, as shown in Fig. 11. With a
    fixed heating time, the higher heating power resulted in a higher initial temperature
    during the cooling stage, and the maximum initial temperatures for the three power
    levels were 313.2 K, 326.3 K, and 352.7 K. Download : Download high-res image

    during the cooling stage under the three different powers and various flow rates
    are shown in Fig. 12. When the flow rates were identical, the cooling curves obtained
    under different powers were essentially parallel to each other, and the calculated
    discriminant index ξv values were the same. This indicated that when using ξv
    as a discriminant index for the flow velocity inside the irrigation pipe, the
    influence of heating power could be eliminated. Download : Download high-res image

    during the cooling stage under different powers and various flow rates. 3.3. Optimization
    of the monitoring scheme As presented in Section 3.2, five different cases were
    established by varying the monitoring tube and irrigation pipe combination. The
    effects of factors such as the flow velocity along the irrigation pipe, contact
    area between the monitoring tube and the irrigation pipe, and thermal conductivity
    of the medium on the cooling law of the heat source were assessed. The influence
    of size effect and heating power was also considered. We observed that as the
    flow velocity inside the irrigation pipe changed, the magnitude of variation in
    ξv increased, indicating higher sensitivity and better performance of the monitoring
    system. The variation pattern of ξv with the flow velocity along the irrigation
    pipe was simulated for all five cases, as shown in Fig. 13. We observed that among
    the five cases, Case 5 showed the most significant variations in discriminant
    index ξv with respect to the flow velocity. Therefore, the scheme corresponding
    to Case 5, which comprised the monitoring tube and irrigation pipe, was chosen
    as the optimized scheme for further numerical simulations and model tests. Download

    location identification 3.4.1. Numerical model To investigate the thermal effects
    near the cracks, numerical models with different crack widths were established
    according to the optimized scheme, as shown in Fig. 14. The longitudinal length
    of the numerical model was 400 mm, and the crack was positioned at the center
    height of the model, with parameter w representing the crack width, and three
    cases were considered: w = 0.2, 0.5, and 1 mm. In the monitoring pipe, the sensing-heating
    element was moved along the vertical direction with the crack center serving as
    the origin, resulting in different monitoring points. The distance between the
    monitoring point and the crack center was denoted as y. Download : Download high-res

    a crack based on the optimization scheme. 3.4.2. Simulation results Different
    cooling patterns at different measurement points were simulated for models with
    three different crack widths under various flow rates, and the distribution of
    ξv along the monitoring line was obtained through fitting, as shown in Fig. 15.
    We observed that the simulated results for the three crack widths were consistent
    under the same flow rate. As the monitoring point grew closer to the crack center,
    the absolute value of ξv increased, and the absolute value of ξv increased with
    increasing crack flow rate. Therefore, crack localization could be achieved by
    analyzing the distribution characteristics of ξv along the monitoring line, and
    the crack localization accuracy could be improved by increasing the crack flow
    rate. When the monitoring point was located 80 mm below the crack, where no water
    flow occurred, the cooling rate of the heat source decreased. In this case, the
    magnitude of ξv was no longer affected by seepage and could be used as a reference
    value. When the monitoring point was 50 mm above the crack, the value of ξv became
    stable, indicating that the cooling pattern was not influenced by crack flow and
    was only related to the flow velocity inside the irrigation pipe. Therefore, ξv
    at locations away from the crack (y + ≧ 50 mm) could be used for calibrating and
    inverting the axial flow velocity. Furthermore, compared to the numerical model
    without cracks, the presence of the crack in the numerical model resulted in external
    water flow. However, the ξv values for both models at the same axial flow velocity
    were essentially identical, indicating that the flow state of the external water
    had minimal effect on the cooling rate of the heat source. Download : Download

    were conducted using the optimized scheme, according to the numerical simulation
    results. The dimensions of the reinforced concrete beam are shown in Fig. 16.
    The monitoring tube and irrigation pipe were composed of stainless steel and corundum,
    respectively, and both consisted of square tubes with an outer side length of
    18 mm. To facilitate a connection between the irrigation pipe and the circular
    delivery pipe, a heat-shrinkable tube was used to connect the irrigation pipe
    and circular PE-RT pipe near the top surface of the concrete. The connection section
    was embedded inside the concrete to ensure a leak-free joint, as verified in practice.
    The bottoms of the monitoring tube and the irrigation pipe were sealed with hot-melt
    adhesive. Download : Download high-res image (133KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 16. Diagram of the test specimen. 4.2. Test process The test site is
    shown in Fig. 17. The specimen was placed horizontally in a prefabricated stainless
    steel water tank, and two circular holes on the side of the water tank were used
    to install the drainage pipes. The lower drainage pipe was equipped with a valve,
    which remained closed during the test and was only opened to drain the water when
    removing the specimen after testing. The upper drainage pipe was used to discharge
    the leaking water, and the leakage flow rate was measured using a graduated cylinder.
    The valve and the pressure gauge were installed between the delivery pipe and
    the irrigation pipe, and the sensing-heating element was placed inside the monitoring
    tube. Next, a three-point bending test was conducted on the specimen using a reaction
    frame and hydraulic jack to induce cracking at specific locations. Water was then
    added to the water tank, and the water supply was stopped when the upper drainage
    pipe started leaking. At this point, the valve on the delivery pipe was opened
    to inject water into the irrigation pipe, and the crack leakage water flowed out
    from the upper drainage pipe. Once the pressure gauge readings and leakage flow
    rate stabilized, testing commenced. Download : Download high-res image (240KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 17. Test site. The testing procedure
    was as follows. (1) The fiber optic connectors and circuit connectors of the integrated
    circuit were connected to the demodulator and the regulated power supply, with
    a sampling frequency of 1 Hz and a voltage of 12 V. (2) The demodulator was started
    and testing began when the displayed wavelength value stabilized on the computer.
    Testing was conducted for at least 1 min under ambient temperature, and the average
    wavelength value within that minute was used as the corresponding wavelength λθ
    for the ambient temperature. (3) The regulated power supply used for heating was
    started, then turned off after 3 min, to initiate the natural cooling process.
    (4) The drainage volume was measured using a graduated cylinder, and the wavelength
    data was monitored. The test was stopped once the temperature stabilized during
    the cooling process. (5) The valve on the delivery pipe was adjusted to change
    the leakage rate, and the integrated circuit was moved to change the measurement
    point. The testing procedure was repeated as outlined above, and with each test
    iteration, the leakage rate or measurement point was changed. 4.3. Test results
    The FBG sensor in the sensing-heating element was specifically packaged to avoid
    strain interference, allowing it to be solely sensitive to temperature. The temperature
    change T caused a corresponding change in the reflected wavelength λ of the FBG,
    with the following relationship: (6) where KT is the temperature sensitivity coefficient
    of the FBG sensor. Due to the linear correlation between the wavelength measured
    under the same sensing point and the temperature, Equation (3) could be expressed
    as (7) where λθ and λ0 denote the wavelength corresponding to ambient temperature
    and the initial wavelength during the cooling stage (nm), respectively. 4.3.1.
    Calibration between ξv and axial flow rate The cracking location was located in
    the middle of the specimen, and the measurement point was moved to a position
    20 cm above the crack. Because the measurement was far away from the crack, the
    cooling behavior at this point was not influenced by the crack seepage, and depended
    only on the axial flow velocity. Testing was initiated once the water pressure
    and seepage rate stabilized, by adjusting the valve to change the flow velocity
    in the irrigation pipe. The time-domain data of the wavelength during the 200
    to 500 s cooling interval at the measurement point were obtained according to
    the test. The corresponding discrimination index ξv was obtained by fitting the
    wavelength data during this cooling interval, using Equation (7). A linear correlation
    could be established between the axial flow velocity and the flow rate, therefore,
    the axial flow velocity could be calibrated by calibrating the flow rate. The
    calibration relationship between ξv and the flow rate qw is shown in Fig. 18.

    Fig. 18. Calibration relationship between ξv and qw. We observed that the distribution
    pattern of ξv with respect to the flow rate was generally consistent with the
    numerical simulation results. However, the numerical values of ξv were overall
    lower, and this discrepancy could be attributed to the following reasons. (1)
    The material parameters used in the numerical simulation were based on the recommended
    values from standard databases, which potentially differed from the actual material
    properties. (2) The thermodynamic characteristics of the medium were influenced
    by temperature and pressure variations, but the numerical simulation was simplified,
    and the medium had constant properties. (3) The actual reinforced concrete beam
    was not a homogeneous medium, and the influence of reinforcement was not considered
    in the numerical simulation. 4.3.2. Calibration of qw -w-pg and mathematical model
    fitting To achieve the identification of multiple crack widths, we established
    a calibration relationship and mathematical model between the crack flow rate
    qw, crack width w, and water pressure pg for individual crack. The crack width
    was observed using a crack microscope, while continuously applying load to the
    specimen. A total of nine width values were recorded in the range of 0.28 to 1.23
    mm, and for each crack width, the valve was adjusted to vary the water pressure.
    After the pressure gauge and flow rate values stabilized, we recorded the flow
    rate corresponding to each water pressure at the given crack width. The calibration
    relationship and mathematical model between qw, w, and pg are shown in Fig. 19.
    According to the calibration results, we observed that the flow rate increased
    in a power-law manner with increasing crack width and water pressure. This pattern
    aligned with the trends observed in the experimental cases documented in reference
    [29]. Download : Download high-res image (209KB) Download : Download full-size

    crack monitoring To validate the effectiveness of this method in identifying multiple
    cracks, another specimen was fabricated, as shown in Fig. 16, which indicated
    that the concrete mix proportion and reinforcement were consistent with the calibration
    test. Two cracks were induced by loading the specimen at distances of 60 and 30
    cm from the bottom. After cracking, loading was applied to the middle of the specimen
    to simultaneously expand the widths of the two cracks, resulting in two different
    cases. From the top of the specimen downward, the crack widths for Case 1 were
    0.20 and 0.27 mm, while for Case 2, the crack widths were 0.25 and 0.33 mm. Measurement
    points were arranged at 10 cm intervals, 10 to 80 cm above the bottom of the specimen,
    and tests were conducted for both cases. During testing, the water pressure was
    maintained at 57.8 kPa for both cases. According to the test results, the corresponding
    ξv values were calculated for the measurement points in the two cases, as shown
    in Table 3, and the distribution of ξv along the height of the specimen is presented
    in Fig. 20. Table 3. Values of ξv (10−3) corresponding to the two cases at the
    measurement points. Case Height (cm) Empty Cell 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 1 −1.3978

    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 20. Distribution of ξv along the height
    of the specimen. As shown in Fig. 20, under identical water pressure, the flow
    rate increased with increasing crack width. Therefore, the ξv values for Case
    2 were generally higher than for Case 1. When the measurement points were located
    at heights of 80 and 50 cm, far from the cracks, the cooling rate of the heat
    source at these points was only related to the axial flow velocity, with a larger
    ξv value indicating a higher flow rate within the irrigation pipe. When the measurement
    points were located at the height of the cracks, the ξv values for both cases
    significantly increased due to the enhanced convective heat transfer effect. When
    the measurement points were located below a height of 20 cm, which was unaffected
    by the convective heat transfer effect, the ξv values for both cases were essentially
    identical. According to the above analysis, the distribution of ξv was consistent
    with the pattern observed in the numerical simulation, indicating that the proposed
    method could effectively achieve multi-crack localization. According to the calibration
    results in Section 4.3.1, the ξv values at heights of 80 and 50 cm on the specimen
    were inverted using the fitting equation in Fig. 18 to obtain the flow rates at
    these two locations. Then, the crack flow rates were calculated for each case,
    according to Equation (4). By applying the water pressure and seepage flow rates
    to the calibration equation in Fig. 19, the widths of the two cracks in Cases
    1 and 2 were subsequently inverted. From the top of the specimen downward, the
    inverted crack widths for Case 1 were 0.19 and 0.30 mm, and for Case 2 were 0.23
    and 0.35 mm. The root mean square error (RMSE) between the measured values and
    actual values for the four sets of data was 0.0212 mm, indicating that the measurement
    error was within an acceptable range for engineering applications. This demonstrated
    that the proposed method, based on the optimized scheme, could effectively achieve
    multi-crack localization and width identification. Potential sources for measurement
    errors included: (1) Inconsistent longitudinal gap between the monitoring tube
    and the irrigation pipe. A larger gap correspondingly weakened the convective
    heat transfer effect, resulting in underestimated crack width identification results.
    Therefore, the vertical alignment of the monitoring tube and the irrigation pipe
    was crucial and led to a consistent longitudinal gap between them. (2) Fluctuations
    in the heating power during the heating phase. The temperature rise of the heating
    tube was related to the heating power, and fluctuations in the heating power potentially
    influenced the monitoring results. Therefore, ensuring the stability of the power
    supply was crucial during testing. 5. Discussion In this paper, when the distance
    between two cracks is 30 cm, the monitoring results were satisfactory. When the
    distance between two cracks was relatively small, in one scenario where the spacing
    of measurement points was sufficiently dense, it was still possible to identify
    the positions and quantity of cracks based on the distribution characteristics
    of ξv. However, due to the mutual influence between the cracks, it became challenging
    to accurately identify the axial flow velocity between the two cracks, and consequently,
    the accurate determination of the widths of the two cracks was hindered. Another
    scenario was when the spacing between measurement points was large, resulting
    in the absence of measurement points between two cracks. In this case, the two
    cracks would be identified as a single crack, and the obtained crack width could
    only be used to assess the degree of cracking. During field testing, discrepancies
    might have existed between the irrigation water temperature (Tv) and the ambient
    temperature of underwater concrete (Tθ). Therefore, when the multi-crack identification
    method proposed in this paper was applied for field testing, the impact of temperature
    discrepancies on the cooling law of the heat source was taken into account. In
    cases where significant temperature discrepancies were observed, temperature compensation
    was recommended to be performed when monitoring underwater concrete cracks. Calibration
    tests were conducted at different irrigation water temperatures to establish the
    relationships between ξv, Tv, and Tθ. Subsequently, utilizing the re-calibrated
    discriminant relationships, the crack widths of underwater concrete could be inverted.
    6. Conclusion A new method for identifying multiple cracks in underwater concrete
    was proposed in this work, based on the thermodynamic phenomenon where the flow
    velocity along the irrigation pipe affected convective heat transfer and consequently
    influenced the cooling rate of the heat source in the monitoring tube. First,
    numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the effects of size, axial
    flow velocity in the irrigation pipe, monitoring tube and irrigation pipe combination,
    and heating power on the cooling behavior of the heat source. An optimized monitoring
    scheme was then determined among the five simulated calculation cases based on
    the findings. Calibration between the discrimination index ξv and the axial flow
    velocity, as well as calibration between the seepage rate, crack width, and water
    pressure, was subsequently performed using the optimized scheme. Finally, dual-crack
    detection was carried out according to the proposed multi-crack identification
    method and calibration relationships. Crack inversion was performed for four sets
    of data corresponding to the two cases of dual-crack widths. The following conclusions
    were drawn. (1) The absolute value of the cooling discrimination index ξv increased
    with increasing flow velocity along the irrigation pipe, however, the increasing
    trend gradually slowed down. (2) Increasing the contact area between the monitoring
    tube and the irrigation pipe, as well as their thermal conductivity, enhanced
    the sensitivity of ξv to the axial flow velocity. (3) Calibration results indicated
    that the flow rate increased in a power-law manner with increasing crack width
    and water pressure. (4) Both numerical simulations and model tests showed that
    ξv underwent a sudden change near the cracks, which could be used for crack localization.
    (5) The model test results of dual-crack detection demonstrated good agreement
    between the crack widths inferred by the proposed multi-crack identification method
    and actual crack widths, with an RMSE value of 0.0212 mm. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Precision agricultural (PrA) technology relies on the utilization of
    special equipment to access real time observations on plant health status, chlorophyll,
    nitrogen content, and soil moisture content. In this research new PrA technology
    (i.e., SPAD (Soil Plant Analysis Development), and UAV-based NDVI (Unmanned Aerial
    Vehicle-based Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) were used to monitor maize
    yield based on different filed trials in eastern part of Hungary. Our study aimed
    to examine the utilization of PrA technology specifically SPAD and UAV-based NDVI
    measurements for monitoring maize GY under irrigated and rainfed experimental
    setups in Hungary with varied nitrogen treatment for the year 2022. The results
    showed that the SPAD increased in all treatments (14.7 %; p < 0.05) from V6–V8
    in the rainfed treatments, decreased significantly (p < 0.05) by 13.9 % (R1) and
    30.6 % (R3). However, implementation of irrigation significantly increased the
    SPAD values in majority of treatments. Also, results reveal that, under irrigated
    and rainfed conditions the highest UAV-based NDVI value (0.703, 0.642) was obtained
    in V12 (A120 treatment) and highest NDVI value (0.728, 0.662) was obtained in
    Vn (A120 treatment). Remarekedly, irrigation led to significant differences (p
    < 0.05) of UAV-based NDVI values compared with none irrigated. On the other hand,
    implementation of 120 kg N ha−1 before sowing led to highest GY, especially under
    irrigated conditions (8.649 Mg ha−1). The overall mean GY under rainfed treatment
    was 6.256 Mg ha−1, while under irrigated treatment it increased by 37.2 % and
    reached 8.581 Mg ha−1 (p < 0.05). In conclusion, PrA technology will support farmers
    in making informed decisions regarding fertilization strategies and timing, which
    will in turn maximize yield and minimize risk.

    performanceHungary 1. Introduction Maize is the second most widely grown crop
    globally after wheat and is a key component of animal feed playing a significant
    role in global agri-food systems and securing nutrition [[1], [2], [3]]. The global
    maize production accounts for 197 million ha majorly in Latin America, Asia, and
    Sub-Saharan Africa [2]. Europe is also reported to be a good contributor for maize
    in terms of increasing yield from past two decades [4] sharing 11 % of the world''s
    maize production [2]. The three major crops i.e., wheat, maize, and rice provide
    30% of the dietary calories for more than 4.5 billion people in 94 developing
    countries [5]. With projected world population growth, increasing demand for food
    products and changing diets, increasing the yield, yield stability and quality
    of maize is of key importance [6,7]. The situation is complicated by the loss
    of arable land [8] and increasingly extreme environmental conditions due to climate
    change [[9], [10], [11]]. Numerous climatic extremes including heat stress and
    drought conditions leads to a reduction in cereal grain filling by reducing the
    spikelet fertility and increasing the rate of transpiration ultimately causing
    a significant decline in cereal yield [12]. Frequent occurrence of droughts and
    high temperatures lowers the moisture content, offset the maize plant growth unless
    provided with sufficient irrigation supported with fertilization [13]. It is expected
    that by 2050, there would be a 20 % decline in maize yield under projected climatic
    scenarios of global warming and drought stress [14]. A critical cultivation technology
    component of maize GY improvement is a balanced nutrient supply, with especial
    regard to N-supply [15,16], as it is an essential element of plant biochemical
    and physiological processes [[17], [18], [19]]. Applying the appropriate quantity
    of N fertilizer can help GY growth [20], but applying excessive amounts is wasteful,
    increases costs [21], does not improve GY, impairs water balance, and might cause
    nitrate pollution [22]. Monitoring maize GY largely depends on the reliable information
    about maize leaf chlorophyll content during the growing season that is much needed
    for appropriate application of N-fertilization in plant without environmental
    damage [23,24]. Chlorophyll is the photosynthetic pigment of the plant, playing
    a central role in light absorption, energy conversion and organic synthesis in
    plants [25]. Since chlorophyll content is closely related and correlated with
    leaf nitrogen concentration, and an important indicator for monitoring plant nitrogen
    status, development, growth, and GY [26]. It also provide an opportunity to schedule
    nitrogen fertilizer application and determine the optimal amount [27]. The use
    of PrA technology (refers to an information technology (IT) based farm management
    system) in this regard is indispensable in all types of environmental conditions
    [28]. PrA technology relies on the utilization of special equipment, sensor devices,
    real time kinematic (RTK) and un-named aerial vehicles (UAVs) to access real time
    observations on plant health status, chlorophyll, nitrogen, and soil moisture
    content [29]. Optical sensor devices like Soil Plant Analysis Development (SPAD)
    meter are cost effective and non-destructive handled PrA technology used to monitor
    in situ plant fertilization or N status to assist improving GY prediction [30].
    The SPAD-502 chlorophyll meter is based on the radiation absorption in leaves
    in the red (R) (650 nm) and near-infrared (NIR) (940 nm) range. The 650 or red
    wavelength is correlated with the chlorophyll content in the leaf while 940 or
    NIR provides the detail of leaf moisture content and plant thickness [31]. Previously,
    it has been used in various studies as a PrA tool for effective farm management
    and GY improvement [32]. The relative chlorophyll content values at leaf level
    measured by the instrument are closely related to the leaf N-value and total chlorophyll
    concentration at different developmental stages, as confirmed by numerous researchers
    [16,33]. Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) based multispectral remote sensing technology
    is more advanced PrA technology widely used to extract phenophase information,
    leaf area index (LAI), carotenoid estimation, and SPAD prediction [34,35]. A brief
    review of similar recent applications of PrA technology in different crop management
    practices are presented in Table 1. Table 1. A review of recent studies with PrA
    applications in agricultural management practices. Crops/plants PrA tool Objective

    UAV-NDVI, and RENDVI under different nitrogen treatments at plot level RENDVI
    camera performed better than NDVI in SPAD predictions [44] The optical and thermal
    infrared sensors of UAVs are capable to derive several vegetation indices like
    normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference red edge
    index (NDRE) used to estimate the biomass, chlorophyll, and nitrogen content,
    and predict crop yields in high spatial resolution [44] with flexibility, rapid
    and non-destructive diagnosis [45,46]. It is profitable and cost-effective [47],
    but this can only be achieved by the optimal timing of surveys [48]. However,
    monitoring and measuring the plant chlorophyll and fertilization status from PrA
    technology largely depends on soil moisture content sourced by rainfall in natural
    and irrigation in human developed scenarios [40,49]. Irrigation is a key factor
    that influences the photosynthetic performance of maize due to severe water stress,
    which otherwise can greatly reduce the relative chlorophyll content and net photosynthesis,
    resulting in significant GY loss [50]. Formerly, studies have proven the application
    of SPAD and UAV PrA technology for monitoring GY under stressed and non-stressed
    environment [41,51,52]. For instance, a few studies reported the use of SPAD and
    UAV based measurements for sun-induced chlorophyll and grain yield measurements
    in particular experimental setup in Europe as well [53,54]. Hungary, from central
    Europe experienced moderate to severe drought spells in recent past years with
    unprecedented impacts on maize and wheat yield [[55], [56], [57]]. Specifically,
    the recent drought year of 2022 is well recognized in research [58,59] to cause
    agriculture drought and impact grain yield. In this context, our study aimed to
    examine the utilization of PrA technology specifically SPAD and UAV-based NDVI
    measurements for monitoring maize GY under irrigated and rainfed experimental
    setups in Hungary with varied nitrogen treatment for the year 2022. Specifically,
    we analyzed the correlation between different levels of basal nitrogen and top-dressing
    treatments, irrigation, and chlorophyll content using spectral values (SPAD, UAV-based
    NDVI). It facilitated determining the required amount of N, the timing of its
    application and the influence of irrigation for achieving higher GY. Overall,
    the output of this research provides an effective utilization of PrA technology
    for grain yield monitoring proposing an optimistic future for farm management
    under drought and non-drought conditions to maximize the GY. 2. Materials and
    methods 2.1. Experimental site This research was carried out in central Europe
    within the research station of the University of Debrecen (47° 33′ N, 21° 26′
    E, altitude 111 m) (Fig. 1). The experiment was conducted using factorial design,
    with two-replicate. The main plots were set up with three hybrids (Merida, Armagnac,
    Fornad), split-plots with irrigation (rainfed, irrigated) and split-split-plots
    with nitrogen treatment doses. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download

    Debrecen; B: layout of the basal and top-dressing nitrogen treatment experiment,
    established by A. Széles, 2011). 2.2. Soil data The soil of the experiment can
    be characterized with high clay loam content (42 %) with humic layer (80–100 cm),
    and medium-compaction, and can be classified as lowland calcareous chernozem (Mollisol-Calciustoll
    or Vermustoll, USDA). The average pHKCl is 6.6 and nitrogen N-supply of the soil
    is medium (humus content: 2.6 %, total N = 0.14–0.18 %). The soil is calcareous
    in the upper 80 cm, but moderately calcareous (12 %) from 100 cm. The original
    AL-soluble P2O5 content of the soil is 130 mg/kg and the AL-soluble K2O content
    is 240 mg/kg. 2.3. Experimental design Before sowing, 27 % Genesis CAN (calcium
    ammonium nitrate) was applied. To meet the factorial design, the nitrogen rates
    were split between basal and top-dressing treatments. All nitrogen doses and period
    are presented in Table 2. Table 2. Nitrogen treatments and period for the factorial

    drought in Hungary, irrigation was considered as the second factor. Thus, plots
    were split to irrigated and none irrigated (rainfed). The total irrigation water
    applied was 115 mm, broken down as follows: 25 mm (21st May); 30 mm (13-16th June);
    30 mm (3rd July) and 30 mm (16th July). The maize was sown on 14.04.2022 and harvested
    on 05.10.2022; the plant density was 73 thousand plants/ha. The evaluation was
    carried out using two maize hybrids of the medium maturity group (FAO 400–499).
    Harvested yield GY (t ha−1) was indicated by correcting it for 14 % moisture.
    2.4. An outlook of climate conditions during the experiment In the first month
    of the growing season (April), rainfall was in line with the average for the reference
    period (1981–2010) (54 mm), while temperatures were 2.2 °C lower. Rainfall in
    May and June was 10 mm and 19 mm respectively, only 15 and 29 % of the multiannual
    average (Fig. 2). This was coupled with mean temperatures in May and June that
    were 1 °C and 2.9 °C above the multi-year average. The drought continued in July
    (21 mm) and August (28 mm), and the situation was exacerbated by the fact that
    the monthly mean temperatures for these two months were 2.1 °C and 2.7 °C above
    the multi-year average. September received the highest rainfall (162 mm), more
    than three times of average. (Fig. 2). Overall, the climatic conditions for the
    growing season 2022 (April–September) deviated from the climatic data for the
    reference period (1981–2010). The rainfall of the growing season was below the
    multi-year average (294 mm), accounting for 85 % of the average, and was characterised
    by an inappropriate temporal distribution. The mean temperature was 1 °C above
    the multi-year average (18.5 °C). Download : Download high-res image (292KB) Download

    temperature of the growing season in 2022 and average for the period 1981–2010.
    The temporal pattern of rainfall during the growing season (from sowing to harvesting)
    and the daily mean temperature trends are shown in Fig. 3. Of the 35 days with
    rainfall, 23 days were below 10 mm and 9 days were above 10 mm. Rainfall exceeding
    20 mm was recorded on 3 days. Reflecting the extreme weather conditions, maize
    water requirements at flowering stage (R1) were 4.5–5.5 mm/ha per day, while there
    was only 3 mm of rainfall during the 31 days between phenophases V8 and R1, and
    average temperature also increased significantly (23.7 °C). Between phenophases
    R1-R3, there was 21 mm rainfall with an average temperature of 22.8 °C. Significant
    rainfall occurred after the R6 phenophase (146 mm). Download : Download high-res

    and daily mean temperature trends from sowing to harvest. Hence, Due to less rainfall
    and prevailing drought conditions during the growing season and the unique challenges
    posed by this specific climatic context, a one-year experimental duration was
    deemed fitting to comprehensively capture the impact of varied nitrogen treatments
    in rainfed and irrigated experimental setups. 2.5. PrA instruments and test methods
    2.5.1. The SPAD-502 A Minolta SPAD-502 portable device (Minolta Camera Ltd., Osaka,
    Japan) was used for the non-destructive assessment of leaf chlorophyll content
    [60]. The illumination system of the device contains two photodiodes, one red
    (max 650 nm) and one infrared (max. 940 nm). The two photodiodes emit light alternately
    with equal brightness. The illuminated area is 6 mm2. The two types of light pass
    through the leaf plate and some of it is reflected (reflection), some is absorbed
    (absorption) while the rest penetrates the leaf (transmission). The light that
    penetrates the leaf is picked up by a sensor consisting of a silicone photodiode
    and converted into an analogue electrical signal. The instrument amplifies the
    electrical signal and converts it into a number. The calculation is based on the
    ratio of the intensity of the infrared and red light passing through the leaf.
    The higher the ratio, the more red light is absorbed by the leaves of the plant,
    which is closely related to the chlorophyll content. The SPAD value can range
    from 0 to over 100 [61,62]. SPAD measurements were performed in the phonological
    phases V6, V8, V12, Vn, R1 and R3. Measurements were taken per hybrid per Nitrogen
    treatment, on the 6th, 7th, and 8th plants of the second left row of each plot.
    Between V6 and R1 phenophase on the latest released fully developed leaf, between
    R1-R6 phenophase on the leaf at the ear [63]. 2.5.2. UAV/drone image acquisition
    The UAV-NDVI measurements were performed using a DJI Phantom 4 Pro V2 drone equipped
    with Sentera Double 4K TrueNDVI and TrueNDRE sensors [64] in six phenophases (V6,
    V8, V12, Vn, R1, R3) simultaneously with the SPAD measurements. The flying height
    was set to 80 m. The precise plot boundaries were determined by another PrA instrument
    i.e., Trimble RTK [65]. All georeferenced UAV images were stitched to make orthomosaic
    with a spatial resolution of 2 cm in open source WebODM program for further analysis
    [66]. The other products developed included digital surface model (DSM) and digital
    terrain model (DTM) which were not used in analysis. The orthorectified photos
    were further processes in open source QGIS environment for NDVI measurements.
    For accurate channels (wavelengths) separation, a set of equations were used to
    subtract out the effect of the out of band channels [64]. These includes eq (1)),
    2), and 3): (1) (2) (3) The resulting NDVI images were analyzed in the QGIS environment
    to calculate mean NDVI of each plot using “zonal statistics” function. 2.6. Statistical
    analysis First, the effects of nitrogen treatments on SPAD and UAV-NDVI for irrigated
    and rainfed conditions are examined in Box-plot distribution plots with significant
    *p < 0.5; **p < 0.1; ***p < 0.001 mean difference plotting from Duncan''s test
    in OriginLab [67]. Multivariate factorial analysis of variance ANOVA from generalized
    linear model (GLM) was used to examine the effects of nitrogen treatments, irrigation,
    and hybrid on GY. The comparison of mean values of different treatment practices
    were analyzed using Duncan multiple range test (DMRT) [68] to avoid the accumulation
    of first-order error. The DMRT is a post-hoc statistical analysis to examine the
    significant differences between various treatments of an experimental setup [69].
    It significantly compares the means of all possible pairs of different treatment
    groups. Currently, DMRT is employed in different nitrogen treatments to evaluate
    the pairwise difference in rainfed and irrigated conditions. Within the homogeneous
    group, the grain yields did not differ at 5 % significance level. Furthermore,
    the significant relationship of nitrogen treatment with SPAD and NDVI values were
    examined by parabolic (quadratic) regression analysis. The independent variable
    was nitrogen treatment, and the dependent variables were SPAD and UAV-NDVI. The
    significant relationship was evaluated based on coefficient of determination (R2).
    The correlation between SPAD and grain yield, and UAV-NDVI and grain yield were
    analyzed using bivariate linear regression analysis. The independent variables
    were SPAD and UAV-NDVI, and the dependent variable was grain yield. Here also,
    the significant relationship was evaluated based on the coefficient of determination
    (r2). The statistical evaluation was performed using the latest version of the
    R environment and results are plotted in OriginLab. 3. Results 3.1. Effect of
    nitrogen treatment and irrigation on studied maize indicators During the growing
    season, the SPAD values varied from 23.0 to 48.4 in the rainfed treatment and
    from 24.4 to 51.8 in the irrigated treatment. Under natural rainfall conditions,
    the average SPAD value was 38.5, while under irrigated conditions it was 40.2.
    The highest SPAD values during the whole growing season were obtained under natural
    rainfall conditions with treatment A60 (40.3; p < 0.05) and under irrigated conditions
    with treatment V6150 (45.5; p < 0.05), which resulted in an increase of 18.5 %
    and 39.6 %, respectively, compared to treatment A0 (Fig. 4, Table 3). Download

    value increased in the V6–V8 phenophase period in the rainfed treatment but varied
    upon nitrogen treatment. The most significant increase (20.7 %; p < 0.05) was
    recorded in the V690 treatment which increased the 60 kg N ha−1 basal treatment
    (A60) with an additional 30 kg N ha−1 dose. After the V8 phenological phase, there
    was a decrease in leaf SPAD values (p < 0.05), 13.9 % (R1) and 30.6 % (R3) (Fig.
    5d). In irrigated treatments, SPAD values increased until the V8 phenophase in
    treatments A0, A60 and A120 (p < 0.05), whereas the top-dressing treatments (V690,
    V6150, V12120 and V12180) increased SPAD values up to phenophase R1 (p < 0.05).
    The highest increase up to phenophase V8 was obtained with A120 (22.8 %) and up
    to phenophase R1 with V6150 (50.6 %) (Fig. 5c and e). By the R3 phenophase, SPAD
    values were identical to those measured at the V6 phenophase, averaged over the
    nitrogen treatments (Fig. 5a–g, Table 4). Furthermore, Duncan test revealed highly
    significant (p < 0.001) SPAD value difference in rainfed and irrigated treatment
    in V8 and V12 phenophase is observed in A0 nitrogen treatment (Fig. 4a), R1 and

    detected in treatment A0 in all phenophases, both in the rainfed and irrigated
    treatments. Evaluating the efficiency of the basal nitrogen and top-dressing treatments
    by phenophase showed that the highest value was 41.8 in phenophase V6 (V12120),
    but the Duncan test did not distinguish between SPAD values in different nitrogen
    treatments. In V8 growth stages, the highest SPAD value was measured in the A120
    treatment (47.3), an increase of 10.0 % (p < 0.05) compared to the A0 treatment.
    After V12 phenophase until R3 phenophase, the lowest spring basal nitrogen treatment
    of 60 kg N ha−1 (A60) proved to be effective (p < 0.05). The nitrogen application
    in R3 phenophase had the greatest effect on SPAD value compared to treatment A0
    (44.8 %). The average nitrogen effect was also highest in the R3 phenophase (39.1
    %). In the irrigated treatment, the statistically proven increase in the vegetative
    phase (V6-Vn) was obtained by the A60 treatment (p < 0.05), while in the generative
    phase (R1-R3) by the A120 treatment increased with an additional 30 kg N ha−1
    (V6150). In the vegetative stage, the V12 phenophase (36.5 %) and in the generative
    stage, the R3 phenophase (102.9 %) had the highest nitrogen treatment effect compared
    to the non-nitrogen (A0) treatment (Table 3). On the other hand, implementation
    of irrigation significantly increased the SPAD values in the majority of treatments
    (Table 4). For the control treatment, the irrigation has a significant impact
    only on the early stages V6 (p < 0.5), V8 (p < 0.001), and V12 (p < 0.001). While
    no significant impact was detected on the other stages (Table 4). For the first
    nitrogen level (60 kg N ha−1 before sowing), the irrigation has no effects on
    SPAD values. However, based on the observed values, the irrigation has no effect
    on SPAD values in Vn stage for all nitrogen levels, where it has an impact on
    R1, and R3. All on all, the irrigation has a significant impact on SPAD for all
    phenological phases except for Vn (Table 4). 3.2. Effect of Nitrogen treatments
    and irrigation on the UAV-based NDVI Nitrogen treatments and irrigation affected
    the UAV-based NDVI values. The values varied from 0.364 to 0.662 in the rainfed
    treatment and from 0.348 to 0.728 in the irrigated treatment. The overall experiment
    mean was 0.541. Under natural rainfall, the UAV-based NDVI for maize was 0.518,
    while under irrigated conditions it was 0.564. The measured data showed that the
    highest average value of the NDVI was obtained in A60 (0.538; p < 0.05) in the
    rainfed treatments and A120 (0.623; p < 0.05) in the irrigated treatments, which
    were 12.3 % and 21.9 % increases, respectively, compared to the treatment A0 (Table
    3). In the rainfed treatment, maize reached the highest UAV-based NDVI value in
    V12 and Vn, with increases of 61.9 % and 64.8 %, respectively (Fig. 6a–g, Table
    5). Then, it decreased in R1 and R3 phenophases (11.3 % and 22.3 %). The measured
    data showed that in V12 phenophases, the highest NDVI values (p < 0.05) were obtained
    in treatments A0, A60, V690 and V6150, while in Vn phenophases, the highest values
    were obtained in treatments A120, V12120 and V12180. Download : Download high-res

    effect: ns = not significant, *p < 0.5; **p < 0.1; ***p < 0.001. Also under irrigated
    conditions, the highest UAV-based NDVI was achieved for V12 and Vn phenophases,
    increasing by 72.1 % for the V12 phenophase and 77.7 % for the Vn phenophase.
    The values have decreased in the R1 and R3 growth phase; by 4.3 % between Vn-R1
    and 17.8 % between Vn-R3. Fertilizer treatments also had an influence in this
    case. At the V12 phenophase, treatments A0, V690, V6150 and V12180 had a significant
    effect (p < 0.05) (Fig. 6a–d, e, & g), while the other treatments had the highest
    effect at the Vn phenophase (Fig. 6b,c, & f, Table 5). Overall, Duncan''s test
    revealed a highly significant (p < 0.001) difference in rainfed and irrigated
    high NDVI values in V12 and Vn phenophase in A60, A120, and V690 nitrogen treatments
    (Fig. 6b, c, & d). Under natural rainfall conditions, the A120 treatment was proven
    to provide the highest UAV-based NDVI value (p < 0.05) throughout the vegetation
    period. Between treatments, the largest increase was recoreded in A120 (38.4 %)
    in the R3 phenophase compared with control one. Under irrigated conditions, the
    result of treatment A60 showed the highest UAV-based NDVI value. Over all the
    highest UAV-based NDVI value were recoreded in A120 (Table 5). Similar to SPAD,
    the UAV-based NDVI value positively affected by irrigation. Irrigation had a positively
    significant effect on the average of treatments based on different phenological
    phases. For A60 and A120 irrigation had a distinct and substantial impact on UAV-based
    NDVI in all phenological phases (Table 5). Under other nitrogen treatments, the
    impact of irrigation on the UAV-based NDVI was inconsistent; it affected certain
    phenological stages while leaving others unaffected. However the average value
    showed that irrigation has significant impact on UAV-based NDVI under all phenological
    phases except for V6. 3.3. Effect of Nitrogen treatments and irrigation on grain
    yield Under rainfed treatments, the A0 provided the lowest GY (4.2 Mg ha−1), which
    was well separated from the other treatments by Duncan''s test (Table 3, Fig.
    3). The 60 kg N ha−1 (A60) resulted in an increase of GY by 64.7 % (p < 0.05).
    This treatment did not increase GY at the 6-leaf stage when increased with an
    additional 30 kg N ha−1 nitrogen rate (V690), and no significant increase was
    measured when an additional 30 kg N ha−1 nitrogen rate was applied at the 12-leaf
    stage (V12120). Treatment A120 provided the largest GY increase (8.649 Mg ha−1),
    which was more than double of the GY of treatment A0 (p < 0.05). However, top-dressing
    treatments above the basal 120 kg N ha−1 resulted in a significant GY reduction
    (p < 0.05). Under irrigated conditions, the lowest GY in terms of nitrogen (5.149
    Mg ha−1) was measured in the A0 treatment. The 60 kg N ha−1 (A60) applied as a
    basal treatment resulted in a GY increase of 4.755 Mg ha−1 (92.3 %; p < 0.05),
    and the 120 kg N ha−1 basal treatment (A120) resulted in a GY increase of 6.715
    Mg ha−1 (130.4 %; p < 0.05) compared to the A0 treatment. Increasing the A60 treatment
    at V6 phenophase with a +30 kg N ha−1 (V690) resulted in a GY increase of only
    3.2 %. Then, at 12-leaf stage, application of an additional 30 kg N ha−1 (V12120)
    reduced GY (−1.363, Mg ha−1; p < 0.05). Compared to the A120 treatment, the effect
    of applying top-dressing (V6150) was minimal on GY reduction. An additional 30
    kg N ha−1 application (V12180) caused further GY reduction (−0.629 Mg ha−1; p
    < 0.05). The 120 kg N ha−1 basal treatment (11.863 Mg ha−1) was found to have
    a reliable GY enhancing effect (Table 3, Fig. 3). The main average yield was 7.419
    Mg ha−1 (rainfed, irrigated). The irrigated variant had a higher average yield
    (8.581 Mg ha−1) (p < 0.05), which was 37.2 % higher than the rainfed version (6.256
    Mg ha−1). In all nitrogen treatments, the irrigated variants provided higher grain
    yields. 3.4. Interaction between yield and different experimental variables Based
    on the factorial ANOVA from GLM analysis (Table 6) different factors with a significant
    impact on GY are identified. Table 6 showed that nitrogen treatments, irrigation,
    and hybrid had a significant impact (p < 0.05), however, the phenological phases
    did not exhibited any impact on GY. Analysis of variance results of chlorophyll
    content expressed as SPAD values in maize hybrids in rainfed and irrigated treatments
    showed that the main factors (nitrogen treatments and irrigation) were strongly
    (p < 0.001) correlated to the development of SPAD values (Table 6). The interaction
    between all variables presented in Fig. 6 revealed the highest rainfed GY (8.6
    Mg ha−1) with the highest NDVI (0.56) and irrigated GY (11.86 Mg ha−1) with the
    highest NDVI (0.62) was obtained under A120 nitrogen treatment (Fig. 7c & f).
    The highest rainfed SPAD value (40.6) is also obtained in A120 nitrogen treatment
    while highest irrigated SPAD value (45.5) is obtained in V6150 nitrogen treatment
    (Fig. 7i). The highest average SPAD value was recorded under irrigated treatment
    (42.9) compared with rainfed (39.7) (Fig. 7h). For GY, the irrigated average treatments
    exceeded the rainfed, while the best GY value were reached with A120 treatments.

    of spectral indexes with nitrogen treatment SPAD and UAV-based NDVI values recorded
    in phenophases were compared with basal nitrogen treatment and top-dressing treatments
    using parabolic regression-analysis (Fig. 9, Fig. 10). The relationship between
    SPAD and applied amount of nitrogen showed that nitrogen application positively
    influenced SPAD in rainfed and irrigated treatments during the growing season.
    Under natural rainfall conditions, the relationship was weakly positive in the
    V6 phenophase (R2 = 0.17**) and nitrogen treatment influenced the SPAD value in
    17.0 %. The relationship between the two variables became stronger for the V8
    phenophase (R2 = 0.4***) and further strengthened for the R1 phenophase (R2 =
    0.47***). A stronger relationship (R2 = 0.67***) was observed for the R3 phenophase,
    with a 67 % influence of nitrogen treatment. Under irrigated conditions, similar
    to the rainfed treatment, the relationship was weak (R2 = 0.23**) for the V6 phenophase
    and became stronger (R2 = 0.83***) in R1 and R3 phenophase. Hence, in R1 and R3
    developmental stages, the influence of nitrogen treatment was the most significant
    (83 % and 83 %) (Fig. 9). Download : Download high-res image (590KB) Download

    Fig. 10. Correlation between N nitrogen treatment and UAV-based NDVI under rainfed
    and irrigated conditions, 2022. The relationship between the UAV-based NDVI values
    and nitrogen application at natural rainfall was moderately close and closely
    correlated in the V12, R1, and R3 phenophases. The strongest correlation was observed
    at the R3 developmental stage (R2 = 0.8***). Under irrigated treatment, the parabolic
    relationship between the two variables was weak at the V6 phenophase and became
    increasingly stronger. It reached to its maximum at R3 phenophase (R2 = 0.82***).
    In this case, the differences between irrigated and rainfed treatments were lower
    than for SPAD (Fig. 10). 3.6. Relationship of spectral indexes with grain yield
    The significant relationship between grain yield and SPAD value under natural
    rainfall conditions was found to be weak to medium until silking (R1) phenophase.
    Furthermore, it improved to a medium level (r2 = 0.51***) by the R3 phenophase.
    For irrigated conditions, it was found to be strongest in R1 phenophase (r2 =
    0.62***) (Fig. 11). Download : Download high-res image (712KB) Download : Download

    improved maize (Zea mays L.) yield. Determining the amount and effective application
    timing of basal and top-dressing fertilizer to achieve optimal grain yields is
    a key research issue under drought stressed environmental conditions. To explore
    the issue, our research effectively utilized PrA technology including Soil Plant
    Analysis Development (SPAD) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV-NDVI) measurements
    in a specified experimental scenario. Under current ongoing climate change, drought
    is considered as one of the natural hazards that has a direct impact on crop production.
    In this context, maize is one of the crops that is directly affected by drought
    and heat waves due to its origin [70]. Many studies reported the sensitivity of
    maize to drought [14,71]. In Hungary, Mohammed, Alsafadi [55] also reported that
    maize is more prone to drought events compare to wheat. The experimental year
    2022 proved to be a record-breaking for extreme weather events with significant
    impacts on agriculture potential of the region [72,73]. Hence meaningful PrA results
    are provided by our research for maize production monitoring under the rainfed
    and irrigated setups in the region. The major findings of the study revealed that
    the SPAD values are highly dependent upon the effects of N-fertilization treatments
    in irrigated and rainfed environments with significant high SPAD values (40.3;
    p < 0.05) reported under rainfed conditions with treatment A60 and (45.5; p <
    0.05) under irrigated condition with treatment V6150 (Table 3, Fig. 4). Formerly,
    János [74] also reported a high SPAD value under irrigated treatment compared
    to low SPAD in non-irrigated treatments. Our research output also reported that
    115 mm irrigated treatment did not reach on average the maximum SPAD range of
    52–56 recommended by Piekielek, Fox [75]. Under rainfed conditions, the early
    top-dressing (V6) suggested by Jaynes [76] had its effect and there was a significant
    (p < 0.05) increase for all nutrient levels for the V8 phenophase. Furthermore,
    in agreement with other research findings [77,78], Following V8 phenophase, water
    deficit significantly (p < 0.05) reduced SPAD, which did not contribute to greater
    accumulation of pre-R1 dry matter. Furthermore, V12 and R3 phenophases had the
    highest effects of fertilizers compared to (A0) treatment. Phenophase analysis
    further revealed that under irrigated conditions in V12 phenophase, maize leaves
    had higher SPAD values than in the rainfed treatment (Table 4, Fig. 5). Due to
    irrigation and top-dressing treatments applied at V6 and V12 phenophases, the
    highest SPAD value developed at silking (R1) stage, the highest increase was observed
    with the V6150 treatment. Like SPAD, the UAV-based NDVI values averaged low i.e.,
    0.518 in the rainfed treatment and high i.e., 0.564 in the irrigated treatment,
    with a significant difference between the two treatments (p < 0.001) as also reported
    by Zhang, Han [79]. Significantly (p < 0.05) highest UAV-based NDVI values over
    the entire growing season in rainfed and irrigated treatments were detected in
    V12 and Vn phenophase with treatment A120 and proved to be most effective for
    achieving high GY (Table 5, Fig. 6). The correlation analysis of GY and UAV-NDVI
    spectral values in agreement with [80] revealed that the early growth stages (V6
    and V8) show a weaker correlation with GY while (V12 and Vn) showed a strong correlation
    with GY. Further research findings exposed that due to extreme weather anomalies
    in 2022, top-dressing had no GY enhancement reflecting the findings of Venterea
    and Coulter [81], as the water stress reduced the transpiration of plants causing
    a decline in N uptake to leaf [33,82]. For instance Ref. [57], also reported that
    several precipitation characteristics including onset and cessation dates, and
    rainy days frequency tend to impact the maize yield in different climatic scenarios
    in Hungary. Another recent study by Rawat, Sharda [83] suggested the significant
    role of climate (in terms of severe heat and less rain) for maize yield predictions.
    Moreover, the negative impact of high temperature is also reported by Liu, Yu
    [84] reducing the chlorophyll index and net photosynthetic rate shortening the
    kernel filling duration. Recent historical climatic conditions of the EU substantially
    impacted the maize yield in rainfed and irrigated conditions with varying fertilization
    treatments [85]. Currently, our findings revealed that the highest grain yields
    were obtained with the application of the spring basal treatment (A120), that
    is in agreement with the results of Drury, Reynolds [86] in both the rainfed and
    irrigated treatments. Moreover, significant (p < 0.001) irrigation effects were
    detected at all nutrient levels with the most significant effect in the V6120
    treatment compared to the A0 treatment. Overall, the coefficient of determination
    R2 of N-nitrogen treatment with both SPAD and NDVI are significantly (p < 0.001)
    strong in irrigated condition compared to rainfed condition except for phenophase
    6 where they have weak correlation (Fig. 9, Fig. 10). Hence, SPAD and NDVI are
    more recommendable to predict maize GY under irrigated condition. From these results,
    the sequence of SPAD correlation with maize GY based on R2 in irrigated conditions
    is as: R1 (0.62) > V12 (0.59) > R3 (0.51) > V8 (0.5) > Vn (0.27) > V6 (0.23) and
    the sequence of NDVI with maize GY is as: R3 > (0.75) > R1 (0.62) > Vn, V12 (0.52)
    > V8 (0.4) > V6 (0.1) (Fig. 11, Fig. 12). Overall, the results of the correlation
    between SPAD and NDVI spectral values and GY agree with other research findings
    [87,88]. Hence, we can conclude that spectral response at regenerative phenophase
    (R1 and R3) are recommendable for GY estimation [80,89]. Our research provides
    a meaningful analysis of PrA technology for effective farm management under irrigated
    and rainfed conditions in drought or stressed environmental condition, however,
    the results of study could be more comparable by using other UAV indices as used
    in other studies [[90], [91], [92]]. 5. Conclusions In the last few decades, the
    agricultural sector has experienced significant advancements by integration of
    advanced agricultural research and technology. Among them, PrA is one of the new
    technologies that are involved in agricultural production. PrA is one of the supporting
    tools that help to improve agricultural production and monitor plant health to
    achieve the maximum yield. In this research, SPAD and UAV-based NDVI were used
    to monitor maize growth in Hungary. The output of thus research can be summarized
    as follow: 1 Different fertilization levels in different maize growing stage led
    to significant differences (p < 0.05) in SPAD, UAV-based NDVI, and GY between
    rainfed and irrigated treatments. 2 Irrigation had increased the yield of maize
    significantly (p < 0.05) in all treatments. 3 SPAD increased in all treatments
    in the V6–V8 phenophase period under rainfed conditions. However, implementation
    of irrigation significantly increased the SPAD values in the majority of treatments.
    4 Under irrigated and rainfed conditions the highest UAV-based NDVI value (0.703,
    0.642) was obtained in V12 (A120 treatment) and highest NDVI value (0.728, 0.662)
    was obtained in Vn (A120 treatment), thus it is'' recommended to use UAV-based
    NDVI in these stages. 5 Irrigation led to significant differences (p < 0.05) of
    UAV-based NDVI values compared with none irrigated. 6 Based on the output of this
    research, implementation of 120 kg N ha−1 before sowing led to highest GY, especially
    under irrigated conditions (8.649 Mg ha−1). On the other hand, both Fertilization*irrigation
    had a positive significant impact on GY. 7 The highest correlation was obtained
    between fertilization and UAV-based NDVI (r = 0.8) under irrigated conditions
    in R3 maize growing stage. A similar pattern emerged where the highest correlation
    between UAV-based NDVI and GY was obtained in R3, also under irrigated conditions.
    Overall, this research recommends using irrigation with 120 kg N ha−1 before sowing
    to increase the maize yield, however more research is needed to confirm this recommendation.
    Also, monitoring the crop using PrA, could indicate potential yield. In this sense,
    high correlation between UAV-based NDVI in R3 stages could reflect high SPAD value
    and potential high yield. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare
    that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships

  description: 'Considering the major role of vegetables in the transmission of gastrointestinal
    diseases, investigation of the presence of gastrointestinal viruses is particularly
    important for public health. Additionally, monitoring and investigating potential
    points of contamination at various stages of cultivation, harvesting, and distribution
    can be important in identifying the sources of transmission. This study was conducted
    with the aim of identifying norovirus, adenovirus, hepatitis A virus, hepatitis
    E virus, rotaviruses, and astroviruses in vegetable samples from the fields and
    fruit and vegetable centers of Tehran City, and to investigate their presence
    in irrigation water by RT-qPCR. This study was carried out in two phases: initial
    and supplementary. During phase I, a total of 3 farms and 5 fruit and vegetable
    centers and a total of 35 samples from farms, 102 samples from fruit and vegetable
    centers and 8 agricultural water samples were collected. Zero, 16 and 1 samples
    were positive for at least one of the viruses from each of the sources, respectively.
    During phase II, 88 samples from 23 farms, 226 samples from 50 fruit and vegetable
    centers and 16 irrigation water samples were collected, with 23, 57 and 4 samples
    were positive for at least one virus, respectively. Rotavirus was the most frequently
    identified virus among the samples, followed by NoV GII, NoV GI, AstV, and AdV.
    HAV and HEV were not detected in any of the tested samples. The results of this
    study suggest that there may be a wide presence of viruses in vegetables, farms,
    and fruit and vegetable centers in Tehran City, which could have significant consequences
    considering the fact that many of these foods are consumed raw. Additionally,
    the detection of some of these viruses in irrigation water suggests that this
    may be a potential route for viral contamination of produce.'

    from farms and markets tested positive for at least one virus. • Rotavirus was
    most frequently identified, followed by norovirus genogroups II and I. • Irrigation
    water contamination suggests pre-harvest viral transmission to produce. • Results
    indicate the need for enhanced viral monitoring and prevention across the Iranian
    food chain. Abstract Considering the major role of vegetables in the transmission
    of gastrointestinal diseases, investigation of the presence of gastrointestinal
    viruses is particularly important for public health. Additionally, monitoring
    and investigating potential points of contamination at various stages of cultivation,
    harvesting, and distribution can be important in identifying the sources of transmission.
    This study was conducted with the aim of identifying norovirus, adenovirus, hepatitis
    A virus, hepatitis E virus, rotaviruses, and astroviruses in vegetable samples
    from the fields and fruit and vegetable centers of Tehran City, and to investigate
    their presence in irrigation water by RT-qPCR. This study was carried out in two
    phases: initial and supplementary. During phase I, a total of 3 farms and 5 fruit
    and vegetable centers and a total of 35 samples from farms, 102 samples from fruit
    and vegetable centers and 8 agricultural water samples were collected. Zero, 16
    and 1 samples were positive for at least one of the viruses from each of the sources,
    respectively. During phase II, 88 samples from 23 farms, 226 samples from 50 fruit
    and vegetable centers and 16 irrigation water samples were collected, with 23,
    57 and 4 samples were positive for at least one virus, respectively. Rotavirus
    was the most frequently identified virus among the samples, followed by NoV GII,
    NoV GI, AstV, and AdV. HAV and HEV were not detected in any of the tested samples.
    The results of this study suggest that there may be a wide presence of viruses
    in vegetables, farms, and fruit and vegetable centers in Tehran City, which could
    have significant consequences considering the fact that many of these foods are
    consumed raw. Additionally, the detection of some of these viruses in irrigation
    water suggests that this may be a potential route for viral contamination of produce.

    Introduction Food has been recognized as a route of disease transmission for over
    a century when poliomyelitis outbreaks were associated with raw milk (Jubb, 1915).
    While the prevalence of food-borne diseases in the world has increased in recent
    years, increasing focus has been directed at foodborne viruses, as they have been
    estimated to be the leading cause of foodborne illness. Many of the most prevalent
    foodborne viruses are transmitted primarily via the fecal-oral route (Greening
    and Cannon, 2016). Norovirus (NoV), sapovirus (SaV), enteroviruses (EV), adenoviruses
    (AdV), hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis E virus (HEV), rotavirus (RV), and astroviruses
    (AstV) have all been associated with foodborne disease outbreaks and are shed
    in feces (Greening and Cannon, 2016). Among these viruses, norovirus is the leading
    cause of foodborne illnesses (Kirk et al., 2015; Scallan et al., 2011). In addition,
    the presence of fresh produce in food outbreaks has recently increased (Gould
    et al., 2013; Miranda and Schaffner, 2019; Torok et al., 2019). An estimates in
    2013 suggest that the consumption of leafy vegetables and fruits-nuts leads to
    35 % and 15 % of viral outbreaks, respectively (Painter et al., 2013). Moreover,
    an examination of data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention''s
    Foodborne Disease Outbreak Surveillance System during the period of 1998 to 2013
    revealed interesting trends. The analysis demonstrated an increase in the proportion
    of outbreaks attributed to raw produce over time. Specifically, the percentage
    rose from 8 % in the years 1998 to 2001 to 16 % in the years 2010 to 2013. Among
    the outbreaks involving raw produce, vegetable row crops were most commonly implicated
    (38 %), followed by fruits (35 %) and seeded vegetables (11 %) (Bennett et al.,
    2018). Furthermore, a recent literature review that focused on healthcare-associated
    foodborne outbreaks found that vegetables and fruits were frequently reported
    as the implicated foods in these settings (25 %). These food categories were also
    associated with the highest number of case-patients, accounting for 1308 out of
    3802 cases (35 %) (Boone et al., 2021). This also corresponds to the increased
    consumption of leafy greens by populations in worldwide (Little and Gillespie,
    2008; Yahia et al., 2019). Leafy greens are often consumed raw or semi-cooked
    with minimal washing, making illness with any pathogens more likely if vegetable
    contamination occurs. Foodborne viruses can contaminate produce at any point from
    pre-harvest to post-harvest, including during preparation. Major contamination
    routes are irrigation water and improper food handler hygiene. Studies demonstrate
    that the lack of hygiene during food handling is a key risk factor for transmission,
    as demonstrated by research in New Zealand and the Netherlands linking poor hygiene
    to outbreaks of norovirus and rotavirus, respectively (de Wit et al., 2003; Thornley
    et al., 2013). Though contamination can occur throughout the supply chain, multiple
    studies from Argentina (Prez et al., 2018), South Korea (Cheong et al., 2009;
    Shin et al., 2019), Spain (Truchado et al., 2021), and two recent studies in Egypt
    (Shaheen et al., 2019; Shaheen et al., 2022) detected enteric viruses like NoV,
    AstV, RV, EV, HAV, and AdV on vegetable surfaces and in irrigation water. This
    further highlights the risk of viral contamination during agriculture via irrigation
    water and poor hygiene practices. Overall, produce can be contaminated with viruses
    at nearly any point from farm to fork, underscoring the need for improved safety
    practices throughout the food production and handling system (Greening and Cannon,
    2016). Iran, with its diverse climatic conditions and agricultural practices,
    provides a unique environment for studying the interactions between pathogens
    and vegetables. Tehran, the capital of Iran, stands as the country''s largest
    and most populous city, covering an area of approximately 11,000 km2 and housing
    a population of about 14 million. This city is located on the slopes of the Alborz
    range, which is favorable in terms of climate. A fertile plain to the south presents
    opportunities for agriculture because of the presence of springs, rivers, and
    wells in this area. However, climate change and the depletion of certain water
    sources have compelled farmers to resort to water with high pollution risk, such
    as sewage water or water contaminated with sewage from city canals. Limited research
    has been conducted on vegetable contamination in Iran, which is the predominant
    focus of these studies on bacterial and parasitic pathogens (Azimirad et al.,
    2021; Fallah et al., 2016; Fatemi et al., 2022; Javanmard et al., 2019; Yahaghi
    et al., 2014). The purpose of this study was to investigate the presence of NoV
    genogroups I (GI) and II (GII), RV, AstV, AdV, HAV, and HEV in vegetable samples
    collected from farms and fruit and vegetable centers, along with irrigation water
    in Tehran, Iran. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Background and sample collection
    This study was conducted in Tehran, Iran, in two phases: Phase I, a pilot study
    to validate the methodology and select sample types, and Phase II, a comprehensive
    study. In Phase I, five types of leafy green vegetables (parsley, basil, watercress,
    lettuce, and spinach) were collected from farms in the south of Tehran and Fruit
    and Vegetable Centers (FVCs) (Fig. 1). Over the course of seven months from September
    2020 to March 2021 (Phase I), a total of 145 vegetable and 8 irrigation water
    samples were collected. Approximately 8 samples were collected from farms each
    month during Phase I, except for January, February and March when no farm samples
    were taken. Additionally, around 15 samples were collected from fruit and vegetable
    centers (FVCs) each month in Phase I. In Phase II, which spanned from April to
    August 2021, the focus expanded to include 23 farms and 50 FVCs, with particular
    attention to lettuce and parsley. In this phase, an average of 18 samples per
    month was collected from farms and 45 samples per month from FVCs (Table 1). All
    farms in Phase II were situated within seven agricultural regions of Tehran Province
    (Varamin, Shahr-e-rey, Kahrizak, Jahan Abad, Chahardangeh, Shahriar, and Baghstan)
    and contributed significantly to the vegetable supply in Tehran (Fig. 1). A total
    of 88 samples were collected from the selected farms, along with 16 irrigation
    water samples from these farms, across the seven agricultural regions (Table S1).
    Additionally, the samples were gathered from 226 fruit and vegetable distribution
    centers situated across 22 districts within Tehran. This endeavor was undertaken
    within each geographical zone, with the number of sampling centers ranging from
    1 to 3, proportional to the size of the respective area (Fig. 1, Table S1). The
    study, encompassing both Phases I and II, involved analyzing a total of 475 samples,
    including 123 from farms, 328 from FVCs, and 24 water samples (Table S1). Download

    on the farm. For FVCs, samplers completed a questionnaire while purchasing samples
    to assess the health and quality of available products. All collected samples
    were stored in sterile boxes at 4 °C and transferred to the Virology Laboratory
    of the Research Institute of Gastrointestinal and Liver Diseases (RIGLD) for the
    viral concentration and detection process within 24 h. 2.2. Process controls and
    virus recovery Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) was used to evaluate virus recovery
    from our concentration and detection assays as previously reported (Rafieepoor
    et al., 2022). To assess recovery from water samples, 2 L of autoclaved irrigation
    water was inoculated with 100 μL of IBV suspension containing 1.5 × 106 TCID50
    prior to concentration using a slightly modified version of ISO 15216-2:2019.
    Fresh produce samples of lettuce and parsley were also tested. Leaves were chopped
    into small pieces and 50 g portions were thoroughly washed and exposed to ultraviolet
    light for 20 min. Each produce sample was then divided in half under sterile conditions.
    One-half was inoculated with the same amount of IBV prior to concentration. The
    other half served as an uninoculated control. The recovery efficiency of IBV from
    the inoculated samples was determined as described in the ISO protocol. Additionally,
    representative lettuce and parsley samples collected during the study period were
    each inoculated with IBV as a sample process control virus to validate the full
    concentration and detection process. 2.3. Elution and concentration Any viruses
    present on the surface of vegetables were isolated and concentrated using a TGBE
    elution buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM glycine, 3 % beef extract, pH 9.5) and
    polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation as previously reported (Dubois et al.,
    2002). Briefly, each vegetable sample (25 g) was cut into 2.5 × 2.5 cm2 pieces,
    placed in a sterile plastic bag, and shaken gently with 40 ml of TGBE buffer for
    20 min. The resulting mixture was then passed through Whatman filters (Whatman
    Grade 41, Fast Ashless filter paper, 150 mm circle, 1441–150) for clarification,
    removing debris. After centrifugation, the supernatant was collected and adjusted
    to pH 7.0 using 6 M HCl. According to the ISO 15216-2:2019 guidelines, polyethylene
    glycol (PEG) 6000 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) and NaCl were added to the samples
    to reach final concentrations of 10 % (wt/vol) and 0.3 M, respectively. The samples
    were incubated with a shaker overnight at 4 °C, followed by centrifugation at
    11,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C, and the pellet storage at −70 °C in 200 μL of PBS
    (pH 7.4). For water samples, 1.5 l were collected and concentrated using the Katayama
    electronegative method with some modifications (Katayama et al., 2002). The samples
    were passed through 47 mm nitrocellulose filters (Sartorious) with 0.45 μm pore
    size after adding MgCl2 with a final concentration of 25 mM. The nitrocellulose
    filter was washed with 200 ml of 0.5 mM H2SO4, and then an elution buffer consisting
    of 10 ml of NaOH (0.1 mM) was passed through the filter to elute the viruses.
    The elution buffer was neutralized with 100 μL of Tris-EDTA and 50 μL of H2SO4
    (100 mM) in a centrifuge tube. In the second stage, PEG 6000 (12.5 %) and NaCl
    (2.5 %) were used. The samples were placed on a mixer at 300 rpm at 4 °C overnight,
    followed by centrifugation at 11,000 ×g for 30 min at 4 °C and pellets storage
    at −70 °C in 200 μL of PBS. 2.4. Nucleic acids extraction and cDNA synthesis Nucleic
    acid extraction and cDNA synthesis were performed on both vegetable and water
    samples using commercial kits. The viral RNA or DNA was extracted from 140 μl
    of the final concentrated dissolved pellet suspension using the QIAamp viral RNA
    mini kit (Qiagen Inc., Hilden, Germany), which allowed simultaneous purification
    of RNA and DNA from the samples. The extracted RNA was then converted into cDNA
    using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis kit, according to the manufacturer''s
    instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The extracted RNA and cDNA were
    stored at −70 °C and − 20 °C, respectively, until further use. 2.5. Molecular
    detection of viruses 2.5.1. AstV, RV, NoV GI, NoV GII, AdV detection assays To
    detect enteric viruses, a multiplex qPCR method was employed, which was designed
    and optimized by van Maarseveen et al. (2010). Briefly, the method involved two
    multiplex qPCR reactions. The first assay targeted AstV, RV, NoV GI, and the second
    assay targeted AdV, NoV GII (Table S2). In this RT-qPCR assay, Equine Arteritis
    Virus (EAV) and Phocine Herpes Virus (PhHV) nucleotide sequences were utilized
    as molecular process controls in each reaction, respectively. These controls were
    employed as internal controls within the samples to monitor the nucleic acid isolation
    procedure and detect any inhibition of amplification. The reactions were carried
    out in 25 μL reaction mixtures containing specific amounts of primers, probes,
    RealQ Plus 2× Master Mix for Probe (Ampliqon, Denmark), and 5 μL of cDNA. Both
    multiplex assays were run with universal thermal cycling parameters on a Rotor-Gene
    Q MDx thermal cycler (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) (Table S2). In case of positive
    control, plasmids were synthesis for targeting DNA and RNA fragments of each virus,
    and for negative control, nuclease-free water were used. Serial dilutions of plasmids
    were prepared to obtain standard curves for each virus studied. 2.5.2. HAV and
    HEV detection assay To detect the presence of Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and Hepatitis
    E virus (HEV) in the collected samples, single qPCR amplification was performed
    based on the primers, probes, and conditions described by Gardner et al. (2003)
    and Jothikumar et al. (2006) was performed. To validate and further investigate
    the initial results, nested PCR was employed due to its higher sensitivity and
    specificity of detection. The nested PCR assays from Tallo et al. (2003) for HAV
    and Inoue et al. (2006) for HEV were performed in two rounds of amplification
    over 40 total cycles to enable detection of viral sequences at lower levels than
    conventional PCR. Thermal cycling for both qPCR and nested PCR was performed using
    optimized instruments - a Rotor-Gene Q MDx thermal cycler (QIAGEN) was used for
    qPCR while an Eppendorf MasterCycler epGradient Cycler Thermo (Model 5341) performed
    the nested PCR thermal profile. 2.5.3. IBV detection assay The SYBR green qPCR
    assay used for detection of Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) previously was published
    (Rafieepoor et al., 2022). The quantification of IBV RNA was performed by generating
    standard curves using serial dilution. The RNA used for the standard curves was
    extracted from the Massachusetts H120 vaccine strain. The resulting standard curve
    exhibited a linear dynamic range spanning from 102 to 106 copies for IBV (y =
    −3.710× + 41.110, R2 = 0.99). 2.6. Statistical analysis The collected data was
    analyzed using SPSS software (version 20, IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA). Descriptive
    statistics, including means, standard deviations, frequencies, and percentages,
    were calculated to summarize the demographic characteristics of the study population
    and the prevalence of foodborne viruses. Chi-square analysis was performed to
    examine associations between variables, such as the presence of foodborne viruses
    and study phases, as well as the types of leafy green vegetables and seasonal
    variations in virus detection examined. The significance level was set at p <
    0.05. The results were interpreted alongside laboratory experiments and other
    relevant data to provide a comprehensive understanding of virus prevalence and
    distribution. 3. Results 3.1. Process control and IBV recovery The mean recoveries
    of IBV in the spiked experiment using irrigation water, lettuce, and parsley samples
    were as follows: irrigation water exhibited a mean recovery of 3.36 × 105 ± 1.35
    × 105 GC/g (22.4 %), lettuce had a mean recovery of 3.24 × 105 ± 1.21 × 105 GC/g
    (21.6 %), and parsley showed a mean recovery of 3.16 × 10^5 ± 4.8 × 10^4 GC/L
    (21.1 %). 3.2. Detection of enteric viruses Leafy green vegetables were collected
    from farms, and FVCs, and irrigation water in Tehran, Iran, between September
    2020 and August 2021. The presence of foodborne viruses was determined using qPCR,
    with 16 out of 145 samples (12.97 %) testing positive in phase I and 67 out of
    330 samples (20.30 %) testing positive in phase II (Table 2). The most frequently
    detected virus overall was RV (10.7 %), followed by NoV GII (3.15 %), NoV GI (2.5
    %), AstV (1.05 %), and AdV (0.21 %) (Fig. 2). HAV and HEV were not detected in
    any of the samples. Table 2. Etiological Prevalence of Foodborne Viruses in Fresh

    Fig. 2. The percentage of genomes of different viruses among the contaminated
    samples. The results showed that for Rotavirus, 48 positive samples were quantified
    from the collections mentioned above. The concentration ranged from 1.64 × 101
    to 4.03 × 103 GC/g, with a mean concentration of 2.52 × 102 ± 5.89 × 102 GC/g
    (mean ± SD). Only 3 water samples were positive for Rotavirus, with a concentration
    range of 9.824 × 102 to 4.076 × 103 GC/L and a mean of 2.4281 × 103 ± 1.557 ×
    103 GC/L (mean ± SD). For Astrovirus, five positive samples were quantified ranging
    in concentration from 8.66 × 101 to 2.39 × 102 GC/g, with a mean of 1.4 × 102
    ± 6.08 × 101 GC/g (mean ± SD). Ten samples were positive for Noroviruses genogroup
    I with concentrations between 6.69 × 101 to 2.632 × 103 GC/g and a mean of 5.999
    × 102 ± 8.457 × 102 GC/g (mean ± SD). Only one water sample was positive for Norovirus
    genogroup I at a concentration of 9.12 × 101 GC/L. Finally, for Noroviruses genogroup
    II, 14 positive samples had concentrations from 7.75 to 2.926 × 103 GC/g and a
    mean of 6.663 × 102 ± 9.258 × 102 GC/g (mean ± SD). Interestingly, the detection
    rate for NoV GI and GII was significantly higher in phase I (P = 0.005), while
    AstV and RV were more frequently detected in phase II (P < 0.001) (Fig. 3). This
    may be attributed to the seasonal increase in NoV transmission, which commonly
    occurs during the winter months (CDC, 2023). In phase I, viral contamination was
    not detected in the farm samples, except for one irrigation water sample contaminated
    with NoV GI. Additionally, the contamination in FVCs was much lower compared to
    phase II (Table 2). Out of the five FVCs sampled in phase I, viruses were detected
    in four of them. In November 2020, out of 30 samples collected from four FVCs,
    2 samples were contaminated with NoV GI and 9 samples with NoV GII, indicating
    widespread contamination in distributed fresh produce. However, widespread contamination
    was not observed in other months, with only one sample contaminated with AdV in
    October and one contaminated sample with NoV GI detected in March (Fig. 3). Download

    farms, viruses were detected in 19 samples (Table 2). The contaminated samples
    were detected in 15 farms, with 11 farms having virus detection in only 1 sample,
    three farms with 2 positive samples, and one farm with 3 positive samples. In
    one of the samples collected from this farm, two viruses were detected simultaneously
    (Fig. 4). Additionally, viruses were detected in three irrigation water samples
    during this phase. Download : Download high-res image (202KB) Download : Download

    in 37 out of 226 collected samples, corresponding to 26 FVCs. Notably, out of
    the 26 FVCs, two centers had 3 positive samples, 7 had 2 positive samples, and
    the remaining had only 1 positive sample. In phase II, out of the 67 samples with
    virus detection, rotavirus was detected in 51 samples by qPCR. This virus was
    observed in all months of phase II, with the highest contamination observed in
    April (n = 18), followed by June (n = 12), May (n = 8), August (n = 7), and July
    (n = 4) (P < 0.001). Other viruses detected in phase II include NoV GI (n = 6),
    NoV GII (n = 5), and AstV (n = 4). As mentioned earlier, phase I examined five
    types of leafy green vegetables (lettuce, parsley, watercress, basil, and spinach),
    while phase II focused on two types (lettuce and parsley). In phase I positive
    samples, spinach, lettuce, watercress, and parsley were contaminated by viruses
    in four, three, three, and one sample, respectively. In phase II, out of the 57
    positive samples, 37 samples were related to parsley, and 20 samples were related
    to lettuce. The majority of positive samples (77 out of 83) were contaminated
    with one viral agent, while 7 samples were contaminated with two viruses. Two
    samples contained AstV and RV, three samples contained RV and NoV GI, and two

    In the context of the global effort to enhance quality of life and promote healthy
    nutrition, vegetables play a significant role in the modern human diet. However,
    studies have shown that vegetables can serve as common sources of foodborne pathogens,
    including viral pathogens. This transmission may occur due to insufficient initial
    washing, inadequate cooking practices, inadequate hygiene by food handlers, as
    well as specific cultivation and harvesting methods (Little and Gillespie, 2008;
    Moritz et al., 2023). Although viruses cannot replicate outside living cells,
    they can contaminate fresh produce at different stages, both pre-harvest and post-harvest
    (Bosch et al., 2011; Seymour and Appleton, 2001). Viral contamination of irrigation
    water is a known pathway for viral outbreaks linked to the consumption of fresh
    produce (Gerba and Choi, 2006; Shaheen et al., 2019). Additionally, food handlers
    and food processors are potential sources of viral contamination. Notably, NoV
    and HAV are viruses that are most frequently associated with outbreaks through
    the consumption of fresh produce, such as frozen raspberries, green salad, and
    fresh fruit (Moritz et al., 2023; Seymour and Appleton, 2001). Limited studies
    have been conducted on the contamination of leafy green vegetables with enteric
    viruses in farms and local markets in Iran, with a focus on farms in most cases,
    while some work has been done in other countries. For example, a study conducted
    in three European countries (Greece, Serbia, and Poland) shows that in the monitoring
    of production, processing and point of sale AdV, pAdV, HAV, HEV, NoV GI, NoV GII
    and bPyV were detected in 20.09 %, 5.53 %, 1.32 %., 3.42 %, 2 %, 2.95 % and 0.82
    % of the samples by RT-PCR, respectively (Kokkinos et al., 2012). In a study in
    Argentina, NoV was detected in 58 % of samples, RV in 5 % of samples, AstV in
    32 % of samples, and infective enterovirus (iEV) in 79 % of vegetable samples
    which were collected from pre-urban farms (Prez et al., 2018). Meanwhile, some
    studies, like one in Japan, reported no detection of NoV GI, NoV GII, HAV, AdV,
    RV and AstV in cabbage and lettuce samples (Shin et al., 2019). Furthermore, another
    study in Spain failed to detect HAV in any of the 95 leafy green samples taken
    and NoV was detected in 5–6 % of the samples (Truchado et al., 2021). In a recent
    study conducted in Egypt, a Middle Eastern country, it was found that 41.6 % (30/72)
    of surface water samples and 27 % (13/48) of fresh produce samples used for irrigation
    were contaminated with HAV, NoV GI, and NoV GII (Shaheen et al., 2022). The variation
    in virus presence among studies could be attributed to the sample sizes, molecular
    detection methods employed, and differences in the water and public health conditions
    of each country. Regrettably, there is a lack of extensive studies or official
    reporting systems focused on foodborne viral outbreaks in Iran. However, studies
    in other countries have shown associations between norovirus infections and the
    consumption of fresh produce. A study has been conducted in the United States
    and the European Union shows that out of 233 NoV cases from 2004 to 2012 (Callejón
    et al., 2015), 108 cases were related to the consumption of fresh produce. Alternatively,
    in Australia fresh produce was responsible for 4 % of foodborne diseases (Kirk
    et al., 2008). According to a recent report by the National Outbreak Reporting
    System (NORS) to the CDC, it was found that from 2017 to 2019, among the outbreaks
    with a confirmed or suspected agent (555 out of 800, 69.4 %), the most prevalent
    pathogens were norovirus and Salmonella, responsible for 47.0 % and 18.6 % of
    the outbreaks, respectively (Moritz et al., 2023). In this study, conducted in
    Tehran, Iran, we aimed to examine the presence of enteric viruses on the surfaces
    of vegetables collected from farms, irrigation water sources, and fruit and vegetable
    centers (FVCs). The study utilized qPCR to detect enteric viruses and observed
    a significant presence of these viruses on leafy green vegetables in Tehran. It
    is essential to note that while qPCR accurately quantifies viral genomes, it cannot
    distinguish infectious from non-infectious viruses and reports the infectious
    and non-infectious together (Randazzo et al., 2016). As consequence of this, although
    the detection of viral nucleic acid presence on vegetables is valuable and shows
    traces of viral contamination, it does not necessarily indicate the presence of
    infectious viruses. Additionally, the low viral genome copy numbers on vegetable
    surfaces make the methods of concentration, sampling, and detection critical in
    confirming viral presence, and the potential for this method to miss contamination
    at low levels for some of the viruses exists (Hamza et al., 2009). Out of the
    475 collected samples, it was determined that at least one enteric virus, such
    as RV, AstV, NoV GI, NoV GII, HAV, or HEV, was detected in 83 samples. During
    phase I, contamination was observed in limited number of farms and FVCs samples
    (about 12.5 %). However, with the expansion of the study and increase in the number
    of farms and FVCs in Phase II, the rate of contamination approximately increased
    to 20 %. One of the contributing factors for this phenomenon can be attributed
    to the relaxation of COVID-19 restrictions, which led to a return to normalcy
    in 2021. As individuals resumed their pre-pandemic activities and interactions,
    there is a possibility of reduced adherence to essential preventive measures such
    as social distancing, mask-wearing, and handwashing which played a crucial role
    in effectively reducing the transmission of not only COVID-19 but also other infectious
    diseases, including enteric viruses during the pandemic. This potential decline
    in compliance likely created favorable conditions for enteric viruses to circulate
    more freely in the community, resulting in an increased risk of transmission which
    obviously could observe in phase II of this study. The results of our study showed
    variation in the viral loads detected among the different foodborne viruses quantified
    in the leafy green and water samples. Although RV was detected at the highest
    concentrations ranging from 1.64 × 101 to 4.03 × 103 GC/g in vegetable samples
    and 9.82 × 102 to 4.08 × 103 GC/L in water samples, Norovirus GII had the highest
    mean concentration of 6.663 × 102 ± 9.258 × 102 GC/g. When compared to other studies
    conducted in Mexico and Egypt, the viral loads observed in our study were generally
    close. A study in Mexico reported mean NoV loads of 2.1 × 102 to 1.3 × 103 RNA
    copies/g, which are similar to concentrations detected in some of our samples.
    However, they found higher concentrations of RV in their positive samples, while
    our study had a higher frequency of positive samples for RV (Felix-Valenzuela
    et al., 2012). Similarly, a study in Egypt found NoV loads ranging from 102 to
    104 GC/g, which are within the ranges we observed (Shaheen et al., 2022). The
    viral loads detected in our study indicate possible contamination risks if products
    are mishandled, though our results were generally comparable to other regional
    studies for NoV and RV. Further research is needed to better understand influencing
    factors. Interestingly, the overall rate of contamination in the farms and FVCs
    was similar in both phases of the study (about 18 %). This evident indicates a
    continuity between the farms and FVCs. Also, most of the viruses which were observed
    in the farms and the FVCs were observed at similar rates, however, the contamination
    rate of irrigation water was not as high as the produce. This could be due to
    a reduced number of water samples taken, as there was difficulty in getting permission
    to sample water from farm owners. As shown in Fig. 4, most of the contamination
    occurs in limited farms and FVCs. 11 farms and 28 FVCs, most of them have one
    contaminated sample and a much smaller number of them had 2 or 3 contaminated
    samples. This result suggests that most of the contamination was not limited to
    a specific farm or FVCs and this contamination could not be the result of a recurring
    source. It is possible that this kind of contamination was related to food handlers,
    although more extensive study is needed for such a conclusion. Undoubtedly, this
    study faced several limitations that warrant consideration in future research.
    The relatively limited sample size, especially in case of irrigation water, may
    have implications for the generalizability of the findings to a broader population.
    To enhance the study''s reliability, future investigation should employ larger
    sample sizes from diverse geographic regions in Iran. Additionally, the qPCR method
    utilized lacked the ability to differentiate between infectious and non-infectious
    viruses, potentially leading to overestimation of contamination risk. Employing
    advanced detection methods with greater sensitivity and specificity would improve
    accuracy in identifying viral pathogens. Another potential limitation of the work
    presented here involves a comparatively limited number of samples of water taken,
    which was not sufficient enough to infer seasonality in contamination, and this
    should be the focus of future work. Moreover, the regional focus solely on Tehran
    limited the study''s scope. Expanding research to include other regions with varying
    agricultural practices and environmental conditions can provide a more comprehensive
    understanding of viral contamination trends. To address these limitations, several
    areas of further study are essential. Conducting longitudinal studies over an
    extended period would offer valuable insights into seasonal variation and trends
    in viral contamination, enabling more accurate risk assessment. Implementing a
    comprehensive viral surveillance program covering various stages of the food supply
    chain, from farm to consumer, is crucial for a holistic understanding of potential
    contamination sources. Exploring the role of food handlers in transmitting viral
    pathogens to fresh produce is vital, considering its potential impact on contamination
    rates. Furthermore, conducting comparative studies across different regions and
    countries with diverse agricultural practices and public health measures would
    shed light on factors contributing to variation in viral contamination rates.
    Detailed evaluation of different water sources used for irrigation, including
    their quality and potential viral contamination, can provide essential data to
    enhance preventive measures. 5. Conclusions In conclusion, this study sheds light
    on the presence of human enteric viruses in irrigation water and fresh produce
    samples collected from farms and food distribution centers in Tehran, Iran. The
    findings emphasize the significance of enhancing viral surveillance programs to
    mitigate the risk of cross-contamination between water sources and fresh produce
    in Iran. Further elucidation of the sources of viral contamination in the future
    could better inform control measures to reduce foodborne transmission. Additionally,
    further study is needed to monitor this pathway step by step to inform solutions
    for minimizing the contamination of produce in Iran. CRediT authorship contribution

    Introduction Agriculture is one of the key sources that plays a significant part
    in the life of the country''s economy. Traditional agriculture refers to the conventional
    farming methods that have been practiced for centuries, relying on manual labor
    and basic tools. In traditional agriculture, farmers often work in small plots
    of land using traditional seeds and farming practices passes down through the
    generations while traditional agriculture has played a crucial role in meeting
    food demands, it does have it disadvantages. One significant drawbacks is its
    relatively low efficiency and productivity. Manual labor-intensive tasks can be
    time-consuming and labor demanding, leading to potential wastage of water, fertilizers
    and pesticides. Moreover, traditional agriculture is more susceptible to the adverse
    effects of unpredictable weather conditions and environmental factors which can
    result in lower yields and economic losses. Meanwhile, food security is a global
    challenge and impacted by rapidly compounding effects of climate changes, population
    trends and supply chain shortcomings. Agriculture''s global impact cannot be overstated,
    as it remains the primary source of food for humanity. Despite the fact that the
    human population continues to grow, agricultural land remains static (Virk et
    al.2020). The authors (Mesgaran et al. 2017) also discovered that the ever-changing
    climatic conditions significantly reduce agricultural product output in conventional
    agricultural systems. As a result of the varying nature of farming resources and
    poor management, farmers continue to experience low agricultural output. Drawbacks
    of Traditional Farming Due to the low degree of automation in the farming area,
    the current state of the art in agriculture, particularly conventional agricultural
    systems, still confronts significant hurdles in terms of sustainability, labor-intensity,
    and energy efficiency needs. Also, the production level of the crops to be considered.
    Scalability problems also taken into account since the population explosion is
    the major cause. Precision Agriculture and Smart Farming In order to overcome
    the limitations and challenges faced in the conventional farming systems, the
    advent of the smart farming and precision agricultural sector to automate the
    farming processes towards achieving many goals towards sustainable agricultural
    systems. Some of them are listed below: • High quantity of crop yield • Better
    quality of the crops • Efficient resource utilization • Effective to handle climatic
    conditions • Decision making in cropping patterns • Environment and user-friendly
    • Easy maintenance • Minimized crop losses • Easy to handle pests, diseases, weeds
    • Minimize the crop growth time duration • Early prediction on the crop loss or
    gain • Ensures and motivates organic way of crop cultivation • Improves the growth
    of wide variety of crops • Reduces the usage of pesticides, fungicides and other
    chemicals that are not good for health. • Though huge amount for installations,
    less chances for failures and lasts for longer life-time. Continue Reading References

    of agricultural elements and processes. The interconnection of \"man-machine-object\"
    in agricultural IoT enhances the management of agricultural elements, processes,
    systems, and the understanding of essential aspects of the lives of animals and
    plants. Moreover, it facilitates the management of agricultural emergencies and
    complex agricultural systems [2]. In the agriculture sector, IoT applications
    play a pivotal role, as depicted in Fig. 1. These applications encompass soil
    monitoring to enhance crop growth, efficient irrigation, and fertilizer management.
    Nutrient optimization is crucial to reduce the environmental impact by addressing
    the soil and plant nutrient requirements. Crop monitoring, facilitated by sensors
    and IoT, supports informed decision-making regarding pest control, irrigation,
    and harvesting. Agricultural product storage techniques aid in preserving crops
    and preventing losses. Smart irrigation improves the accuracy of crop watering,
    reduces water wastage, and promotes sustainability. Precision agriculture employs
    drones and sensors for field mapping and precise input application. Finally, IoT
    automates livestock management, including feeding and health data collection.
    Collectively, these IoT applications enhance agricultural efficiency, sustainability,

    paper PDF 1 Introduction India is the world''s largest producer of sugar, fruits,
    and jute and also the largest manufacturer of 25% overall production. The extremely
    familiar types of disease attacks on plants’ leaves are alternative of viruses
    and fungoid diseases. As for proper growth of plants and crops, the geographical
    conditions are required 15–20 °C for spraying time, and 20–26 °C for maturing
    and picking with rainfall around 75–100 cm. The growing rate of population and
    advanced conditions of climate also cause harm to plant diseases. Now, the main
    cultivation in India is groundnut, cotton, fish, species, livestock, etc. For
    this, various methods of cultivation have been used like livestock farming, arable
    farming, nomadic farming, sustainable farming, and mixed farming. Livestock farming
    is best for employment and waste which gets activated by animals is used as natural
    manure for the maintenance of soil fertility as agriculture enables a large number
    of quantities of grains and other foodstuffs, and arable farming is used for the
    production of crops that include various types of crops from the growth of plants
    it also produces an extensive range of yearly crops the annual crops means total
    life cycle of the crops from germination to grain production enclosed by 12 months.
    Nomadic farming is a type of primary sustainable farming, nomadic live in arid
    and semiarid parts of Asia, Africa, and Europe in Africa nomadic herd cattle,
    goats, sheep, camels, and other animals managed by nomadic including horses, mux-oxen,
    yaks; mixed farming is used to involve growing crops and raise of livestock. Thus,
    pesticides take an essential role in the production of food and the pesticide
    industry had done contribution in 2018 of over 6.75 billion and the Indian industry
    cultivated 9%, the investment is evaluated at 16.7 million. Although there are
    various types of pesticides used in farming like rodenticides larvicides, overuse
    of fertilizers and pesticides affects soil organisms that are similar to humans
    overworked with antibiotics. For example, plants may depend on different types
    of microorganisms to convert atmospheric nitrogen into nitrates, which plants
    can use. As per the Indian government, 40% land about 150 billion corrupted. As
    in agricultural generation, 25% of land gets degraded and the soil carbon, nitrous
    oxide exists the atmosphere. Once there, they can infect plants and animals ranging
    from favorable microorganisms, insects, fish, and birds. The detection can be
    done by using plants leaf, temperature, gas sensor, humidity, and soil moisture
    readings will be received from the sensors. Now, in the advanced period of agriculture
    epoch of Industry 4.0 faces many objections, and IoT with automation is used for
    the fulfillment of “Automatic disease detection to monitor the plant health for
    various plants leaf using image processing techniques and TensorFlow algorithm.”
    1.1 Literature Review The apple leaf disease affects the yields of apples; they
    show a detecting process in real time and a deep learning approach on CNN detection
    of leaves of brown spots, gray spots, and mosaics [1]. In this paper, they have
    discussed and used the technology of bacteria foraging algorithm, image segmentation,
    and neural network. The image processing is done for processing of leaf images
    by using methods like soft computing and conventional method [2]. The arbuscular
    mycorrhizal fungus on growth and development of blast resistance is used and examined
    all rice types which were sensitive root colonization by AM fungus [3]. This paper
    shows plant detection of disease in real time that is affected using a convolutional
    neural network for appropriate fertilizers spread on the damaged portion of plants.
    For improving the accuracy of the system, they have used a TensorFlow framework;
    the accuracy is increased by up to 95%. The remaining area infected by diseases
    is calculated by k-means algorithm [3]. In this paper, they show the detection
    of diseases that affect various plants by using image processing techniques. As
    commonly we know farmers spray pesticides on the plants but also affect humans
    directly and indirectly through health issues or any other [4]. This paper uses
    the technology of ML and processing of image to allow the viral disease from the
    snaps of leaf, and this method identifies the injury of potato leaf disease. Their
    segmentation approaches the utilization by using multiclass SVM [5]. The algorithm
    has used deep learning network for detection of tobacco plants in photos captured
    by using unmanned aerial vehicles. This algorithm has three stages the primary
    stage with morphological and watershed segmentation, the second is convolutional
    neural network is assembled and train with tobacco plant region and the third
    part is post-processing are performed to discard the non-tobacco plant [6]. This
    paper uses forest in identifying plant disease between healthy and disease plants
    for extracting the features of the image. This is used by using the trained dataset
    to detect the virus by using ML technology [7]. They have used a data augmentation
    technique that has been used to do the deviation of the leaf photos in dataset.
    As they have also used the CNN model for image classification, the accuracy is
    98.56% [8]. This paper shows about image detector and the resource-constrained
    using a convolutional network implemented in a low-cost, platform to perform the
    types of plant infection [9]. In this paper, they discussed current trends and
    challenges for plant leaf disease using deep learning method using a k-means clustering
    algorithm [10]. This paper shows the present surveys on current techniques and
    prediction models for the validation and diagnosis of tomato leaf diseases based
    on image processing and the IoT for the verification and various types of tomato
    plant diseases [7]. They show leaf diseases that can be effectively used to detect
    the leaves of plants but the unhealthy plants that we get are unbalanced that’s
    why it is difficult to detect the diseases from the unhealthy plant''s dataset
    for solving this they have used double GAN to generate higher-resolution pictures
    of unhealthy plants leaf using samples [11]. 2 Methodology First of all, the robot
    system will start activating and it will move into the farm for taking photos;
    it will check the height of plants; if it''s too low, then the mechanism will
    spray the fertilizers for the proper growth of plants; if the height is proper,
    then it will again go for taking photos for detection of insects on plants; if
    any parasitic detected, then it will spray pesticides on the affected portion
    of plants and send alert message to the farmer (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Flowchart for
    prototype device Full size image Algorithm Used for Plants Disease Detection:
    TensorFlow: It is a library of Python language used for rapid arithmetic calculations,
    and it can also create models of hierarchical learning exactly. This model detects
    leaf spot diseases and also predicts healthy leaves. The TensorFlow algorithm
    also uses a neural network for training the image classification model. The TensorFlow
    should be run on single central processing unit as well as on graphic processing
    unit and mobile devices. The used dataset is used in training and testing of dataset
    1000 from that 700 images of plants are used for training and remaining 300 images
    are uses for testing. The dataset is identified across the model for the procedure
    of building to escape overfitting. The tested dataset is independent for the training
    set. The test dataset is used to identify the performance of model or accuracy
    of model, and the images of plants classify leaves based on the below parts: Healthful
    part: In this case, the plants’ leaves are healthy and show no symptoms of bacteria
    or infections of any kind (change in color, of leaves, etc.) Bacteria part: In
    this, the bacterial spots are identified, and therefore, the system gives alert
    message to farmer. Viral part: In this case, the color of leaves gets changed
    due to DNA virus that’s why it changes the color. Late Blight part: In this part,
    the harmful plants infection especially affects rice. 2.1 Block Diagram Figure
    2 shows systematic diagram for the observation of farms as the Esp32 module is
    used to collect all data from sensors like LDR. Various sensors are used in the
    farm like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and gas sensor. As temperature
    sensor is useful while growing the crops which needs wet and dry climatic conditions,
    the temperature sensor measures the presence of heat energy of the soil and also
    determines whether it is good for plants growth. If the temperature rises high
    in the farm, then it causes erosion to the cultivation of yields. If temperature
    is too low on the farm, then it decreases the plant''s enzymes and it causes to
    stunt growth or may cause it to die. The humidity sensor is used for controlling
    and monitoring [12] the humidity as well as the air temperature of the farm. As
    if humidity arises high, then plants get to die and crops get fail. If it arises
    low, then the growth of plants takes more time for the growth and smaller leaves
    get to drop off and the quality of plants is not so good. The moisture sensor
    is used for the capacity of water level of soil and also for good irrigation management
    which gives better crops and increases the profit of the farmer as well as the
    land; if the moisture level is too low in the farm, then plants may not mature
    and they may die. So for the betterment of crops and plants, normally 21–40% of
    moisture level is required. The gas sensor is used on the farm for how much amount
    of gas is present in the farm and environment or if anyone tries to spread petroleum
    in the farm at that time this sensor senses it and gives an alert message to the
    farmer; due to this, our farm can be saved due to unwanted gas spread. The DC
    motor is used in the farm as it plays a necessary part in the farm for scanning
    plants vertically and horizontally for the detection and monitoring of the plant''s
    health if the disease gets detected the LCD will display all the desired conditions.
    And servomotor is used for spraying the pesticides on the affected portion of
    the plant this mechanism is inserted in the robot if any insect is detected, then
    the mechanism will start and spray the pesticides. The water pump is used if the
    moisture of the soil gets low, then water pump will start by triggering the relay.
    If moisture level is too high, then off the water pump. Thus, all the data will
    be sent to on new technology of Blynk cloud to show the data in real time and
    a power supply is provided to all the sensors for proper working and giving the
    results. As in greenhouse automation [13], they used the old Blynk technology
    for controlling the greenhouse system including soil moisture, temperature, and
    humidity. Fig. 2 Schematic diagram of observing farmland Full size image 3 Design
    Implementation The working implementation consists of various parts, processing
    which is defined below: A. Collection of Dataset The analysis depends on the detection
    of affected leaf; [14] I have collected a dataset from an agricultural institution.
    This dataset has images of various disease-affected plants [15] . I organized
    to collect pictures of various types of infection indication. They are apple black
    dots, grape spot, maize gray dots, tomato mosaic virus, and peach bacterial spot
    [16]. One of the most frequent diseases is in apple plants which may be increased
    by fungi. Podosphaera leucotricha is the black spot as its name shows with black
    spots seen on the surface of the leaves. Grape leaf spot shows about fungus Phomopsis
    viticola, and maximal is determined the most critical disease of grapes [17].
    Gray spot on corn results on top side. Yellow spots are viewed on another side
    of white disease wrapping the inner part of a leaf. Tomato mosaic virus is mostly
    known as plant pathogenic [18]. The number of images collected from diseases is
    shown in the table (Figs. 3, 4, and 5). Fig. 3 Table on plants diseases Full size
    image Fig. 4 Various leaves [19] affected by unwanted pesticides Full size image
    Fig. 5 Boxplot on the affected area of the plants (leaf) Full size image 4 Future
    Scope It is used in the animal shed for monitoring domestic animals. It will help
    the farmers to do work in any season and conditions [20, 21] . It reduces the
    time consumed in spraying the pesticides [22]. It works very effectively, and
    it will reduce the danger to farmers [23] from different breathing and physical
    problems. This model is used for the detection of various types of plants disease
    [24]. This system is used for multiple types of plants health and disease. 5 Conclusion
    The agriculture field needs automation in large amounts to make the human work
    easy, [25] and the agriculture [26] hanging robot [27] has been designed for monitoring
    the farm weather (temperature, humidity, and soil moisture) and also plants health;
    thus, system will go detection of insects [28] if any found the system will spray
    pesticides only on the affected portion of plants. By using this technology, there
    will be less time consumed and I can protect the farm as well as plants from unwanted
    pesticides. This proposed model is designed for the detection and quality of leaves
    by using different types of sensors like temperature, humidity, gas sensor, and
    soil moisture sensor. The purpose device is used whether the device is healthy
    or diseased. 6 Software Testing See Figs. 6, 7, and 8. Fig. 6 Monitoring the farm
    by using Blynk cloud Full size image Fig. 7 Blynk app results in real time Full
    size image Fig. 8 Visuino results for temperature and humidity Full size image
    7 Hardware Testing Figure 9 shows the output results of the farm on LCD as ESP32
    is the controller module of IoT as to help the farmers and send the data on cloud.
    In this project, I have used various sensors like DHT11, gas sensor also soil
    moisture; apart from these, I have also used water pumps for the proper nourishment
    of crops health. Although these all sensors have been used for monitoring, the
    farm and sensors give values on LCD in real-time mode [29, 30] . Thus, the proposed
    system also gives suggestion to the farmers for the betterment of farm and how
    to get rid of plants diseases by applying the appropriate amount of fertilizers
    and pesticides. Fig. 9 Output results of the farm on LCD Full size image References

    1 Introduction Water quality is a critical aspect of human health and environmental
    sustainability. Water bodies can become contaminated with various pollutants [1],
    such as chemicals, pathogens, and algae, which can have adverse effects on human
    health and aquatic ecosystems. The recent rise in waterborne diseases is a cause
    for concern. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 79% of
    health issues in developing nations are linked to inadequate water quality, leading
    to approximately 25% mortality [2]. Therefore, monitoring and maintaining water
    quality is essential to prevent potential health hazards and ecological damage.
    The conventional method of water quality detection, which is widely used, involves
    laboratory testing that is tedious, prolonged and requires experienced personnel
    to carry out appropriate chemical tests using specialized substances. The digital
    image processing technique is increasingly popular and has been extensively adopted
    in various industries due to its affordability, visual nature, and contactless
    approach [3]. To address the limitations of conventional methods, image processing
    methods have been utilized in this study. Deep learning algorithms like Convolutional
    Neural Networks (CNNs) can be trained to identify patterns and anomalies in water
    quality data, providing accurate predictions and classifications. Image processing
    techniques can be used to detect visual changes in water quality, such as color,
    turbidity, and algae growth, and provide a visual representation of water quality.
    By providing timely and accurate information about water quality, the water quality
    detection system enables stakeholders to take necessary actions to mitigate potential
    health and environmental risks. 2 Related Work Water quality detection systems
    have been a subject of extensive research in recent trends as a response to the
    growing concern about water pollution. Numerous studies have been carried out
    to develop effective and reliable water quality detection systems using various
    techniques and technologies. Here are some examples of related work in this field:
    Machine learning algorithms have been widely used in water quality detection systems.
    For instance, in one study, [4] a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model was developed
    to detect the presence of heavy metals in water samples based on various water
    quality parameters. In another study, [5] a deep learning model was developed
    to classify water quality based on physical, chemical, and biological parameters
    [6]. The Internet of Things (IOT) technology has been extensively used to develop
    water quality detection systems. Optical sensors are an emerging technology for
    water quality detection [7]. These sensors use light to measure various water
    quality parameters such as turbidity, chlorophyll, and dissolved organic matter
    [8]. Biosensors are another technology used in water quality detection. These
    sensors use biological components such as enzymes, antibodies, or microorganisms
    to detect specific pollutants in water. Many studies have used a combination of
    different techniques and technologies to develop water quality detection systems.
    For instance, [9] in one study, a hybrid system combining IoT-based sensors and
    machine learning algorithms was developed for real-time water quality monitoring
    [10]. Another study developed a system that combines optical sensors and machine
    learning algorithms for detecting microplastics in water. 3 Methodology 3.1 Data
    Acquisition About 2100 sample images are collected from standard websites such
    as Google earth engine, Shutter stock [11, 12], etc. were as illustrated in Fig.
    1. All of the collected images were classified into categories based on expert
    knowledge and saved in the JPG format [13]. There are four categories in total
    for the water quality samples, each with a certain number of images. These categories
    represent different grades of water quality, based on water color, including dark
    green, yellow, brown, blue, black and light green [14]. These grades have been
    classified as algae water, clean water, mud water and polluted water respectively.
    The images are resized to 150 × 150 pixels to fit the model for subsequent calculations.
    Fig. 1 Samples collected and categorized Full size image 3.2 Overview The following
    is an overview of the water quality monitoring approach, as shown in Fig. 2. The
    first step involves collecting suitable water sample images and using image incision
    technology to isolate representative portions [14]. The sample images are categorized
    based on expert knowledge and labelled to form a sample library for modelling.
    The samples are input into proposed CNN models, to train the data. CNN models
    evaluate the output through different layers of the network by using a process
    called feature extraction [15]. The network consists of multiple layers, each
    performing a specific function. Fig. 2 Architecture of proposed system Full size
    image During each layer''s operation, the CNN model extracts important features
    from the input image, such as color, edges, corners, and textures. These features
    become increasingly complex as they move deeper into the network [16]. The output
    of each layer is assessed according to its capacity to detect the features it
    was designed to identify. To evaluate the output of each layer, CNN models use
    a technique called activation mapping. Activation mapping involves visualizing
    the output of each layer as a heatmap, where the brightest areas indicate the
    most significant features detected by that layer. Overall, CNN models use feature
    extraction and activation mapping to evaluate the output through different layers
    of the network, allowing for the identification of significant features in the
    input data and improving the model''s performance. The subsequent sections provide
    detailed descriptions of each phase. 4 Proposed Approach 4.1 Image Acquisition
    and Pre-processing Image acquisition and pre-processing are essential steps in
    preparing data for CNN models. Here are the typical steps involved in image acquisition
    and pre-processing: Image acquisition- the first step is to acquire high-quality
    images that represent the target object or scene. This is done by collecting around
    2100 images from standard websites from google. Image resizing- most CNN models
    require images of a specific size for optimal performance [17]. Therefore, it
    is essential to resize the images to the required dimensions to 150 × 150. Image
    normalization- it involves transforming the pixel values of the image to a standard
    range. This helps to reduce the impact of differences in image brightness, contrast,
    and color balance, which could affect the CNN model''s performance. 4.2 Data Augmentation
    Data augmentation is a method used in deep learning to increase the amount of
    data available for training a model by creating new, altered versions of pre-existing
    data as shown in Fig. 3. The idea behind data augmentation is to introduce variations
    in the original data, such as rotation, scaling, translation, flipping, or adding
    noise. This allows the model to learn more robust and generalized features, which
    can improve its performance on new and unseen data. For example, rotating an image
    by a certain angle can create a new sample that is similar to the original but
    with a slightly different viewpoint, so the collected water images have been rotated
    by 90°, 180° and 270°. Flipping an image horizontally can create another new sample
    that is a mirror image of the original and here the images have been flipped horizontally
    as well as vertically. Adding noise to an image can create new samples that simulate
    different lighting or atmospheric conditions [5]. Fig. 3 Modified versions of
    algae content water using data augmentation Full size image Data augmentation
    is especially useful when the amount of available training data is limited. By
    generating more data from the existing samples, the model can learn a wider range
    of variations and improve its ability to generalize to new data. Moreover, data
    augmentation can also help to prevent overfitting. 4.3 Proposed CNN Model A typical
    CNN-based image processing system architecture includes input layer, convolutional
    layers, pooling layers, activation function, fully connected layers, and output
    layer, allowing the network to learn complex features and relationships between
    them for accurate image classification or other image processing tasks [18]. There
    is no one CNN architecture that fits water quality classification. To determine
    the best model, the existing architectures should be tested, and the most appropriate
    one should be chosen based on the particular scenario. The pre-trained models
    are initialized with pre-existing weights from ImageNet and the upper layers are
    redefined to serve the purpose of classification. In order to assess whether a
    trained model is appropriate for its intended purpose, it is essential to test
    it for both underfitting and overfitting. To prevent overfitting, data augmentation
    techniques have been proposed. The pre-trained models utilized Adam optimizer
    to minimize the loss function. The global average pooling layer is added to every
    model, which reduces the dimensionality of the output from the previous layers.
    A dropout layer is added to the model, which randomly drops out a portion of the
    activations during training to prevent overfitting. A fully connected output layer
    is added with 4 nodes (one for each class), using the softmax activation function
    to output a probability distribution over the classes. Finally, various CNN approaches
    are utilized to train and validate the models on the water quality image dataset.
    The pretrained models used are InceptionV3, VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet201 and MobileNet.
    5 Results and Discussion The models were trained using a batch-size of 10 for
    30 epochs. The complete dataset was randomly divided into training and testing
    data in a 80–20 ratio. The ModelCheckpoint callback is defined to save the best
    model weights based on validation loss during training. It will save the weights
    of the model to a file with a specified format, including the epoch number, validation
    loss, and validation accuracy. The EarlyStopping callback is defined to stop training
    early if there is no significant improvement in validation loss for a designated
    number of learning cycles. The ReduceLROnPlateau callback is defined to reduce
    the learning rate if there is no significant improvement in validation loss for
    a designated number of epochs. Figures 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 show the variation in
    accuracies and losses of the training data and validation data when data has been
    trained under different pre-trained cnn models. The x-axis indicates the number
    of epochs, and the y-axis denotes the accuracy rate in the chart. Fig. 5 ResNet-50,

    and losses of the trained and validation data and the testing accuracies (obtained
    when the model has been tested on unseen images) are as shown in Table1. Observing
    Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 and Table 1, our evaluation indicates that the DenseNet
    model outperforms all others in terms of training performance, achieving the highest
    validation accuracy. Based on these results, we selected DenseNet for further
    testing on unseen images and achieved an accuracy of 91.75%. The precision, recall
    and f1-score values across all categories are as shown in Table 2. Table 1 Comparing
    various techniques based on their accuracy and loss metrics Full size table Table
    2 Evaluation indicators of DenseNet201 class prediction Full size table Due to
    the limited amount of data available, the DenseNet model did not yield reliable
    prediction results, despite implementing data augmentation techniques during model
    training. However, it has shown a notable ability to classify features within
    the dataset, making it a viable option for water quality evaluation, even with
    a limited dataset. 6 Conclusion In this paper, we presented a water quality monitoring
    approach that leverages image processing and deep learning techniques. Then image
    classification is performed for water quality evaluation. Different experiments
    are conducted and compared the results with the state-of-the-art CNNs, the pre-trained
    models for image recognition. Notably, DenseNet201 model achieved higher classification
    accuracy i.e. 96.26% even in the absence of massive training samples. Further
    research can be conducted to explore the systems scalability and reliability in
    real-world scenarios, paving the way for sustainable and effective water quality
    management. References Seetha M (2018) Accuracy assessment of rough set based

  description: The poultry business in contemporary India is one of the most important
    and rapidly expanding sectors of the country's agricultural economy. Increases
    in chicken production can be attributed to better manufacturing methods and more
    efficient agricultural methods. The importance of automation in the current world
    cannot be overstated, and neither can the rapid development of the Internet of
    Things (IoT) idea with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Using a certain method, manual
    tasks may be made fully automatic. Poultry farms can benefit from IoT-based operations
    when remote monitoring and repair are required, transforming them from traditional
    to cutting-edge operations that make extensive use of automation. In order to
    maintain and enhance chicken health, it is necessary to constantly check for changes
    in a number of variables. In this study, we propose and construct a low-cost Internet
    of Things (IoT)-based system for monitoring environmental factors in a chicken
    farm in real time, including temperature, humidity, ammonia levels, and light
    i ntensity. Information gleaned via sensors and continuous monitoring. By putting
    the planned system into action, we were able to evaluate its viability. Temperature
    and humidity levels, as well as their management, are the most important climatic
    parameters for a poultry farm's output. The purpose of this project is to automate
    the operation of a chicken farm by utilising Internet of Things (IoT) technologies.
    Chicken health is maintained by careful monitoring of environmental conditions
    like temperature, humidity, light, and ammonia gas, as well as through the supervision
    of routine tasks like feeding, watering, and cleaning.

  description: With the increasing demands on global agriculture, there is an imperative
    need to optimize crop yields and promote sustainable agricultural practices. Real-time
    monitoring and accurate predictions of soil health and crop yields have significant
    implications for farmers, agronomists, and policymakers. While existing soil analysis
    models offer certain predictive capabilities, their efficiency is often hindered
    by issues related to energy consumption, prediction delay, and accuracy levels.
    Contemporary soil models primarily fall short in addressing the multifaceted nature
    of soil attributes and their dynamic interactions. These models also struggle
    to provide real-time insights, frequently leading to delayed interventions, misallocated
    resources, and suboptimal yields. In this paper, we introduce an advanced, low-cost,
    and energy-aware multiparametric IoT-based soil analysis model designed to overcome
    the prevailing limitations. Our system harnesses the synergy of N, P, K, Humidity,
    and Temperature sensors, augmented with temporal datasets to offer a comprehensive
    view of the soil's current state. At the core of our analysis, an ensemble learning
    model combines the strengths of Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM, MLP, and
    1D CNN methods, streamlining accurate yield level predictions. To further refine
    the model's efficiency, a Q Learning approach is integrated, ensuring both energy
    conservation and heightened prediction accuracy. When deployed in various agronomic
    scenarios, the proposed model manifested a marked improvement in prediction metrics.
    Notably, we observed a 10.5% enhancement in precision, 9.4% in accuracy, 8.5%
    in recall, and 4.5% in AUC. Moreover, the model reduced the prediction delay by
    9.5% compared to its counterparts. These advancements underscore the potential
    of our model to revolutionize soil analysis techniques, paving the way for smarter,
    energy-efficient, and productive agricultural practices.

  description: 'Accurately identifying bovine respiratory disease is challenging in
    feedlots, and previous studies suggest behavioral monitoring is important. The
    study objective was to describe individual differences in physical activity (distance
    traveled), feeding/watering patterns (proximity to feed and water), and social
    behavior (average cattle within 3 m) when associated with health status in commercially
    raised beef cattle during the first 28 days on feed. Data from a previous Australian
    feedlot study monitoring cattle behavior and associated health outcomes were analyzed.
    Health status categories were generated for all cattle, and each animal was categorized
    as known healthy (HLTH), known diseased (SICK), or intermediate/uncertain (INTR).
    The INTR animals were excluded from the final analysis. Key findings included:
    differentiation in activity between SICK (n = 138) and HLTH (n = 1508) cattle
    dependent on time of day, SICK cattle spending more time in water and feeding
    zones early in the feeding phase (<6 days on feed), SICK cattle spending more
    time in the water and feeding zone during the overnight hours, and SICK cattle
    spending more time in groups early in the feeding phase but more time in isolation
    after the first week on feed. Results illustrate behavioral data were associated
    with important health outcomes.'

    Summary Accurately identifying bovine respiratory disease is challenging in feedlots,
    and several studies have highlighted the importance of monitoring behavior to
    determine cattle health status. The objective of this study was to describe individual
    differences in physical activity, feeding/watering patterns, and social behavior
    when associated with health status in commercially raised beef cattle during the
    first 28 days on feed. Data from a previous study monitoring cattle behavior and
    associated health outcomes at two Australian feedlots were used to determine potential
    associations of interest. These data illustrated an association between several
    key behavioral parameters (physical activity, proximity to feed and water, and
    social behavior) and health status categories (healthy vs. sick), and many of
    these effects were modified by the time of day or days spent at the feedlot. Sick
    cattle were less active, spent more time by themselves, had differing attendance
    at the feed bunk across days on feed, and spent more time near water and the feed
    bunk at certain times of the day. Sick cattle were also more social early in the
    feeding period but less social as time progressed. These behavioral observations
    may provide information to help inform the process of diagnosing cattle with bovine
    respiratory disease. Abstract Accurately identifying bovine respiratory disease
    is challenging in feedlots, and previous studies suggest behavioral monitoring
    is important. The study objective was to describe individual differences in physical
    activity (distance traveled), feeding/watering patterns (proximity to feed and
    water), and social behavior (average cattle within 3 m) when associated with health
    status in commercially raised beef cattle during the first 28 days on feed. Data
    from a previous Australian feedlot study monitoring cattle behavior and associated
    health outcomes were analyzed. Health status categories were generated for all
    cattle, and each animal was categorized as known healthy (HLTH), known diseased
    (SICK), or intermediate/uncertain (INTR). The INTR animals were excluded from
    the final analysis. Key findings included: differentiation in activity between
    SICK (n = 138) and HLTH (n = 1508) cattle dependent on time of day, SICK cattle
    spending more time in water and feeding zones early in the feeding phase (<6 days
    on feed), SICK cattle spending more time in the water and feeding zone during
    the overnight hours, and SICK cattle spending more time in groups early in the
    feeding phase but more time in isolation after the first week on feed. Results
    illustrate behavioral data were associated with important health outcomes. Keywords:

    a major challenge in the beef industry, and BRD identification is commonly based
    on subjective assessments with relatively poor accuracy [1,2]. Misclassification
    of diseased cattle is relatively common using current BRD diagnosis techniques
    [3]. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of identifying diseased cattle
    based on signs of clinical illness for BRD have previously been reported to be
    as low as 61.8% and 62.8%, respectively [2]. In simple terms, ~38% of diseased
    calves in a population may go undiagnosed, and ~37% of calves diagnosed with BRD
    may be misdiagnosed when they are actually not diseased [2]. Multiple studies
    have evaluated methods to diagnose BRD more accurately in commercial settings,
    including blood parameters, temperature monitoring devices, and thoracic ultrasound
    [3,4,5,6,7]. Many of these diagnostic systems are designed primarily to confirm
    diagnosis after an animal is preliminarily identified with BRD (e.g., thoracic
    auscultation, thoracic ultrasound, etc.). These systems could help improve the
    specificity of the BRD diagnosis in the population preliminarily identified as
    potentially ill. Other diagnostic systems focus on remotely monitoring cattle
    in real time to identify sick cattle in a normal housing environment (e.g., ruminoreticulum
    boluses, behavioral monitoring, etc.), and these systems may have the potential
    to identify new cases not observed as ill. In a review of several available monitoring
    systems, the authors noted that one of the more promising directions for improving
    BRD diagnosis is the utilization of remote monitoring of behavioral changes [3].
    Whereas the use of remote monitoring technologies in beef cattle is still a relatively
    new field of interest, there has been a significant amount of research done in
    dairy cattle. Although the day-to-day routines and life of dairy and beef cattle
    differ greatly, there are common behavioral measures that may be useful in the
    diagnosis of disease in both types of animals. Physical activity (distance traveled
    or steps taken/lying time), feeding and watering behaviors, and social behaviors
    have all been suggested as potential indicators of cattle health status in both
    dairy and beef cattle [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. Furthermore, these behavioral
    variables have been directly linked to predicting BRD [8,9,11,19,20,21]. Previous
    evaluations of behavioral monitoring have illustrated the ability to find BRD
    cases prior to visual observation with greater accuracy, which may influence treatment
    success [22,23,24,25]. Behavior varies among individual animals, and understanding
    the drivers of differences between cattle may help delineate signs of illness.
    A more refined understanding of behavioral changes may also allow remote monitoring
    systems to be more focused on the accurate detection of BRD. Therefore, the objective
    of this study was to describe individual differences in physical activity (distance
    traveled), feeding/watering patterns (proximity to feed and water), and social
    behavior (average cattle within 3 m) when associated with health status in commercially
    raised beef cattle during the first 28 days on feed (DOF). All of these behaviors
    were expected to change based on an animal’s health status. 2. Materials and Methods
    2.1. Trial Overview The current trial used observational data collected from a
    clinical trial conducted at two feedlot locations in Australia designed to compare
    potential differences between BRD identification methods (the Remote Early Disease
    Identification [REDI] system and conventional visual observation; manuscript under
    preparation). The REDI system is a system used to continuously monitor behavior
    and potentially identify disease [23]. This system utilizes cattle behavior data
    to inform a proprietary algorithm that identifies cattle that are suspected to
    have BRD [23]. The clinical trial consisted of feeding beef steers in 12 pens
    for each method of BRD identification (six pens per method at each location).
    Each study site procured its own cattle, and typical Australian buying practices
    were used to procure cattle from sale yards for site 1 and direct vendor procurement
    for site 2. Breeds at site 1 were Angus, Angus cross, Bos indicus cross, British
    Cross, European, Hereford, Murray Grey, and Shorthorn. Breeds at site 2 were Angus
    cross, Hereford cross, and Shorthorn Cross. A total of 3114 cattle were observed
    using the REDI system (site 1 n = 1800 animals, site 2 n = 1314 animals). There
    were six pens at each site, with 300 animals in each pen at site 1 and 216 to
    223 animals in each pen at site 2. Each pen had 50 m of bunk length and 58 m of
    depth (22.7 cm per animal of bunk space, or 12.3 m2/animal), with a 3% slope.
    All pens had a single strip of shade cloth (11 m wide) in the middle of the pen.
    Pen waterers were shared along the fence line with adjoining pens and cleaned
    weekly. Cattle were fed up to two times per day, with the first feeding occurring
    between approximately 7 and 11 am. Cattle in the REDI pens that were identified
    by the system as positive for BRD using the same criteria as previous work were
    treated [23]. These criteria include monitoring behavioral changes from baselines
    for individual animals. After a targeted 60 DOF, all cattle were monitored using
    visual observation for the remainder of the feeding period. Trained operational
    personnel at each location evaluated cattle daily for visual signs of BRD, including
    increased respiration, anorexia, and depression. Following visual identification
    in the pen, cattle were transported to a hydraulic chute for further examination
    and were treated if BRD was confirmed. Cattle were slaughtered at approximately
    114 DOF for site 1 and 187 DOF for site 2. 2.2. Individual Animal Behavioral Data
    Cattle were monitored with REDI to determine behavioral patterns. The system consisted
    of a REDI tag placed in the ear of each animal that communicated with readers
    surrounding the perimeter of the pen. The hardware was a commercially produced
    system (Smartbow, Vienna, Austria). Communication between tags and readers allowed
    the location engine software to calculate the location of each animal within the
    pen (accurate to within 0.5 m) at approximately 4 s intervals. Location data were
    transferred to the readers that moved data to an on-site server, which calculated
    activity, proximity, and social indices using previously described methods [22,23].
    The cloud server then utilized the REDI disease classification engine [22,23]
    to generate reports containing the BRD status of each individual steer. The reports
    were then relayed to a digital platform for personnel to determine which steers
    needed to be pulled by pen riders for daily treatments. The current trial focused
    on the raw data collected by the REDI system to describe cattle behavior during
    the first 28 DOF. Key behavioral components were selected to describe cattle behavior
    in three areas: activity (distance traveled), proximity to areas of interest (percent
    time in feeding and water zones), and social index (average cattle within 3 m).
    These three areas of behavior provide an overview of individual animal movement
    within the pen, time spent near eating and drinking facilities, and time spent
    around other cattle within the pen. The feeding and water zones were identified
    when an animal was within 1 m of the designated feeding or watering area. These
    values indicate proximity but not necessarily that the animal was actually eating
    or drinking. The decision to analyze data from the first 28 DOF was based on the
    experience of the authors as it pertains to cattle behavior at the feedlot. There
    is little to no data in the literature that definitively describes the time period
    during which cattle behavior is most dynamic at the feedlot, and there is no scientific
    consensus on the time period during which cattle are most at risk for developing
    BRD. However, the authors have anecdotally observed through previous research
    and unpublished foundational work developing the REDI system that cattle behavior
    appears to be the most dynamic during the first 28 DOF due to a wide variety of
    factors that have yet to be fully elucidated. Therefore, only behavioral data
    collected during this time period was analyzed for the purposes of this manuscript.
    Data cleaning consisted of removing unrealistic values that may have occurred
    due to tag losses or hardware issues. Only values considered unrealistic were
    removed from each behavioral outcome. Unrealistic values may have resulted from
    inaccurate data reported from the tag, and cutoffs for levels of unrealistic data
    were determined by the authors. For distance traveled, values ranged from 0 to
    750 m, with 12,946 hourly observations (0.35%) that were greater than 750 m out
    of 3,651,122 hourly observations removed. The percentage time in the feeding and
    water zones ranged from 0 to 100%, and 28 hourly observations (<0.01%) for each
    variable outside of these ranges were removed. The average number of cattle within
    3 m ranged from 0 to 15, with 180 hourly observations (<0.01%) outside this range
    removed. 2.3. Pulmonary Data at Harvest Data were limited to include only cattle
    that died of BRD or received a lung or pleurisy score at harvest. Overall lung
    scores consisted of monitoring pulmonary consolidation and pleurisy scores. Scoring
    was performed by the same three people who were trained prior to initial scoring.
    Pulmonary consolidation was recorded based on a scale of 0 to 100%, similar to
    previous work [26]. Consolidation scores were categorized into three categories:
    0 to 1%, 2 to 9%, and 10 to 55%. Pleurisy scores ranged from 0 to 3. A score of
    0 was no pleurisy, a score of 1 was pleuritic fibrinous attachments between lung
    lobes or on the lung surface with no adhesion on the pleura of the thorax, a score
    of 2 was pleuritic lesions with localized adhesion to the thoracic wall, and a
    score of 3 was severe pleuritic adhesions with the chest requiring “stripping”
    or additional removal, as adhesions between the lungs and plural cavity were extreme.
    In cases where the lungs were adhered to the thoracic wall, a pleurisy score of
    3 was given, but a consolidation score was not recorded (reported as NS). Animals
    that died or were rejected from the trial did not have a lung score recorded.
    Animals that were condemned also did not have a lung score recorded. If an animal’s
    lungs were stuck to the thoracic wall, a consolidation score was not recorded,
    but a pleurisy score was reported. An overall pulmonary disease score was created
    based on the combination of consolidation and pleurisy scores. 2.4. Production
    Data Not all animals in the dataset had an individual live weight prior to slaughter;
    however, a hot carcass weight was available. The average dressing percentage on
    available data of live weight and hot carcass weight was calculated to be 58%
    (based on AUS-MEAT hot standard carcass weight trim). This percentage was used
    to calculate an estimated final live weight for all cattle that were shipped for
    slaughter (even if live weight was available, to maintain consistency). The estimated
    final live weight, initial body weight, and DOF were used to calculate an average
    daily gain (ADG), or how much weight cattle gained per day, over the entire period.
    Animals that died were not included in ADG calculations. 2.5. Health Status Categorization
    Health status categories were generated for all cattle, and each animal was placed
    into one of three categories: known healthy (HLTH), known diseased (SICK), or
    intermediate/uncertain (INTR). Cattle were classified based on their known individual
    overall health outcomes to provide a case definition for comparison of behavioral
    characteristics. Cattle were placed in the HLTH category if they had no lung or
    pleurisy score greater than 1, had never been treated for BRD, did not die, and
    were not rejected for any reason during the trial. Cattle were placed in the SICK
    category if they were classified as having a lung or pleurisy score of 3 (which
    was collected at slaughter), died due to BRD, or were rejected from the trial
    due to BRD. All other cattle were placed in the INTR category. Identification
    of BRD by the REDI system was not an inclusion criterion for any of the three
    health status categories. Although REDI was used to identify cattle for initial
    BRD treatment, follow-up evaluation by trained animal health personnel was required
    to confirm a BRD relapse. The decision to treat an animal multiple times was ultimately
    based on clinical diagnosis. This also applied to the decision to reject an animal
    for BRD, which was made based on an evaluation by trained animal health personnel.
    Animals could also never be treated for BRD but still qualify for the SICK category
    based on post-mortem examination and having a lung or pleurisy score of 3. 2.6.
    Statistical Analysis Data handling and statistical analysis were performed using
    R in RStudio. Descriptive analyses were performed on the final individual animal
    behavioral dataset. Individual animal behavioral data was aggregated to individual
    animals over the period and by hour throughout each day. For the hourly analysis,
    data were evaluated using all the hours for each animal during the period, comparing
    variability over time. For the individual animal analysis, data were aggregated
    to the animal level over the entire trial period. A data subset was created containing
    only cattle in the HLTH and SICK categories, as these case definitions clearly
    delineated health status. In this subset, initial body weight was limited to 300
    to 500 kg and categorized by 50 kg groups to avoid linearity assumptions with
    behavioral outcomes. Animals in the INTR category were not included, as many of
    them had conflicting indications of disease (e.g., pulmonary lesions present but
    never identified with disease or no pulmonary lesions but identified and treated
    for disease). Analyzing only the HLTH and SICK categories allowed for inferences
    of behavior with known health outcomes. Multivariable statistical models (RStudio:lmer)
    were created to evaluate relationships between key behavioral variables and potential
    covariates of interest, including the fixed effects of health status (HLTH/SICK),
    DOF, hour of the day, initial body weight category, and potential interactions
    between health status and DOF, and health status and hour of the day. Each statistical
    model accounted for a lack of independence among observations with random effects
    due to study site, cohort, and repeated measures on individual animals. Independent
    statistical models were created for the first 28 DOF to determine potential associations
    between covariates and each behavioral variable. Only variables with a significant
    (p < 0.05) association with the key behavioral outcomes of interest were reported.
    Comparisons were made among health status groups within DOF or record hours using
    the Tukey adjustment for multiple comparisons (p < 0.05). 3. Results 3.1. Health
    Status Categorization Data were limited to the 3,114 animals monitored with the
    REDI system for behavioral analysis and comparison. These behavioral data contained
    3,651,122 observations (hourly summaries). There was an average of 48.9 days of
    behavioral monitoring per animal. A combination of lung scores, treatment history,
    and health outcomes were used to categorize animals based on health status. Animals
    in the SICK category (n = 138 animals) were rejected due to BRD (n = 10 animals),
    died due to BRD (n = 8 animals), were treated twice for and subsequently rejected
    due to BRD (n = 14 animals), had a lung score of 3 (n = 3 animals), or had a pleurisy
    score of 3 (n = 103 animals). Animals in the HLTH category (n = 1508 animals)
    received no treatment for BRD and did not have a pleurisy or lung score greater
    than 1. Animals in the INTR category (n = 1468 animals) encompassed the remainder
    of the dataset. The distribution of health status categories by study site and
    pen is displayed in Table 1. Table 1. Distribution of cattle in each health category
    by study site and pen. Animals designated to the SICK category had lower weight
    at REDI tag removal, final estimated live weight, and hot carcass weight compared
    to animals in the HLTH category (Table 2). These lower weights translated to decreased
    ADG from arrival to both the time of REDI tag removal and shipment for slaughter
    in the SICK animals compared to the HLTH animals. Table 2. Comparison of common
    performance characteristics among cattle in each health category using multivariable
    models. Superscripts within a row indicate statistical differences at p < 0.05.
    Each model contained relevant covariates of interest and effects to account for
    the lack of independence among data points. ADG = average daily gain, REDI = remote
    early disease identification. 3.2. Distance Traveled and Health Status The effect
    of health status on distance traveled was modified by DOF and hour of the day
    (p < 0.01) but not the initial body weight category (p = 0.56) (Figure 1). Data
    included all SICK and HLTH animals as identified in each health status category
    regardless of when or if the animal had been identified as diseased. The SICK
    animals displayed greater distance traveled relative to HTLH animals over the
    first 2 DOF, then lower distances traveled on days 3, 4, and 5 (Figure 1A). An
    interaction between record hour and health status category was observed (p < 0.01),
    with healthy animals traveling higher distances at hours 9, 14, 15, 22, and 23
    (Figure 1B). Figure 1. Least squares mean distance traveled from the generalized
    model with fixed effects for the interaction between health status and days on
    feed (A) and health status and hour of the day (B). The model included effects
    to control for clustering due to repeated measures on individual animals within
    the pen and study site. Each * signifies a significant difference (p < 0.05) within
    the day or record hour between health status categories. 3.3. Time near Water
    and Feed Associated with Health Status The effect of health status on time spent
    in the water zone was modified by DOF and hour of the day (p < 0.01) but not the
    initial body weight category (p = 0.15) (Figure 2). The average percent of time
    spent in the water zone illustrated several differences among animals classified
    as HLTH compared to those classified as SICK. Early in the feeding phase (2 to
    5 DOF), animals in the SICK category spent a greater percentage of time at the
    water compared to those in the HLTH category (Figure 2A). Figure 2. Least squares
    mean time spent in the water zone from the generalized model with fixed effects
    for the interaction between health status and DOF (A) and health status and hour
    of the day (B). The model included effects to control for clustering due to repeated
    measures on individual animals within the pen and study site. Each * signifies
    a significant (p < 0.05) difference within the day or record hour between health
    status categories. The average time spent in the water zone showed differences
    in watering behavior between the SICK and HLTH categories based on time of day
    (Figure 2B). Animals in the HLTH category spent more time at the water compared
    to SICK animals during mid-morning to late afternoon (10 am to 8 pm). However,
    during night-time hours, SICK animals spent more time at the water. The effect
    of health status on time spent in the feed zone was also modified by DOF and hour
    of the day (p < 0.01) but not the initial body weight category (p = 0.61) (Figure
    3). Similar to water behavior, animals designated as SICK spent more time in attendance
    at the feed bunk early in the feeding period (DOF 1, 2, and 4) and less time later
    in the feeding period (DOF 18, 22, 23, 25) (Figure 3A). Figure 3. Least squares
    mean time spent in the feed zone from the generalized model with fixed effects
    for the interaction between health status and DOF (A) and health status and hour
    of the day (B). The model included effects to control for clustering due to repeated
    measures on individual animals within the pen and study site. Each * signifies
    a significant (p < 0.05) difference within the day or record hour between health
    status categories. Feeding behavior differed by SICK and HLTH animals based on
    the hour of the day monitored (Figure 3B). During the lower activity evening and
    early morning hours (hours 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 04, 05), SICK animals spent more
    time in the feeding zone (p < 0.05), with fewer differences noted during the primarily
    daytime hours (7 am to 5 pm). 3.4. Social Indices and Health Status The average
    number of animals within 3 m is an indication of socialization, and the effect
    of health status on animals within 3 m was modified by DOF and hour of the day
    (p < 0.01) but not the initial body weight category (p = 0.12) (Figure 4). The
    average number of cattle within 3 m illustrated a distinct relationship with health
    status (Figure 4A). Until 6 DOF, the SICK animals had higher numbers of other
    cattle within 3 m (more social), but this changed from day 8 through day 28 when
    the HLTH animals had a higher number of cattle within 3 m (Figure 4A). Figure
    4. Least squares mean average number of cattle within 3 m from the generalized
    model with fixed effects for the interaction between health status and DOF (A)
    and health status and hour of the day (B). The model included effects to control
    for clustering due to repeated measures on individual animals within the pen and
    study site. Each * signifies a significant (p < 0.05) difference within the day
    or record hour between health status categories. Time of day had some effect on
    the differences in social behavior based on health status, with no differences
    noted during mid-day (p ≥ 0.05) and some differences noted in the overnight hours
    (p < 0.05). Animals in the SICK group spent more time with less cattle within
    3 m during the overnight hours (midnight to 7 am). 4. Discussion The objective
    of this study was to describe individual differences in physical activity, feeding/watering
    patterns, and social behavior when associated with health status in commercially
    raised beef cattle during the first 28 DOF. Health status was shown to have a
    significant impact on distance traveled (physical activity), time near water and
    feed, and social behavior. Moreover, many of these effects were modified by time
    of day and DOF, highlighted by novel observations in cattle deemed to be clinically
    sick with BRD. Physical activity and feedlot performance are associated with cattle
    health status categories in the current study. Unsurprisingly, animals designated
    to the SICK category had poor performance compared to those in the HLTH category.
    These findings align with previous research [27,28,29] and indicate that the HLTH
    and SICK categories are correctly delineating degrees of illness. However, these
    findings do not tell the entire story, as the activity of SICK animals differed
    by time of day and DOF. It is unclear why SICK animals traveled a greater distance
    than HTLH animals over the first 2 DOF and whether this observation is truly a
    function of the health status category, but previous work has illustrated lower
    activity in calves with BRD. Many of the behavioral changes identified in other
    research occurred prior to the time of visual diagnosis [8,19]. Similar to DOF,
    the time of day also appeared to modify cattle behavior. One observation to note
    is cattle appear to have high-activity time periods (between approximately 7 to
    9 am and 9 pm to midnight). During these time periods, few differences were identified
    in the morning hours typically associated with feeding time. This may be due to
    social pressures being highest during these time periods when even SICK cattle
    will move with the group. During low-activity times (mid-day), some separation
    (hours 9, 13, 14) in activity levels between the HLTH and SICK animals was observed.
    One conclusion may be that the best time to try to observe potential differences
    in health status is likely a time when baseline activity levels are lower and
    social pressures are not elevated. Interestingly, the HLTH animals appeared to
    be more active closer to midnight than the SICK animals. It is unclear what drove
    this difference, although reasonable speculation might suggest sick animals tend
    to rest more during less social time periods of the day. Time near water may provide
    valuable behavioral information for diagnosing BRD, but time of day and DOF must
    be considered when interpreting these observations. It is noteworthy that SICK
    animals spent a greater percentage of time at water compared to those in the HLTH
    category. This could be due to several potential factors, including acclimatization
    to the new environment and the cattle entering the facility at some level of dehydration,
    which may have increased water consumption. Previous research illustrates that
    shrink, or weight loss during transit (often associated with changes in hydration
    status), is associated with increased BRD risk [30]. One caveat to consider is
    the REDI system only measured water attendance, not consumption; however, previous
    research has illustrated that, when monitored by a real-time location system compared
    to video observation, the probability of cattle drinking when in attendance is
    42–54% [31]. There was also a distinct difference between SICK and HLTH animals
    regarding the hours of the day during which they spent time in the water zone,
    with HLTH animals spending more time near water during the day-time hours and
    SICK animals spending more time during night-time hours. One theory based on past
    observations is that watering behavior during the day may be a more social event,
    whereas in evening hours it is based on individual animal preferences. This finding
    indicates a simple threshold based on time near the location of water may not
    elucidate the differences in health status based on these behavioral patterns.
    Time near feed may also provide valuable behavioral information for diagnosing
    BRD depending on the time of day and days after arrival. Similar to water behavior,
    though, time of day and DOF must also be considered when interpreting these observations.
    Cattle designated as SICK spent more time in attendance at the feed bunk early
    in the feeding period. The feeding area may be an area for socialization and maintaining
    herd cohesion, which may be driving the difference in behavior. However, cattle
    may be trying to participate in herd activities and hide potential illness early
    in the disease process, leading them to spend more time at the feed bunk. Again,
    the time of day also appeared to modify feeding behavior. Observation of anorexia
    or non-aggressive feeding behavior is often considered a hallmark for visual BRD
    diagnosis and has been investigated in dairy cattle as a potential variable of
    interest in predicting health status [18,21,32]. However, these results indicate
    that the timing of observations to identify potentially ill animals may be very
    important. During the highest feeding time activity hours (06, 07), no differences
    were noted based on health status, and few differences were identified during
    the day. Social parameters provided an interesting insight into cattle behavior
    and how they might be used for diagnosing BRD, with differentiation between SICK
    and HLTH animals observed early in the feeding phase. Individual animal isolation
    or separation from the group is often considered a sign of BRD for visual observation
    [16], but in this study, SICK animals spent more time with other HLTH animals
    early in the feeding phase. One behavioral hypothesis is that, due to predator
    and prey relationships, diseased cattle are reluctant to separate from the herd,
    making them harder to identify [33]. These data may indicate that SICK cattle
    were ill early in the feeding phase and did not separate from the herd until after
    the disease had significantly progressed. Among the behavioral attributes monitored,
    socialization illustrated several significant differences based on health status.
    Time of day also appeared to have an effect on the differences in social behavior
    based on health status. Cattle in the SICK group spent less time with fewer cattle
    during the night-time and early morning, which would have been challenging to
    observe during this period without remote monitoring. This is especially noteworthy
    as isolation is commonly considered a hallmark of BRD. Limitations of this work
    include the observational nature of the study, with behavioral changes evaluated
    relative to DOF after arrival. The included study data focused only on known outcomes
    (HLTH, SICK), which allowed for comparison between these two groups but does not
    account for cattle in the INTR group. Thus, the results should not be used as
    definitive predictors of or diagnostic criteria for BRD since there undoubtedly
    were cattle in the INTR group that were sick with BRD. The analysis did not evaluate
    time relative to BRD identification, meaning inferences could only be made about
    the HLTH and SICK cattle based on DOF. Since it is not known when cattle actually
    developed BRD, it is also unclear to what extent cattle behavior was influenced
    by the disease process and how it progressed. The external validity of the results
    is limited to the first 28 DOF at the feedlot. While not a major limitation, it
    is important to recognize that the data reported here cannot be generalized to
    cattle behavior at later stages of the feeding cycle. Due to the retrospective
    nature of the data, the authors were unable to draw any conclusions regarding
    the causation of observations and could only comment on identified correlations,
    which require further experimental investigation. 5. Conclusions Several key behavioral
    parameters (physical activity, proximity to feed and water, and social behavior)
    were associated with health status categories in commercially raised beef cattle
    during the first 28 DOF at the feedlot. Time of the day and DOF modified some
    of these effects to varying degrees. These findings confirm behavioral dogma in
    identifying BRD in feedlot cattle, including observations that sick cattle are
    less physically active and spend an increased amount of time in solitude. However,
    there were additional findings that may help to provide greater context on animal
    behavior as it pertains to health status. The physical activity of sick cattle
    differed by time of day. There were unique times of the day during which sick
    cattle spent more time at the feed bunk. Watering behavior also differed early
    in the feeding phase for sick cattle. A differentiation in social behavior was
    observed early in the feeding phase, with sick cattle behaving more socially (more
    cattle within 3 m) until 6 DOF, after which they became less social. The behavioral
    observations reported here may provide additional information that can be used
    to help inform the process of diagnosing cattle with BRD, as well as improve the
    accuracy of precision monitoring systems in identifying BRD in feedlot cattle.

  description: This study addresses the critical health risks faced by farmers owing
    to the use of harmful chemical pesticides in agriculture. The primary objective
    is to create an effective solution to minimize these risks and reduce the use
    of pesticides. To achieve this, a smart irrigation system has been implemented
    by connecting various sensors, such as moisture sensors and thermal imagers through
    the Internet of Things. These sensors collect vital data on crop moisture levels
    and thermal images that are securely stored in a cloud-based system. The data
    collected were subjected to extensive analysis to ensure accurate pesticide use
    and to identify specific pests affecting crops. In addition, the smart irrigation
    system includes an Android phone for remote monitoring and pesticide spray detection,
    thus offering a convenient remote-based operating system for farmers. This innovative
    system not only proved to be cost-effective but also proved to be significantly
    more efficient than traditional methods, resulting in reduced labor costs. Importantly,
    it not only addressed the health risks associated with pesticide use but also
    led to a significant reduction in overall pesticide use in agriculture. This research
    provides a comprehensive and effective approach to address the health risks farmers

    2019 1 Introduction Agriculture is the backbone of the country’s economy and food
    security, accounting for nearly 60% of India’s population [1]. This sector has
    historically adapted to changing climatic conditions and available resources to
    meet the ever-increasing food demands of a growing population [2]. However, the
    relentless pursuit of greater agricultural productivity often necessitates extensive
    use of pesticides, leading to complex challenges related to pest management, crop
    diseases, and environmental factors [3]. In recent years, the combination of agricultural
    mechanization and expanded farm acreage has made these challenges increasingly
    untenable for manual management. Farmers use a variety of pest control methods,
    ranging from manual pesticide application through backpack sprayers to indiscriminate
    spraying implemented through tractor-mounted systems [4]. Despite their effectiveness,
    these methods present inherent risks and require strict safety precautions [5].
    The advent of robotics and automation technologies has ushered in a new era in
    agriculture, offering innovative solutions to these challenges [6]. Agricultural
    vehicles with advanced capabilities, including navigation, detection, and operation,
    have emerged as indispensable assets in contemporary farming practices [7]. These
    vehicles can seamlessly execute a wide range of tasks, from basic agricultural
    operations to the early detection of plant diseases, which is an indispensable
    part of preventing widespread crop damage [8]. Conventional approaches to the
    identification and classification of plant diseases have traditionally relied
    on expert visual inspection, a method characterized by its cost and time-intensive
    nature [9]. However, technological advances, particularly in image and video processing,
    have paved the way for automation of disease detection and control [10]. These
    state-of-the-art technologies leverage the variations in crop color induced by
    invading pathogens to automatically detect and classify plant diseases [11]. This
    revolutionary development not only increases accuracy but also reduces the burden
    on labor and financial resources. In many developing countries, plant diseases
    are a serious threat to agricultural productivity and result in reduced crop quality
    and quantity. Automated systems designed for disease detection and control represent
    promising solutions for reducing these risks [12]. Moreover, the integration of
    automation in agriculture aligns with a critical need to ensure the safety of
    human operators. This system, combined with automation and robotics, reduces direct
    contact with harmful chemicals, minimizes manual pesticide application, targets
    pesticides using real-time sensor data, and enhances safety through remote monitoring,
    thus decreasing pesticide usage and exposure risks in agriculture. This study
    explored the integration of automation and robotics in agriculture, with particular
    emphasis on reducing pesticide use, increasing safety, and enhancing crop health.
    By surveying the current landscape of agricultural robotics and advances in disease
    detection and control, this study underscores the novel and urgent potential of
    these technologies to drive the transformation of modern agricultural practices,
    reduce environmental impacts, and strengthen food security. This study presents
    an analysis of modern agricultural technologies in Indian farming. We then explore
    innovative advances in disease diagnosis and productivity enhancement in Sect.
    2. The development of agricultural robots is described in Sect. 3, emphasizing
    health risk reduction as a part of the systematic methodology. An overview of
    the robot’s operation is provided in Sect. 4. A robot control flowchart is presented

    of reducing the environmental and health consequences of agrochemicals and maintaining
    agricultural productivity have led to significant technological advances. Nicolopoulou-Stamati
    et al. [13] emphasized the adverse effects of agrochemicals on both human health
    and the ecosystem but acknowledged their role in ensuring food security. To address
    these critical concerns, researchers have pioneered innovative technologies aimed
    at reducing agrochemical effects and optimizing crop yields. Among these innovations,
    the dropleaf technique [14] uses water-sensitive markers to accurately estimate
    the coverage area, particularly during insecticide spraying. By enhancing the
    accuracy of pesticide application, this approach not only reduces waste, but also
    demonstrates the potential of employing environmentally sustainable practices.
    Kotkar et al. [15] proposed an automatic insecticide spraying system that uses
    convolutional neural network (CNN) algorithms to diagnose plant diseases promptly
    and accurately. The combination of advanced machine learning techniques with agriculture
    has potential for targeted and effective pest management. Automation has found
    a place in this quest, as demonstrated by Suganya and Jayaranjani [16], who introduced
    a solar-powered agricultural machine that can streamline agricultural operations,
    thereby reducing dependence on renewable energy sources and the environmental
    footprint. Furthermore, Chand et al. [17] presented an intelligent multipurpose
    agricultural robot (MpSFR) that uses IoT and computer vision (CV) technology to
    perform tasks ranging from precision pesticide spraying to irrigation. Advances
    in automation and robotics have shaped modern agriculture. Chaitanya et al. [18]
    design an automated system for pesticide treatment with L293d motor driver, Raspberry
    Pi3 system and robot. This integration not only enhances efficiency, but also
    reduces human exposure to harmful chemicals. Recognizing the need for sustainable
    solutions, Ramesh et al. [19] emphasized the need for cost-effective solar-powered
    technologies to protect crops and reduce losses. Similarly, Chaudhary et al. and
    Olabanji, Olayinka Mohammed [20, 21] introduced an intelligent robotic insecticide
    spraying system that uses a Node MCU microcontroller as the core to reduce direct
    human contact with pesticides, while increasing productivity. Furthermore, the
    incorporation of Internet of Things (IoT) technology in agriculture, highlighted
    by Suganya et al. [22], has the potential to optimize resource use by providing
    accurate nutrient requirement estimates and enabling real-time monitoring of land
    and crop conditions, thereby reducing labor and input costs. The nexus between
    technology and agriculture promotes the development of sustainable and efficient
    agricultural practices. These advances, exemplified by Kumbhare et al. [23] and
    Sai Yeswant et al. [24], show promise in reducing the environmental impact, ensuring
    food safety, and enhancing occupational safety for agricultural workers. In this
    innovation landscape, this literature review emphasizes the importance of novel
    solutions that can reshape the future of agriculture. 3 Methodology This study
    provides a methodological framework for developing a robotic model designed for

    contemporary challenges in the agricultural sector. 4 Module description The system
    under consideration comprises of embedded C language, Arduino microcontrollers,
    power sources, DC motors, motor drivers, Bluetooth modules, and Automatic Speech
    Recognition (AMR) capabilities. In Fig. 2 shows the Proposed Assembling of Hardware
    Schematic. Fig. 2 Proposed assembling of hardware schematic Full size image 4.1
    Arduino controller The Arduino boards use AVR microcontrollers with varying amounts
    of flash memory, pins, and features as shown in Fig. 3. The 32-bit Arduino Due,
    based on the Atmel SAM3X8E, was introduced in 2012. The boards use pins or female
    headers that facilitate connections for programming and incorporation into other
    circuits. These may connect with add-on modules termed shields. Most boards include
    a 5 V linear regulator and a 16 MHz crystal oscillator or ceramic resonator. Some
    designs run at 8 MHz and dispense with the onboard voltage regulator due to specific
    form-factor restrictions. Fig. 3 Arduino controller Full size image 4.2 Power
    supply A power supply is a device that provides electrical or other forms of energy
    to an output load or group of loads. Typically, the term “power supply unit” or
    PSU is used to describe such devices or systems. Although power supplies can provide
    various types of energy, the term is most frequently associated with electrical
    power supplies, and less commonly with mechanical or other types of energy. The
    power supply section is an essential component that converts the incoming AC signal
    to a DC signal while reducing the signal’s amplitude. In particular, the AC voltage
    signal from the mains (230 V/50 Hz) needs to be converted to a DC voltage (with
    no frequency) with an amplitude of + 5 and + 12 V for various applications. This
    section typically includes a transformer and bridge rectifier, which are connected
    in series. The output is then passed through voltage regulators for + 5 and + 12
    V (7805 and 7812), connected in parallel via a capacitor (1000 µF ), as shown
    in the circuit diagram in Fig. 4. Fig. 4 Power supply circuit diagram Full size
    image Each voltage regulator’s output is again connected to a set of capacitors
    (100, 10, 1, 0.1) connected in parallel, from which the corresponding output (+ 5
    or + 12 V) is taken into consideration. Overall, the power supply section plays
    a crucial role in providing stable and reliable DC voltage signals to power the
    various components of the circuit. 4.3 DC motor A DC motor is a mechanical device
    that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. To understand the operating
    principle of a DC motor, it is essential to comprehend Fleming’s left-hand rule,
    which determines the direction of force on the armature conductors of a DC motor.
    According to this rule, when the index finger, middle finger, and thumb of the
    left hand are extended in a way that the current-carrying conductor is placed
    in a magnetic field (represented by the index finger) that is perpendicular to
    the direction of current (represented by the middle finger), the conductor experiences
    a force in a direction (represented by the thumb) that is mutually perpendicular
    to the direction of the field and the current in the conductor. Figure 5 shows
    the circuit diagram of the DC motor. Fig. 5 Circuit diagram of the DC motor Full
    size image 4.4 L293D IC motor driver The L293 and L293D are electronic components
    that function as quadruple high-current half-H drivers. These devices are capable
    of bidirectional drive currents of up to 1 A, with a voltage range of 4.5 to 36
    V. The L293 and L293D have a temperature range of 0 to 70 °C for operation. Each
    output of the L293 and L293D is a complete totem-pole drive circuit, consisting
    of a Darlington transistor sink and a pseudo-Darlington source. The drivers are
    enabled in pairs, with drivers 1 and 2 enabled by 1,2EN, and drivers 3 and 4 enabled
    by 3,4EN. The L293D IC Motor Driver is shown in Fig. 6 shows the circuit diagram.

    serial bluetooth module Bluetooth is a wireless communication technology that
    enables the interconnection of mobile phones, PDAs, and personal computers using
    short-range wireless connections. Bluetooth modules chips can be used to establish
    wireless communication between two devices, with each device having its unique
    MAC address. The HC-05 module, depicted in the Fig. 7, is an easy-to-use Bluetooth
    Serial Port Protocol module that facilitates a wireless serial connection setup.
    The module operates using the silicon radio BC417 2.4 GHz Bluetooth chip with
    CMOS technology and employs an external 8 MB flash memory. The HC-05 module requires
    a 3.3 V power supply. It is noteworthy that the HC-05 module is widely used in
    various applications, such as wireless control and data transfer, among others.

    study establishes that voice commands for the robot are analyzed via an android
    application and transmitted through Bluetooth [25]. After thorough deliberation,
    the research team opted for an Android OS interface as the speech processing platform,
    owing to its versatile and extensive functionalities. Furthermore, this platform
    facilitates a seamless and dependable association with the Google Speech processing
    libraries, ensuring seamless and precise speech recognition. Andriod application

    image 5 Flowchart for robot operation The operation of the robot using Bluetooth
    control involves several steps, which are illustrated in the flowchart in Fig.
    9. The following is a description of the steps: (1) Start: The process starts
    with the initiation of the robot system. (2) Initialize port: The ports of the
    system are initialized to ensure that they are ready to receive data. (3) Initialize
    Bluetooth: The Bluetooth module is initialized to enable wireless communication
    between the robot and the control device. (4) Wait for Bluetooth data: The system
    waits for data to be received via Bluetooth from the control device. (5) If data
    received (Yes/No): The system checks whether data has been received. If data has
    been received, it proceeds to the next step. If not, it goes back to step 4 to
    wait for data. (6) If Yes: If data has been received, the system executes the
    command received to move the robot and spray pesticide. (7) End: The process is
    terminated. Fig. 9 Flowcharts for robot operation Full size image This flowchart
    provides a clear representation of the steps involved in controlling the robot
    using Bluetooth. It enables easy understanding and implementation of the system
    by users, thereby enhancing the efficiency of the robot control system. 6 Construction
    of a sprinkler irrigation system The sprinkler irrigation system follows a systematic
    approach, drawing valuable insights from the flowcharts in Fig. 9, which were
    originally designed for robotic operation. This methodology ensures a well-structured
    developmental process. During the system design and planning phases, we used the
    logic of the flowchart to accurately determine sprinkler head positions, sensor
    placements, and irrigation coverage areas. During the hardware assembly, we interface
    the Arduino microcontroller with an embedded C code to establish control over
    the DC motors for precise movement. Inspired by the flowchart principles, we optimized
    the motor control, used Bluetooth for remote access, and integrated sensors, such
    as soil moisture and temperature sensors, to improve system intelligence. The
    sprinkler heads and piping were strategically placed for uniform water distribution.
    Optionally, Automatic Speech Recognition (AMR) can be used for voice control.
    Rigorous testing, motivated by the care of the flowchart, validates system functionality,
    followed by fine-tuning for optimization. After successful testing, the system
    was implemented and maintained for long-term irrigation. We adopted the structural
    approach from the robot operation flowcharts shown in Fig. 9 for our construction
    approach, as shown in Fig. 10. Our approach introduces innovations in irrigation
    technology through the use of a sprinkler irrigation system. By following the
    logic of the flowchart, we precisely planned and designed the system by strategically
    placing sprinkler heads and sensors. The hardware assembly is guided by flowchart
    principles, which include the Arduino microcontrollers, embedded C code, and precision
    motor control. Bluetooth communication improves remote access, and advanced sensors
    provide intelligent irrigation decisions that reflect a streamlined approach to
    robot operation. The sprinkler setup ensures a uniform water distribution, and
    for added innovation, automatic speech recognition (AMR) is integrated for voice
    control. Rigorous testing was used to verify the functionality of the system,
    followed by fine-tuning for optimal performance. With expansion and ongoing maintenance,
    this innovative sprinkler irrigation system ensures efficient and reliable irrigation.

    burden 1. Introduction Globally, rivers provide several benefits, including clean
    water, wildlife habitat, recreation, and spiritual and cultural activities. However,
    they also are a source of pathogenic microbes, due to the discharge of pollutants
    from anthropogenic sources (Khatri and Tyagi, 2015). Contamination of rivers by
    microbial pathogens ultimately leads to the emergence of waterborne diseases (Nwabor
    et al., 2016). Contaminated rivers play a critical role in the transmission of
    pathogens, including antibiotic-resistant ones. South Africa is a water-scarce
    country, and communities rely on their freshwater bodies such as rivers for irrigation,
    domestic water, recreation, spiritual and cultural activities (Molobela and Pramod,
    2011; Njage and Buys, 2015; Mboweni and De Crom, 2016; Sekwadi et al., 2018).
    Rivers are increasingly being recognised as reservoirs of clinically important
    antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) and antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs), and
    they have the potential to transmit these to humans (Abia et al., 2018). Furthermore,
    ARGs can be exchanged between environmental bacteria, human/animal commensals,
    and pathogens. The increase in pathogen resistance to clinically relevant antibiotics
    is a global concern, as this can lead to increased mortality associated with infectious
    diseases, including waterborne infections (O''Flaherty and Cummins, 2017). Campylobacter
    species are one of the major causes of waterborne infections, and are one of the
    key pathogens responsible for bacterial gastroenteritis. Campylobacter infections
    are characterised by watery, non-bloody, non-inflammatory diarrhoea, abdominal
    pain, and fever (Shobo et al., 2016). The infections are usually self-limiting,
    but more severe cases can result in Guillain-Barre syndrome, reactive arthritis,
    and abortion (Aksomaitiene et al., 2019). Despite infection symptoms being self-limiting,
    patients are treated with antibiotics when infections prolong. The antibiotics
    used in the treatment of infections due to Campylobacter species are macrolides
    (erythromycin, azithromycin, and clarithromycin), fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin),
    and tetracycline (Chukwu et al., 2019). Globally, the prevalence of Campylobacter
    infections is on the rise, and this phenomenon, coupled with the tendency of these
    bacterial species to resist the actions of antibiotics, renders them a serious
    public health threat (Aksomaitiene et al., 2019; Igwaran and Okoh, 2019). Antibiotic-resistant
    Campylobacter and ARGs have been detected in river water (Moore et al., 2001;
    Van Dyke et al., 2010; Andrzejewska et al., 2022) and this can pose health risks
    to humans exposed to infected water bodies. The common potential routes of human
    exposure to ARB and ARGs in environmental water are ingestion, dermal contact,
    and inhalation (Manaia, 2017; Shuai et al., 2021). Existing regulations for water
    quality are based on routine monitoring of indicator organisms and physicochemical
    parameters. For many years water quality management and research have been based
    on these parameters (Okeyo et al., 2018). Despite evidence that recreational water
    is a known reservoir and transmission path for ARGs and ARB, current regulations
    for recreational water quality do not consider antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter
    or any other antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The regulations only consider indicator
    organisms. For example, the WHO guidelines for recreational water stipulate the
    minimum concentrations for intestinal Enterococci (≤40/100 ml), while the European
    Union (EU) bathing waters directive 2006 (2006/7/EC) guideline values for excellent
    water quality are less than 100 CFU/100 ml for Enterococci, and less than 250
    CFU/100 ml for Escherichia coli (Efstratiou and Tsirtsis, 2009). Similarly, the
    guidelines for Canadian recreational water quality only consider Escherichia coli
    (≤235 CFU/100 ml) and Enterococci (≤70 CFU/100 ml) (Saleem et al., 2023). The
    Australian guidelines for recreational water quality and aesthetics also do not
    consider antibiotic-resistant bacteria, but do stipulate the concentrations for
    Enterococci organisms (≤35/100 ml) and faecal coliform organisms (≤150/100 ml).
    The South African water quality guidelines for recreation state that faecal coliform
    counts, or E. coli, should not exceed 130 CFU/100 mL (DWAF, 1996). Currently,
    no guideline considers antibiotic-resistant bacteria and their antibiotic resistance
    genes (ARGs), and therefore there are no set limits. However, WHO guidelines have
    recognised antibiotic resistance to be one of the emerging pollutants in freshwater,
    including in recreational waters, rivers, and lakes (WHO, 2021). Antibiotic-resistant
    strains of various bacteria, including Campylobacter, have been detected in recreational
    waters in many parts of the world (O''Flaherty et al., 2019; Tyagi and Kumar,
    2021). Studying the exposure dose of ARGs through different routes (ingestion,
    inhalation, and skin contact) can contribute to a better understanding of the
    potential health risks of antibiotic microbial resistance (AMR) in human-related
    environments. Currently, there is no standard method for exposure risk assessment
    of pathogenic bacteria and ARGs from environmental waters. However, a few studies
    have provided a convenient and reliable way of assessing the exposure dose to
    human populations (Li, 2020a, Li, 2020b; Shuai et al., 2021). In these studies,
    the intake burden/dose of targeted ARGs or bacterial genus was estimated from
    the product of the target concentration in water, and the ingestion rate/inhalation
    rate/skin surface area for dermal contact. Ingestion rate is an approximation
    of the volume of water which water users typically ingest in an average session
    of their chosen activity (Leonard et al., 2018). Inhalation rate (20 m3/day per
    person) is an approximated average volume of air inhaled per person per day (USEPA,
    2011), while skin surface area is an approximated value of 16,000 cm2, based on
    literature data (Li, 2020a, Li, 2020b). The exposure data (dose) estimated through
    this method can be used to estimate the human health risks. The estimated exposure
    dose of Campylobacter and associated ARGs through accidental ingestion of recreational
    water can provide an evaluation of the potential health risk of antibiotic-resistant
    Campylobacter spp. in selected rivers in the Eastern Cape, South Africa. Accidental
    ingestion is emphasized here because the water from the rivers is not expected
    to be intentionally ingested (used as drinking water) without some level of treatment.
    The extent to which recreational water contributes to human exposure to Campylobacteriosis
    remains uncertain. To our knowledge, this is the first study designed to estimate
    potential human exposure (dose) to Campylobacter and associated ARGs through accidental
    ingestion of water from rivers used for recreation. This study aimed to assess
    the potential human exposure to Campylobacter and its ARGs from selected rivers
    through accidental ingestion during swimming, by calculating human hourly intake
    of ARGs and the average hourly ingested dose rates of Campylobacter spp. The estimated
    exposure dose of Campylobacter and associated ARGs through accidental ingestion
    of recreational water can contribute to the evaluation of the potential health
    risk of antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter spp. in aquatic environments. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Description of the study area and water sample collection Bloukrans
    River has a length of approximately 40 km and flows in the south-easterly direction
    through the town of Makhanda (33°18′33.0″ S and 26°31′36.0″ E) and Belmont valley
    farms (Mangadze et al., 2019) (Fig. 1). In contrast, the Swartkops River is approximately
    155 km long and flows through highly urbanised and industrialised areas of the
    Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality (NMBM) (Adams et al., 2019). Both rivers support
    recreational, agricultural, and livestock production for the local communities
    and both are prone to pollution by anthropogenic activities (Fig. 2). A total
    of 44 samples were collected from both the Bloukrans and Swartkops rivers, Eastern
    Cape, South Africa. Download : Download high-res image (1MB) Download : Download

    (Sites SC, S1, S2, S3, S4, and S5) on the Swartkops River, Eastern Cape, South
    Africa. A minimum of two (2) litres of water samples were collected from each
    of the eleven sampling sites (BC, B1, B2, B3, and B4 for the Bloukrans River and
    SC, S1, S2, S3, S4, S5 for the Swartkops River). Water sampling was conducted
    four times at each site. Sites BC and SC were designated as the control sites
    for the two rivers. These two sites were chosen because at the time of testing
    they were the least impacted by anthropogenic activities. Water quality parameters
    were measured on-site before the water samples were collected. The parameters
    measured were pH, temperature (°C), electrical conductivity (μs/cm), dissolved
    oxygen (mg/L), (Hanna Instruments, South Africa), and turbidity in Nephelometric
    Turbidity Units (NTU), (Turbidimeter, Eutech Instruments, USA). These parameters
    were selected because they play a critical role in the survival of Campylobacter
    species in the aquatic environment. The water samples were then transported to
    the laboratory in a cooler box and kept at 4 °C before processing. 2.2. Sample
    processing Water samples were processed by centrifuging each 2-L sample. The water
    was centrifuged at a maximum of 14,000 g for 60 min using a centrifuge (Avanti®
    J-E Centrifuge Beckman Coulter, Inc. USA). The supernatant was carefully poured
    into a sterile container, then the pellets were scraped off and placed into sterile
    Eppendorf tubes. The collected supernatant was then filtered through sterile 47
    mm/0.45 μm cellulose nitrate membrane filters (Whatman, plc, UK), using a membrane
    filtration assembly. The filters were added to the pellets and then treated with
    already prepared propidium monoazide (PMA™) (Biotium, Inc. Fremont, CA 94538,
    USA) which was stored in the dark at −20 °C. The filter and pellets were suspended
    in PBS and a volume of PMA was added to the suspension. The micro-centrifuge tubes
    were then placed on ice and incubated in the dark for 5 min. The micro-centrifuge
    tubes were then exposed to a 650 W halogen light source for 10 min. The tubes
    were placed at a distance of 20 cm from the light source and were inverted occasionally
    to ensure thorough mixing (Li et al., 2014). Following PMA treatment, DNA was
    extracted from the pellets and filter mix, using a commercial genomic DNA isolation
    kit (Qiagen Kit, DNeasy PowerSoil Pro Kit, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Germany)
    according to the manufacturer''s instructions. The concentration and quality of
    the extracted DNA were determined using a Nanodrop 2000 UV–Vis Spectrophotometer
    (ThermoFisher Scientific, Lenexa KS, USA). Samples that had a 260/280 absorbance
    ratio between 1.7 and 2.1 were regarded as good-quality DNA and used for downstream
    applications. 2.3. Detection of Campylobacter species and antibiotic-resistant
    genes Campylobacter was detected by targeting the 16 S rRNA gene using primers
    C412F and C1228R. Campylobacter multi-drug resistant genes were detected using
    the primers cmeA, cmeB, and cmeC. Campylobacter tetracycline-resistant genes were
    detected using the tetO primers. These genes were selected because of the reported
    increase in antibiotic resistance amongst Campylobacter isolates from various
    sources, including water. Tetracycline-resistant genes (tetO) were chosen due
    to a documented increase in Campylobacter resistance to this type of antibiotic
    and other relevant antibiotics (Szczepanska et al., 2017). The Campylobacter multidrug
    efflux pump (cmeABC) genes are known to confer resistance to a wide range of structurally
    unrelated antibiotics, and so their presence can cover a wide range of other antibiotics
    (Otigbu et al., 2018). All the primers were synthesised by Inqaba Biotech, South
    Africa. The primer sequences and PCR conditions are specified in Table 1. The
    PCR reaction mixture consisted of 25 μL EmeraldAmp GT PCR master mix (Takara Bio
    Inc, China), 2 μL forward, 2 μL reverse primers, 2 μL template DNA, and 19 μL
    molecular grade water to make up a volume of 50 μL. All PCR products were analysed
    by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels (CSL-AG100, Cleaver Scientific Ltd. Warwickshire,
    UK). Thereafter, the gel was placed in a UV imaging system (molecular imager ChemiDocTM
    XRS+, BIO-RAD) to capture its image. Table 1. Primers used to detect Campylobacter

    and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in river water samples by qPCR The qPCR
    assay for the detection of Campylobacter and ARGs was performed in 20 μL reaction
    mixtures consisting of 4 μL HOT FIREPol® EvaGreen® qPCR Mix Plus (Solis Biodyne,
    Tartu, Estonia), 0.4 μL forward primer, 0.4 μL reverse primer, 2 μL template DNA
    and 13 μL molecular grade water. The primers and PCR conditions used are listed
    in Table 1. The conditions for the melt curve cycle were 95 °C for 15s, 60 °C
    for 60 s, and 95 °C for 1 s. The reactions were performed on a QuantStudio 5 Real-Time
    PCR System (ThermoFisher Scientific, Lenexa KS, USA). The qPCR results were analysed
    using the QuantStudio Design and Analysis software version 1.5.2 (ThermoFisher
    Scientific, Lenexa KS, USA). Only wells with a slope of −3.1 to −3.6, r2 = 0.980
    to 1.00, amplification efficiencies of 90%–110%, and melting curves with single
    peaks were considered (Bustin et al., 2009). Mean cycle threshold (CT) values
    were obtained and genome copies were estimated using the formula: mass = DNA size
    (base pairs) × 1 mol/6.023e23 molecules × 660 g/mol. 2.5. Assessment of human
    exposure risk To assess the human exposure risk to Campylobacter spp. and ARGs,
    the major exposure pathways were first identified. The authors acknowledge that
    the major exposure pathways for the two rivers are ingestion, inhalation, and
    skin contact. However, in this study, ARGs on skin and aerosol samples were not
    determined, and therefore the risk of exposure through these two pathways was
    not assessed. Exposure to river water via ingestion during swimming is of short
    duration compared to the daily intake of ARGs via ingestion from drinking the
    water. Therefore, the event intake of the ARGs during swimming was evaluated for
    an hour instead of daily duration, a method determined by Shuai et al. (2021).
    The human intake of Campylobacter ARGs from a river per hour (copy/h) during recreational
    swimming was calculated by multiplying the concentration of ARGs (copy/L) by the
    ingestion rate (21 ml/h on average) following the method by Shuai et al. (2021).
    The ingestion rate of (21 ml/h) for recreational swimming is calculated based
    on data from a previous study (Dorevitch et al., 2011). The event intake of the
    pathogens at the genus level was calculated by multiplying the 16 S rRNA gene
    concentration (copy/L) with the ingestion rate (21 ml/h on average). Human intake
    of Campylobacter ARGs (copy/hr) was calculated by multiplying the concentration
    (copy/L) by the ingestion rate (21 ml/h on average) (Shuai et al., 2021). 3. Results
    3.1. Detection of Campylobacter and ARGs This study analysed river water samples
    from the Bloukrans and Swartkops rivers, Eastern Cape, South Africa. Water samples
    were collected from control sites and sites impacted by anthropogenic activities.
    Water quality parameters were measured on-site before collecting water samples,
    given that these parameters are critical to the survival of Campylobacter species
    in the aquatic environment. The physicochemical parameters recorded are presented
    in Table 2. Additionally, we measured average Escherichia coli concentrations
    of 144–362 CFU/ml and 21–196 CFU/ml for the Bloukrans and Swartkops rivers, respectively,
    which indicates faecal contamination. Table 2. Physico-chemical characteristics

    (6.4) Mean (standard deviation). For the Bloukrans River, twenty (20) river water
    samples from five (5) sites influenced by different anthropogenic activities were
    analysed. Campylobacter was detected in 13 samples (60%). Of the Campylobacter-positive
    samples, 22.72% were positive for cmeA, while 52.27% were positive for cmeB, 15%
    were positive for cmeC and 61% were positive for tetO. All the samples positive
    for Campylobacter were also positive for at least one Campylobacter antibiotic-resistant
    gene. For the Swartkops River, twenty-four (24) river water samples from six (6)
    sites influenced by different anthropogenic activities were analysed. Campylobacter
    was detected in 14 samples (58%). Of the Campylobacter-positive samples found,
    cmeA, cmeB, cmeC, and tetO genes were detected at concentrations of 14.29%, 50%,
    7.14%, and 50%, respectively. None of the river samples from the control sites
    (BC and SC) showed positive results for Campylobacter or any of the antibiotic-resistance
    genes being tested. The same observations were also made for site S1 on the Swartkops
    River. This site lies downstream of the control site and is one of the least impacted
    by human activities. 3.2. Quantification of Campylobacter 16 S rRNA genes In Fig.

    sites showed a higher concentration of the Campylobacter 16 S rRNA gene than the
    Swartkops River. For the Swartkops River, the mean concentration of the Campylobacter
    16 S rRNA gene ranged from 4.72 to 1.11 × 104 copies/ml (Fig. 3). The highest

    result in severe symptoms in children, immunocompromised individuals, and the
    elderly (Barker et al., 2020). Exposure to Campylobacter antibiotic-resistant
    genes may result in even more severe effects (Otigbu et al., 2018). Exposure to
    infected water in the environment has been identified as a risk factor for Campylobacter
    infection and has been linked to outbreaks of waterborne diseases (Pitkänen, 2013;
    Gorham and Lee, 2016). This study assessed potential human exposure to Campylobacter
    and its ARGs from river water samples from the Bloukrans and Swartkops rivers,
    Eastern Cape, South Africa. Results of the prevalence of Campylobacter (60% and
    58%) in water samples from the Bloukrans and Swartkops rivers, respectively, are
    comparable with results from other rivers around the world. In Bangladesh Campylobacter
    spp. Was detected in 60% of untreated river water used as drinking water for ducks
    at a farm (Uddin et al., 2021). Similarly, in the Netherlands, Campylobacter was
    detected in 66% of surface water samples (Mulder et al., 2021). In some instances,
    the prevalence of Campylobacter infection has been relatively higher or lower
    than that recorded in this study for the Bloukrans and Swartkops rivers. For example
    in Mozambique, Campylobacter spp. Was detected in 95% of Inkomati river water.
    This higher prevalence could be because the Inkomati river receives run-off from
    large-scale poultry production in the catchment (Taviani et al., 2022). In contrast,
    a lower prevalence of 8.1% for Campylobacter spp. in river water from Poland was
    reported (Andrzejewska et al., 2022). The concentration of ARGs in this study
    is lower than that reported by Zhang et al. (2022) where the absolute abundance
    of total ARGs in river water ranged from 2.71 × 106 to 8.35 × 108 copies/L. Similarly,
    a mean concentration of the ARGs intI1, suls, tets, erms, and qnrs was reported
    in Yangtze River Delta in China at 1.23 × 109, 1.86 × 108, 1.99 × 107, 6.83 ×
    106, and 4.23 × 105 copies/L (Yang et al., 2020). These concentrations were higher
    than those recorded in this study because they did not specifically target Campylobacter
    ARGs. Only limited studies have specifically quantified Campylobacter ARGs in
    river water. The lower concentrations found in this study may also be attributed
    to the treatment with propidium monoazide, which led to the detection of only
    viable DNA. For the Bloukrans River, the mean concentration of the Campylobacter
    16 S rRNA gene ranged from 3.38 × 104 to 1.75 × 105 copies/ml (Fig. 2). The highest
    concentration was detected at site B2, a site that lies downstream of a wastewater
    discharge point. For the Swartkops River, the mean concentration of the Campylobacter
    16 S rRNA gene ranged from 4.72 to 1.11 × 104 copies/ml (Fig. 2). The highest
    concentration was detected at site S2, which lies downstream of a wastewater discharge
    point. The level of Campylobacter in the Bloukrans River is high compared to that
    found by Ahmed et al. (2009). Considering how low an infectious dose is (500 CFU
    can cause illness), the current concentrations of Campylobacter in Bloukrans River
    could pose significant health risks. Campylobacter and ARG prevalence and their
    concentrations were higher in the Bloukrans River samples than in the Swartkops
    River samples. For the Swartkops River, the mean concentration for the Campylobacter
    16 S rRNA gene ranged from 4.72 to 1.11 × 104 copies/ml, which is lower than the
    3.38 × 104 to 1.75 × 105 copies/ml recorded for the Bloukrans. The prevalence
    of ARGs recorded for the Bloukrans River was higher than that for the Swartkops
    River. The high values observed in the Bloukrans River can be attributed to the
    differences in width and flow rate. The Swartkops River has a higher depth, width,
    and flow rate than the Bloukrans River, and, and therefore the quantity of pathogens
    is reduced due to dilution (O''Flaherty et al., 2019). In addition, the Bloukrans
    River receives a large volume of insufficiently treated effluent from the nearby
    dysfunctional and dilapidated Wastewater Treatment Works (WWTW), and this can
    contribute to high concentrations of Campylobacter (Vereen et al., 2013). The
    prevalence of Campylobacter is influenced by the water quality of the rivers.
    The physicochemical properties of the water samples from the Bloukrans and Swartkops
    rivers indicate that Campylobacter can thrive in both rivers (Hilton et al., 2001;
    Van Dyke et al., 2010; Culotti and Packman, 2015; Teh, Lee and Dykes, 2017). Based
    on the Escherichia coli concentrations of the water samples (144–362 CFU/ml and
    21–196 CFU/ml) from Bloukrans and Swartkops rivers, respectively, the presence
    of Campylobacter can be inferred, as this pathogen is associated with faecal contaminated
    water. In addition, the high turbidity (44.9–54 NTU), low dissolved oxygen (2.5–4.6
    mg/L), and high conductivity (2151.5–3131 μs/cm) recorded in these rivers, which
    are impacted by wastewater discharge, agriculture activities, livestock grazing,
    and run-off from nearby informal settlements, all promote the proliferation of
    Campylobacter species (Pitkänen, 2013; Gorham and Lee, 2016). It is therefore
    not surprising that Campylobacter and its ARGs concentrations were higher for
    sites which recorded high turbidity, low dissolved oxygen, and high electrical
    conductivity. These observations correlate with previous studies, which have reported
    the presence of Campylobacter in rivers highly impacted by human activities (Strachan
    et al., 2013; Otigbu et al., 2018; Chukwu et al., 2019; Mulder et al., 2021).
    For both rivers, the prevalence of Campylobacter was high for sites downstream
    of the WWTP effluent discharge points, sites in areas where the predominant land
    use is agriculture, where animals access the river for drinking water, and sites
    with nearby informal settlements lacking solid waste management systems. The presence
    of Campylobacter in rivers impacted by human activities has been reported in previous
    studies (Strachan et al., 2013; Otigbu et al., 2018; Chukwu et al., 2019; Mulder
    et al., 2021). Frequent faecal contamination of the water by livestock, farm animal
    manure runoffs, solid waste, discharge of poorly treated wastewater, and urban
    runoff from the community into these rivers may lead to high concentrations of
    viable Campylobacter (Abulreesh et al., 2006; Karikari et al., 2016). Runoff from
    livestock production farms along the Bloukrans and Swartkops rivers has been implicated
    as a source of ARGs as well as ARBs in the river. Local studies in South Africa
    indicate that antibiotic use in livestock production is high (Pillay et al., 2020;
    Sithole et al., 2021). This practice has been linked to the high spread and transmission
    of antibiotic-resistant zoonotic pathogens such as Campylobacter, Salmonella,
    E. coli, and Shigella (Chala et al., 2021). Studies suggest that animals poorly
    absorb antibiotics in their guts and may excrete high concentrations of antibiotic
    residues in their faecal matter and urine. Animal excreta from livestock may therefore
    lead to a high concentration of ARB and ARGs being released into the Bloukrans
    and Swartkops rivers by livestock which graze the river banks. The Bloukrans and
    Swartkops rivers are both seriously impacted by pollution inputs from different
    insufficiently treated effluent from dysfunctional Wastewater Treatment Works
    (WWTW). Antibiotic-resistant pathogens, including Campylobacter and their genes,
    are introduced into the rivers through the discharge of wastewater. Wastewater
    carries both resistant and sensitive pathogen organisms such as Campylobacter
    spp, E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Shigella spp., Salmonella spp., and Vibrio spp.
    (Fouz et al., 2020). In addition, the wastewater may also contain ARG and antibiotic
    residuals which are then discharged into the rivers, making the rivers hot spots
    for the transmission and development of antimicrobial resistance (Berendonk et
    al., 2015; Adams et al., 2019; Phungela et al., 2022). The fate of the ARGs is
    multi-faceted; they can be diluted, adsorbed onto particulate matter, degrade
    through biological and non-biological processes, or be taken up by aquatic microorganisms
    through horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (Chen and Dubnau, 2004; Lapara et al.,
    2015). Dilution of ARGs does occur in high-flowing rivers (Lapara et al., 2015;
    Jerde et al., 2016; Anyaduba and Laboratories, 2017). However, in the case of
    the Bloukrans and Swartkops rivers, which are located in the drought-prone Eastern
    Cape, South Africa, dilution may not necessarily reduce the concentration of ARGs.
    The ARGs can interact with minerals and humic substances, and are immobilised
    in sediments (Nnadozie and Odume, 2019). ARGs will persist longer in rivers owing
    to immobilization, and extended persistence of ARGs provides an opportunity for
    resuspension during high-flow events or shear stress (Turner et al., 2015). It
    can be argued that degradation, a significant process which influences the fate
    of ARGs in the freshwater environment, may occur either through natural sunlight
    exposure or biotic processes involving DNases. The DNases are secreted by the
    organotrophic microbiome while metabolizing large organic molecules, before they
    are assimilated into cells. ARGs adsorb to sediments and their components, which
    protects them from biological degradation (Turner et al., 2015). Data on the capacity
    of sunlight to degrade ARGS is still scarce, however, generally, sunlight-mediated
    degradation does not eliminate ARGs in the freshwater environment. Therefore,
    ARGs can be assimilated by competent bacteria within the environment and then
    incorporated into the bacterial genome (Yoon et al., 2018; Nnadozie and Odume,
    2019). Based on this discussion, it can be deduced that ARGs may persist in rivers.
    It is therefore feasible that humans can be exposed to ARGs via drinking water,
    consumption of crops irrigated with contaminated water, and through recreational
    activities (Kaakoush et al., 2015). Microbial pollution of these rivers can be
    mitigated through adequate treatment of wastewater, controlled grazing, and proper
    solid waste management in the community. With regard to assessment of the risk
    of exposure, the exposure dose of Campylobacter via accidental ingestion to humans,
    that is, 7.1 × 105–3.7 × 106 copies/h, which was recorded for the Bloukrans River
    in this study, is comparable to the 2.67 × 103–4.18 × 106 copies/h calculated
    by Shuai et al. (2021) for the dissemination of total antibiotic-resistant opportunistic
    pathogens via swimming. Accidental ingestion, however, emphasized in this study,
    remains the main exposure pathway to humans in recreational water. The study by
    Shuai et al. (2021) investigated the exposure dose of ARGs and antibiotic-resistant
    opportunistic pathogens during swimming in a pool. The exposure dose/intake burden/targeted
    ARG or bacterial genus was estimated from the product of the target concentration
    in water and ingestion rate. Ingestion rate is an approximation of the volume
    of water that water users typically ingest in an average session of their chosen
    activity (Leonard et al., 2018). The exposure dose of Campylobacter via accidental
    ingestion of Bloukrans river water is higher than that calculated by Shuai et
    al. (2021), for antibiotic-resistant opportunistic Mycobacterium (7.47 × 102–1.41
    × 107 copies/h) via swimming in pools. Shuai et al. estimated the human exposure
    dose of Mycobacterium via swimming in recreational pools as 7.47 × 102–1.41 ×
    107 copies/h. This difference is expected because swimming pool water is treated,
    and will be of better microbiological and physico-chemical quality than river
    water. The exposure dose of ARGs for 1 h through accidental ingestion of water
    from the Bloukrans and Swartkops rivers is comparable to that via ingestion of
    drinking water (104–105 copies/day) (L. N. Li, 2020a, Li, 2020b). The intake burden
    (copies/hr) of Campylobacter ARGs for the Bloukrans River ranged from 1.64 × 104–5.8
    × 105 copies/hr for cmeB and 1.0 × 103–5.7 × 104 copies/hr for tetO. In contrast,
    the intake burden for Swartkops River ranged from 3.6 × 102–1.551 × 105 copies/hr
    for cmeB and 9.98 × 102–5.7 × 104 copies/hr for tetO. Therefore, just by accidently
    ingesting water from the Bloukrans River, one can be exposed to the same dose
    of ARGs as one would be by drinking the water intentionally. This indicates an
    increased risk to human health through accidental ingestion. These results also
    suggest that the route of waterborne transmission of ARGs from these rivers poses
    a high risk of ARG exposure via ingestion to local residents who use the rivers
    for recreation or other activities, such as baptism/cultural rituals, as accidental
    ingestion can occur. Exposure to natural waters has been identified as a risk
    factor for Campylobacter infection (Pitkänen, 2013; Gorham and Lee, 2016). Furthermore,
    exposure to natural waters used for recreation has been linked to outbreaks of
    waterborne diseases. A study between 2007 and 2008 demonstrated that ingestion
    of contaminated recreational water accounted for 81 outbreaks of waterborne diseases
    in the US (Gorham and Lee, 2016). Ingestion of contaminated water is just one
    of the major routes of human exposure. The Swartkops and Bloukrans rivers also
    support other anthropogenic activities such as fishing and crop irrigation, and
    are both sources of water for livestock such as goats and cattle. Therefore, other
    routes of human exposure to Campylobacter and its ARGs in these catchments include
    consumption of vegetables irrigated with river water, consumption of fish, and
    indirect exposure through consumption of meat and meat products of animals which
    may have consumed this water. These potential routes of exposure need to be further
    investigated. In addition, the health risks caused by the potential intake of
    Campylobacter ARGs should be further explored. Most importantly, measures to reduce
    the health risks associated with exposure to Campylobacter and related antibiotic-resistance
    genes in polluted river environments are critical for the benefit of people for
    people who rely on the rivers for their livelihoods. 5. Conclusions, practical
    applications of this work, and future research perspectives This study demonstrates
    that the Swartkops and Bloukrans rivers may represent a source of contamination
    by Campylobacter and its antibiotic-resistant genes. The pathogen and ARGs can
    be transmitted to humans who ingest the water during recreation, which can result
    in infection or illness. These rivers are also utilised for fishing and irrigation,
    and are a source of water for livestock. Further investigation of other potential
    routes of exposure needs to be conducted. It is important to evaluate and monitor
    the quality of river water, and to improve surveillance of waterborne diseases
    caused by pathogens such as Campylobacter. The propagation of antibiotic-resistance
    genes in aquatic environments, and subsequent human exposure to these genes in
    these environments, may pose public health risks. Quantitative microbial risk
    assessment (QMRA) is a generally acceptable suitable method to evaluate and quantify
    this health risk. QMRA approach assesses the potential health risks posed by a
    particular pathogen by combining the information on occurrence, exposure, and
    dose-response. From this study, the exposure doses of Campylobacter ARGs of 71.64
    × 104–5.8 × 105 copies/h for cmeB and 1.0 × 103–5.7 × 104 copies/h for tetO for
    a 1-h swimming event at the Bloukrans River, and 3.6 × 102–1.551 × 105 copies/h
    for cmeB and 9.98 × 102–5.7 × 104 copies/h for tetO at the Swartkops Rivers have
    been estimated. This work contributes towards the body of knowledge in closing
    the current research gap on possible human exposure to antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter,
    and in general, exposure to ARBs through freshwater sources. However, this study
    has only considered the ingestion pathway; other pathways for the exposure assessment
    step of the QMRA process during recreational activities in freshwater systems
    must be considered in future studies. Credit authorship contribution statement

  description: 'Irrigation is key to increasing crop yield and meeting the global
    demand for food. This study reports the assessment of tomato water consumption
    by bioristor, a new in vivo an Organic ElectroChemical Transistor-based biosensor.
    Bioristor enables direct, real-time acquisition of biophysical information about
    the plant’s water requirements directly from the plant sap, and thus the water
    input can be adjusted accordingly. The aim of this study is to demonstrate the
    efficacy of bioristor in rapidly detecting changes in the plant’s water status
    enhancing water use and irrigation efficiency in tomato cultivation with significant
    savings in the water supply. To this end, experiments were carried out in 2018
    and 2020 in Parma (Italy) in tomato fields under different water regimes. The
    sensor response index (R) produced by bioristor recorded the real time plant health
    status, highlighting an excess in the water supplied as well as the occurrence
    of drought stress during the growing season. In both years, bioristor showed that
    the amount of water supplied could have been reduced by 36% or more. Bioristor
    also measured the timing and duration of leaf wetting: 438 h and 409 h in 2018
    and 2020, respectively. These results open up new perspectives in irrigation efficiency
    and in more sustainable approaches to pesticide application procedures.'

    use and irrigation efficiency in tomato cultivation with significant savings in
    the water supply. To this end, experiments were carried out in 2018 and 2020 in
    Parma (Italy) in tomato fields under different water regimes. The sensor response
    index (R) produced by bioristor recorded the real time plant health status, highlighting
    an excess in the water supplied as well as the occurrence of drought stress during
    the growing season. In both years, bioristor showed that the amount of water supplied
    could have been reduced by 36% or more. Bioristor also measured the timing and
    duration of leaf wetting: 438 h and 409 h in 2018 and 2020, respectively. These
    results open up new perspectives in irrigation efficiency and in more sustainable
    approaches to pesticide application procedures. Similar content being viewed by

    reflectometry sensor Article 01 April 2015 Introduction Agriculture must provide
    food for the 10 billion people expected to inhabit the planet by 2050, despite
    the decreased availability of land and water and the competition from other uses,
    such as non-food crops, urbanization, or industrial development (FAO, 2021). To
    date, around 70% of the freshwater available on the planet goes into irrigation
    (FAO, 2021), yet only a fraction of this is used by crops; the rest is lost via
    evaporation or consumed by competing weeds. Crop yields are greatly affected by
    temperature and rainfall, to the point that water shortage represents the most
    important environmental factor limiting crop growth, development, and yield (Ben
    Mariem et al., 2021; Polinova et al., 2019; Wing et al., 2021). Optimization of
    water use efficiency is key to addressing climate change and food security. Tomato
    (Solanum lycopersicum L.), a high-value crop for the Italian market, is mainly
    cultivated under irrigation (Corbari et al., 2021), and a non-controlled reduction
    in water availability could lead to yield losses of up to 50% (Cantore et al.,
    2016; Takács et al., 2020). To improve crop yields and optimize farm management,
    precision agriculture and assist management decisions can concretely enhance sustainability
    in agriculture. Sensors allow farmers to map the topography and resources in detail
    (water, nutrient availability, soil topology), as well as variables such as soil
    pH and temperature (Yin et al., 2021). Several technologies, mainly based on proximal
    and remote sensing approaches, are currently used to develop, and test multiple
    indices and techniques for precision water management. Vegetation indices such
    as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI, Wong et al., 2022) and precision
    agriculture tools such as unmanned aerial vehicles, are currently being used to
    develop decision support systems to achieve optimized resource inputs (Loures
    et al., 2020, p. 202). The need to establish the plant water content has prompted
    the development of several approaches to detect the physiological status of the
    plant and of the surrounding environment (Shafi et al., 2019). These approaches
    are based on terahertz radiation combined with psychrometry to determine the leaf
    pressure-volume (Browne et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020). Such approaches entail
    using VIR/NIR spectroscopy (Jiang, 2020; Zhang et al., 2012); electrical impedance
    spectroscopy (Ben Hamed et al., 2016; Jamaludin et al., 2015; Janni et al., 2021;
    Jócsák et al., 2019); infrared technology (Kaiser et al., 2022; Parihar et al.,
    2021); ultrasonic techniques (Fariñas et al., 2022; Sancho-Knapik et al., 2013);
    and leaf patch clamps (Cabrita, 2022; Ehrenberger et al., 2012). In addition,
    soil moisture sensors and electrical conductivity sensors are used to monitor
    soil temperature and structures (Bonfante, 2019; Polinova et al., 2019), salinity
    and conductivity, air temperature and humidity, air pressure and wind speed (Shafi
    et al., 2019). However, these technologies have three main limitations: (i) lack
    of dynamic and continuous monitoring, (ii) indirect acquisition of the plant water
    status, and (iii) need for time-consuming data processing. Bioelectronics is emerging
    as a powerful approach to monitor plant morphological traits and physiological
    processes as well as plant-environment interactions. It has been used to monitor
    or stimulate biological processes (Coppedè et al., 2017; Diacci et al., 2021)
    and has proved successful in plant sensing and actuation (Bernacka-Wojcik et al.,
    2019; Diacci et al., 2021; Poxson et al., 2017; Stavrinidou, 2022; Stavrinidou
    et al., 2015, 2017). An implantable organic electronics ion pump for in vivo delivery
    of abscisic acid has also been proposed (Bernacka‐Wojcik et al. 2019). Several
    examples of exploiting bioelectronics in precision agriculture, in particular
    organic electronics (Gebbers & Adamchuk, 2010; Kim & Lee, 2022), have been reported
    in Dufil et al. (2022) and in Kim and Lee (2022). In recent years, an in vivo
    Organic ElectroChemical Transistor (OECT)-based sensor, namely “bioristor” was
    developed and applied as biosensor for agricultural applications (Coppedè et al.,
    2017). The sensor can detect the changes in the composition of the plant sap in
    growing tomato plants (Solanum lycopersicum), in vivo and in real time, without
    interfering with plant functions. Previous work demonstrated its ability to operate
    directly within the plant stem, thereby enabling in vivo observations of a plant’s
    physiological mechanisms related to ion movements and compartmentalization, under
    normal as well as stress conditions such as drought (Janni et al., 2019) and salt
    stress (Janni et al., 2021), or under environmental variations such as vapor pressure
    deficit (Amato et al., 2021; Vurro et al., 2019) and increase in relative air
    humidity RH. The aim of this study is to demonstrate how a bioristor in open field
    conditions can detect changes in plant water status, thereby enhancing water use
    and irrigation efficiency in tomato cultivation with significant savings in the
    water supply. The novelty of this study lies in the application of bioristor for
    tomato field monitoring, demonstrating concretely the potential water saving achievable
    through bioristor supporting its use in pathogen detection and pests’ management.
    Results are discussed in terms of sensor operability and bioristor index acquisition.
    Materials and methods Plant growth and field conditions Heinz 340 tomato plants
    were grown up to 2nd stage flowering in two seasons, 2018 and 2020, in two locations
    in the Parma area of northern Italy, and monitored with bioristors. The climate
    of both experimental areas is classified according to the Koppen–Geiger classification
    as Cfb (https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-11-1633-2007). The two trial seasons were
    comparable, but not identical, in terms of number of deployed sensors, days of
    monitoring, and adopted control units. The differences were due to constraints
    in the plots available and in the overall setup. The bioristor control units used
    in the second trial had also been improved to make them more suitable to operate
    in the open field and less dependent upon laboratory instrumentation. In addition,
    variability between seasons and sites in terms of weather, soil, and experimental
    setup is clearly unavoidable during field validation of sensors in open field
    conditions. In 2018, the experiment was carried out in Azienda Stuard, Parma (60
    m a.s.l., 44° 48′ 29.888″ N 10° 16′ 29.074″ E) in collaboration with Mutti SpA
    (https://mutti-parma.com/). Three experimental plots, consisting of three rows
    for each irrigation regime, were monitored (Fig. 1A). To avoid any water leakage
    compromising the validity of the measurements, only the middle row of each plot
    was used for bioristor measurements. Ten plants for each irrigation condition,
    distributed across an area of about 50 m2, were equipped and monitored continuously
    with a bioristor for 62 days, from flowering to harvest. Three irrigation regimes
    were applied. The control was set as 100% in line with recommendations by the
    regional irrigation advisory service Irriframe. It evaluates weather, soil and
    groundwater data obtained from farmers and from regional agencies and provides
    crop-specific irrigation regimes (https://www.irriframe.it/Irriframe). Two regimes
    were set to receive 80% and 60% of the full irrigated plot (100%). In the 2018
    experiment, differential irrigation started eight days after the bioristor installation,
    while in 2020, the experiment was performed in collaboration with Yaxe Srl for
    54 days in a commercial tomato field in Parma (44° 49′ 02.4″ N 10° 14′ 37.5″ E).
    Fig. 1 Sketch and real-field image of the field trial. A 2018, B 2020 Full size
    image Based on the results obtained in 2018, the irrigation was set at full water
    regime (100%, as in Irriframe recommendations), and 70 and 50% of the fully irrigated
    plot (Fig. 1B). One bioristor was installed in four plants for the 100% regime,
    four plants for the 70 and 50% regimes. The plants were monitored in total for
    54 days. In the 2020 experiment, due to a delay in the implementation of the irrigation
    system, differential irrigation started after 21 days. A drip watering system
    was used for irrigation in both years, where the regimes were differentiated according
    to the time of water flow. All plots were regularly irrigated according to 100%
    of Irriframe advice prior to the start of the differential irrigation. The full
    list of phytosanitary treatments and operations is reported in Suppl. Table 1.
    In both years, in all plots subjected to multiple water regimes the bioristor’s
    response (R) was compared to identify differences between the different irrigation
    regimes in terms of bioristor output. The effects of the treatments on the bioristor
    response were then analyzed to further understand the bioristor’s ability to monitor
    plant eco-physiology. The bioristor sensors, principles and preparation The bioristor
    is an OECT-based biosensor made up of two functionalized textile fibers (polypropylene)
    serving as the channel and the gate of a transistor. The bioristor is directly
    inserted into the plant stem (Janni et al., 2019), and it measures the changes
    in ion concentration in the plant sap which is continuously read via an IoT system
    (Finco et al., 2022). The working principle is based on doping-state changes in
    the semiconductor channel material due to electrolyte-ion injections which modify
    the electrical conductivity (Marquez et al., 2020; Tarabella et al., 2012). A
    positive input voltage at the gate electrode modulates the channel current by
    pushing cations from the electrolyte into the PEDOT:PSS matrix, thus modifying
    channel conductivity (Friedlein et al., 2018; Janni et al., 2021). The sensor’s
    response is the result of the relationship between the sensor and the changes
    occurring in the plant sap composition and ion concentration during growth, development
    and under abiotic stress. Under drought stress, the sensor response drops significantly
    because of the diminished ion concentration in the plant sap derived from low
    plant transpiration and root water absorption (Janni et al., 2019). A significant
    increase in the R was observed (Amato et al., 2021; Vurro et al., 2019) in high
    relative humidity conditions (RH) and low vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Bioristor
    preparation Prior to functionalization, each thread was cleaned with a plasma
    oxygen cleaner (Femto, Diener electronic, Ebhausen/Germany) to improve the thread’s
    wettability and facilitate the adhesion of the aqueous conductive polymer solution.
    This step enhances the performance of the sensors by removing any impurities or
    contaminants on the fibers, and increases the surface area for the polymer adhesion.
    An aqueous solution containing PEDOT:PSS (Clevios PH1000, Starck GmbH, Munich,
    Germany) and dodecyl benzene sulfonic acid (2% v/v) was prepared and stirred for
    five minutes to ensure homogeneity. The solution obtained was deposited onto polypropylene
    fibers using a drop-casting technique in an amount of 50 µL/cm. This resulted
    in the formation of a thread with a cross-sectional area of 1.42 mm × 0.25 mm.
    This approach means that the thickness and shape of the sensor can be controlled
    precisely, polypropylene fibers can be used as a substrate which offers biocompatibility
    and mechanical stability, and the fibers can be infused with the conductive polymer,
    which is essential for the sensors to function effectively. The entire process
    is repeated three times to complete the preparation of the sensors. Next, the
    fibers were treated with highly concentrated sulfuric acid (95%) for 20 min. This
    improves the crystallinity, electrical properties, and durability of the polymer
    by replacing the use of ethylene glycol (10% v/v) treatments to improve the electrical
    conductivity and long-term stability of the polymer. Finally, the fibers were
    washed with water, and subjected to annealing for 1 h at 130 °C (Coppedè et al.,
    2017). The bioristor is covered by patents in Europe (IT201600130803A1) and the
    USA (Pat. n. WO2018116149A1). Bioristor integration in plants and signal acquisition
    After functionalization, 2 cm of the prepared fibers were inserted into the plant
    stem, with a distance between the two threads of 5 mm in tomato plants at 15 days
    after transplant (5–6 leaves) at 10 cm above the soil surface (Janni et al., 2019)
    (Fig. 2A and B). The channel is connected by bonding two thin electrical wires
    to both sides, while the gate is connected only on one side to the electrical
    wire. These wires are fixed on a 3D printed holder made of blue polymeric material,
    to improve bioristor stability (Fig. 2A) and connected by wires to the digital
    motherboard (Fig. 3A) or to the control unit (Fig. 3B, C). Fig. 2 Bioristor implementation
    in plants. A Example of bioristor inserted into tomato plants in open field. The
    bioristor is composed of a channel and a gate connected to electrical wires in
    its current version. A holder ensures that no damage is caused to the plant stem

    the holder Full size image Fig. 3  A 2020 Bioristor application. B 2020 Field,
    C 2020 bioristor control unit Full size image A constant voltage (Vds = − 0.1
    V) was applied between the source and drain terminals of the channel, resulting
    in a continuous current flow, and a positive voltage at the gate (Vg = 0.6 and
    1 V in 2018; Vg = 0.5 V in 2020) was applied thus leading to a decrease in the
    channel conductivity due to the cations pushed from the electrolyte into the channel.
    The current (Ids) was monitored continuously. The sensor response (R) is the main
    index acquired and is proportional to the sap cation concentration. It is given
    by the expression: $$\\text R =\\frac{\\left|{\\text I}_{\\text {ds}}-{\\text
    I}_{\\text {ds0}}\\right|}{{\\text I}_{\\text {ds0}}},$$ (1) where Ids0 represents
    the current across the channel when Vg = 0. The sensor response R was recorded
    for the entire productive cycle. The Igs was also monitored and is the current
    flowing through the solution from the gate to channel when a positive gate bias
    is applied. The difference \\(\\Delta {\\text I}_{\\text {gs}}= {\\text I}_{\\text
    {gs}}-{\\text I}_{\\text {gs0}}\\) is related to the sensor wetting status, where
    Igs0 is the current across the solution when Vg = 0 (Gentile et al., 2020). The
    acquisition of the sensor response R is based on the relative change in the channel
    current. No calibration is required. The current flowing through the channel when
    the gate is off (Ids0) is used to calculate the R at each time point continuously.
    Two time constants τ and τgs of the sensor were also evaluated in a multivariate
    analysis. τ and τgs, computed by fitting the non-linear drain and gate current
    curves, are related to the time that ions take to enter the polymer, τ, and the
    ions diffusivity in the solution, τgs, respectively (Coppedè et al., 2014, 2017;
    Vurro et al., 2019). The first derivatives as a function of time of R, ∆Igs, τ,
    and τgs parameters (dR, d∆Igs, dτ, and dτgs) were also calculated to highlight
    specific trends (Vurro et al., 2019). R is the result of the relationship between
    the sensor and the changes in the plant sap composition and ion concentration
    during growth, development and under abiotic stress. Under drought, R drops significantly
    because of the reduced ion concentration in the plant sap due to the low plant
    transpiration and root water absorption (Janni et al., 2019). Moreover, in high
    relative humidity conditions and low vapor pressure deficit (VPD), a significant
    increase in R was observed (Amato et al., 2021; Vurro et al., 2019). Rainy events
    increase the air relative humidity (RH%) and decrease the VPD and a rapid increase
    in the R was observed. Based on these considerations, to demonstrate the reproducibility
    of the sensor’s response, an in vitro experiment was performed. The results of
    the sensor response of seven replicates of bioristor, in the range 10− 4–10−2
    M NaCl solution, were reported (Suppl. Table 2). Bioristor IoT control unit The
    bioristor control unit was optimized across the two field trials to improve its
    performance and enable the use of the device in open fields. In the 2018 setup,
    each bioristor sensor was connected to a digital acquisition board NI USB-6343
    multifunction I/O device (National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA) through electrical
    wires. It is a multi-channel analog-to-digital converter connected to a PC, where
    the readout data is processed using custom and then saved in the cloud. The sensor
    currents were converted to voltage, which is more easily readable by the NI board,
    through a resistor. The board is equipped with a 16 bit ADC (5 V full-scale),
    and currents are read through a 10 Ohm resistor. The current resolution is about
    8 µA. The data from each connected bioristor was acquired every second, locally
    saved on the PC, and then sent to the cloud. In the revised 2020 setup, the IoT
    control unit was based on the Arduino DUE system and connected to a 12 V 12 Ah
    lead battery powered by a 10 W photovoltaic panel. Bioristor data was locally
    saved on a micro-SD memory card and transferred to the cloud via a 4G connection.
    This setup allowed for the maximization of the signal to noise ratio using customized
    electronic circuits to amplify the bioristor signals, as well as local analysis
    of the raw data. Signals were read through an amplification system that gave a
    more accurate measurement of the currents. The sampling rate was 1 Hz, and each
    control unit was able to read up to four sensors. The control unit has a 12 bit
    ADC (5 V full-scale); the maximum current full-scale is 7 mA, the current resolution
    is about 1.5 µA. A micro-weather unit was also incorporated into the control unit
    (DHT11 module, Seeed Technology Inc., Shenzhen, China) to monitor air temperature
    (T°C) and relative humidity (RH). In both experiments, the gate was turned ON
    (Vg = 0.6 V in 2018 season; Vg= 0.5 V in 2020 season) for 15 min and OFF (0 V)
    for 15 min. At every gate that was switched on, R was calculated every 15 min
    considering the last two values of Ids and Ids0,. Environmental conditions and
    soil characteristics In 2018 rain abundance, as well as temperature and relative
    humidity at 2 m above the ground, were recorded by ARPAE agrometeorological station
    (https://simc.arpae.it/dext3r/). Soil sensors from Agricultural support (http://www.agriculturalsupport.it/prodotti-colture-orticole)
    were also exploited to verify the changes in the soil moisture. In 2020, the environmental
    conditions were monitored via Pycno sensors (https://pycno.co/), which monitor
    soil volumetric water content and temperature at 10, 25, 40 and 55 cm depth, and
    air temperature, humidity, and solar radiation. Based on the parameters recorded
    with the datalogger, the VPD value was calculated as follows (Vurro et al., 2019):
    $$\\text {VPD} =\\left(1-\\frac{\\text {RH}}{100}\\right) \\times \\text {SVP},$$
    (2) where RH is relative humidity and SVP is saturated vapour pressure. The SVP
    was calculated with the following equation (Murray 1967): $$\\text {SVP} =610.7
    \\times {10}^{\\frac{7.5\\text T}{237.3+\\text {T}}},$$ (3) where T is the temperature
    measured in the growth chamber. Ground physiological measurements In 2018, to
    validate bioristor in monitoring plant health and water use efficiency in field,
    classical physiological measurements were performed. Three plants for each regime
    were analyzed to calculate the relative water content (RWC) of the leaves (Buffagni
    et al., 2020). Leaf RWC (%) was measured in control and stressed leaves. Two leaves
    were clipped from five plants from each regime and placed in 50 mL tubes. Fresh
    weight (FW) was immediately recorded, then leaves were soaked in distilled water
    for 4 h at room temperature under constant light. The turgid leaf disks were then
    rapidly blotted to remove surface water and weighed to obtain the turgid weight
    (TW). Leaves were dried in the oven at 80 °C for 24 h to record the dry weight
    (DW). The RWC was calculated according to the formula (Barrs & Weatherley, 1962):
    $$\\text{RWC}\\left(\\%\\right)=\\frac{\\text{FW-DW}}{\\text{TW}-\\text{DW}}\\times100.$$
    (4) Chlorophyll content was assessed with a SPAD 502 m (Konica Minolta, Ramsey,
    USA). Ten measurements for each plant of three expanded leaves were recorded along
    the leaf length in five plants for each regime. The relative SPAD values were
    recorded. The stomatal conductance of the leaves was measured using an SC1 leaf
    porometer (Decagon Devices, Pullman, WA, USA) to evaluate the transpiration process.
    Five plants (one leaf for each plant) were recorded from 06:00 am to 08:00 am.
    Data analysis and statistics R data were analyzed with MATLAB (https://uk.mathworks.com/)
    and Microsoft Excel 2016 to smooth out variations related to the circadian cycle
    (Coppedè et al., 2017; Janni et al., 2019) by calculating the rolling mean. The
    aim was to reduce background noise and thus highlight the variations due to drought.
    The R data were then subjected to ANOVA using MATLAB (https://uk.mathworks.com/)
    .In addition, the p-value was calculated and is reported in Suppl. Tables 3 and
    4. The standard error was calculated on plant physiological data using Excel 365
    ProPlus (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA, United States). Data were analyzed
    from five plants with one, two and three replicates for stomatal conductance,
    RWC and SPAD measurements, respectively. The current data from the bioristors
    were fitted using least square minimization performed with the “fminuit” function
    in MATLAB. To evaluate the effect of differential treatment and the contribution
    of each parameter to the plant health under drought stress, PCA was performed
    using all the bioristor parameters collected from plants at 30–34 days in 2018
    and at 32–39 days in 2020. PCA was performed using the R “prcomp” function and
    represented as a biplot using the R package “factoextra”. The first two principal
    components PC1 and PC2 and the corresponding component loading vectors were visualized
    and summarized in a biplot, in which component scores (indicated with dots) were
    colored in relation to the specific regime (Kassambara & Mundt, 2016). Results
    Bioristor monitoring in multisite experiments The bioristor transfer characteristics
    were verified by measuring Ca2+, K+, and Na+in vivo, with reference to concentrations
    included in the range found in leaves. This demonstrated that a bioristor can
    detect small changes in the salt-related ion concentrations in the plant sap (Janni
    et al., 2021). In 2018, the R index trend showed no significant difference between
    water regimes for almost the entire season. The first 5–7 days after bioristor
    integration in plants correspond to the implantation and stabilization phase of
    the sensor, also previously reported in controlled conditions (three days in pots,
    Janni et al., 2019). The R observed during the stabilization phase was not used
    to calculate the theoretical water savings (TWS). In fact, in 2018 several rain
    events characterized the growing season and substantially nullified the effect
    of differential irrigation for almost the entire duration of the experiment. The
    difference among the regimes was only observed in the interval between days 28
    and 35, when a severe drought occurred (Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table
    3). A major and rapid peak in the R signal (200–400%) was observed in correspondence
    with each rain event (days 5–7, 12, 13, 16, 18, 23, 25, 42, 47, 58, 59, Suppl.
    Figure 1 A) due to the increases in relative humidity (RH%) and, in turn, a decrease
    in the VPD (Fig. 4 in Vurro et al., 2019). Fig. 4 R monitored in 2018 for 62 days
    (100% regime: blue line, 80% regime: dark red line, 60% regime: dark gray line)
    and vapor pressure deficit (VPD, black line) in the 2018 season. R plots are the
    average response of 10 plants for each regime (Color figure online) Full size
    image A considerable decrease in the R signal was observed in all plots between
    days 5 and 20 in relation to the treatment with ACTARA 25WG, which was administered
    to counteract an aphid infestation. In fact, a key time window for the entire
    experiment was observed between days 22 and 44, when the reduction in rain events
    and the increase in temperature meant that the R index response was different
    for each regime. Between days 25 and 35, a significant difference in R was observed
    among the regimes (p ≤ 0.05, Supplementary Table 3). The sensor response drops
    significantly under drought due to the block of transpiration which then leads
    to a reduction in the ion concentration in the xylem sap and their redistribution
    to maintain the plant osmoregularity (Janni et al., 2019). From days 31 to 35,
    the R of the 80% regime showed a 40–60% decrease in the sensor response compared
    with the 100% regime, and a 10–40% reduction in the R of the 60% regime was also
    observed. Data suggest the occurrence of more severe drought stress in the 80%
    regime compared to the 60% regime, in accordance with measurements recorded by
    the soil sensors (Fig. 4). Between days 40 and 62, there was a gradual decrease
    in R in all the regimes, except for days 42, 47, 58 and 59 when heavy rains occurred
    and the R trend rapidly increased as expected. In fact, fruit ripening causes
    leaf senescence and a reduction in transpiration (Mundim & Pringle, 2018). This
    leads to a subsequent decrease in the concentration of ions in the plant sap,
    which explains the decrease in the R signal observed (Fig. 4). The 2018 field
    pilot allowed to successfully validate the efficacy of the bioristor to detect
    physiological changes in plants as confirmed by the physiological data collected.
    The stomatal conductance trend showed a significant reduction in the transpiration
    process between regimes starting from day 22 up to day 27 (Fig. 5A), whereas neither
    the RWC nor the SPAD values showed a significant difference between regimes. This,
    confirms the high sensitivity of the bioristor’s index in the early detection
    of drought stress (Fig. 5B, C, Janni et al., 2019). Fig. 5 Physiological analyses
    performed in real time (dpi = days post insertion) in 2018. A Stomatal conductance,
    B relative water content (RWC), C chlorophyll fluorescence expressed as relative
    SPAD units. Error bars represent standard error Full size image The PCA performed
    on bioristor data showed that the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2)
    explained 72.4% of the total variance and highlighted a clear division of variables
    into three different groups along the first component (PC1), thereby confirming
    that the effects of drought stress on plant physiology are correctly tracked by
    the sensor (Fig. 6). The first PC (PC1) alone explains 47.3% of the phenotypic
    variation with controls and drought-stressed plants well separated in the biplot,
    thus indicating the efficacy of the various irrigation regimes. The sensor response
    R, ∆Igs and their first derivative (dR, d∆Igs) are negatively correlated with
    τgs and τ. Fig. 6 PCA of the parameters acquired via bioristor in the 2018 trial.
    The component scores (shown in points) are colored according to the regime (blue
    100%; red 80%; gray 60%). The component loading vectors (represented in lines)
    were superimposed proportionally to their contribution. ∆Igs: difference between
    minimum and maximum gate current values. τ and τgs: time constants. From the acquired
    data, the first derivatives of R, ∆Igs, τ and τgs (dR, d∆Igs, dτ and dτgs) were
    calculated. PC1 and PC2 explain 72.4% of the variability observed. Each dot represents
    the daily mean for each detected stress day (30–34) (Color figure online) Full
    size image In 2020, the R index trend was comparable for all plots, as expected,
    which were irrigated regularly up to day 21 (Fig. 7). The deviation in the R response
    of the 50% regime from day 7 to day 15 is discussed in the next section. Starting
    from day 21, irrigation was managed differently for each regime and a significant
    difference in the R signal was observed (Supplementary Table 4). A severe drought
    stress was detected in the 50% regime (33% R reduction, p-value ≤ 0.05), whilst
    the 70% regime showed an intermediate decrease (17% R reduction). As observed
    by other authors, under fruit ripening the R signal declined as an effect of the
    reduction in transpiration (Mundim & Pringle, 2018). Fig. 7 Plot of R monitored
    in 2020 for 54 days (100% regime: blue line, 70% regime: red line, 50% regime:
    gray line) and vapor pressure deficit (VPD, black line) during 2020 trial. R plots
    are the average response of four plants for each regime (Color figure online)
    Full size image There was a rapid increase in the R index also due to rain in
    2020. The R index varied from 26 to 122% with rain on days 5, 6, 15–18, 32, 37,
    38, 43–45, 47, 48 and 52 (Supplementary Fig. 1B). This observation further supports
    the ability of bioristor to detect leaf wetting due to increased environmental
    VPD (Fig. 7). A PCA of the 2020 data confirmed the observations made in the 2018
    trial. The first two components (PC1 and PC2) explain 64.2% of the total variance.
    The variance among the groups is more closely associated with the variance captured
    by PC2 than by PC1. The three regimes are well separated in the biplot, highlighting
    how the bioristor can detect physiological changes due to drought stress (Fig.
    8). However, the distribution of the groups was not homogenous, as observed in
    our previous trial in 2018. Specifically, the groups associated with the 100%
    and 70% regimes form a cluster-like pattern, whilst the scores for the 50% regime
    were more separated. When all variables were considered, the 100% and 70% regimes
    of the 2020 trial clustered closer than the 100% and 80% regimes of 2018, suggesting
    that all the bioristor variables should be considered. Fig. 8  A PCA of the parameters
    acquired via bioristor in the 2020 trial. The component scores (shown in points)
    are colored according to the agronomic groups (blue, 100% regime; red, 70% regime;
    gray, 50% regime). The component loading vectors (represented in lines) were superimposed
    proportionally to their contribution: ∆Igs; difference between minimum and maximum
    current gate values, τ and τgs; time constant. From the acquired data, the first
    derivative of R, ∆Igs, τ and τgs (draw, d∆Igs, dτ and dτgs) were calculated. PC1
    and PC2 explain 64.2% of the variability observed. Each dot represents the daily
    mean for the principal detected stress days (32–39) Full size image The R trend
    recorded for each plant is highly reproducible (Supplementary Fig. 2). In open
    field, the sensor response is strongly dependent on the interaction of each plant
    with the environment. Consequently, the sensor’s performance should be considered
    in terms of the signal trend variation, rather than the R value of an individual
    plant. This was confirmed in vitro, where plant physiological and morphological
    mechanisms have no influence, and the environment has no impact. The sensor response
    reproducibility was extremely high, calculating the R on seven sensor replicates,
    in a range of 10−4–10−2 M NaCl solution (Supplementary Table 2). Estimation of
    potential water saving using the bioristor The R index was also compared with
    the tomato yield and quality indices recorded at harvest (Table 1). Table 1 Tomato
    yields in the 2018 and 2020 trials Full size table In both trials (2018 and 2020),
    the tomato yield differed only slightly between the regimes. This resulted in
    a comparable percentage in terms of commercial yield. In 2018, only the 60% regime
    exhibited a significant reduction in the commercial production due to an increase
    in rotten fruit, most probably due to the drought suffered during flowering (Millones-Chanamé
    et al., 2019). Based on the R index variations recorded during the experiment,
    in both trials, the theoretical water saving (TWS) was calculated and is reported
    in Tables 2 and 3. In the 2018 trial, all regimes performed similarly during the
    entire season. The R index slope was significantly different for few days only
    (28–35) between the different water regimes (P ≤ 0.05) and was dependent on the
    amount of water input. Based on the yield recorded for all regimes, it was assumed
    that the amount of water provided in the 60% regime would be sufficient to achieve
    the good final yield expressed in marketable fruit percentage, except for the
    28–35 day window, when the full amount of water applied to the 100% regime was
    required to overcome the severe drought. Table 2 Irrigation volumes and water
    savings (TWS) calculated based on the response of the bioristor sensor in 2018
    Full size table Table 3 Irrigation volumes and water savings (TWS) calculated
    based on the response of the bioristor sensor in 2020 Full size table For the
    2018 trial, the percentage of theoretical water saving reported as achievable
    using the bioristor signal as a guide for irrigation was computed using the formula:
    $$\\text{T}\\text{W}\\text{S} \\left({\\%}\\right) = \\frac{{\\text{V}\\text{t}}_{100{\\%}}
    - {\\text{V}\\text{t}}_{\\text{T}\\text{B}\\text{I}} }{{\\text{V}\\text{t}}_{100{\\%}}}
    \\times 100,$$ (5) where Vt100% represents the total volume of water used for
    irrigation (100% control regime), as determined by the Irriframe service (Table
    2), and VtTBI indicates the total volume of water that would have been used if
    irrigation had been managed with the bioristor, based on the signal recorded for
    the other regimes (Table 2). Based on the above formula, if the bioristor had
    been used in 2018 to guide the irrigation system, the average water saving would
    have been 36% (Tables 1 and 2). In the 2020 trial, yield was not in line with
    irrigation. In fact, the 70% regime showed a significant, larger decrease in yield
    (marketable fruit) compared with the 50% regime, whereas a smaller decrease in
    yield was observed in the 50% water regime compared with the 100% water regime.
    Based on the bioristor data and yield performance, in 2020 the TWS was 38% (Tables
    1 and 3). Discussion Water scarcity increasingly threatens food security and nutrition
    due to the importance of water for food systems, agricultural production, food
    processing, households, and consumers (FAO, 2021). Italy is a big water consumer
    since agriculture is one of the main sources of income. A total of 41.67% of the
    entire agricultural land in Italy is irrigated. Out of 9 Mha of cultivated land,
    4 Mha are equipped for irrigation. A total of 17 billion m3/year of agricultural
    water are consumed in Italy alone (Ritchie & Roser, 2020). Precision agriculture
    is gaining interest as the related technologies can observe, measure, and apply
    exact quantities of water to crops on a large scale. Several sensors are extensively
    used in precision agriculture management. In particular, proximal soil sensors
    play a critical role in smart and precision agriculture by monitoring real-time
    physical signals in the soil, such as temperature, moisture, pH, and pollutants,
    and providing key information to optimize crop growth, fight against biotic and
    abiotic stresses, and enhance crop yields (Yin et al., 2021). However, proximal
    sensors only return data related to the plant proximity and do not provide information
    on what is really occurring in the plant system. An in vivo sensing approach was
    used in this study to understand the potential water savings through continuous
    and real-time monitoring of tomato crops in the open field during the entire growth
    season. The output of bioristor sensor is strongly related to the plant’s water
    status and to physiological and phenotypic changes due to drought. The high sensitivity
    and short time response (within minutes) of the bioristor index R increases the
    possibility and timeliness for determining a water deficit in a plant at a particular
    crop stage, thereby improving the efficiency of plant-based irrigation scheduling
    (Gentile et al., 2020; Gu et al., 2020; Janni et al., 2019; Vurro et al., 2019).
    In 2018 and 2020, an excess in irrigation was identified by comparing the final
    yields with the water used. A minimum reduction of 36% in 2018 and 38% in 2020
    in water use would have been achievable if bioristor had been used to guide the
    irrigation system. Previous studies have used a life cycle assessment to estimate
    the amount of water saved for different crops. Fotia et al. (Fotia et al., 2021)
    demonstrated that precise irrigation by DSS-based management can reduce the overall
    environmental impact per 1 ton of olives by 5.3–18%, or by 10.4–22.6% per 1 ha
    of cultivated land. Balafoutis et al. (Balafoutis et al., 2017) reported that
    variable-rate application of water in a vineyard can reduce greenhouse gas emissions
    by 8.8%. In the experiments carried out in two years and in two locations, the
    bioristor-based approach reported in this study provided additional tools to:
    (i) save water for irrigation, (ii) decreasing the water input required in tomato
    crops by 36–38%. Based on the collected data a complete algorithm for a fully
    operational decision support system based on the in vivo bioristor data, have
    been developed with the aim of identifying thresholds for the early warning of
    drought stress (Fig. 9). Fig. 9 Bioristor working principle and features. Sensor
    response and data interpretation in relation to water supply and needs Full size
    image A novelty of this work is the possibility to calculate form the R index,
    the timing and duration of leaf wetting were also measured through the bioristor:
    438 h in the 2018 experiment, and 409 h in 2020 (Table 4). Table 4 Leaf wetting
    timing and duration calculated over the whole season in 2018 and 2020 Full size
    table Leaf wetting plays a major role in plant physiology with direct or indirect
    effects on plant function. For example, in leaf wetting by dew, the transpiration
    rate can decrease, thereby mitigating water stress at times of high evaporative
    demand (Yokoyama et al., 2021). Consequently, leaf wetting increases the photosynthetic
    rate in the long term by mitigating water stress (Yokoyama et al., 2021). Leaf
    wetting is also linked with pathogen detection, thus continuous monitoring can
    help in the early detection of pathogens (Dawson & Goldsmith, 2018). The ability
    of bioristor to detect leaf wetting is mainly due to the variation in solutes
    content in the plant sap due to environmental conditions. Changes in water potential
    lead to changes in the concentration of solutes (i.e. leaf osmolality), which
    then impact on the primary and secondary metabolism (Dawson & Goldsmith, 2018)
    as highlighted by the high correlation observed between R and VPD values (Figs.
    4 and 7, Vurro et al., 2019). A side result of this field trial was the determination
    of the half-life of the pesticides by continuous monitoring during the field trial.
    During the 2018 season, a strong change in the slope of the sensor response was
    associated with the use of an anti-aphid treatment (ACTARA 25WG). In fact, the
    mode of action of ACTARA in the plant was similar to the one triggered during
    severe drought stress, thus leading, in terms of sensor response, to a major change
    in the value and trend of the R index. The analysis of R also enabled the ACTARA
    half-life to be estimated as 13 days which to the best of our knowledge has not
    been reported before. Conclusions This study has demonstrated that bioristor enables
    real time, in vivo and continuous monitoring of tomato growth and fruit production
    in open field conditions, resulting in the identification of the sensor response
    index (R index), that has been demonstrated to be a good proxy of plant health
    status. Of note, bioristor allowed to trace the plant’s water status dynamics
    during the plant response under changing environmental conditions together with
    the precise occurrence and duration of the drought stress. The use of bioristor
    for smart agriculture can concretely contribute to improve the sustainable use
    of water in agriculture leading to save 36–38% of the water consumed for irrigation.
    A novel feature of bioristor was also identified. The frequency, timing, and duration
    of leaf wetting was also established through the analysis of the R index, leading
    to further optimization of water use, and opening new perspectives on pest detection,
    and management since a pathogen attack is strictly related to plant humidity.
    This bioristor’s feature would enable a more precise schedule of pesticide treatment,
    thereby contributing to greater sustainability in agriculture. Taking all together,
    this work paves the way for the use of bioristor under a smart irrigation approach
    significantly improves the water use efficiency allowing the fine-tuning of irrigation
    protocols and strategies. Data availability The datasets generated during the
    current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.

  description: Salmonella is one of the main zoonotic agents causing foodborne diseases
    in Europe. The main reservoirs of the infection are represented by domestic and
    wild animals, and the infection occurs by direct contact or following the consumption
    of contaminated food or water. The study aimed to evaluate the presence of Salmonella
    spp. in food-producing animals and irrigation waters in southern Italy and the
    serovar distribution. From 2011 to 2021, a total of 473 samples from 6 different
    animal species (bovine, buffalo, goat, ovine, swine, poultry, and wild boars)
    and 313 irrigation water samples were collected and analyzed. The overall percentage
    of positive samples was 56.87% in organs, 50.85% in feces, and 20.45% in irrigation
    waters. By animal species, the most frequently detected serovar was Salmonella
    Typhimurium in bovine (17.39%), in buffalo (13.10%) and swine (28.21%), and S.
    Kentucky (24.78% ) in poultry. The subspecies diarizonaelIIb was frequently detected
    in goats (40.00%) and ovine (83.33%), while salamaeII (14.12%) and diarizonaeIIIb
    (11.76%) were frequently isolated in wild boars. In the irrigation water samples,
    the most frequently detected serovar was S. Napoli (25%). Results revealed that,
    although in Europe, control strategies aimed at preventing the spread of Salmonella
    have been implemented, the prevalence of this pathogen in food-producing animals
    and irrigation waters is high. Considering the risk to public health associated
    with the contamination of products or foods, more stringent control interventions
    are needed at primary production and along the food chain.

  description: 'Smart farming focuses on three crucial areas: soil quality, weather
    conditions, and crop health. Because of the significant impact of weather and
    irrigation factors, many smart farming solutions are tightly integrated with smart
    environment and smart water (pollution, turbidity, nutrients) systems for a holistic
    approach. The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing soil monitoring, giving
    farmers and growers the means to optimize yields, minimize disease risks, and
    rationalize resource use. Thanks to IoT sensors, it is possible to measure various
    parameters such as soil temperature, NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) levels,
    and soil moisture. The information collected by these IoT sensors is then transmitted
    to a central point or stored in the cloud server for in-depth analysis, visual
    representation, and trend identification. The application of the IoT in agriculture
    is widely referred to as smart farming. The IoT is an essential pillar of precision
    agriculture, enabling more targeted and efficient management of resources. Smart
    sensor systems provide more information about water and crop water requirements.
    This information can be used to mechanically manage the water supply system and
    help farmers optimize their irrigation system. The information acquired by the
    first sensors is transferred to the cloud server. This article proposes and evaluates
    the concept of remote sensing systems. Three sites were selected to test the IoT
    system. At each site, five sensors were employed, specifically designed for soil
    and irrigation water analysis. The sensors dedicated to soil pH, moisture, and
    NPK demonstrated commendable accuracy; equally, the irrigation water pH and turbidity
    sensors exhibited notably precise measurements. The results were noteworthy, with
    an R2 value surpassing 90% across all sensor measurements. These IoT sensors could
    facilitate effective crop monitoring without excessive expenditures and serve
    to safeguard groundwater from nutrient contamination.'

    potassium) levels, and soil moisture. The information collected by these IoT sensors
    is then transmitted to a central point or stored in the cloud server for in-depth
    analysis, visual representation, and trend identification. The application of
    the IoT in agriculture is widely referred to as smart farming. The IoT is an essential
    pillar of precision agriculture, enabling more targeted and efficient management
    of resources. Smart sensor systems provide more information about water and crop
    water requirements. This information can be used to mechanically manage the water
    supply system and help farmers optimize their irrigation system. The information
    acquired by the first sensors is transferred to the cloud server. This article
    proposes and evaluates the concept of remote sensing systems. Three sites were
    selected to test the IoT system. At each site, five sensors were employed, specifically
    designed for soil and irrigation water analysis. The sensors dedicated to soil
    pH, moisture, and NPK demonstrated commendable accuracy; equally, the irrigation
    water pH and turbidity sensors exhibited notably precise measurements. The results
    were noteworthy, with an R2 value surpassing 90% across all sensor measurements.
    These IoT sensors could facilitate effective crop monitoring without excessive
    expenditures and serve to safeguard groundwater from nutrient contamination. 1
    INTRODUCTION Soil quality is often related to its use. Thus, the expected quality
    of soil for building is different from that for agricultural production, and the
    indicators to be measured are therefore different. For this reason, scientific
    groups and research institutes, as well as industry, are racing to offer more
    and more Internet of Things (IoT) products to the agricultural sector and are
    laying the groundwork for a clear role for the Internet to become a dominant technology
    (Yang et al., 2021). At the same time, the already popular Internet and big data
    provide sufficient resources and solutions to maintain, store, and analyze the
    huge amounts of data generated by Internet-connected devices. The management and
    analysis of data from the IoT can be used to automate processes, predict situations,
    and improve many activities, even in real time. Indeed, the IoT now enables farms
    to increase operational efficiency by automating and optimizing production lines.
    IoT also brings undeniable benefits for farm management (Subahi & Bouazza, 2020).
    Soil monitoring with IoT uses technology to empower farmers and growers to maximize
    yield, reduce disease, and optimize resources. IoT sensors can measure soil temperature,
    soil fertility status (NPK), volumetric water content, photosynthetic radiation,
    soil water potential, and soil oxygen levels. The data from the IoT sensors is
    then transmitted back to a central location (or the cloud server) for visualization
    and analysis. The resulting data can then be used to optimize farm operations,
    identify trends, and make subtle adjustments to conditions to maximize crop yield
    and quality (Bhatia & Sood, 2017). The use of IoT in agriculture is known as smart
    farming, and IoT is a central component of precision agriculture. This paper will
    focus on the impact that the IoT has had in this field. The supply of hardware
    for farmers is diversifying from drones flying over Zfield to analyze the conditions
    of the soil to robots dispersing pesticides in a targeted manner, tractors performing
    centimetric soil analysis, precision irrigation equipment, and collars studying
    the physical condition of livestock (Badhe et al., 2018). The operation of these
    tools is based on a digital analysis of data collected by various sensors (thermal,
    chemical, soil moisture, etc.). The robots then process these data, but they can
    also be used by other devices (Nandurkar et al., 2014). For example, a tractor
    will be able to analyze soil quality to accomplish its task, but the extracted
    data will also be used for a digital irrigation system. A technological ecosystem
    is superimposed on the life of the farm, made up of connected objects in “conversation”
    with each other, remaining in continuous communication with the system''s software
    or platform (Gutiérrez et al., 2013). 2 MATERIALS, TECHNIQUES, AND SYSTEM STRUCTURE
    2.1 System structure The system developed in this research was tested under various
    soil quality conditions (Figure 1) (Vidya Devi & Meena Kumari, 2013). It measured
    four parameters (pH, temperature, soil moisture, and the value of potassium, nitrogen,
    and phosphorus in the soil in three different agricultural sites). FIGURE 1 Open
    in figure viewer PowerPoint Proposed system flow diagram (Beta et al., 2016).
    referred to as P1, P2, and P3, each located in different regions of Morocco. The
    objective was to closely observe and assess the soil quality and irrigation water
    quality at each of these sites, employing innovative methodologies. To verify
    the performance of the systems, conventional methods were used. For instance,
    atomic absorption was used to check the content of potassium elements, P-Olsen
    for phosphorus, and N-Dumas to determine nitrogen content, as outlined in Table
    1. In addition, the turbidity of the irrigation water was cross verified using
    a turbidimeter. This validation process guarantees the reliability and accuracy
    of the results. TABLE 1. Analysis of soil parameter using conventional methods.

    344.17 2.2 Microcontroller board Arduino UNO board is a microcontroller board
    worked around the ATmega328. The card contains everything that is essential for
    the microcontroller''s task (Figure 2). It is small, has a low power consumption,
    and is essential in any embedded electronics solution (car, garage door, robots,
    etc.). In addition, it is the simplest and most economical microcontroller and
    can be programmed with software available with the microcontroller (Zhang et al.,
    2017). To implement the microcontroller, we need to associate it with a PC via
    a USB connection; as for the energy sources, it can be powered with an external
    power supply or batteries (Hori et al., 2010). FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Arduino UNO cards. 2.3 Sensors Various types of sensors, including
    optical, thermal, magnetic, and others, are employed to assess the quality of
    soil and water. These sensors serve the purpose of gathering essential data about
    different aspects, such as composition, temperature, and magnetic properties,
    contributing not only to an enhanced understanding of soil and water resources
    but also fostering improved crop cultivation practices. 2.3.1 pH sensor The pH
    sensor determines the acidity or alkalinity of the soil and the irrigation water
    (Figure 3). Soil pH affects the amount of nutrients available to plants and soluble
    in soil water because some nutrients are available under acidic conditions, while
    others are more available under alkaline conditions. Incorrect irrigation water
    pH can significantly affect plant growth, soil pH, irrigation equipment, and pesticide
    efficiency and can contribute to the leaching of nutrients to the groundwater
    (Na et al., 2016). FIGURE 3 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint pH sensor. The pH
    takes values between 0 and 14, and its measuring temperature is between 0 and
    60°C for pH of water and between 3 and 9 at −30–70°C for soil pH. The measurement
    has an accuracy of ±0.3 pH units and a resolution of 0.1 pH. As a rule, the correct
    balance of soil pH and irrigation water for good crops is between 5.5 and 7.5.
    Thus, checking pH levels regularly can avoid considerable problems that can be
    costly and difficult to correct (Mehta et al., 2018). The IoT pH sensor is equipped
    with a probe of 7 cm allowing for in situ measurements. To ensure accuracy, it
    is appropriate to select a suitable measurement site, devoid of stones, and confirm
    that the probe remains unexposed to hard objects. Before inserting the probe,
    the topsoil should be removed, and depending on the desired measurement depth,
    while maintaining the natural soil density beneath, the sensor is vertically inserted
    into soil ensuring no tilting or swaying from side to side. After a 10-s interval,
    the results will be available. It is advisable to take multiple measurements within
    a small area around a single measurement point and subsequently calculate the
    average. The sensor yields better result in moist soil conditions. 2.3.2 Soil
    moisture sensor The soil moisture sensor (SMS) is a type of sensor used to measure
    the volumetric water content in the soil, as well as to estimate the water stored
    in the soil horizon (Figure 4). The SMS is usually connected to the irrigation
    system for the estimation of the water content of the root zone before each irrigation
    to give the soil the adequate amount of water and interrupt irrigation if its
    water content exceeds the prescribed standards. This method is useful for scheduled
    irrigation systems (Kodali & Sahu, 2016). FIGURE 4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Soil moisture sensor (SMS). The use of SMS has a beneficial effect on water management
    and crops. It provides a better understanding of the behavior of water in the
    soil. It can maximize yields by limiting irrigation costs and avoiding water wastage
    while reducing the demand for irrigation water. And the obtained data can be used
    to improve hydrological models (Soil, Water and Plant Characteristics Important
    to Irrigation, 2017). The SMS calculates the average water content across the
    entire sensor length, with a 2-cm probe section as the influencing zone. The sensor
    must be inserted vertically, ensuring no lateral tilting. The probe is inserted
    in the soil after removing the topsoil, and adjusting the depth according to the
    desired measurement, while retaining the soil''s natural density underneath. 2.3.3
    Turbidity sensor A turbidity sensor (Figure 5) measures the amount of light scattered
    by suspended solids (SS) in the water. An increase in the amount of SS in the
    water leads to a rise in the level of turbidity, which has negative effects on
    underwater life in rivers, lakes, and seas. It interrupts the photosynthesis process
    and reduces dissolved oxygen. Soil erosion and rainwater runoff are the principal
    sources of water turbidity. High turbidity levels also affect irrigation performance,
    reducing soil hydraulic conductivity and polluting the soil surface through surface
    runoff. At the viral level, as known as various viruses and bacteria can be attached
    to solid wet particles and migrate with them. Thus, the elimination of SS is linked
    to the elimination of harmful germs. Water with minimum turbidity, lower than
    2 nephelometric turbidity unit (NTU) as a standard in different countries, is
    generally considered to be of good quality for irrigation purposes (Jeong et al.,
    2016). FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Turbidity sensor. 2.3.4 NPK soil
    sensor The NPK soil sensor detects the content of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium
    (N, P, K) in the soil (Figure 6). The NPK are the primary macronutrients indispensable
    for plant growth. A lack of plant development, late plant maturation, and lower
    yields explicitly describe symptoms of NPK plant deficiency. And the main symptom
    of excessive NPK in soil is stunted plant growth, making it unable to produce
    flowers or fruit. Aside from that, having very high NPK level in soil can run
    off to the waterways and harm aquatic life by accelerating the eutrophication
    and algae blooms (Benslimane et al., 2023). Therefore, the NPK need to be monitored
    in soil and used in a controlled way. The use of NPK soil sensor allows the determination
    of soil fertility and thus facilitates the systematic evaluation of the soil condition.
    The sensor is equipped with a high-quality probe of 7 cm that resists rust, electrolysis,
    and alkali-salt corrosion. It is suitable for all types of soil and substrate
    too. This sensor does not require any chemical reagents, enabling on-site measurements.
    It has a real-time response and good interchangeability and can be used with any
    microcontroller, but not directly because it uses a Modbus communication mode.
    The sensor works on 9–24 V batteries with a low power consumption (Ma et al.,
    2015). To ensure the sensor precision, it is suitable to choose an appropriate
    measurement location that is free of stones, confirming that the probe remains
    unexposed to hard objects. Prior to inserting the probe, it is recommended to
    clear away the topsoil. Adjust the depth of insertion according to the desired
    measurement depth. Vertically insert the sensor into the soil with utmost care
    to prevent any tilting or swaying. After a 10-s interval, the results will become
    accessible. It is advisable to conduct multiple measurements within a confined
    area around a single measurement point and subsequently compute the average. This
    NPK soil sensor has a good accuracy of about 2% with a measurement resolution
    of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium of 1 mg/kg (mg/L) in a detection range
    from 1 to 1999 mg/kg. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint NKP soil sensor.
    2.4 Network tools To facilitate data transmission in the local environment, an
    integrated Wi-Fi module was used (Figure 7). This module acts as a conduit for
    the Arduino board to efficiently communicate its data to an access point. Using
    this Wi-Fi module, the Arduino board acquires the ability to share collected measurements
    with smart devices (Ibrahim et al., 2019). The access point itself establishes
    an Internet connection, enabling seamless data transfer. As a result, the access
    point captures data from the local environment and facilitates its transmission
    to a local computer and a remote database (Ojha et al., 2015). FIGURE 7 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Wi-fi module: ESP8682-01. 3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION To
    examine the soil and irrigation water quality, the proposed framework uses pH,
    soil moisture, turbidity, and NPK sensors to get information about soil and irrigation
    water pH, the soil moisture, turbidity of irrigation water, and the concentration
    of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium in the soil. These sensors are associated
    with the Arduino UNO board, which is associated with a Wi-Fi module that helps
    to send information to the cloud server, to process the information gathered by
    the different sensors (Kumar & Patel, 2014). This piece of information is stored
    in the Influx Cloud server, an open-source, high-availability distributed storage
    system. Most of the time, the information is refreshed in the Influx database
    (Kumari et al., 2018). After calibrating sensors by integrating factors within
    the Arduino code for each sensor, enabling their accurate calibration, and ensuring
    the precise performance of the sensors. Table 1 outlines the analysis of soil
    parameters, elucidating the conventional methods employed for assessing each parameter.
    The summary of obtained soil values is presented in Table 1. The data show there
    is a good match between IoT sensors and the conventional methods, except for the
    nitrogen estimation of the first site, which exceeded the detection range of the
    sensor, but the estimation is still close to the conventional method value, suggesting
    that the sensor works well. The irrigation water pH and turbidity values are given
    in Table 2; the data demonstrate the sensor''s high precision, and the values
    are almost under the standard of turbidity value of 2 NTU. The coefficients of
    determination for all measurements in relation to the conventional method are
    presented in Table 3, indicating an R2 value exceeding 90% for the majority of
    sensor measurements. This provides compelling evidence that these sensors can
    serve as viable alternative methods for measuring soil and water parameters in
    Moroccan soils. TABLE 2. The obtained irrigation water values. Site Measurements

    siliconRapid assay 1. Introduction Water sources are vulnerable to intentional
    and inadvertent human pollution by abundant trace contaminants (micropollutants
    of synthetic, geogenic and biological origin), with severe consequences for aquatic
    ecosystems and human health [1]. In particular, the wide spread of pathogenic
    microorganisms in water sources promotes the propagation of infectious diseases
    (primarily intestinal infections such as diarrhea, but also guinea worm disease,
    typhoid fever, cholera and dysentery), causing the loss of millions of lives annually
    [2]. Escherichia coli (E. coli) is perhaps the most commonly known coliform bacterium
    naturally found in the gastrointestinal tracts of warm-blooded animals and the
    human colon''s normal flora [3]. E. coli is an established indicator of fecal
    contamination or poor-hygiene processing conditions in the food industry [1].
    Its existence in drinking water sources at low concentrations is usually harmless;
    however, higher counts may imply the existence of fecal-borne microorganisms (e.g.,
    hepatitis A or Salmonella). Therefore, monitoring and evaluating its biological
    hazard distribution and bioavailability is crucial to safeguarding public health;
    an assessment of water source quality in real-time allows for taking corrective
    measures to mitigate the biological risks [4]. At present, all microbial contaminants
    are recognized by conventional culture plating and molecular diagnostic practices,
    which are highly efficient and precise using laboratory-based facilities, but
    are impractical for rapid and straightforward field diagnosis of the causative
    hazard [1], [3], [5]. In the last two decades, numerous efforts have been made
    to develop high-throughput, rapid, sensitive and accurate sensing devices for
    routine on-site assessment of most emerging pathogenic bacteria related to water-
    and food-contaminants surveillance [1], [4], [6]. The developed alternatives to
    standard practices include a wide range of sensing and biosensing approaches facilitated
    primarily by electrochemical, optical and mass-based transduction mechanisms [7],
    [8]. The plethora of sensing schemes have used antibodies, aptamers, peptides,
    polymers, phages and other capture probes to differentiate bacteria based on their
    morphology, biochemical composition, motility, biofilm formation and antibiotic-resistance
    status [6]. Both direct and indirect sensing approaches (label-free and label-based,
    respectively) have been used to tackle the key concern of any analytical device,
    the inherent limit of detection (LOD). While direct monitoring of minute analyte
    or concentration variations can be restricted by the actual pathogen amount in
    the effective probing area and controlled by the diffusion limit, the indirect
    approach, although sacrifices to provide molecular information, offers enhanced
    qualitative and quantitative sensing capabilities subsequent to the biorecognition
    event [9]. The latter is ascribed to the diversity in sensors'' designs and fabrications,
    and their adaptability to complex biological media and environmental assessments.
    It should be noted that all approaches can be assisted by sensitivity-enhancing
    strategies throughout the analytical workflow, such as fluid mixing, analyte concentration
    or non-target material removal, chemical signal amplification and coupling to
    additional modalities, to improve the diagnostic performance [8], [10]. The trivial
    adaptation of recent nanotechnology-based research advances and the unique merits
    of novel nanomaterials for analytical chemistry applications have gained considerable
    attention [11]. Various nanoparticles, nanowires, nanocatalysts, nanoarrays and
    miniaturized nanodevices have been involved in probing pathogens'' identities
    in biological samples [4], [5], [6]. Specifically, porous silicon (p-Si) is a
    commercially viable platform suitable for on-site label-free sensing and imaging
    applications [12], [13], [14]. The p-Si is acknowledged for its immense internal
    surface area, ease of fabrication and bulky catalog of different functionalities
    attributed to versatile surface modification, which are beneficial for sensor
    design [15], [16]. The layered nanostructures designed in accordance with the
    target analyte''s physical features can complement the practical sensing capabilities
    and minimize matrix effects from interfering species. The optical signal is obtained
    in real-time using deployable instrumentation (hand-held spectrometer and compact
    light source), highlighting its compliance for field assessments [17]. Few works
    have leveraged the utilization of p-Si for the optical sensing of bacteria (whole
    cell, fragments or secreted products) [12], [18], [19], [20], [21]. To the best
    of our knowledge, the current LOD using these porous thin film scaffolds is 102
    CFU mL−1, regardless of the applied sensing mode. Herein, we present a miniaturized
    sensing platform for rapid and reliable assessment of model bacteria (E. coli)
    in contaminated water sources using reﬂective interferometric Fourier transform
    spectroscopy (RIFTS). Initially, all bacterial suspensions were immuno-recognized
    by selective antibodies, then syringe-filtered to exclude target bacteria and
    bound antibodies from the analyzed samples and applied on the p-Si. Immediately
    after, a rapid biochemical amplification reaction was utilized to enhance the
    optical signal and evaluate the residual immuno-entities coupled to the porous
    surface (antibody ̶ antibody complexes) [22]. The general sensing concept is presented
    in Scheme 1. The physical properties of the single-layered Fabry-Pérot interferometer
    were tuned for optimized sensitivity. The selectivity was assessed in detail against
    common water and food-related pathogens. Lastly, the prospective utilization of
    the developed platform for real-life scenarios was interpreted in contaminated
    water and milk samples and related to the standard microbial assay. Download :

    crystal B-doped silicon wafers with 1.0 ± 0.2 mΩ cm were purchased from Sil''tronix
    Corp. Absolute ethanol, acetonitrile, N,N- 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES),
    4-chloro-1-naphthol (4CN), diisopropylethylamine (DIEA), disuccinimidyl carbonate
    (DSC), hydrofluoric acid (48 %, HF), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), gelatine and sodium
    hydroxide were acquired from Merck. Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus, ATCC-25923),
    E. coli (ATCC-10798), Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epidermidis, ATCC-12228)
    and Bacillus cereus (B. cereus, ATCC-11778) were purchased from Biological Industries.
    Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) tagged rabbit anti-E. coli polyclonal antibodies
    (anti-Ec-ab) and goat anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (s-ab) were obtained from
    Zotal Ltd. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) and Listeria
    monocytogenes (L. monocytogenes) were kindly received from the Clinical Bacteriology
    and Mycology Department, KVI, Israel, managed by Dr. Shlomo E. Blum. 2.2. Porous
    transducers preparation p-Si Fabry–Pérot interferometers were prepared in accordance
    with a well-documented electrochemical anodization practice described in our previous
    works [23]. Different current densities (231, 385 and 538 mA cm−2) and periods
    (70, 42 and 30 s) were applied to produce various porous nanostructures that alternate
    the physical features. Immediately, the as-etched platforms were subjected to
    thermal oxidation, resulting in oxidized nanostructures (p-SiO2) [24]. The morphological
    features were studied using a Carl Zeiss Ultra Plus HRSEM and spectroscopic liquid
    infiltration method, as previously described [24]. Surface modification stages
    are demonstrated in Scheme 1 and were described in detail in our previous report
    [19]. Briefly, the APTES-modified p-SiO2 were biofunctionalized with a DSC crosslinker
    to anchor s-ab (40 µL of 50 µM) on the interferometer''s surface (resulting in
    s-ab/p-SiO2) [25]. Finally, the exterior surface was blocked with 50 µL of 1 mg mL−1
    gelatin solution (PBS buffer, pH 7.4) to reduce non-specific adsorption with the
    solid support [23]. ATR-FTIR was applied to thoroughly characterize all p-Si surface
    functionalization steps using a Thermo Scientific Nicolet iS50 (Madison, WI, USA).
    2.3. Environmental samples pretreatment All water and milk samples were pretreated
    prior to optical examination to standardize the process. Ground, irrigation and
    river water were acidified to a neutral pH to maintain optimal biochemical response.
    Raw and pasteurized milk samples attained from healthy animals (the institutional
    dairy research farm, ARO) were 10-fold diluted and defatted (2500 g centrifugation
    for 7 min) to minimize filter clogging due to the viscous samples passing through
    and to eliminate matrix interferences [26]. Then, the noted samples were spiked
    with fixed E. coli concentrations (50 and 500 CFU mL−1) and verified through conventional
    microbiological culture assay. The selectivity samples were correspondingly pretreated.
    2.4. Immunoassay The pretreated samples containing E. coli cells (980 µL) were
    incubated with 20 µL of 50 µg mL−1 anti-Ec-ab for 30 min, sieved using a syringe
    filter (0.22 µm pore size PVDF membrane filter, Millex) and applied on s-ab/p-SiO2
    surfaces, see Scheme 1. Note: the filtration process excludes bacteria and bound
    antibodies from the analyzed samples. Then, the porous interferometers were impregnated
    in a flow cell configuration and equilibrated with 0.8 mM of 4CN substrate for
    5 min as an optical baseline. Finally, 0.16 M H2O2 is added to the cycled solution
    to activate the biochemical reaction. 2.5. Reflectivity studies The reflectivity
    data were obtained using Ocean Optics, Inc. (FL, USA) VIS-NIR Flame spectrometer
    at 30 s intervals with 60 ms integration duration and 10 spectral scans averaging.
    A detailed description of the optical setup and data analysis were previously
    described [23], [27]. Concisely, the reflectivity spectra were fast Fourier transformed
    (FFT) into single peaks attenuation, each characterized by indicative effective
    optical thickness (EOT) and intensity values. The former parameter designates
    the scaffold''s average refractive index and its complete thickness governed by
    the Fabry-Pérot equation, while the latter is proportional to the difference in
    refractive index contrast of adjacent interfaces, which delineates the relevant
    layer. The biochemical amplification data are given as the relative intensity
    of the observed FFT peak: (1) where is the obtained optical intensity response
    following the initiation of the biochemical response in the presence of H2O2 needed
    for HRP''s substrate (4CN) oxidation in regard to (baseline intensity values).
    The relative responses of the various bacterial loads are given as the relative
    activity: (2) where represents the relative intensity of different E. coli concentrations;
    is the maximal relative intensity while omitting bacteria from the assay. 3. Results
    and discussion 3.1. Porous transducers characterization The sensitivity of the
    label-free porous transducer is influenced by its inherent structural features,
    thus the physical characteristics of the different p-SiO2-based platforms were
    investigated. Initially, three different nanoscale pore diameters with similar
    void thicknesses were fabricated by alternating the constant current densities
    and etching duration. A highly B-doped Si wafer was subjected to current densities
    of 231, 385 and 538 mA cm−2 applied for 70, 42 and 30 s, respectively. HRSEM was
    used to characterize the resulting features (i.e., pore diameter and thickness)
    of each monolayer after thermal oxidation. Fig. 1a, b and c present characteristic
    non-uniformly shaped pores with average diameters of 23.5 ± 6.3, 41.7 ± 14.5 and
    52.9 ± 15 nm for current densities of 231, 385 and 538 mA cm−2, respectively (see
    pore histograms in Fig. S1). The corresponding p-SiO2 thicknesses are shown in
    a cross-sectional view (Fig. 1d, e and f), revealing cylindrically shaped pores
    and an average thickness of 7.98 ± 0.53 µm. Furthermore, the reflectivity measurements
    were used to assess the characteristic optical properties of the produced scaffolds.
    Fig. S2a depicts the reflectance spectra of the noted porous interferometers.
    A similar Fabry–Pérot interference pattern is observed for all samples, with minor
    attenuations in the frequency and overall spectral intensity. The resulting were
    FFT into single peaks with characteristic EOT and intensity values (Table S1).
    Both parameters decreased in correlation with pore augmentation (e.g., the EOT
    values are 22,703 ± 18, 19,356 ± 169 and 17,179 ± 40 nm for etching currents of
    231, 385 and 538 mA cm−2, respectively). These values were included in the Bruggeman
    effective medium approximation to assess the open porosities and thin film thicknesses
    using the spectroscopic liquid-infiltration method, as previously shown [24],
    [27]. Table S1 shows a profound increase in the thin film porosities, with values
    of 67.5 ± 0.6, 74.8 ± 0.5 and 82.4 ± 0.2 % for current densities of 231, 385 and
    538 mA cm−2, respectively. The corresponding calculated thin film thicknesses
    were inversely decreased upon elevated etching conditions (i.e., 8701 ± 79, 7829 ± 33
    and 7422 ± 11 nm, respectively). Next, the three different p-SiO2 surfaces were
    biofunctionalized using a bottom-up approach (individual layer addition), which
    included alkyl-silane, DSC crosslinker, s-ab, gelatin and anti-Ec-ab. The resulting
    sequential surface-modification steps were characterized using ATR-FTIR analysis
    (see Fig. S3 for the detailed study). Download : Download high-res image (627KB)

    42 s and (c, f) 538 mA cm−2 for 30 s. 3.2. Biochemical signal characterization
    The main limitation of novel sensing approaches for bacterial contamination is
    ascribed to the high sensitivity level needed to detect a single bacterium in
    a complex medium or matrix. Therefore, prior to cross-examining the sensitivity
    threshold of the designed interferometer, the experimental conditions were optimized
    by evaluating the influence of the inherent structural features on optical performance.
    The overall sensing concept is facilitated based on an indirect immunoassay while
    assessing the unreacted anti-Ec-ab content whereby the s-ab/p-SiO2 surfaces. Note:
    prior to applying the pretreated sample solutions on the solid support, all mixtures
    were rapidly sieved through a syringe filter (0.22 µm) to eliminate target microorganism
    and bound antibodies from the analyzed samples. Immediately after, a rapid biochemical
    amplification reaction was utilized to enhance the optical signal and evaluate
    the residual immuno-entities coupled to the porous surface (antibody-antibody
    complexes). The biochemical reaction included catalytic oxidation of 4CN by the
    HRP moieties linked to anti-Ec-ab, as previously shown [22], [28]. Initially,
    the three different functionalized transducers were subjected to different filtered
    final concentrations of anti-Ec-ab (1, 0.8, 0.6 and 0.4 µg mL−1) to simulate the
    dynamic response and assess the optimized biosensing platform based on pronounced
    optical performance. It should be noted that no bacterial suspensions were used
    at this point, as the anti-Ec-ab content was varied using controlled conditions.
    Fig. 2 depicts representative sensorgrams of the HRP catalytic activity products’
    infiltration into the different platforms. All sensorgrams show a similar descending
    trend of optical values with decreasing anti-Ec-ab concentration. For example,
    the relative intensities of the first nanostructure, characterized by minor pore
    size (23.5 ± 6.3 nm), revealed values of 1.54, 1.32, 1.16 and 1.10 for 1, 0.8,
    0.6 and 0.4 µg mL−1 anti-Ec-ab, respectively, see Fig. 2a. The attained data can
    simulate a similar optical response of increased bacterial concentrations, in
    which minute unbound anti-Ec-ab amounts pass through the syringe filter and interact
    with the s-ab/p-SiO2 surface, resulting in decreased relative responses for all
    studied nanostructures. In addition, the relative intensity values were increased
    in response to pores enlargement, as previously shown [27], [29]. Fig. 2d presents
    the corresponding relative activity values for all noted platforms. It should
    be highlighted that the activity values were normalized with respect to the maximal
    relative intensity of each platform (i.e., 1 µg mL−1 anti-Ec-ab). Significant
    differences were obtained for nanostructures with increased pore diameter etched
    at the maximal current density of 538 mA cm−2 (p ≤ 0.01), whereas others presented
    inconsistent differences between adjacent antibody concentrations (p > 0.05).
    The latter is ascribed to the high level of porosity accessible for the insoluble
    products’ infiltration and accumulation (favoring larger pores), thus amplifying
    the refractive index variation between the different treatments. Therefore, based
    on the achieved data, the greater pore size etched by 538 mA cm−2 was preferred
    for the sequential study. Download : Download high-res image (307KB) Download

    (b) 41.7 ± 14.5 and (c) 52.9 ± 15 nm, produced by 231, 385 and 538 mA cm−2 anodization,
    respectively. The s-ab/p-SiO2 surfaces were pre-interacted with different filtered
    anti-Ec-ab concentrations (1, 0.8, 0.6 and 0.4 µg mL−1), fixed in a custom-made
    cell followed by reflectivity spectra assessment (every 30 s). Each sensorgram
    consists of (I) baseline acquisition with 0.8 mM 4CN in HEPES buffer (pH 8) and
    (II) signal amplification by 0.16 M H2O2 introduction to the cycled solution.
    (d) The corresponding relative activity values of the dissimilar pore diameters
    upon interaction with various anti-Ec-ab concentrations. Data are presented as
    mean ± SD (n = 3). Next, the influence of the porous layer''s total depth was
    assessed through optical performance evaluation. Three different layers were anodized
    by varying the process duration (538 mA cm−2 applied for 10, 20 and 30 s). The
    resulting thicknesses were 2.7, 5.2 and 7.9 µm, respectively, obtained by HRSEM
    characterization (Fig. S4). Fig. S2b shows that the frequency of the Fabry–Pérot
    interference pattern increases upon porous layer thickening, as previously shown
    [30]. Finally, the calculated FFT values and Bruggeman effective medium approximation
    indicators are summarized in Table S1. The EOT values directly correlated with
    porous layer thickness, whereas the porosities were retained for all analyzed
    voids. Next, a similar biochemical characterization using simulating conditions
    of different filtered anti-Ec-ab concentrations (1, 0.8, 0.6 and 0.4 µg mL−1)
    was applied to the resulting interferometers. Again, no bacterial suspensions
    were used in the conducted assay. Fig. S5 shows the relative activity values of
    the dissimilar layers upon interaction with anti-Ec-ab concentrations. Significant
    optical differentiation of the various treatments was obtained for the thickest
    layer (7.9 µm, p ≤ 0.01) with respect to the other studied platforms. Therefore,
    based on the obtained data, the maximal porous depth of the interferometer was
    adapted as an optimized condition for practical sensor examination. 3.3. Sensitivity
    and selectivity of the sensing scaffold The optical performance of the optimized
    sensing scaffold toward the detection of pathogenic bacteria was elucidated by
    constructing a specific calibration curve. Briefly, different bacterial loads
    under spiked water conditions (10 – 106 CFU mL−1 E. coli) were allowed to interact
    with the anti-Ec-ab, passed through a syringe filter and applied on s-ab/p-SiO2
    surfaces. Note: the various bacterial counts were confirmed using conventional
    plate assay. Fig. 3a shows the biochemical response sensorgrams of the HRP catalytic
    activity products’ infiltration upon different filtrated solutions interactions
    with the s-ab/p-SiO2. The relative intensities declined gradually with increasing
    bacterial load as fewer free (unreacted) capture probes could associate with the
    porous support. For instance, the obtained relative values were 1.83, 1.66, 1.54,
    1.43, 1.37, 1.25 and 1.24 for the control condition (omitting bacteria from the
    assay), 101, 102, 103, 104, 105 and 106 CFU mL−1, respectively. The insufficient
    differences obtained at highest bacterial count, revealed saturation of the assay
    and inadequacy to quantify pronounced concentrations (i.e., ≥ 106 CFU mL−1). Thus,
    the corresponding values were used to calculate the relative activities with respect
    to the control condition and calibrate the assay. Fig. 3b shows a linear optical
    response to increasing E. coli concentrations, which is governed by the relationship
    of Rel. Activity = −0.1387 × (log CE. coli) + 0.9975 (R2 = 0.996). The calculated
    LOD is 2 CFU mL−1 within the studied range using the ratio between three standard
    deviations of the y-axis and the fitted line regression slope. The resulting calculated
    threshold level is highly attractive, especially using miniaturized equipment
    compatible with on-site detection. Download : Download high-res image (165KB)

    Note: The s-ab/p-SiO2 surfaces were pre-interacted with different filtered anti-Ec-ab
    concentrations, fixed in a custom-made cell, followed by reflectivity spectra
    assessment (every 30 s). Each sensorgram consists of (I) baseline acquisition
    with 0.8 mM 4CN in HEPES buffer (pH 8) and (II) signal amplification by 0.16 M H2O2
    introduction to the cycled solution. (b) The corresponding calibration curve.
    Data are reported as mean ± SD (n = 3). The label-free optical interferometers
    are susceptible to non-specific interaction between the sensing device or its
    counterparts and other common interfering molecules. This leads to false-positive
    indications and assessments of the overall target bacterial content in the examined
    matrix. Thus, the selectivity of the developed immunosensor was evaluated against
    different interfering pathogens, i.e., L. monocytogenes, S. Typhimurium, S. aureus,
    S. epidermidis, B. cereus and their mixtures with and without the inclusion of
    E. coli cells to the mixture compound. The concentrations of all inspected species
    were fixed to 103 CFU mL−1 and were correspondingly subjected to the pretreatment
    protocol. Fig. 4 presents the relative activities of the different interfering
    pathogen solutions without including E. coli in the analyzed solution. The obtained
    values present insignificant deviation with respect to the control condition (eliminating
    all bacteria from the assay), with relative activity values of 0.90 ± 0.09, 0.91 ± 0.05,
    0.92 ± 0.01, 0.98 ± 0.08, 0.96 ± 0.10 and 0.94 ± 0.06 for L. monocytogenes, S.
    Typhimurium, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. cereus and their mixtures, respectively.
    The negligible interference from all studied microorganisms is ascribed to the
    highly selective biorecognition probes used in the assay, which explicitly interact
    with the target bacteria and the porous nanostructure. Moreover, to exemplify
    a marginally complex matrix, the analyzed bacterial suspensions were spiked with
    E. coli and evaluated by the optical transducer. The responses were 0.58 ± 0.03,
    0.59 ± 0.13, 0.62 ± 0.01, 0.62 ± 0.05, 0.63 ± 0.10 and 0.61 ± 0.08 for L. monocytogenes,
    S. Typhimurium, S. aureus, S. epidermidis, B. cereus and their mixtures, respectively
    (while E. coli alone showed values of 0.61 ± 0.02). Thus, these results further
    strengthen that the indirect immunoassay design toward target bacteria detection
    reveals high selectivity in the presence of interfering microorganisms without
    compromising its performance measures. Download : Download high-res image (107KB)

    as mean ± SD (n = 3). 3.4. Environmental sample analysis The water samples from
    different origins (ground, irrigation and river) were used to exhibit the efficacy
    and accuracy of the biosensing platform for real-life scenarios. Two additional
    complex samples were also assessed by the s-ab/p-SiO2 platforms: non-contaminated
    raw and pasteurized milk samples obtained from representative healthy udders.
    The matrix-related complexity stems from milk constituents (e.g., fat globules,
    proteins, nutrients, white cells, etc.) that can block the porous nanostructure
    and impair its optical performance. Successful assessment of the latter samples
    was expected to provide insight into the suitability of the developed approach
    for food-related matrices. Thus, the noted samples were initially verified for
    null bacterial contamination prior to inoculation. Then, fixed E. coli concentrations
    (50 and 500 CFU mL−1) were similarly spiked in all samples and evaluated by conventional
    culture assay. The optical responses obtained from the porous transducers were
    used to calculate bacterial concentration using the regression relationship of
    the calibration curve, see summarized data in Table 1. The relative optical responses
    declined proportionally to increasing bacterial load, where less unreacted anti-Ec-ab
    can interact with the s-ab/p-SiO2 platforms, thus minimizing the biochemical reaction
    products’ output. The calculated recovery values for spiked ground, irrigation
    and river water were found between 93 % and 107 % with RSD of 7–14 %. Similarly,
    the recovery values of the spiked milk samples (raw and pasteurized) were between
    92 % and 103 %, with RSD ≤ 11 %. The obtained optical performances indicated that
    the developed assay is well-suited for the detection of pathogenic species such
    as E. coli in a rapid, reliable and accurate manner using environmentally relevant
    matrices. The system''s characteristics (e.g., detection range, LOD, assay duration
    and assessment of actual media) were further compared with recent optical biosensing
    approaches focused on E. coli quantification, see Table 2. In comparison, our
    method bridges the gap by offering a comprehensive detection range and practical
    LOD for water and milk samples within a shorter timeframe, surpassing the capabilities
    of other comparative methods. However, it is important to acknowledge that our
    approach does have some notable limitations. The main limitation of the bioassay
    is the sensitivity with respect to traditional culture-based and molecular-based
    methods capable of detecting a single CFU per 100 mL in 24 h or ∼ 100 fg target
    pathogen DNA in 5 h, respectively [1], [31]. The assay in its current state uses
    disposable sensing platforms, one s-ab/p-SiO2 unit for each dedicated test, hence
    non-reusable. Additionally, some pretreatments are necessary for the environmental
    samples, which might pose a challenge in certain scenarios [26]. Despite the noted
    limitations that can be alleviated by additional optimization steps, the method
    represents a significant advancement in detecting and analyzing water and milk
    samples. First, the separation process using syringe filtration excludes microorganisms
    from the complex media, therefore minimizing the need for time-consuming and instrumentation-based
    separation techniques (e.g., centrifugation and magnetic separation). Second,
    no enrichment process was involved in the pretreatment procedure, which simplified
    the execution of the presented bioassay. Third, label-free real-time qualitative
    and quantitative measurement of target pathogen using simple, portable, cost-effective
    sensing equipment. Fourth, the presented methodology is highly generic and could
    be potentially applied to study other relevant composite matrices. Overall, the
    comparative assessment highlights the advantages of the optical design for rapid,
    user-friendly and effective on-site detection of causative pathogens. Table 1.

    an effective sensitive detection method for E. coli cells contaminated water and
    food samples. The indirect immunoassay was coupled to a miniaturized p-SiO2 interferometer
    that was used as a physical sieve to accommodate the insoluble biochemical reaction
    products in correspondence with bacterial concentration. The sensing approach
    demonstrated several significant advantages for on-site field analyses, such as
    high sensitivity, attractive dynamic range and rapid assessment (2 CFU mL−1, 101
    to 105 CFU mL−1 and 80 min, respectively). The former was achieved by a simple
    separation procedure (syringe filtration) to eliminate microorganisms from the
    complicated environments, thereby minimizing most interferences with the porous
    support. Finally, besides being portable and low-cost, the developed interferometer
    is not constrained by exterior light (label-free transduction) while performing
    the assay outdoors using the RIFTS technique. Thus, we assume that the miniaturized
    sensing platform can be utilized for various emerging applications with pathogenesis
    relevance assessment conducted in most complex media. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: 'Generally, the agriculture sector contributes significantly to the
    Indian economy. The common problem faced by the farmers is that of decreased production
    because of dynamic infrastructure, feeble storage, lack of access to the market,
    and apt delivery. There is a demand for digital transformation in order to convert
    the traditional farming system toward a smart farming system based on IoT technology.
    There are several areas in agriculture where IoT can be implemented. Some of the
    focus areas are: predicting weather conditions, field monitoring, crop health
    and growth analysis, seedlings, fertilizer sprinkling, pesticide sprinkling, irrigation,
    soil condition monitoring, animal trespassing, etc. With the help of IoT sensors,
    a huge amount of data can be collected. Decisions can be made manually or automatically
    to monitor the fields with the aim of achieving equivalent growth and higher production.
    Smart farming based on IoT technology helps monitor real-time data, which improves
    the smartness of the agriculture system. The main objective of this chapter is
    to propose a case study in smart farming using IoT technology. Incorporation of
    such IoT technology leads to data collection and better control over internal
    processes, and, as a result, lowers production risks, better cost management,
    and waste reduction. Thanks to increased business efficiency through process automation,
    enhanced product quality and volumes are by-products.'

  description: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is a non-destructive and contactless technology
    that provides valuable information about the structure and composition of an object.
    It has the ability to capture detailed information about the chemical and physical
    properties of agricultural crops. Due to its wide spectral range, compared with
    multispectral- or RGB-based imaging methods, HSI can be a more effective tool
    for monitoring crop health and productivity. With the advent of this imaging tool
    in agrotechnology, researchers can more accurately address issues related to the
    detection of diseased and defective crops in the agriculture industry. This allows
    to implement the most suitable and accurate farming solutions, such as irrigation
    and fertilization, before crops enter a damaged and difficult-to-recover phase
    of growth in the field. While HSI provides valuable insights into the object under
    investigation, the limited number of HSI datasets for crop evaluation presently
    poses a bottleneck. Dealing with the curse of dimensionality presents another
    challenge due to the abundance of spectral and spatial information in each hyperspectral
    cube. State-of-the-art methods based on 1D and 2D convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) struggle to efficiently extract spectral and spatial information. On the
    other hand, 3D-CNN-based models have shown significant promise in achieving better
    classification and detection results by leveraging spectral and spatial features
    simultaneously. Despite the apparent benefits of 3D-CNN-based models, their usage
    for classification purposes in this area of research has remained limited. This
    paper seeks to address this gap by reviewing 3D-CNN-based architectures and the
    typical deep learning pipeline, including preprocessing and visualization of results,
    for the classification of hyperspectral images of diseased and defective crops.
    Furthermore, we discuss open research areas and challenges when utilizing 3D-CNNs

    evaluationDeep learning 1. Introduction Plant diseases pose significant threats
    to global food production, with potential yield losses of up to 30% and substantial
    economic impact [56]. This can have a devastating impact on farmers and communities,
    particularly in low-income countries where access to food is already challenging.
    Precision agriculture and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) offer promising solutions
    for preventing crop damage and losses, ultimately contributing to efforts to promote
    sustainability and reduce the impact of diseases on food production. HSI, also
    referred to as imaging spectrometry, combines two distinct technologies, imaging
    and spectroscopy, to provide both spatial and spectral information, simultaneously.
    Spectral information can provide rich information about biochemical and biophysical
    attributes of the agricultural crops. This is due to the higher spectral resolution
    of hyperspectral sensors compared to multispectral and RGB ones. As a result,
    this feature can lead to better discrimination of objects of similar colors, higher
    accuracy in complex classifications, and the ability to predict chemical composition
    and provide information about the interior of an object [67]. However, the interpretation
    of spectral data can be complex, especially when analyzing and comparing multiple
    samples over extended periods. One approach to simplify spectral analysis is the
    usage of spectral indices. Spectral indices are mathematical expressions that
    combine several spectral bands into a single value, providing an easier representation
    of the data. For example, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) computes
    the ratio between Near Infrared (NIR) and Red (R) bands of hyperspectral channels
    as follows: (1) With the help of spectral indices, one can effectively identify
    trends and changes in the data without requiring an in-depth comprehension of
    the underlying scientific principles governing spectral data, thus enabling a
    simpler data analysis, enhancement of features, standardization, comparability,
    and calibration of data. In the agricultural industry, two common spectral indices
    are the already mentioned NDVI and the Green Chlorophyll Index (GCI). The former
    is used to monitor vegetation growth and health and the latter quantifies the
    amount of chlorophyll in plants. Further indices have been defined, usually in
    the context of remote sensing, to support research for example on agriculture,
    soil, vegetation, water and forestry. A comprehensive database of spectral indices
    that is searchable by application area and hyperspectral sensor is provided in
    Henrich et al. [24]. From a data-perspective, a hyperspectral image is a stack
    of images, known as a hyperspectral cube or a data cube. Each image of this cube
    represents the response of the imager to one of the distinct hyperspectral channels
    [5]. This is illustrated in Fig. 1. It shows a 3D data cube P with dimensions
    , where M and N represent the axes of spatial information and λ represents the
    spectral dimension [74]. In the hyperspectral cube, each pixel, given by its spatial
    coordinates, is a vector of length λ that indicates the reflected radiation of
    a specific part of the object. Download : Download high-res image (79KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 1. The hyperspectral cube (adapted from Tarabalka
    et al. [74] with modification). It is a three-dimensional array where each pixel
    represents a spectrum containing a range of wavelengths. This spectrum can act
    as a fingerprint and provides information about biophysical and biochemical characteristics
    of the imaged object. The high-dimensionality of this data cube poses a challenge
    to traditional machine learning approaches, resulting in reduced accuracy due
    to their inability to extract complex features. Moreover, the performance of these
    approaches heavily depends on manual feature engineering. Convolutional Neural
    Networks (CNN) have been proven to achieve high classification accuracies in image
    classification tasks and to work well with the high-dimensionality of HSI data.
    In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of 3D-CNN-based models utilized
    in the classification of non-UAV-based hyperspectral images of diseased and defective
    crops. This review is intended to assist computer vision experts and agriculture-domain
    researchers seeking to address HSI classification tasks for crops under stress.
    The paper is organized as follows. In the following Section, we outline the investigation
    protocol used in this review. In Section 3, we briefly describe the structure
    of CNNs and their most important concepts. Following the typical data pipeline
    associated with CNNs, Sections 4 to 7 review data preprocessing, band and feature
    selection, network architecture design, and data visualization. This provides
    a convenient overview of its individual steps for plant classification problems
    using 3D-CNNs. Finally, Section 8 highlights the research gaps and limitations
    associated with the application of 3D-CNNs for HSI data classification. 2. Search

    through Google Scholar search engine. To optimize the search results, specific
    keywords were employed in the advanced search section, resulting in a refined
    list of articles. The selected search terms were different combinations of “hyperspectral”,
    “disease”, “detection”, “identification”, “diagnosis”, “plant”, “crop”, “stress”,
    “3D CNN”, “3 dimensional CNN”, “three dimensional CNN”, utilizing the Boolean
    operators, AND and OR. Around 2,000 records were investigated, however, to ensure
    the relevance of the articles, the abstracts of the retrieved papers were thoroughly
    assessed to confirm coherence with the title of this research. Moreover, screening

    review examines various applications of 3D-CNN-based models in detecting and classifying
    diseases in agricultural crops, including charcoal rot in soybeans [45], mold
    in peanuts and strawberries [42], [33], bacterial leaf blight (BLB) in rice [10],
    grapevine vein-clearing virus (GVCV) in grapevines [47], and potato late blight
    (PLB) in potatoes [51]. Moreover, the review explores the use of 3D-CNN-based
    architectures for identifying specific defects in crops, such as decay in blueberries
    [52], bruise and brown spots in fruits [50], [28], heat stress in rice [19], as
    well as black, fermented, shell, and broken coffee defects in beans [13]. By harnessing
    the power of 3D-CNN-based models, we can effectively address challenges of classifying
    diseased and defective using hyperspectral images. This can result in the preservation
    of product quality, prevention of yield losses, and ensuring food safety standards.
    3. CNN structure and concepts A CNN is comprised of a series of layers each consisting
    of several neurons. As shown in Fig. 2, each layer is the input for the next layer
    in the network. Key building blocks of a CNN are convolution layers, detector
    layers, and pooling layers. A convolution layer uses convolutional kernels to
    extract low-dimensional features from the input data while preserving the spatial
    relationship between the input data pixels. Fig. 3 depicts the movement directions
    of 1D (spectral), 2D (spatial), and 3D (spatial-spectral) kernels within the hypercube.
    A detector layer applies a non-linear function like Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
    to learn non-linear representations. Pooling layers make features invariant by
    reducing the dimensionality of data. Download : Download high-res image (55KB)

    A CNN consists of multiple layers, including convolution, detector, and pooling
    layers, where each layer serves as the input for the subsequent layer, enabling
    the extraction of low-dimensional features, learning of non-linear representations,
    and dimensionality reduction in the network. Download : Download high-res image

    process using 1D, 2D, and 3D kernels in hypercube. A schematic overview of movement
    directions for (a) 1D, (b) 2D, and (c) 3D convolutions in CNNs over hypercube
    is shown. The X and Y directions indicate the movement of the kernel across the
    spatial dimensions, and Z direction shows the movement across the spectral dimension.
    Classification methods based on 1D-CNN (spectral feature-based) and 2D-CNN (spatial
    feature-based) cannot efficiently classify hyperspectral data as neither utilizes
    spatial and spectral features together. However, a 3D-CNN can extract spatial-spectral
    features from the volumetric data. This is due to its ability to incorporate the
    spectral dimension in addition to the spatial dimensions, which enables it to
    model and learn more complex spatiotemporal representations. On the flipside,
    a straightforward generalization of kernels to their 3-dimensional versions increases
    the number of operations that must be performed to apply a kernel by a factor
    of l. Not only the application of these kernels is computationally more costly,
    but also their training becomes more challenging, as the kernel has more parameters.
    Taking no other model-changes into account (as, for example in Qiao et al. [52])
    we would have to shorten kernel-sides by to keep computational complexity at roughly
    the same level. In the following, a description of previous review papers that
    deal with the topics of CNNs, hyperspectral data, and applications in agriculture
    and plant research is given. The work of Signoroni et al. [63] is aimed at domain
    professionals seeking comprehensive insights into the integration of hyperspectral
    acquisition techniques and deep learning architectures for specific tasks across
    diverse application domains. This resource caters to machine learning and computer
    vision experts, offering a nuanced understanding of how deep learning technologies
    are tailored to effectively process and analyze hyperspectral data, keeping them
    up-to-date with the latest advancements. In Jiang and Li [29] an examination of
    how different CNN architectures have been employed in the assessment of plant
    stress, plant development, and postharvest quality. This review categorizes the
    studies according to the technical advancements achieved in terms of imaging classification,
    object detection, and image segmentation. As a result, it highlights cutting-edge
    solutions for specific phenotyping applications, offering valuable insights into
    the current state of the field. An overview of state-of-the-art CNN models and
    visualization techniques for disease diagnosis in plants is given in Joseph et
    al. [31]. The review given in Gill et al. [21] delves into the plant stress phenotyping,
    specifically examining the utilization of machine learning and deep learning methodologies.
    The study encompasses a wide range of high throughput phenotyping platforms, exploring
    the integration of data from diverse sources. However, it does not discuss 3D-CNN
    architectures. Finally, a review paper that combines all three topics was provided
    in Wang et al. [80]. In that work, the authors provide an overview of the application
    of hyperspectral imaging in agriculture, encompassing areas such as ripeness and
    component prediction, classification themes, and plant disease detection. Additionally,
    the study examines recent advancements in hyperspectral image analysis specifically
    in the context of deep learning models. The review not only highlights the achievements
    in this field but also outlines the existing challenges associated with deep learning-based
    hyperspectral image analysis. Moreover, the study presents future prospects and
    potential directions for further research in this domain. In this review, we update
    and complement the paper of Wang et al. [80] with a particular focus on 3D-CNNs
    and the entirety of the process of creating a high-performant model, including
    preprocessing of data, band selection, exploration of model architectures, and
    data visualization. A deep learning pipeline for HSI classification typically
    consists of several stages, including data preprocessing, band and feature selection,
    model design, model training, testing, and evaluation (see Fig. 4). Data preprocessing
    involves enhancing the quality of raw HSI data, for example, through noise removal,
    radiometric calibration, and dimension reduction. Feature extraction transforms
    the raw data into a new space of features, which is expected to be more discriminative
    for the classification task. Band selection defines a subset of the original spectral
    bands that is the most relevant for the classification task. Model design is the
    configuration of hyperparameters of the CNN model, for example, the number and
    sequence of convolutional layers and dense layers, the activation functions to
    be used, and the usage of dropout or skip connections. During the training step,
    the model is optimized by iteratively adjusting its internal parameters (weights
    and biases) to minimize the error between its predicted output and the actual
    output on the input data. Finally, the model is evaluated to learn patterns and
    relationships in the data and to make accurate predictions on new unseen data.

    Fig. 4. Typical deep learning pipeline for HSI data classification. First, the
    discriminative features and bands are extracted from preprocessed HSI dataset
    of crop. Then, the dataset is split to training, validation, and testing sets.
    The training dataset is used to train the 3D-CNN model, the validation dataset
    is employed to assess the model''s performance and fine tune its parameters, and
    the testing dataset serves to evaluate the final performance and generalization
    ability of the trained 3D-CNN model on unseen data. 4. Data preprocessing Data
    preprocessing is a critical step in hyperspectral data analysis, aimed at optimizing
    the quality and quantity of the data. This step enhances the suitability of the
    data for downstream tasks such as classification and feature extraction. Preprocessing
    techniques include patch extraction, radiometric correction and calibration, smoothing,
    dimension reduction, and background removal. Data augmentation also falls under
    preprocessing and has the goal of increasing the volume of training data. 4.1.
    Patch extraction Patch extraction is a technique that involves dividing an image
    into smaller images or patches. In the context of HSI, patch extraction has significant
    advantages for efficient and targeted analysis of specific regions of interest
    within an image. By extracting image patches that contain pixels with similar
    properties, researchers can focus their analysis on areas of the image that are
    most relevant to diseased or defective areas. To give a concrete example, Nagasubramanian
    et al. [45] utilized patch extraction to analyze hyperspectral images of soybean
    crops. In their study, they extracted spatial patches of size 64×64×240 from an
    original image of size 500×1600×240, where the first two dimensions define the
    spatial resolution of the image and 240 denotes the number of spectral bands.
    By analyzing the properties of pixels within these patches, they were able to
    extract features that were more representative of the target disease which ultimately
    improved the accuracy and efficiency of their analysis. Furthermore, patch extraction
    helps to expand the number of images when there is a lack of data. It also reduces
    computational time, as processing hyperspectral images of large sizes can be computationally
    demanding [51], [28]. 4.2. Data augmentation Imbalanced and scarce data is a common
    problem in many machine learning applications (see, for example, [1]) and HSI
    is no exception. Imbalanced data, a special case of data scarcity, refers to the
    situation where the number of samples in each class or category of the data is
    not evenly distributed. This can lead to a bias towards the overrepresented classes
    in the analysis results, which is particularly problematic if the minority class
    is of interest. To address imbalanced HSI data, one common approach is resampling
    [47], which involves either oversampling the minority class or undersampling the
    majority class to balance the class distribution. Resampling can be done randomly
    or using more advanced techniques such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique
    (SMOTE) [12] or Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) sampling [23]. Other widespread data
    augmentation approaches include transformation techniques such as mirroring [42],
    rotation [42], [13], horizontal and vertical flipping [13], [50], and color jittering
    [50]. Along with above-mentioned methods, patch extraction (Section 4.1) can also
    be used to address imbalance HSI dataset. 4.3. Radiometric calibration and correction
    Radiometric calibration is an essential step in the accurate operation of hyperspectral
    cameras. It aims to establish a quantitative relationship between the response
    of the camera sensor (the radiation sensor) and the actual reflectance (radiation
    level) of an object in a given environment. The calibration process involves assigning
    a “true” value for either radiation intensity or reflectance to the digital numbers
    given by the camera that represent recorded outputs for each pixel and spectral
    channel. To that end, calibrated reflectance standards are utilized, which usually
    consist of a matte Lambertian reflecting surface to ensure that reflected light
    is uniform in all directions [60]. The calibration process is then performed as
    follows: After selecting a radiation source that emits a known type and amount
    of radiation, the detector is placed in close proximity to the source to measure
    the radiation. Next, using calibration factors provided by the manufacturer or
    based on known mathematical formulas (see, for example, [51]) for the particular
    detector, the expected response of the detector is determined. The measured response
    of the detector is then aligned with the expected response based on the known
    radiation level using calibration factors. This calibration process should be
    repeated periodically with different radiation sources to ensure the continued
    accuracy and reliability of the detector''s measurements. Even with calibration
    performed, hyperspectral cameras are susceptible to radiometric errors that can
    arise from a variety of sources, including sensor drift, electronic interference,
    light source, and data transmission and recording issues. For example, one of
    the common radiometric errors which relates to the camera''s sensor is stripping.
    Each sensor consists of multiple individual detectors that sometimes do not function
    properly due to being out of calibration. Consider a push broom (along-track)
    camera where its sensor has multiple detectors aligned in a row. When one of them
    is calibrated slightly different from the adjacent detector the striping effect
    can occur. In this case, lines predominantly consisting of varying shades of dark
    and bright pixels formed. Radiometric correction can register and rectify incorrect
    pixel brightness. To achieve this, a series of procedures are employed including
    noise correction, de-striping, line-dropout correction [17], and black and white
    image correction [19], [10], [13], [28]. Fig. 5(b) shows the calibrated hyperspectral
    image of lettuce using the following computation, (2) where, Raw HSI Data is the
    image taken by the hyperspectral camera without modification, Dark Ref is the
    image captured by closing the camera''s lens, and the White Ref is the imaged
    white reference with even and maximum reflectance across the spectral range. Download

    and white calibration of HSI data. (a) The hyperspectral image of lettuce rendered

    image after black and white image correction using the Equation (2). 4.4. Smoothing
    Smoothing, also known as filtering, is a technique in HSI to improve the quality
    of the data by reducing noise and artifacts and enhancing the signal-to-noise
    ratio of the data. This technique in HSI can be broadly classified into two categories:
    spatial smoothing and spectral smoothing. Spatial smoothing techniques selectively
    smooth out certain features in an image by applying filters that amplify or attenuate
    certain spatial frequencies [17]. Common spatial smoothing techniques include
    Gaussian filtering, mean filtering [54], median filtering, bilateral filtering
    [9], and anisotropic diffusion filtering [39]. Spectral smoothing techniques operate
    on the spectral domain of an HSI image by smoothing the intensity values of neighboring
    spectral bands. As in spatial smoothing the goal is to remove noise [77], reduce
    artifacts, and enhance features in the image. Common spectral smoothing techniques
    include moving average filtering [77], Savitzky-Golay (SG) filtering [78], Fourier
    filtering, wavelet filtering, and principal component analysis (PCA). For example,
    Cao et al. [10] eliminated the random noise that was present in the spectral data
    of the different region of interests (ROIs) using SG filtering. The filtering
    process makes it easier to identify the true signal of the sample and remove interference
    caused by size and structure differences between the ROIs. Similarly, Jung et
    al. [33] and Jia et al. [28] used a SG filter to smooth out the spectral data
    and reduce the effect of noise. As Vaiphasa [77] points out, care must be taken
    when applying smoothing techniques. The subjective selection of smoothing filters
    in hyperspectral remote sensing studies can negatively impact the statistical
    properties of the spectral data, which can, in turn, affect subsequent analyses.
    To preserve the statistical properties of the HSI data, the selection of smoothing
    filters should be done through a comparative t-test method that identifies the
    filter with the least statistical disturbances. By using this approach, it is
    possible to mitigate the negative effects of smoothing filters and ensure the
    reliability of subsequent analyses based on statistical class models. 4.5. Dimension
    reduction The large number of spectral bands within hyperspectral data often makes
    it challenging to process and analyze HSI data. Dimensionality reduction techniques
    retain relevant information, while allowing the model to work on smaller hypercubes
    downstream. These techniques are split into linear and non-linear ones. 4.5.1.
    Linear techniques Linear dimension reduction in HSI refers to a set of statistical
    and machine learning techniques that aim to find a lower-dimensional linear manifold
    in the high-dimensional space that captures the essential spectral information
    of the data [35]. By embedding the data into this lower-dimensional linear space,
    the dimensionality of the data is reduced while preserving as much of the spectral
    information as possible. PCA and Random Forest (RF) are two examples of this technique,
    and demonstrations of both can be seen in Cao et al. [10]. The process of PCA
    involves first zero-centering the input spectral matrix (i.e., the matrix of the
    spectral bands) and computing its covariance matrix. Next, the eigenvectors and
    eigenvalues of the covariance matrix are calculated, and the eigenvalues are sorted
    in descending order. The top k eigenvalues are then selected and the corresponding
    eigenvectors space computed. The k-dimensional data is obtained by projecting
    the original spectral matrix into the new space using the selected eigenvectors.
    On the other hand, an RF evaluates the importance of each wavelength by randomly
    replacing it and measuring its effect on the accuracy of the thus trained CNN
    model. To accomplish this, the RF builds many decision trees, and each tree is
    trained on a different subset of the data. The algorithm calculates the importance
    score for each wavelength by measuring the change in the prediction error rate
    before and after randomly replacing the wavelength in the out-of-bag data. The
    wavelength with the highest importance score is selected, and this process is
    repeated until the desired number of wavelengths is achieved. The dimensionality
    of the hyperspectral data is thus reduced, while retaining the most important
    information for accurate predictions. Further linear algorithms for dimension
    reduction of HSI data are described in Fırat et al. [18] and encompass Independent
    Component Analysis (ICA) and PCA-based algorithms like Incremental PCA (IPCA),
    Sparse PCA (SPCA), and Randomized PCA (RPCA). 4.5.2. Non-linear techniques Non-linear
    techniques can handle data with complex and non-linear structures. Yang et al.
    [83] classified these techniques into Kernel-based and manifold learning [83].
    Kernel-based techniques, like Kernel PCA (KPCA), use non-linear mappings to transform
    data into higher-dimensional feature spaces first on which linear techniques can
    be applied. Manifold learning algorithms, on the other hand, aim to directly discover
    the intrinsic non-linear structure of data. See Khodr and Younes [35] for well-known
    manifold learning techniques, including Isometric Feature Mapping (Isomap), Locally
    Linear Embedding (LLE), Local Tangent Space Alignment (LTSA), Diffusion Maps,
    Sammon''s Mapping (SM), and Locality Preserving Projections (LPP). 4.6. Background
    removal The data captured in hyperspectral images contains both foreground, called
    the ROI, and background objects. In scenarios where the target object does not
    cover the entire scanning area the signals from background objects can interfere
    with the data analysis, i.e., the background can contain noise that needs to be
    filtered out [78]. This is especially true when dealing with images that exhibit
    color gradients. By masking the background from the data, researchers can focus
    on the spectral signature of the ROI. This leads to improved target detection
    in classification task. It also reduces the computational complexity of subsequent
    processing steps including the training 3D-CNN models [51]. There are various
    traditional techniques to extract he ROI from the hyperspectral image. These techniques
    can be classified into several categories based on their underlying principles
    and are discussed separately below. 4.6.1. Spectral similarity-based methods These
    methods work based on the similarity between the spectra of the pixels within
    an image. Examples of such methods include Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) [37] and
    Spectral Information Divergence (SID) [53]. SAM computes the spectral angle (3)
    between the target reference spectrum R and each pixel spectrum T for all spectral
    bands λ in the hyperspectral image. This results in a similarity measure that
    is insensitive to illumination variations [2]. On the other hand, SID works based
    on the concept of information theory (entropy). It compares the spectral information
    content of each pixel to a reference spectral information content. In general,
    SAM is better suited for well-defined spectral variations and low background noise,
    while SID is more robust to complex background noise and illumination variations.
    4.6.2. Statistical-based methods These methods leverage statistical techniques
    to identify ROIs that share similar spectral properties and produce a set of uncorrelated
    components capturing different aspects of spectral variability within the image.
    For example, Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF) [43] is specifically designed to reduce
    the impact of noise in the data by separating the noise and signal components
    of the HSI data. This makes it particularly useful for operating on noisy HSI
    data but at the expense of more computational time. Another technique, ICA (see
    Section 4.5.1), aims to separate the mixed signals into their independent components,
    providing a more flexible approach to identify subtle spectral differences between
    ROIs. Finally, PCA [13] decomposes the original HSI data into orthogonal components
    that represent the directions of maximum variance in the data. In general, PCA
    is computationally more efficient than ICA and MNF, as it involves a simpler mathematical
    transformation that uses standard matrix operations. 4.6.3. Spatial-based methods
    These methods exploit the spatial correlation present in the image to differentiate
    between pixels within and outside the ROI. Typically, these methods apply morphological
    operations or spatial filtering techniques to extract features such as edges or
    texture, which are then used to segment the image into ROIs. The Morphological
    Attribute Profile (MAP) [14] and the Spatial-Spectral Endmember Extraction (SSEE)
    algorithm [49] are examples of spatial-based methods that use mathematical morphology
    and spatial filtering, respectively. SSEE first identifies the endmembers, or
    pure spectral signatures, present in the HSI data, and then uses a spatial clustering
    algorithm to group adjacent pixels with similar spectral properties into ROIs.
    On the other hand, MAP applies a series of morphological opening and closing operations
    to the image to identify connected regions of pixels with similar morphological
    attributes, such as size and shape. These connected regions can then be used as
    ROIs. These methods are computationally efficient and can be useful in scenarios
    where spectral information alone is not sufficient for accurate ROI extraction,
    such as in cases of low spectral contrast or high noise levels. 4.6.4. Hybrid
    methods These methods combine techniques to improve the accuracy and efficiency
    of the ROI extraction process. One approach can be combining statistical-based
    techniques such as PCA, ICA, or MNF with spatial-based techniques such as MAP
    or SSEE. For example, by combining MAP and PCA we can exploit both the spatial
    and spectral information [70] in the HSI data for ROI extraction. These hybrid
    methods can be effective in cases where neither spatial nor spectral methods alone
    are sufficient for accurate ROI extraction. 4.6.5. Machine learning-based methods
    Machine learning algorithms can also be used to extract the ROI. This process
    involves training a model using labeled data to identify and extract regions with
    specific spectral characteristics. Once trained, the model can be used to predict
    the presence of those characteristics in unlabeled data and extract ROIs. This
    procedure is computationally efficient and allows for the extraction of subtle
    and complex patterns that may not be easily identifiable through traditional methods.
    Some instances of such techniques are Support Vector Machines (SVM) [6], RF [7],
    and CNN [40], [79]. 4.6.6. Software-assisted manual annotation Manual definition
    of the ROI can be assisted by software specifically built to handle HSI data.
    Amongst these are for example ENVI [38] and Spectronon [55] as commercial products,
    as well as the MATLAB Hyperspectral toolbox. Examples for open-source and free
    software are SeaDAS [46], the Orfeo ToolBox [11], and RSGISLib [8]. These packages
    provide HSI data analysis for a wide range of tasks discussed before. An example
    of software-assisted annotation is the work of Jin et al. [30] in which the authors
    generated an ROI using ENVI by manually selecting the tissues or areas of interest
    in the false color images of HSI data. Researchers can utilize such software in
    addition to the above discussed algorithms. For example, Gao et al. [19] developed
    an open-source software which is specifically designed for analyzing HSI data
    of seeds. It is able to remove the background of the HSI data and produces a binary
    mask using a user-defined minimum and maximum intensity threshold along with a
    component-searching algorithm. The results are an accurate segmentation of the
    seeds even when they overlap. 5. Band and feature selection The selection of spectral
    bands in HSI is another crucial preprocessing step for classification tasks. It
    entails the identification of a subset of the most discriminative spectral bands
    from all available bands. This process is instrumental in reducing data dimensionality
    by eliminating redundant bands, thereby significantly reducing the computational
    overheads of downsteam tasks. Furthermore, the careful selection of spectral bands
    can also reduce the effects of noise in the data. In general, based on the survey
    of Sun and Du [71], band selection mechanisms can be categorized into six groups
    as follows (another classification of methods is presented in Sawant and Prabukumar
    [58]). 5.1. Ranking-based selection Ranking-based band selection methods evaluate
    the significance of each spectral band based on a predetermined criterion and
    choose the most important bands in a sorted order. These methods can be categorized
    into two types: supervised and unsupervised. In supervised ranking-based methods,
    labeled training samples are utilized to determine the importance of each spectral
    band, while in unsupervised ranking-based methods, statistical properties of the
    data are used for the same purpose. One example of such method is spectral differentiation.
    Qi et al. [51] employed first and second order differentiation to decrease the
    computational complexity of HSI data containing 204 bands. The first derivative
    can effectively pinpoint areas in the spectrum where the rate of change is highest.
    This indicates the presence of sharp spectral features such as absorption or emission
    lines. Moreover, it allows for the selection of bands that capture these features
    and thus, provide critical information for classification or detection tasks.
    The second derivative is useful for identifying regions of the spectrum where
    the rate of change of the first derivative is highest, signifying the presence
    of spectral curvature. The selection of bands that capture the shape of the spectral
    signature, based on this information, can enhance the differentiating power in
    classification or detection tasks. Likewise, Jung et al. [33] achieved an increase
    in accuracy using spectral differentiation and expansion of the input in the vertical
    direction of the raw data. This technique was applied in addition to SG smoothing
    (see Section 4.4) to further improve data quality. 5.2. Searching-based selection
    Searching-based band selection methods involve the creation of a criterion function
    such as Euclidean distance and Bhattacharyya distance [26] to evaluate the performance
    of each spectral band based on a specified optimization objective. The first step
    involves creating an initial subset of bands, followed by an assessment of the
    criterion function for the subset. The next step is applying a searching strategy
    to identify the best subset of bands that maximizes the criterion function, and
    evaluating the selected subset based on data classification performance. This
    iterative process continues until the desired level of performance is reached.
    Searching-based methods largely depend on the quality of the criterion function
    and the optimization strategy employed. Incremental searching [81], [57], updated
    searching [20], [62], and eliminating searching [68] are among the commonly utilized
    strategies. 5.3. Clustering-based selection Clustering-based methods for hyperspectral
    band selection group bands into clusters and select representative bands from
    each cluster to create a final subset. These algorithms can be unsupervised [27],
    [82], supervised [44] or semisupervised [66], [65]. The selection of representative
    bands is typically performed using information measurements, such as mutual information
    or Kullback–Leibler divergence. Commonly used clustering techniques are K-means,
    affinity propagation, and graph clustering. K-means selects the best cluster centers
    that minimize the sum of distances to a set of putative center candidates. Affinity
    propagation selects exemplars by considering the correlation or similarity among
    bands and the discriminative capability of each band. 5.4. Sparsity-based selection
    Sparsity-based techniques for band selection rely on sparse representation or
    regression to identify representative bands. The most common of these methods
    are discussed separately below. 5.4.1. Sparse nonnegative matrix factorization-based
    methods These methods [41] break down the hypercube into a set of building blocks,
    which are both nonnegative and sparsely encoded. This promotes a feature extraction
    process that combines these building blocks to create a parts-based representation
    of the original data. The goal of this method is to identify the most informative
    bands of the HSI data matrix by optimizing an objective function that includes
    sparsity constraints. 5.4.2. Sparse representation-based methods Sparse representation-based
    methods [86], [72] use pre-defined or learned dictionaries to select informative
    bands of the HSI data matrix based on their sparse coefficients. These methods
    rank the bands according to the frequency of their occurrence in the sparse coefficient
    histograms. In some cases, sparse representation-based methods can also be designed
    to solve multiple tasks simultaneously, and an immune clonal strategy can be used
    to search for the best combinations of informative bands. 5.4.3. Sparse regression-based
    methods Sparse regression-based techniques [69], [15] transform the band selection
    problem into a regression problem and estimate the most representative bands by
    solving a sparse regression problem. These methods can also include sparsity constraints
    to encourage the selection of only the most informative bands for the regression
    model. 5.5. Embedding-learning based selection Embedding-learning based methods
    aim to learn a low-dimensional representation of the spectral data, also known
    as an embedding, that captures the most salient features of the data. There are
    several types of embedding learning-based methods that can be used for band selection,
    including autoencoders [75], Deep Neural Networks (DNN) [87], and CNNs [61]. Autoencoders
    learn a compact representation of the input data by training a neural network
    to encode the input into a lower-dimensional space and then decode it back into
    the original space. DNN, on the other hand, consists of multiple layers of interconnected
    neurons. This architecture enables the network to learn complex patterns and features
    in a hierarchical manner, empowering it to extract high-level representations
    from the input data. Meanwhile, CNNs can learn spatially invariant features from
    image data. These techniques aim to learn a set of parameters that minimize an
    objective function that measures the model''s performance on a particular task,
    such as classification or target detection. Band selection is integrated into
    the optimization process by constraining the learning algorithm to focus on a
    subset of the available bands, or by assigning weights to each band that reflect
    its relevance to the task at hand. The resulting model can then be utilized to
    predict the class label of new samples or to detect the presence of specific targets
    in the image. For example, Chen et al. [13] employed a DNN based binary classification
    to identify the foreground and background regions of the HSI data. Subsequently,
    connected component labeling algorithms and edge contours were used to isolate
    the ROI from the image for further analysis. Moreover, Jia et al. [28] implemented
    a CNN-based band selection module that works based on a group convolution technique,
    which involves applying a 1×1 one-dimensional convolution (equivalent to a scalar
    multiplication) to each band of the input hyperspectral image independently. This
    technique helps to overcome the problem of mutual interference between different
    channels. The weights of the convolutional kernel are updated in the early stage
    of the network training using a loss function and an auxiliary classifier (see
    also the next Section 6). The weights represent the importance of each band, with
    a higher absolute value of weight indicating greater importance of the corresponding
    band. 5.6. Hybrid-scheme based selection Hybrid-scheme based methods involve combining
    multiple band selection techniques to select the most appropriate bands. A popular
    combination is clustering and ranking [84], [16], where clustering is used to
    group bands and ranking is used to select the most important bands within each
    cluster. Other hybrid methods combine clustering with searching or combine ranking
    with searching to further optimize band selection. 6. Network architecture design:
    feature extraction and classification The objective of neural network architecture
    design is to create a model that can effectively learn from the input data and
    generalize well to new, unseen data. In order to achieve this for HSI classification,
    a network architecture must be developed that can capture the complex spectral
    and spatial information present in the data. As an integral aspect of designing
    a neural network, the decision of the number of layers to use is a crucial one.
    While the inclusion of more layers in a network has been shown [76], [32] to improve
    performance, it can simultaneously present several challenges. A notable challenge
    arises from the potential occurrence of vanishing or exploding gradients [73],
    where the gradient signal becomes too small or too large as it backpropagates
    through the layers during training (see also Subsection 6.2.1). Such a phenomenon
    makes it difficult for the network to learn and adjust its weights effectively.
    Moreover, as the number of layers and parameters increases, the risk of overfitting
    rises, which is characterized by the network''s ability to perform exceptionally
    well on the training data, but not generalize well on unseen data. Consequently,
    the network may become computationally expensive to train and use due to its high
    processing power and memory requirements. Additionally, gradient computation time
    increases, thereby impeding the training''s efficiency. Hence, careful consideration
    of these challenges and trade-offs is imperative to designing a network that balances
    complexity and performance. For this review, we classified 3D-CNNs into hybrid
    and non-hybrid structures. A network is hybrid if it includes either specific
    module(s) that improve feature extraction, accuracy, and performance or if it
    integrates 2D-CNN within the 3D-CNN architecture. In the following, we present
    3D-CNN models for the classification of diseased and defected crop using HSI data.
    A summary of these architectures is also given in Table 1, Table 2. 6.1. Non-hybrid
    networks Nagasubramanian et al. [45] presented a 3D-CNN model to classify healthy
    and diseased crop. This model consists of two convolution layers with max pooling
    layers, and two Fully Connected (FC) layers, trained using the Adam optimizer.
    To prevent overfitting, dropout mechanisms were used after the first max pooling
    and first FC layer. A Weighted Binary Cross Entropy (WBCE) function of the form
    (4) was implemented to address imbalanced training data. Here y and represent
    binary variables for whether the ground truth and predicted result belong to a
    given class, respectively (see also Section 4.2 for a discussion on how to counteract
    imbalances in datasets). Using the coefficient β the WBCE loss function assigns
    higher weights to the minority class, for example, the false negatives rate decreases
    if β is set higher than 1, while setting it smaller than 1 reduces the false positive
    rate. Although the above technique can classify and detect diseased crop, detection
    of asymptomatic diseased crops at early stage and differentiating it from the
    healthy crops can be more challenging. In this respect, Jung et al. [33] developed
    a 3D-CNN model that improves classification accuracy of the asymptomatic diseased
    crop without modification and preprocessing of input HSI data. The model consists
    of four 3D convolution layers in which the first and fourth layers each are followed
    by a 3D max pooling layer and a batch normalization. The rest of the convolution
    layers are only followed by batch normalization. The output of the last 3D convolution
    layer is passed through a global average pooling and two dense layers. In Jung
    et al. [33] the results were improved further by preprocessing the input HSI data
    which went through spectral differentiation, vertical expansion, and smoothing.
    Automating the classification procedure of HSI data using software can effectively
    mitigate the time-consuming process of implementing a deep learning pipeline.
    In this respect, Gao et al. [19] developed an open-source software that classifies
    seeds at pixel level using 3D-CNN. Though at first it was developed for a specific
    crop (rice), the test experiments over other seeds are promising. This software
    utilizes a 3D-CNN that consists of two 3D convolution layers, with two and four
    3D convolution kernels for the first and second layers, respectively. The output
    is then flattened via one FC layer and classification is performed using a softmax
    function. However, this software as part of its feature extraction process does
    not consider the global feature relationship which can improve its ability to
    recognize and classify seeds accurately. Nguyen et al. [47] implemented a 3D-CNN
    for classification of a small size dataset. The feature extraction part is implemented
    based on AlexNet [36] and constitutes 5 convolutional layers followed by a flattening
    layer. The input layer takes an input of size 512×512×203, where 203 stands for
    number of bands. The first two convolutional layers are followed by a max pooling
    layer and a batch normalization. After that each convolutional layer is followed
    by a max pooling layer and after the last max pooling layer batch normalization
    and flattenings is applied before feeding the result into a RF or SVM for binary
    classification (healthy or diseased crop). 6.2. Hybrid networks 6.2.1. 3D-CNN
    architectures based on ResNet To address the challenges of vanishing or exploding
    gradients Qiao et al. [52] proposed to leverage residual convolutional blocks
    within a 3D deep ResNet architecture. This approach reduces the number of channels
    through the use of identity residual blocks and a convolutional residual blocks.
    The identity residual block maintains the same input and output dimensions, while
    the convolutional residual block changes the number of channels. The use of a
    l×l×l convolution kernel as the shortcut in the convolutional residual block reduces
    the number of parameters and computational complexity. To further improve efficiency,
    Qiao et al. [52] adopt a bottleneck structure, that reduces the number of required
    convolution operations. Each convolutional layer is followed by a batch normalization
    layer to prevent vanishing gradient and enhance convergence rate. The network
    uses Exponential Linear Unit (ELU) as the non-linear activation function, which
    addresses the problem of dying neurons in ReLU. In order to identify the appropriate
    hyperparameters, the authors employed a Tree-structured Parzen Estimator (TPE)
    as an optimization algorithm. The TPE utilizes a probabilistic model to approximate
    the distribution of the objective function and guides the search for optimal hyperparameters.
    For the classification, a 7×7×1 global pooling layer and a FC are utilized. This
    model halves the number of parameters and improves the computational time up to
    10%. Moreover, the study of Pourdarbani et al. [50] over performance of well-known
    architectures in detection of defective crop demonstrates that residual connections
    achieve higher accuracy, while training faster despite having more parameters.
    6.2.2. Hypernet-PRMF network Liu et al. [42] presented a feature pre-extraction
    and a multi-feature fusion block to extract peanut characteristics from hyperspectral
    data. The feature pre-extraction includes constructing a Peanut Recognition Index
    (PRI) based on two informative bands to distinguish healthy, moldy, and damaged
    peanuts. The multi-feature fusion block is a technique used in image segmentation
    to fully extract spatial and spectral features from HSI data. This technique involves
    using multiple types of convolution kernels including 2D convolution for common
    texture features, separable convolution for increased feature diversity, depthwise
    convolution for band feature extraction, and 3D convolution for spectral change
    information. The convolutions are concatenated after normalization and activation
    functions to enhance diversity and improve recognition accuracy. Moreover, the
    authors employed feature pre-extraction and multi-feature fusion block techniques
    in their proposed peanut recognition model, called Hypernet-PRMF network. This
    model works at both peanut- and pixel-level recognition. The model consists of
    four parts: feature pre-extraction, down-sampling, up-sampling, and prediction.
    The feature pre-extraction part enhances the differentiation between different
    peanut features. The down-sampling part reduces the size of the image while increasing
    the number of convolution kernels, whereas the up-sampling part reconstructs the
    image while reducing the number of convolution kernels. The prediction works based
    on the softmax function and the class of maximum predicted probability is chosen
    as the final recognition result. The model achieves pixel-wise recognition accuracy
    with the use of the watershed segmentation algorithm. This technique has the potential
    to be employed for detection of other crops like sorghum. 6.2.3. Spectral dilated
    convolution 3D-CNN Cao et al. [10] proposed a spectral dilated convolution (SDC)-3D-CNN
    model to detect crop''s asymptomatic diseases at an early stage. This model consists
    of SDC modules along with residual blocks that prevent the gradient vanishing
    problem. SDC extends the idea of dilated convolution which expands the receptive
    field of convolution kernels without augmenting the model''s parameterization.
    Receptive field is the portion of the input space needed to create a filter at
    any convolutional layer. The 3D-SDC extends the receptive field of convolutional
    kernels to the spectral dimension. It works based on the principle of applying
    a filter to an input with intermittent intervals, which are dictated by the spectral
    dilation rate. The network was tested with top 50, 100, 150, and 200 significant
    wavelengths extracted by RF and Principal Components (PCs) of the same ranking
    by PCA along with different spectral dilation rate to detect healthy, asymptomatic,
    and symptomatic crop. The experiment result shows higher detection performance
    of the network using top the 50 important features extracted by RF at a dilation
    rate of 5. 6.2.4. Merged 2D- and 3D-CNN architectures Chen et al. [13] developed
    a 2D-3D-CNN for real-time crop defect detection. This network is the detection
    module of a real-time coffee-bean defect inspection algorithm (RT-CBDIA). The
    network consists of a 2D-CNN and a 3D-CNN, the former one is responsible to extract
    spatial features and the latter one is accountable for extraction of spectral
    features. Combining these two networks can boost feature extraction by providing
    robust and discriminative spectral-spatial features. The 3D-CNN is comprised of
    two convolution blocks with the same structure as in the 2D-CNN except that 3D
    convolutions and pooling layers are used. The two networks run simultaneously
    and their last pooling layers will be merged and fed to a FC layer and then a
    dropout layer to avoid overfitting. Finally, a softmax layer determines each crop
    health status. Likewise, Qi et al. [51] fully extracted spatial-spectral features
    by merging 2D- and 3D-CNN architectures using AttentionBlock [85] and Squeeze-and-Excitation
    (SE)-ResNet [25]. To accomplish this, the model first creates a neighborhood block
    of size 11×11×10 around a center pixel from the input image. Then, 2D convolution
    operations are used to extract spatial correlation features from the neighborhood
    block, and 3D convolution operations are used to capture spectral correlation
    features. The model uses four 2D convolutional layers and four 3D convolutional
    layers to capture feature maps of various spatial and spectral dimensions. By
    using different sizes of convolution kernels and downsampling steps, varied types
    of information can be captured. Finally, the extracted feature maps are fused
    together to create a final set of feature maps that contain valuable and pertinent
    information required for effective classification. Herein, AttentionBlock and
    SE-ResNet play important role, as outlined immediately below. An AttentionBlock
    is used to highlight important information in the fused spectral space feature
    map. It works by considering the similarity between each pixel in the feature
    map and weighting the relevant pixels with higher importance. This is achieved
    through a series of 2D convolutions with a kernel size of 1×1 to transform each
    pixel into an λ-dimensional vector, where λ represents the number of feature channels
    in the input tensor. The similarity between any two pixels is then calculated
    using the dot-product of their transformed vectors, and the results are weighted
    using a softmax function. The output of an AttentionBlockt is a feature map that
    emphasizes the relevant information while suppressing irrelevant information.
    This process allows AttentionBlocks to focus on the relevance between pixels in
    the entire feature map, rather than just the spatial range of the convolution
    kernel size used in traditional convolution and pooling operations. This results
    in better classification results with little computational complexity. In order
    to enhance the representational power of CNNs, SE modules as a type of attention
    mechanism can adaptively recalibrate the feature maps. It does so by capturing
    channel-wise feature dependencies through a squeeze operation, followed by an
    excitation operation that learns how to weight the importance of each feature
    map. This mechanism allows the model to pay more attention to salient channel
    features and disregards the less significant ones. By integrating AttentionBlocks
    and SE-ResNet, the network of Qi et al. [51] can better generalize in classification
    and achieve higher accuracy. Moreover, in the context of detection of two similar
    crop diseases that are indistinguishable to the naked eyes, a recent study by
    Jia et al. [28] developed a new network called Y-Net. The Y-Net model takes in
    10×10×203 hyperspectral data cubes as input and it consists of a channel attention
    mechanism, a band selection module with auxiliary classifier, a 3D-2D-CNN architecture,
    and a classification module. A CNN architecture is employed to conduct the band
    selection, where 1×1 1D convolutions are assembled to modify the parameters of
    the convolutional kernel in the early phase of the network training. The magnitude
    of the weight of the convolution kernel is indicative of the relevance of the
    band, with greater absolute weight values signifying more distinctive bands. The
    use of group convolution helps in preventing any hindrance from nearby bands,
    while the ReLU activation function is adopted for fast network convergence without
    the problem of saturation. The output of this step will be given to an auxiliary
    classifier that enables early-stage weight updating in the band selection block.
    The auxiliary classifier module updates the loss function of the Y-Net model:
    (5) where y is the ground truth label, is the predicted label, and θ and β are
    hyperparameters that control the trade-off between the two losses and the sparsity
    of the band selection module, respectively. is the weight of the band in the band
    selection module and n is the number of total bands. The loss is a combination
    of the cross entropy losses of the final classifier and the auxiliary classifier
    and the sum of the weights of the band selection module. The purpose of this combination
    is to control the classification accuracy while updating the weights of the band
    selection layer. The adjustment factor θ gradually decreases as the number of
    training iterations increases. The presence of this adjustment factor enables
    the Y-Net model to update the weights in the band selection module in the early
    stages of training and gradually shift towards training the final classifier to
    learn a more accurate classification model. Additionally, the auxiliary classifier
    helps to constrain the weight sparsity of the band selection module, ensuring
    that the score of unimportant features is close to zero. The results of Jia et
    al. [28] show that by removing nonessential and nondiscriminative bands the accuracy
    of the Y-Net model increases and reduces the model size and the number of parameters.
    Moreover, since the band selection module is integrated into an overall architecture,
    the training time does not significantly increase. 7. Visualization techniques
    for HSI classification decisions Visualization techniques can be employed to observe
    the contribution of pixels in the classification decision. These techniques allow
    us to identify the pixel locations associated with the most important spectral
    bands that play a crucial role in the final classification results. Saliency maps
    [64] are one of the essential and traditional visualization tools to identify
    the most sensitive regions (crucial pixels) in an image with respect to a model''s
    predictions. This technique works by computing the gradient of the output class
    score with respect to the input image. This gradient represents how much each
    pixel in the input image contributes to the final classification decision. Next,
    the absolute values of these gradients are summed across the channels to obtain
    a saliency map, which highlights the most salient regions of the input image for
    the predicted class. For example, Nagasubramanian et al. [45] discovered that
    saliency maps can help to locate the most sensitive pixel locations in infected
    crop images, which are often the severely infected areas. Conversely, both healthy
    and infected crop images had saliency map gradients that were primarily focused
    around the mid-region of the crop stem, highlighting the stem''s importance in
    crop classification. Moreover, Cao et al. [10] observed that the significant wavelengths
    extracted by RF from raw HSI data overlaps the saliency-sensitive wavelengths.
    More importantly, saliency maps can determine significant wavelengths for classification
    which are not extracted by RF. Another visual explanation technique for CNN decision
    is the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) [59]. It was introduced
    as an improvement over CAM [88]. CAM involves modifying a pre-existing CNN model
    by replacing the final FC layer with a global average pooling layer, which retains
    essential channel information while reducing the spatial dimensions. This modification
    enables the utilization of feature maps from the preceding layer. By applying
    learned weights to these feature maps through global average pooling, CAM generates
    a map that highlights the crucial regions associated with the predicted category.
    However, CAM provides a coarse localization of the important regions within an
    image. It highlights the regions that contribute most to the predicted class,
    but it does not provide precise boundaries of those regions. To address this limitation,
    Grad-CAM was introduced as an extension to CAM. Grad-CAM enhances the CAM approach
    by incorporating gradient information. Similar to CAM, Grad-CAM also utilizes
    a global average pooling layer after the last convolutional layer to obtain importance
    scores for each channel in the feature maps. However, instead of learning separate
    linear models for each class, Grad-CAM calculates the gradients of the predicted
    class score with respect to the feature maps. These gradients are used to weigh
    the feature maps and enables Grad-CAM to identify more intricate features that
    play a significant role in the classification decision. In addition, there are
    further statistical techniques that help in analyzing the importance of individual
    features (spectral bands) of HSI data in a classification. Light Gradient Boosting
    Machine (LightGBM) [34], [19] is one of such methods that uses decision trees
    in calculating feature importance. It builds decision trees in a leaf-wise manner,
    meaning that the algorithm grows the tree by adding new leaves one at a time which
    is computationally faster compared to level-wise approach by selecting the best
    split based on the maximum reduction in loss function for all leaves in the tree.
    Therefore, LightGBM calculates the importance of each feature by evaluating how
    much it contributes to the reduction in loss function across all trees. The feature
    importance score is calculated by summing up the number of times a feature is
    used to split the data across all trees, weighted by the improvement in accuracy
    achieved by each split. Features that are used more frequently and result in larger
    improvements in accuracy are assigned higher importance scores. 8. Discussion
    and conclusion In this study, we conducted a comprehensive review of 3D-CNN-based
    models applied in the domain of agriculture using non-UAV-based HSI data. Our
    analysis delved into diseased and defective crops, focusing on the structures
    and efficiencies of the models, the quantity of datasets utilized, and the necessary
    preprocessing steps. This review indicates the advantages of 3D-CNNs in capturing
    spatial-spectral information within hyperspectral data, enabling them to outperform
    1D- and 2D-CNN in hyperspectral image classification. With the aim of assisting
    computer vision experts and agriculture-domain researchers in tackling HSI classification
    tasks for crops experiencing stress, this comprehensive review provides valuable
    insights and guidance. In general, HSI holds great potential for detecting subtle
    changes in crop growth and development, making it a promising technique for diagnosing
    crop diseases and defects. Despite this potential, our study indicates that there
    is still limited research conducted that use 3D-CNNs in this context. Furthermore,
    the studies that are performed are often very application-specific and it is unknown
    how well the performed methods and models generalize to a broader range of applications.
    We identify three major challenges that must be overcome to achieve a broader
    adoption of HSI in general and the usage of 3D-CNN for HSI classification problems:
    limited availability of hyperspectral data, computational complexity of 3D-CNN
    models, and the costs of hyperspectral imaging hardware. In the following we address
    each of these challenges in more detail and offer ideas on how to overcome or
    avoid them. Limited availability of varied hyperspectral data on diseased and
    defective crops presents a significant challenge for researchers, farmers, and
    stakeholders in the agriculture industry who rely on data to make informed decisions.
    The lack of data in this area of the research hampers efforts to understand the
    extent of the problem and develop effective solutions. It makes it difficult to
    track the progress and success of any initiatives aimed at improving crop health
    and reducing the prevalence of disease and defects. To address this issue, there
    is a need for increased investment in data collection and data sharing, as it
    has been done in the past, for example, for RGB-data (e.g., Beck et al. [4], [3]).
    Large-scale HSI data collection and publicly available datasets will allow research
    groups to develop the next generation of models, even if they have no access to
    the otherwise required hardware and plant material. Even with small datasets there
    are also techniques to models beyond the specific application case they had been
    trained on. In recent years, transfer learning and active learning techniques
    have been increasingly used together to tackle the challenges posed by limited
    data. By leveraging knowledge from pre-existing models, transfer learning can
    enhance the accuracy of models trained on limited HSI data. On the other hand,
    active learning involves selecting and annotating informative samples to improve
    the effectiveness of models trained on small HSI datasets. By combining the two
    techniques, transfer learning and active learning can address the bottleneck of
    limited HSI data and enable the development of robust 3D-CNN models capable of
    accurately classifying HSI data. The computational complexity of 3D-CNN models
    is a barrier for their deployment in the field, for example, in edge computing
    devices or even as part of an embedded system in UAVs or agricultural equipment.
    Real-time diagnosis could significantly enable farmers to quickly detect and respond
    to disease outbreaks, which can help to prevent the spread of disease and reduce
    crop losses. This requires, however, researchers to explore ways to optimize their
    models for speed and efficiency, particularly their memory-footprint. This can
    be achieved through advancing the capabilities of single board computers, particularly
    their GPU and AI accelerators, on the one side, as well as developing lightweight
    models on the other side, for example, by reduction of used bands or grouping
    of bands into indices. Identifying the spectral bands that are most informative
    for detecting a varied range of diseases and defects would play an important role
    in reducing the model''s training computational time, decreasing the number of
    parameters, achieving higher accuracy and generating a more lightweight model.
    Despite the valuable insights hyperspectral imaging provides regarding the condition
    and health of crops, deploying this technology is relatively costly compared to
    RGB and multispectral imaging technologies. The higher expense is primarily attributed
    to the increased processing power required to analyze the HSI data and the extensive
    range of spectrum offered by hyperspectral cameras. One approach to consider for
    cost reduction is the limitation of the number of bands in hyperspectral cameras,
    as not all spectral bands may be equally crucial for disease and defect detection.
    Therefore, instead of having an imaging device that supports full range of wavelengths
    from the visible to the infrared spectrum, we can deploy imaging systems that
    work with essential wavelengths rather than hundreds of spectral bands. In this
    respect, some companies already provide the facility to design customized multispectral
    systems, which work with bands that had been identified to be the most discriminative
    (see Hamila et al. [22] for a 3D-CNN model training advantage of this approach).
    Therefore, developing methods for identifying the most informative spectral bands
    would also be cost beneficial. Furthermore, by leveraging Machine Learning as
    a Service (MLaaS) platforms [48], the need for required infrastructure to process
    HSI data using 3D-CNN can be eliminated. Additionally, leading MLaaS providers
    can integrate pre-built 3D-CNN models into their offerings for training HSI data,
    thereby reducing the time and effort required for model development, especially
    for individuals in the agriculture domain who may have limited machine learning
    expertise. In summary, the application of 3D-CNNs with hyperspectral data for
    disease and defective crop detection is a promising research area with several
    open research questions. Collecting and sharing HSI data on scale, identifying
    informative spectral bands, developing transfer and active learning techniques,
    and implementing light-weight architectures are some of the key research areas
    that can be considered for future work. The advancement of this research will
    lead to more accurate and efficient disease and defective crop detection, which
    can have significant impacts on the agricultural industry. CRediT authorship contribution

  description: Harmful algal blooms (HABs) diminish the utility of reservoirs for
    drinking water supply, irrigation, recreation, and ecosystem service provision.
    HABs decrease water quality and are a significant health concern in surface water
    bodies. Near real-time monitoring of HABs in reservoirs and small water bodies
    is essential to understand the dynamics of turbidity and HAB formation. This study
    uses satellite imagery to remotely sense chlorophyll-a concentrations (chl-a),
    phycocyanin concentrations, and turbidity in two reservoirs, the Grand Lake O′
    the Cherokees and Hudson Reservoir, OK, USA, to develop a tool for near real-time
    monitoring of HABs. Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery from 2013 to 2017 and from
    2015 to 2020 were used to train and test three different models that include multiple
    regression, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest regression (RFR).
    Performance was assessed by comparing the three models to estimate chl-a, phycocyanin,
    and turbidity. The results showed that RFR achieved the best performance, with
    R2 values of 0.75, 0.82, and 0.79 for chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin, while
    multiple regression had R2 values of 0.29, 0.51, and 0.46 and SVR had R2 values
    of 0.58, 0.62, and 0.61 on the testing datasets, respectively. This paper examines
    the potential of the developed open-source satellite remote sensing tool for monitoring
    reservoirs in Oklahoma to assess spatial and temporal variations in surface water

    Monitoring reservoirs in near real time using remote sensing provides water quality
    information integrated into early warning systems for harmful algal blooms. 1
    INTRODUCTION Nutrient runoff from agriculture, animal feeding operations, and
    wastewater treatment plants promote the growth of algae and cyanobacteria or blue-green
    algae (BGA). Extreme rainfall events transport large amounts of pollutants including
    sediments and nutrients into surface water bodies and reservoirs that adversely
    affect ecosystem health and cause harmful algal blooms (HABs). Sedimentation,
    sediment resuspension, and eutrophication diminish the utility of reservoirs and
    negatively impact human health (Zhang et al., 2020). Increasing agricultural activity
    to meet demands of growing populations and excessive use of fertilizers exacerbate
    HAB events, resulting in water impairment issues. HABs cause taste and odor problems
    in drinking water due to the release of geosmin (Antoniou et al., 2005; Deng et
    al., 2017; van der Ploeg & Boyd, 1991). The decay of HABs creates ecological dead
    zones due to the depletion of dissolved oxygen in surface water, which create
    unfavorable conditions for the sustenance of flora and fauna in water bodies (Bennett,
    2017; Chislock et al., 2013; Zohdi & Abbaspour, 2019). HABs can produce toxins
    in water which pose health risks to mammals when consumed (Anderson, 2009; Park
    et al., 2017). Because of the toxic risks of exposure and increasing occurrences
    of HAB events, there is a critical need for novel water quality monitoring technologies
    to understand HAB formation and nutrient transport in surface water. Successful
    monitoring of water bodies requires observations of spatial and temporal trends
    in turbidity and HAB formation. Existing satellite technologies provide spatial
    and temporal observations that can be used to study water quality in inland water
    bodies. For instance, Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 orbit the Earth in sun-synchronous
    near-polar orbit with a 16-day repeat cycle, where they collect multispectral
    imagery of the Earth''s surface (Blackwell, 1979; Carpenter & Carpenter, 1983;
    Masek et al., 2020). Landsat-8 has two instruments, including the Operational
    Land Imager (OLI) and Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS). Landsat-8 imagery has been
    widely used to monitor water quality, including chlorophyll-a (chl-a), turbidity,
    mineral suspended solids, and surface temperature (Fraser, 1998; Harrington et
    al., 1992; Olmanson et al., 2016; Potes et al., 2012; Silva et al., 2016; Trinh
    et al., 2017; Watanabe et al., 2015). Similarly, the Sentinel-2 mission uses two
    satellites, S2A and S2B, in sun-synchronous orbit, which are phased at 180° to
    each other to collect multispectral data of the Earth''s surface. Sentinel-2 satellites
    have 13 spectral bands with variable spatial resolutions from 10 to 60 m. The
    frequency of revisit time of each Sentinel-2 satellite is 10 days and the combined
    constellation revisit is 5 days. Multispectral data from these platforms provide
    the reflectance of water surfaces at spectral regions beyond the visible range,
    which enhances the possibilities to monitor water quality trends in space and
    time. For instance, algal pigments including chl-a and phycocyanin reflect electromagnetic
    radiation that can be estimated using remote sensing. Previously, remote sensing
    methods have been used to estimate the concentrations of chl-a, turbidity, and
    phycocyanin using satellite data in the oceans and reservoirs (Babin et al., 1996;
    Brezonik et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2013; Chipman et al., 2004; Crósta & Moore,
    1989; Hansen & Williams, 2018; Kutser et al., 2006; Ortiz-Casas & Peña-Martinez,
    1989; Porcar-Castell et al., 2014). Monitoring reservoirs and inland water bodies
    is important to ensure provision of freshwater to households (Afroz et al., 2014).
    Besides acting as potential water sources, inland water bodies provide recreation
    and ecosystem provision services for local economies (Cowx et al., 2010; Ward
    et al., 1996). In the United States (U.S.), there are around 90,000 dams that
    have reservoirs that can be monitored remotely using satellite sensors for water
    quality (Song et al., 2021). The Grand Lake O′ the Cherokees (Grand Lake) and
    Hudson Reservoirs are located in northeastern Oklahoma where they are monitored
    and operated by the Grand River Dam Authority (GRDA). Recently, Grand Lake has
    experienced an increase in HAB outbreaks, including shutdowns on the fourth of
    July weekend in 2011 and June 2021, which significantly affected the local economy
    (Mason & Triplett, 2016). Increased occurrences of HABs in Oklahoma and monitoring
    needs for water resource managers like GRDA necessitate near real-time HAB detection
    tools based on remote sensing. The main objective of this study was to develop
    a remote sensing tool to monitor for HABs in near real time (as soon as Level-2
    satellite data are available online) for inland water bodies. To achieve this
    objective, empirical relationships were built using the surface reflectance values
    from both the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites and in situ data collected at
    Grand Lake and Hudson Reservoir. For active HAB monitoring, an open-source software
    tool in Python was developed that acquires satellite images from the web, extracts
    values of pixels within each reservoir, and estimates water quality data, including
    chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin concentrations. This software can be used to
    visualize present and previous HABs in GRDA reservoirs. The utility of the Landsat-8
    and Sentinel-2 satellites for remote sensing was compared for efficacy in HAB
    estimation. These tools can help guide HAB advisories by automating the image
    data acquisition, estimating water quality parameters, and providing observations
    of HAB dynamics. 2 MATERIALS AND METHODS 2.1 Description of the study area The
    study area includes Grand Lake and Hudson Reservoir located in northeastern Oklahoma.
    Detailed information of Grand Lake and Hudson Reservoir involving storage capacity
    and area are provided in Table 1. Grand Lake has a total area of 188.2 km2, a
    mean depth of 11.0 m, a maximum depth of 40.5 m (OWRB, 2009). Three significant
    rivers, including Neosho, Spring, and Elk, drain into Grand Lake. The lake spans
    parts of Craig, Delaware, Mayes, and Ottawa counties in Oklahoma, making it the
    third largest lake in terms of both surface area and water-holding capacity in
    the state (Hunter & Labriola, 2019). The watershed of Grand Lake contains cultivated
    agriculture, livestock, and wastewater treatment plants that act as sources of
    HAB nutrient precursors. Nutrient loadings into Grand Lake vary due to differences
    in land management practices across its many sub-watersheds. In Grand Lake, Horse
    Creek Cove is a point of interest in testing remote sensing methods, because most
    of the HAB events start in this area during the summer months when nutrient-rich
    runoff from agricultural sources and other land use in the Horse Creek Watershed
    flows into the lake. Overall land use in the watershed consists of 57% grassland
    (including planted pasture and natural grassland), 20% agricultural land, 6% developed
    land, and 3% surface water and wetlands. Hudson Reservoir is located in Mayes
    County in the Arkansas River Basin on Neosho River. It is the fourteenth largest
    reservoir in Oklahoma and supplies water to public and private stakeholders authority
    (GRDA, 2009). Hudson Reservoir receives water mainly from releases of Grand Lake
    but is also fed by other tributaries originating in Oklahoma and Arkansas. The
    study areas of both Grand Lake and Hudson Reservoirs are shown in Figure 1. TABLE

    Water quality Grand Lake and Hudson Reservoir have been sampled for water quality
    parameters by GRDA using EXO-1 and EXO-2 multiparameter sondes regularly since
    2011. The in situ data collected by GRDA were used to develop remote sensing algorithms
    for estimating chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin at Grand Lake and Hudson Reservoir
    using the spectral imagery from Landsat-8 since 2013 and Sentintel-2 since 2015
    as described in Section 5. Observations of in situ water quality from Grand Lake
    and Hudson Reservoir were collected as part of the GRDA water quality monitoring
    program. Multi-parameter water quality probes developed by Yellow Springs Instruments
    (YSI) were used to measure chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin. EXO-1 and EXO-2
    sondes with water quality probes were assembled, prepared, and calibrated according
    to procedures detailed in the instrument''s operation manual (XYLEM, 2019). All
    sampling sites used to collect in-situ water quality data for both Grand Lake
    and Hudson reservoirs are shown in Figure 2. Parameters used to build the remote
    sensing tool include the chl-a concentration in μg/L, turbidity in NTU, and phycocyanin
    concentration in RFU. For model building, in situ water quality data within ±5 days
    of satellite data acquisition for chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin were utilized.
    All in situ sensor data utilized in this research were collected within 3 feet
    of the surface. FIGURE 2 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Locations of in situ
    sampling sites in reservoirs used in this study. 2.3 Satellite data Satellite
    imagery was obtained from both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 and co-located with in-situ
    observations for development of remote sensing algorithms for chl-a, turbidity,
    and phycocyanin. The OLI and TIRS are suitable to assess water quality in surface
    water bodies such as lakes, rivers, and coastal marine zones. The OLI measures
    the reflectivity of Earth''s surface across nine spectral bands, which include
    the panchromatic band; the ultra-blue coastal aerosol band; the blue, green, and
    red bands; the near infrared (NIR) band; the two shortwave infrared bands (SWIR1
    and SWIR2); and the cirrus band. These bands have spatial resolution at 30-m on
    the ground, except the panchromatic band, which is provided at 15-m resolution.
    The Landsat TIRS has two thermal spectral bands that have a spatial resolution
    of 100 m. Sentinel-2 is an Earth observation mission from the Copernicus program
    to acquire satellite imagery with spatial resolution ranging from 10 to 60 m on
    the ground. Currently, the two Sentinel satellites, S2A and S2B, collect imagery
    with 13 spectral bands, which include the blue, green, red, and NIR bands at 10-m
    resolution; the vegetation red edge, narrow NIR, and SWIR bands at 20-m resolution;
    and the water vapor and cirrus bands at 60-m resolution. Details about the Landsat-8
    and Sentinel-2 bands used in this study are shown in Table 2 and in the supplemental
    document in Tables S1 and S2. TABLE 2. Spectral bands with band wavelength used

    including multiple regression, support vector regression (SVR), and random forest
    regression (RFR) were used to develop algorithms for estimating chl-a concentrations,
    turbidity, and phycocyanin concentrations from the co-located observations of
    reflectance and in situ water quality. Since the chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin
    data were not normally distributed, the data were log-transformed (Figure 5) to
    make the distribution closer to normal. Regression models, which are widely used
    to associate algal pigments and water quality parameters with spectral signatures
    of satellites, were then used with these data to minimize the sum of the squared
    errors using the cost function shown in Equation (1). (1) In regression, given
    a training dataset containing dependent variables yi and independent variables
    xi denoted {xi, yi} ∈ , is the function used in the regression for prediction,
    n is the sample size, and v is the vector that defines the function f with same
    dimension; that is, the number of parameters in the vector v and the function
    f must be the same. If the noise generated in the predicted data do not follow
    a Gaussian distribution, then data cleaning to remove outliers and minimize the
    error between predicted and expected values is needed to achieve good model performance.
    For the multiple regression algorithm, the dependent variables included chl-a
    and turbidity, while the independent variables included the spectral bands from
    Landsat-8 OLI and TIRS. A model was developed using multiple regression to find
    a relationship between each dependent variable and the independent variables using
    different band ratios and band combinations as shown in Table S3 with Landsat-8
    images. Multiple regression models with band combinations have difficulty in quantifying
    low chl-a samples and underpredict high chl-a concentrations (Boucher et al.,
    2018). Since algal dynamics in surface water are nonlinear, machine learning models
    including SVR, and RFR were also analyzed as an alternative approach to develop
    remote sensing algorithms for the water quality parameters. SVR is an extension
    concept of support vector machines, which are applied to regression statistical
    analysis. SVR has been successfully applied to develop machine learning algorithms
    for nonlinear, chaotic systems including alternating current cycles, urban traffic
    flows, medical applications, and stock markets (Agarwal, 2011; Alipour et al.,
    2022; Das & Padhy, 2012; Hong et al., 2011; Khan & Zubek, 2008; Liang et al.,
    2010; Weng et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2008). In SVR, the linear
    loss function shown in Equation (2) was used to evaluate model performance (Drucker
    et al., 1996; Vapnik et al., 1995): (2) where L is the loss function in SVR, y
    is the expected value, f(x, v) is the predicted regression function, and is the
    error tolerance. The loss function takes a value 0 when L ≤ , and otherwise has
    a value of when L >  . In this study, the predicted chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin
    were tested with nonlinear machine learning models that required a kernel function
    for SVR. Typically, a kernel function transforms features from original to higher
    dimensions to improve group separation of expected data around a hyper-plane.
    An optimal parameterization was determined by iterating through available kernel
    functions including the linear, polynomial, gaussian, sigmoid, spectral angle,
    and radial basis functions (RBFs). The RBF kernel was selected after testing all
    the available kernel functions to give an optimum prediction for chl-a, turbidity,
    and phycocyanin. The RBF kernel was used to predict water quality and has been
    widely used in regression problems (Chitralekha & Shah, 2010; Nadadoor et al.,
    2012). An RFR is an ensemble machine learning algorithm that contains a large
    number of decision trees such that the algorithm obtains a prediction based on
    a consensus of responses in all the trees. The sample data were partitioned to
    random subsets for predicting chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin. RFR can handle
    large datasets and can predict co-related water quality data without decreasing
    prediction accuracy. In multispectral imagery, there is strong correlation between
    many bands. The RFR algorithm uses numerous de-correlated decision trees randomly
    and assigns weightings based on the performance of each tree, using Gini impurity.
    The RFR algorithm has built-in feature importance method that can be computed
    using Gini impurity. The feature importance data provide important insights into
    the significance of the various spectral bands to remotely sense the water quality
    parameters. Although RFR seems to be a promising model, it is important to check
    if the model is overfitting the training dataset. To prevent overfitting the trained
    dataset, both k-fold cross validation and hyperparameter tuning were performed
    on different training and validation datasets to check RFR model performance.
    3.2 Structure and workflow of python tool The software developed in this study
    is written in Python 3.7. Python is free, open-source, and extensively utilized
    for scientific applications because of its object-oriented, interpretive, and
    interactive programming features (Lutz, 2013; Millman & Aivazis, 2011). Python
    possesses a wide range of extension libraries such as the Geospatial Data Abstraction
    Library, Numeric Python, and Scientific Python that were utilized to ensure smooth
    operation of the procedure to extract imagery and analyze the data. The Google
    Earth Engine Python Application Program Interface (API) was used to acquire Level-2
    Landsat-8 imagery of the study area. Similarly, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS)
    API was used to obtain Sentinel-2 Level-1 images from Google Cloud Services. Landsat-8
    Level-2 images were obtained using spatial bounds for the lakes in scenarios where
    the cloud cover was less than 10% of the image. Geographic coordinates (latitude
    and longitude) were provided as a Comma Separated Value files such that the Python
    software can find the satellite images within the bound spatial coordinates. In
    the case of Sentinel-2, after acquiring the Level-1 images, Sen2Cor was used to
    process the single date Level-1 top of atmosphere images to Level-2 bottom of
    atmosphere or surface reflectance products (Main-Knorn et al., 2017). Based on
    the geographic coordinates and in situ sampling dates, the software selects raster
    images from the available data for each mission, and then prints the appropriate
    candidates within the spatial bounds of the study area with cloud cover less than
    the specified preference of 10%. The Level-2 data obtained from Earth Engine API
    are atmospherically corrected and have five visible bands, two shortwave bands,
    and one thermal infrared band. In total, there are 19 bands available from the
    Level-2 images, which are shown in Table S1. The Sentinel-2 constellation has
    two satellites operated by the European Space Agency. Both the satellites S2A
    and S2B carry multispectral instruments that image the Earth both in the visible
    and infrared spectrum. The resampled Level-2 images with Sen2Cor have bands with
    spatial resolutions of 10, 20, and 60 m. The 20-m spatial resolution is used to
    build the remote sensing tool to measure the concentration of phycocyanin. A detailed
    description of the bands after processing to Level-2 with surface reflectance
    using Sentinel-2 is shown in Table S2. After acquiring and processing the satellite
    images for both the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 satellites, the surface reflectance
    values were extracted at the in-situ sampling location that most closely matched
    the sampling time (±5 days). All the surface reflectance values of the reservoirs
    were parsed based on the availability of in situ water quality data. The surface
    reflectance data obtained were split to train the algorithms and test the performance
    of the models using the cost functions for initial model selection. The statistical
    training process involves improving the model performance based on using the error
    metrics, including root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of determination
    (R2). In addition to error metrics, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning
    were used to improve the performance of the remote sensing algorithms. The details
    of the model calibration, feature selection, and hyperparameter tuning are discussed
    in Section 12. The band combinations/band ratios with multiple regression, SVR,
    and RFR did not improve validation performance (Table S3), consistent with the
    findings of previous research (Sudheer et al., 2006). Therefore, based on the
    superior model performance with the initial test/train and split, the RFR model
    was selected for subsequent testing using k-fold cross-validation. After gaining
    confidence that the RFR did not overfit the training dataset, it was selected
    as the final model to be used in the remote sensing tool. The steps involved in
    developing the remote sensing software are shown in Figure 3. FIGURE 3 Open in
    figure viewer PowerPoint Operational structure of the software. API, Application
    Program Interface; ESPA, EROS Science Processing Architecture. The information
    required to use the remote sensing tool requires the user to register on Google
    Cloud and Earth Resources Observation and Sciences (EROS). In addition to login
    information to the publicly available satellite imagery, users must provide the
    desired cloud cover (in percentage), geographic coordinates, and temporal information
    (start date and end date) of the imagery to select the desired satellite images
    within the region of interest. In addition, a boundary shapefile of the waterbody
    must be provided by the user to clip the region of interest and remove unwanted
    regions in the raster. Using all the input information provided by the user, the
    tool searches publicly available datasets from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery
    in Google Cloud and downloads them to the local computer. The spectral reflectance
    values in the region of interest are then extracted by the software. The RFR algorithm
    is applied to the clipped region of interest to produce heat maps of water quality
    parameters, and the unwanted pixels of land are masked by the tool. The masking
    of land was performed using the raster of crop-specific land cover map from Cropland
    Data Layer. In addition to land pixels, the erroneous pixels corresponding to
    clouds and cloud shadows are removed using QA bands. Using the surface reflectance
    values of water, the software estimates the concentrations of chl-a, turbidity,
    and phycocyanin to produce gridded images of water quality. The gridded estimates
    on the satellite raster can be used to provide HAB advisories for further analysis
    based on the concentrations of chl-a and phycocyanin as shown in Figure 4. FIGURE
    4 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Logic for classification of algal blooms based
    on satellite imagery using World Health Organization alert levels of chl-a and
    cyanobacterial cells. EROS, Earth Resources Observation and Sciences. The criteria
    to establish a HAB alert is decided based on World Health Organization (WHO) alert
    levels of chl-a and BGA concentrations more than 50 μg/L and 100,000 cells/mL
    respectively (Ahn et al., 2007; Izydorczyk et al., 2009; United States Environmental
    Protection Agency, 2019). Based on a study conducted in Klamath River, California,
    phycocyanin monitoring over 5 years from 2008 to 2013 resulted in a mathematical
    relationship between phycocyanin (RFU) and BGA (cells/mL) (Laurel & Kann, 2016).
    The mathematical relationship between phycocyanin and BGA is shown in Equation
    (3). (3) Communications and a previous study from YSI confirmed that the conversion
    of phycocyanin to BGA on their sondes is based on Equation (3) (YSI, 2012). Phycocyanin
    measurements from the YSI Exo sondes were used to estimate phycocyanin concentration,
    but Equation (3) is used in our software to provide a warning advisory criteria
    for GRDA that was confirmed by further laboratory testing performed that resulted
    in Grand Lake shutdown of 2021. The detailed information on alert concentration
    levels of algal pigments is shown in Table 3. TABLE 3. Recreational action levels
    for chl-a, cyanobacteria, microcystin, and phycocyanin levels. Probability of
    acute health effects Chl-a (μg/L) Cyanobacteria (cells/mL) Estimated corresponding

    to 47 High ≥50 >100,000 >20 >47 4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION The distribution of chl-a,
    turbidity, and phycocyanin from the in situ observations in the study area is
    shown in Figure 5. The chl-a concentrations used in this study ranged from 0 to
    60 μg/L, turbidity ranged from 0 to 150 NTU, and phycocyanin ranged from 0 to
    53 RFU. Based on the WHO guidelines for recreational water, chl-a concentrations
    more than 50 μg/L and BGA of 200,000 cells/mL indicate a HAB event that requires
    further testing of water samples in the laboratory for toxicity (microcystins).
    The relationship between phycocyanin and BGA in Equation (3) can be used to estimate
    the cyanobacterial cells from phycocyanin concentrations. Both chl-a and turbidity
    can be remotely sensed using Landsat-8 satellite imagery. Landsat-8 satellite
    data since the mission launched in 2013 were compiled to match 1709 in situ observations
    for chl-a and turbidity in the study area. Sentinel-2 data were compiled to remotely
    sense phycocyanin that were matched to 1095 data points from 2015 to 2020. The
    in situ water quality data were positively skewed for chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin
    as shown in Figure 5. Each of the three water quality parameters were log-transformed
    such that the fit is close to a Gaussian or normal distribution used for algorithm
    development. However, nonparametric machine learning models like SVR and RFR do
    not need data to fit a normal distribution. FIGURE 5 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Whisker and distribution plots of in situ water quality parameters. After transforming
    the in situ data to a Gaussian distribution, algorithms that translate observations
    from single bands and band combinations into water quality parameters were generated
    using co-located pixels based on coordinates. The bands used in building and testing
    regression algorithms are shown in Table 2 for each water quality parameter and
    satellite mission. For remote sensing of chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin, features
    were extracted using individual bands from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2, respectively.
    4.1 Multicollinearity of multispectral bands of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 Some
    of the multispectral bands of both Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 images are strongly
    correlated, which causes data redundancy. Therefore, highly correlated bands with
    coefficient of determination (R2) of greater than 0.9 were dropped. Figure 6 shows
    the correlation matrix between all the observations from the Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2
    imagery. The bands that were dropped included Ultra-Blue, Coastal Aerosol (SR_B1),
    and Shortwave Infrared 2 (SR_B7) while estimating chl-a concentrations using Landsat-8.
    Similarly, surface reflectance bands including Ultra-Blue, Coastal aerosol (SR_B1),
    and Shortwave Infrared 1 (SR_B6) bands were dropped for estimating turbidity concentrations
    using Landsat-8. For phycocyanin estimation, surface reflectance bands including
    Red Edge 3 (B7) and Shortwave Infrared 1 (B11) were dropped while using Sentinel-2
    imagery for remote sensing. In addition to surface reflectance bands, surface
    temperature bands were retained because surface temperature is highly correlated
    to chl-a and helps in detecting both chl-a and turbidity concentrations which
    are discussed in Section 11 (Harod et al., 2021). The bands used in machine learning
    algorithms for model calibration were selected based on feature importance as
    discussed in Section 11. FIGURE 6 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Correlation
    matrices between water quality parameters, Landsat-8 (top) and Sentinel-2 (bottom)
    bands. 4.2 Feature selection for regression Feature selection for regression was
    done based on the feature importance scores determined by the RFR (Belgiu & Drăguţ,
    2016; Esteban et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2020). All three regression algorithms
    are further investigated (multiple regression, SVR, and RFR), and RFR estimated
    the water quality parameters best compared to the other models as explained in
    detail in Section 12. The importance of computed bands based on Gini impurity
    including the surface temperature bands of Landsat-8 plays an important role in
    predicting chl-a and turbidity, as shown in Figure 7. FIGURE 7 Open in figure
    viewer PowerPoint Feature importance using RFR. Besides high correlation, the
    surface reflectance band Ultra-Blue Coastal Aerosol (SR_B1) was dropped because
    of low feature importance, with a Gini impurity close to zero. The surface temperature
    band B10 (ST_B10) was retained for algorithm development because it has been previously
    been used to remotely sense the concentrations of chl-a in water (Allan et al.,
    2011; Tanaka et al., 2004). For phycocyanin, the Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT)
    band of Sentinel-2 was dropped because aerosols in air do not aid in detecting
    phycocyanin pigments. The Red Edge 3 (B7) band was dropped because of low feature
    importance and high correlations between Red Edge 2 (B6) and Red Edge (B7). Also,
    between Shortwave Infrared 1 (B11) and Shortwave Infrared 2 (B12) bands, B11 was
    dropped because of low feature importance and high correlation. However, retaining
    one of the shortwave infrared bands (B12) was important because they help in detecting
    cyanobacterial blooms (Yan et al., 2018). Most of the remote sensing methods predicted
    phycocyanin in the spectral range from 600 to 754 nm (Ogashawara et al., 2013;
    O''Shea et al., 2021; Yacobi et al., 2015). However, SWIR bands have been less
    susceptible to turbidity in detecting algal pigments and distinguish surface cyanobacterial
    blooms and macrophytes (Mansaray et al., 2021; Oyama et al., 2015). Therefore,
    the B12 band was retained in building the remote sensing tool to estimate the
    phycocyanin pigment. 4.3 Machine learning algorithms for remote sensing of HABs
    and turbidity The data from Grand Lake and Hudson Reservoir were used to develop
    and test the three algorithms. Since the log transformed in situ chl-a, turbidity,
    and phycocyanin data were close to a normal distribution, standardization of all
    the features was performed using a standard scaler to remove bias in model fitting
    (Ferreira et al., 2019; Garreta & Moncecchi, 2013). After scaling, the data were
    split for training and evaluation (70%/30%) of models before and after k-fold
    cross validation. As the three regression models were tested using different band
    combinations, the most efficient regression models were selected for chl-a, turbidity,
    and phycocyanin based on R2 values and kernel density plots as shown in Figure
    8. The kernel density plots in Figure 8 show that the multiple regression model
    explains roughly half of the relative variability in the concentrations of phycocyanin,
    chl-a, and turbidity regression (top), SVR (middle), and RFR (bottom). FIGURE
    8 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Kernel density plots for measured and predicted
    water quality data using multiple regression (top), support vector regression
    (SVR) (middle), and RFR (bottom). The SVR model overestimated the water quality
    parameters and did not have definitive peaks at mean concentrations of chl-a.
    Out of the three algorithms tested, the RFR estimated the water quality parameters
    closest to the measured testing dataset. The RFR algorithm was further tested
    on datasets for model performance based on RMSE and R2. Based on previous literature
    (Xie et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2015) and trials, the RBF kernel was used in SVR
    for remote sensing of water quality parameters. In both the testing and training
    cases, the R2 values for chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin using the SVR and RFR
    algorithms improved model performance compared to multiple regression, as shown
    in Table 4. The RFR model explained observations of chl-a, and phycocyanin slightly
    better for training than testing. A k-fold cross-validation using random search
    CV was used to validate the RFR model for different potential hyperparameters,
    including maximum depth, maximum features, samples split, and sample leaf (Bates
    et al., 2021; Krstajic et al., 2014). The results of the k-fold cross validation
    for the RFR model after validation are reported in Table 4 and explained in detail
    in Section 13. To visualize the relationship between measured and modeled water
    quality parameters, a scatter plot is shown in Figure 9. TABLE 4. Statistics metrics

    remotely sensed and in situ observations of water quality parameters using multiple
    regression (top), SVR (middle), and RFR (bottom). The best regression fit for
    all the water quality parameters was used to identify outliers which were carefully
    re-examined and removed if necessary, based on errors including sensor malfunction
    present in the database and cloud pixels identified by re-examining satellite
    images. The R2 values are displayed at the bottom of each subplot to illustrate
    the ability of the model to explain the data. The k-fold cross-validation, scatter
    plots, and statistical metrics demonstrate that RFR is the best machine learning
    method of the three approaches to remotely sense HABs using imagery from Landsat-8
    and Sentinel-2. 4.4 Calibration and validation of RFR The RFR model used in the
    development of remote sensing tool was validated using k-fold cross-validation.
    The baseline RFR model with initial train/test split provided satisfactory results
    with R2 of 0.75, 0.82, and 0.79 for the 30% validation datasets of chl-a, turbidity,
    and phycocyanin, respectively. The RFR model hyperparameters were tuned by altering
    the maximum tree depth, maximum number of features, minimum number of samples
    for a split, and minimum number of samples per leaf. A random search was used
    to define a grid of hyperparameter ranges and randomly sample from the grid, performing
    k-fold cross-validation with a combination of values (Schratz et al., 2019). The
    number of iterations performed was 100 with random grid selection. The RFR algorithm
    was tested with 100, 200, and 300 estimators, and 300 estimators were selected
    for further optimization of the RFR algorithm to avoid overfitting the training
    dataset. After random search cross-validation, the optimized hyperparameters for
    chl-a, phycocyanin, and turbidity were computed. As shown in Figure 10, the RMSE
    decreased until a tree depth of 12 was reached for predicting chl-a, phycocyanin,
    and turbidity using Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2. Tree depths of 12, 11, and 11 were
    selected for predicting chl-a, phycocyanin, and turbidity, respectively. Overfitting
    is always a problem while using nonparametric models like RFR to build remote
    sensing tools. Increasing the tree depth further can overfit the RFR model to
    the training dataset, as shown in Figure 10. The maximum number of features and
    minimum number of sample per split hyperparameters did not impact the model performance
    and were not investigated in detail. FIGURE 10 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint
    Hyperparameter tuning based on RMSE of the random forest (RF) estimators. 4.5
    Uncertainty of model simulation The uncertainty of the RFR model was assessed
    using visualization of the observed values within the prediction intervals of
    different conditional quantiles. The percentiles of the conditional quantiles
    used in this study were 99%, 95%, 50%, and 5%. The number of estimators and other
    hyperparameters used in assessing the uncertainty of the quantiles were the same
    as in RFR model. Figure 11 shows the 95% prediction interval, and 80%, 78%, and
    70% of the data fell into the 95% prediction interval for chl-a, turbidity, and
    phycocyanin, respectively. The length of the prediction intervals for turbidity
    was wider compared to chl-a and phycocyanin. This indicates that the RFR was able
    to make chl-a predictions using Landsat-8 with 10% more certainty when compared
    to phycocyanin with Sentinel-2. FIGURE 11 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Prediction
    intervals shown with observed data using quantile RFR. 4.6 RFR model selection
    Previous analysis of freshwater bodies using multiple regression found that chl-a
    and phycocyanin had large standard deviations from the mean, which required feature
    engineering to model the nonlinear behavior of HABs (Lee & Lee, 2018). However,
    feature engineering in this study did not improve the multiple regression statistics
    for the validation dataset as shown in Table S3. SVR has been shown to outperform
    multiple regression for chl-a and phycocyanin remote sensing in freshwater bodies
    (Chegoonian et al., 2021). However, RFR models have exhibited even better performance
    for estimating algal pigments including chl-a and phycocyanin compared to SVR
    (Li et al., 2018). The RFR models provided a good balance of results for the statistical
    metrics shown in Table 4 when tested for different k-fold cross validation. The
    factors influencing increased concentrations of chl-a and phycocyanin in freshwater
    bodies are nonlinear, so it makes sense that RFR adapts to the nonlinearities
    found in this study area. RFR models have previously been shown to forecast chl-a
    concentrations in freshwater bodies with the best forecasting results over 3 months
    (Yajima & Derot, 2017). Similarly, a study conducted in Lake Geneva found that
    RFR models have the capability of predicting the concentration of harmful cyanobacteria
    over a year (Derot et al., 2020). Based on model performance with random search
    k-fold cross-validation, and previous literature, RFR was selected as a model
    to translate the satellite observations into water quality parameters in this
    study area. The RFR algorithms tested have the capability to remotely sense algal
    pigments with good certainty, showing R2 values of more than 0.7, consistent with
    the previous research (Abdelmalik, 2018; Chen et al., 2021; Duan et al., 2012;
    Lailia et al., 2015; Olmanson et al., 2013; Toming et al., 2016). RFR models are
    able to be interpreted by visualizing the tree estimators used in the model building
    process. The first estimators of RFR algorithms developed in remote sensing of
    chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin are shown in Figure 12. Complete details of
    the estimators used in the RFR algorithms are shown in Figures S1–S3. FIGURE 12
    Open in figure viewer PowerPoint RF estimators.(..), growing nodes; SR, surface
    reflectance bands; ST, surface temperature bands; T, terminal node. 4.7 Remote
    sensing example during recent HAB events In Grand Lake, there were temporally
    coincident satellite flyovers during 4 days in 2021 including February 3, March
    7, April 8, and July 13, and a HAB event occurred in the late spring that ended
    in July 2021. The satellite data and RFR algorithm were used to remotely sense
    chl-a, and phycocyanin as shown in Figure 13. The concentrations of chl-a were
    higher on the edges of Horse Creek in the month of July which is confirmed by
    the field sampling personnel of GRDA. In addition to algal pigments, turbidity
    was also remotely sensed in Grand Lake using RFR. Figure 13 also shows that the
    Landsat 8 remote sensing estimates of turbidity were not affected by the surface
    chl-a and phycocyanin pigment concentrations. FIGURE 13 Open in figure viewer
    PowerPoint Remotely sensed chl-a (μg/L) (top), turbidity (NTU) (middle), phycocyanin
    (RFU) (bottom) using RFR algorithm developed in building the remote sensing tool.
    Since the temporal and spatial data obtained from satellites are relatively coarse,
    increasing number of satellite flyover and high-resolution in situ datasets could
    further improve water quality observation. Besides, there was a significant HAB
    event during June 2021 but due to significant cloud cover the imagery was not
    obtained by the remote sensing tool for further analysis. 4.8 Implications for
    water resource management The remote sensing software developed in this study
    automates the data acquisition, image processing, and visualization of water quality
    parameters for both Grand Lake and Hudson Reservoir in northeast Oklahoma. This
    tool is already integrated with an early warning HAB advisory system of Grand
    Lake that is currently being used by GRDA for reservoir monitoring purposes. Excessive
    sedimentation in the shallow regions of Horse Creek Cove in Grand Lake make it
    inaccessible by boat and difficult to retrieve physical samples during HAB outbreaks
    that are initiated in these shallow regions due to the interactions between shallow
    surface water and sediments. The remote sensing tool provides the concentration
    of chl-a and phycocyanin needed to assess the near-real-time conditions of the
    shallow regions of Grand Lake. With more in situ data of freshwater bodies across
    lakes and reservoirs in the U.S., the remote sensing tool can help lake managers,
    water quality managers, and people enjoying recreation in freshwater bodies to
    detect HAB outbreaks. The software is open-source and easily transferable to new
    study areas. In addition to remote sensing applications, this approach could be
    used to develop high-resolution surface water quality models with software such
    as the Environmental Fluid Dynamics Code to understand how sediment and nutrient
    influxes into lakes and reservoirs can cause HAB events in surface water bodies
    (Gao & Li, 2015; Xie, 2012). 4.9 Limitations and future research This research
    has several limitations and possible directions for future research. The software
    tool makes use of Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 data, which have moderate spatial and
    temporal resolutions when compared to alternatives such as Planetscope. A Landsat
    pixel, which is 900 m2, is susceptible to land-water mixed pixel problems, interference
    from other objects, and low intensity reflectance from low-concentrations of chl-a
    and phycocyanin. In addition, Landsat-8 has temporal resolution of 16 days during
    this time, several HAB events could occur that are not observed. Moreover, satellites
    are not helpful for species identification and detecting toxic algal scum formation
    within hours. Integrating unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned surface
    vehicles to collect remote sensing and in situ data would help address these issues.
    The tools we developed here could be expanded to use the raster datasets collected
    by UAVs and other satellites to remotely sense water quality data. Integration
    of these datasets and applying machine learning and artificial intelligence could
    potentially produce more reliable daily HABs advisories. 5 CONCLUSIONS Key conclusions
    from this research include: The RFR models were able to provide superior performance
    in estimating in-lake water quality parameters for Grand Lake compared to other
    models tested including multiple regression and SVR. The satellite remote sensing
    tool shows the change in concentrations of water quality parameters including
    chl-a, phycocyanin, and turbidity in Horse Creek Cove of Grand Lake from spring
    to summer of 2021. The remotely sensed chl-a and phycocyanin concentrations provided
    GRDA with information regarding spatial and temporal trends of HABs in Grand Lake
    during summer 2021. The spatial and temporal trends of algal pigment concentrations
    were used by GRDA to provide HAB advisories to public during summer 2021. The
    chl-a, turbidity, and phycocyanin levels in the reservoirs can be remotely sensed,
    which provides estimates in the shallow and inaccessible regions. This remote
    sensing approach could be extended to new water resources when large datasets
    of in situ data water quality data are available to estimate algal concentrations
    on the surface of freshwater bodies. Further improvement of the remote sensing
    technologies with the addition of new image datasets of satellites and calibration
    of models will make the monitoring of freshwater bodies more efficient. The chl-a
    and phycocyanin estimates from remote sensing tool can provide more insights into
    the incomplete historical data of HAB outbreaks spatially and temporally across
    the Grand Lake. The algal pigment concentrations across several years, when integrated
    with the climate data such as precipitation and temperature, can help understand
    the trends of HAB formation due to extreme weather events and answer question
    on how freshwater HABs form in reservoirs such as Grand Lake. AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS

  description: Agriculture is vital for economic sustainability and structural transformation
    in ASEAN. This paper explores the agricultural landscape in ASEAN, focusing on
    Thailand as a prominent rice producer. Challenges such as rural-urban migration,
    the ageing population employed in agriculture, and need to implement innovative
    solutions to strengthen regional food security are discussed. The primary focus
    is the innovative use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in ASEAN agriculture.
    UAVs revolutionize data collection through aerial photography, providing real-time
    insights into terrain, vegetation health, and soil composition. They enable informed
    decisions, optimize resource allocation, and streamline processes, resulting in
    cost savings. Equipped with sensors, UAVs precisely monitor crop health, irrigation
    efficiency, and early pest detection. Integration of advanced software and geographical
    information systems enhances data analysis and visualization. UAVs facilitate
    high-resolution mapping, offering detailed information on crop density, weed infestation,
    and disease outbreaks. This enables targeted interventions, reducing input costs
    and optimizing resource allocation. Multispectral or hyperspectral sensors provide
    insights into plant health, chlorophyll content, and water stress, enabling site-specific
    management strategies for improved sustainability. UAVs are affordable, versatile,
    and continuously advancing. They can potentially improve productivity, efficiency,
    and resource management in agriculture. In rice production, UAVs offer benefits
    like crop monitoring, precise spraying, and uniform seed spreading. They provide
    real-time information on crop health and pest infestations, enabling optimized
    management. Spray drones accurately apply pesticides, while seed-spreading drones
    enhance crop growth and save costs. UAV drones offer significant advantages in
    ASEAN agriculture, addressing workforce challenges and enhancing productivity.
    Supportive measures will lead to efficient UAV integration, enhancing sustainability
    and farmer livelihoods.

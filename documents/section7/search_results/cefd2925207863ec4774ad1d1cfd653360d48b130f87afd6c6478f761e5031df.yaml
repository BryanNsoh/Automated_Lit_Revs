  description: In rice-wheat cropping system the emerging Super Seeder (SS) is a tractor
    operated single pass solution to incorporate the standing and loose paddy residues
    into soil without burning, prepares land and concurrently sows wheat seed. This
    study was conducted during 2022 to assess the pros and cons of SS for wheat sowing
    as well as to compare the economics of wheat production to conventional tillage/broadcasting
    method (CT). As the SS has not been adopted on large scale to find out its adopters
    easily; therefore, twenty innovative farmers were included in sampling frame with
    non-probability sampling procedure for field survey as well as six field experiments
    were conducted in Gujranwala zone, Pakistan to evaluate four sowing techniques,
    i.e., CT, happy seeder, ridge sowing and SS with Randomized Complete Block Design.
    As compared to CT the SS has been estimated as resource conservation technique
    regarding sowing time (62.50%), irrigation time (7.69%), seed cost (14%), fertilizer
    cost (10.81%), and fuel cost (58.33%) with the constrained requirement of higher
    hp tractor (preferably 85 hp) for sowing operation. An increased wheat yield (13.11%)
    was estimated with SS (3450 kg ha-1) as compared to CT (3050 kg ha-1) in rice-wheat
    cropping system. The more net returns (36.15%) were calculated by SS with higher
    benefit cost ratio value (2.81) as compared to CT with lower value (2.16). Similarly,
    based on the field experiments data the SS resulted in significantly higher values
    of emergence count (211 m-2), productive tillers (322 m-2), grains count (38.93
    spike-1), 1000 grains weight (38.91 g) and grains yield (3497 kg ha-1) delineating
    more yield (13.10%) over the CT. Thus, SS has conserved soil moisture, increased
    soil organic matter, better soil tilth and enhanced fertilizer uptake efficiency
    which ultimately increased the yield over the other comparative wheat sowing techniques.

    I n Pakistan the wheat (Triticum aestivum L) is consumed as staple food and its
    availability always ensured the food security. Its cultivated area is 8.91 million
    hectares with share of 7.8% regarding value addition in agriculture as well as
    1.8% of country’s GDP (GoP, 2022). It has been cultivated in different cropping
    systems like maize-wheat, sugarcane-wheat, rice-wheat and cotton-wheat but about
    60% of the wheat area is recorded under cotton-wheat and rice-wheat cropping systems.
    In Pakistan wheat sowing starts from October and continues till the mid of January
    (Anwar, 2019). The wheat sowing may more be late due to pre-sowing irrigation
    (Rauni) to get proper soil moisture, which required additional 7-10 days’ condition
    to weather situations and existing field capacity. Delay in wheat sowing from
    3rd week of November has progressively reduced the grain yield (Iqbal et al.,
    2017). In rice-wheat cropping system the farmers usually burn the paddy residues
    for ease of land preparation along with cost saving and timely wheat sowing. According
    to Lin and Begho (2022) the higher incorporating cost, scarcity of labour, no
    market of crop residue and the less time gap between crop harvest and next crop
    cultivation were the causing factors to burn crop residue. The residue burning
    damage the soil, raise the erosion risk, and enhance the soil temperature, subsequently
    destroying soil microbes. Hence, there has been the great scope to devise and
    use the agricultural machinery capable of crops sowing in standing crop residues/stubble
    along with introducing short duration varieties of crops. To cope with paddy residue
    burning issue the Happy Seeder started to adopt during 2006 in India which is
    a tractor mounted machine that cut and picks up rice straw or standing stubbles
    in front of the sowing tine and clean each tine twice in one rotation of rotor
    for proper seed placement without seed bed preparation in soil with its attached
    zero till drill (Sidhu et al., 2007). During machine operation the mulched rice
    residues resulted in immobilization of nitrogen, improve organic matter, conserve
    soil moisture and control weeds which caused better wheat yield. The happy seeder
    consumes about 24.70 L ha-1 and has a field capacity of 4.05-4.86 hectare a day
    (Jat et al., 2020). Köller (2003) had concluded that the direct seeding could
    save 73% of fuel energy as compared to conventional tillage. Then to address the
    existing operational issues of available happy seeder machine the Super Seeder
    (SS) introduced by India during 2018 is claimed to complete plough the standing
    paddy residues and sow seeds for the next wheat crop, in a single operation. The
    SS is technologically superior to the prevailing Happy Seeder machine for zero
    tillage wheat sowing with fuel consumption of 19.76 Lha-1 (Dhanda et al., 2022).
    The SS required a tractor of 85 hp ideally to operate the machine. This is also
    tractor operated machine that cuts and fully incorporate rice straw or stubbles,
    cultivate wheat into the soil. Presently, a more updated form of emerging super
    seeder namely Pak seeder has also been introduced by National Agricultural Research
    Council (NARC), Islamabad, Pakistan in 2021 for timely adoption which needed to
    be assessed. Therefore to avoid delay in wheat sowing and to diminish the cost
    of production (land preparation); the Agriculture Department has demonstrated
    this machine at different farmer fields and Govt. agriculture farms i.e. Adaptive
    Research Farm Gujranwala and Govt. Agri. Seed Farm Chillianwala district M.B.
    Din. Meanwhile some innovative farmers have also been reported to adopt SS to
    cultivate wheat timely and efficiently. Hence, this research study was planned
    to evaluate the pros and cons of SS for wheat sowing as well as to compare the
    economics of wheat production to conventional tillage/broadcasting method (CT).
    Materials and Methods As the SS has been introduced recently and has not been
    adopted on large scale in Pakistan to find out its adopters conveniently for field
    survey during 2022. Therefore, a number of 20 available innovative farmers were
    included in sampling frame with non-probability (convenience and purposive) sampling
    methods similar to Bhardwaj (2019) and Latif et al. (2022). The same number of
    non-adopters was also interrogated from the same location of SS adopters for comparative
    economic analysis. Pre-tested and well-designed questionnaire was employed for
    field survey. According to the approach employed by Iqbal et al. (2022), Latif
    et al. (2018), Reddy et al. (2018), and Latif et al. (2022); the economic indicators
    like benefit cost ratio (BCR), net returns and percent change values were computed
    to compare the economics of wheat production with super seeder to conventional
    tillage/broadcasting method (CT). The employed indicators are given below as:
    Net returns = Gross income – Total operational cost Benefit cost ratio (BCR) =
    Gross income/Total operational cost Percent change = (New value – Old value)/Old
    value ×100 During Rabi 2021-22 Adaptive Research Farm, Gujranwala zone also conducted
    six research trials for demonstration and evaluation of Super Seeder; a newly
    emerging technology for wheat sowing. Four treatments as sowing techniques, i.e.
    conventional tillage/broadcasting, happy seeder sowing, Ridge sowing and Super
    seeder sowing were evaluated by using the Randomized complete block design (RCBD)
    with three replications. The net plot size of each treatment on each site was
    66 m × 50 m. All the other agronomic and plant protection practices were kept
    as per departmental recommendations with only variations in seed variety and sowing
    time. The meteorological data on rainfall and temperature was also collected and
    considered to explain the yield parameters. The research trials data was collected
    on different crop yield attributes like emergence count (plants m-2), productive
    tillers m-2, number of grains per spike, 1000-grains weight (g) and grains yield
    (kg ha-1). It was in accordance to Iqbal et al. (2020) and Yousif et al. (2015).
    To verify the normality of data set the scatter plot technique was used. After
    verification of normality trend, the Fisher’s analysis of variance (ANOVA) was
    used for analysis on different observations/treatments (Steel and Torrie, 1997).
    Treatments (sowing techniques) means were evaluated by adopting Least Significant
    Difference (LSD) as post-hoc test at probability of 5%. Results and Discussion
    It was estimated that adoption of super seeder (SS) facilitated the farmers to
    sow wheat about 10-15 days earlier than CT method. Hobbs and Gupta (2003) explained
    that due to sowing after 20th November the wheat yield potential decreases by
    1.5% per day as terminal heat implies. Saharawat et al. (2010) concluded that
    4-6 times ploughing along with 2-3 times planking operation is comparatively regular
    practice in fine textured soil which leads towards increase in sowing cost and
    delay in wheat cultivation. Comparative performance of super seeder (SS) for wheat
    sowing based on survey data About 14% less seed was recorded with SS thus reducing
    seed cost than CT. Franke et al. (2007) described that the seed should be placed
    at a depth of twice the width or diameter of the planted seed. Nielsen (2015)
    concluded that the optimum seed depth of 3.81 cm to 5.08 cm to get sufficient
    moisture for uniform water uptake is easily ensured with SS with definite seed
    saving. While the broadcasting (CT) is not an efficient way of wheat sowing due
    to the issues of non uniform seed distribution and uneven planting depths. The
    saving of Fertilizer (Urea-DAP-Potash) (kg ha-1) was estimated as 10.81% through
    adoption of SS due to the quick nutrients’ availability in proper maintained depth
    by reducing losses factor. During Fiscal Year 2021-22 overall the respondent farmers
    were using minimal quantity of fertilizer due to prevailing shortage and sudden
    rise in prices soon after COVID-19 epidemic incident. However, potash application
    was negligible. According to Erenstein and Laxmi (2008) some zero tillage (ZT)
    adopters reported 20 kg ha-1 fertilizer saving. With SS it became possible to
    sow wheat just after rice harvesting through utilizing residual moisture for wheat
    germination. Moreover, due to water conservation in soil by rice residues which
    act as mulch, the number of irrigations/depths of irrigation is reduced resulting
    in water saving. Mishra and Singh (2012) explained the seed broadcasting for seed
    placement at different depths resulted in poor stand establishment and requirement
    of high seed rate. According to Raju et al. (2012) on an average, farmers saved
    6.13%, 15.98%, 45.88% and 13.93% cost on fertilizer, irrigation, machine labour
    and human labour respectively in ZT than CT of wheat cultivation. According to
    Iqbal et al. (2002) the time (hours) involved to irrigate wheat (particularly
    during the first irrigation) varied much in different sowing methods. It consumed
    6.18, 9.88 and 8.65 hours respectively to irrigate one hectare of wheat cultivated
    with ZT, Rauni and wad watter methods. Diesel consumption (L ha-1) for sowing
    operation was calculated in the range of 22.23-29.64 L ha-1 with 58.33% saving
    by adopting SS for wheat sowing. There might be different factors for varying
    diesel consumption like type of soil (i.e. sandy, loamy or clayey), model/horse
    power of operating tractor, SS machine condition (i.e. used blades 42-60 and machine
    weight 750-950 kg), extent of rice residue/straw present in the field and existing
    soil moisture etc. Similarly, time required for land preparation/sowing as well
    as time required for irrigation with SS was estimated with savings of 62.5% and
    7.69%, respectively. The wheat sowing in the residual moisture resulted in saving
    of irrigation and time with SS. The higher yield (3450 kg ha-1) was estimated
    with SS as compared to CT (3050 kg ha-1) with 13.11% increase in rice-wheat cropping
    system (Table 1). The higher yield might be achieved due to better emergence,
    productive tiller, efficient uptake of soil moisture and nutrients. The more net
    returns (36.15%) were recorded by SS with higher benefit cost ratio (2.81) as
    compared to CT of wheat with lower value (2.16) (Table 2). The adopters of SS
    were of the view that this method has conserved soil moisture, increased soil
    organic matter, better soil tilth and enhanced fertilizer uptake efficiency. Similar
    results were found by Sharma et al. (2008) who explained that enhanced root development
    resulted in higher uptake of nutrient which caused increase in crop yield. The
    study results are in accordance to the Sidhu et al. (2007) who estimated more
    yield (10%) with Happy Seeder sowing as compared to CT. Performance evaluation
    of super seeder (SS) for wheat sowing based on field experiments During Rabi 2021-22
    Adaptive Research Farm, Gujranwala zone conducted six research trials for demonstration
    and evaluation of SS; a newly emerging technology for wheat sowing. Four treatments
    as sowing techniques, i.e. CT, happy seeder sowing, ridge sowing and SS were evaluated.
    The trials were conducted within the premises of Punjab province of Pakistan on
    the sites namely, Adaptive Research Farm Gujranwala (32°12ʹ15ʺN,74°13ʹ48ʺE) with
    227 m altitude, Majju Chak (31°55’23”N, 74°5’30”E) with 228 m altitude in tehsil

    was recorded in SS (211 m-2) followed by ridge sowing (190 m-2), conventional
    tillage (CT) (175 m-2) and happy seeder (172 m-2). The emergence count was significantly
    different between SS and ridge sowing. Accordingly, the emergence count (plants
    m-2) was higher in SS (20.57%) and ridge sowing (8.57%), respectively as compared
    to CT (Table 3 and Figure 1). Khan et al. (2021) described that low tillage treatment
    provided maximum wheat emergence count m-2 as compared to traditionally ploughed
    and deep tillage treatments. Dry period during November-December, 2021 helped
    out in harvesting of long duration fine rice varieties but wheat sowing and germination
    delayed due to improper soil moisture conditions. Occurrence of terminal heat
    stress during wheat reproductive stage also raised the need of more irrigation
    and resulted in increasing the cost of irrigation. As negligible rainfall recorded
    for the whole months of November and December during 2021 which raised the issues
    of wheat emergence particularly for happy seeder method. GoP (2021a, b) also reported
    that November 2021 rainfall was 94.4% below the average in Pakistan and stood
    6th driest November month on record as well as Punjab suffered with deficient
    rainfall (-92.0%) and stood 12th driest November month in history. Similarly,
    December 2021 rainfall was 66.3% below the average in Pakistan as well as Punjab
    (-86.2%) suffered with deficient rainfall (Table 4). Poudel et al. (2020) described
    that wheat is much responsive to heat stress. It is calculated that per 1°C rise
    in temperature cause reduce in universal wheat production by 6%. Heat stress in
    wheat cause poor seed emergence, lower in grain filling period, decrease in number
    of grains, deactivation of Rubisco enzyme, decline in photosynthetic capacity,
    decrease in rate of assimilate translocation, untimely leaf senescence, decline
    chlorophyll content and finally decline in yield. The profitable yield of cereals
    is generally based on productive tillers count. The productive tillers count m-2
    was non-significantly varied between SS and ridge sowing but significantly varied
    as compared to CT and happy seeder. Higher productive tillers count was estimated
    in SS (322 m-2) followed by ridge sowing (313 m-2), CT (291 m-2) and happy seeder
    (289 m-2). Accordingly, the higher productive tillers m-2 was recorded with SS
    (10.65%), ridge sowing (7.56%) and happy seeder (3.27%), respectively as compared
    to CT (Table 3 and Figure 1). Khan et al. (2021) described that higher tiller
    count (278.5 m-2) was estimated in low tillage treatment as compared to conventional
    tillage treatment (267.8 m-2) and deep tillage treatment (261.7 m-2). Higher grains
    count was estimated in SS (38.93 spike-1) followed by ridge sowing (38.77 spike-1),
    happy seeder (38.60 spike-1) and CT (38.08 spike-1). Similarly, higher value of
    1000 grains weight was calculated in SS (38.91 g) followed by ridge sowing (37.72
    g), happy seeder (37.36 g) and CT (37.33 g). The data showed that there were non-significant
    variations among sowing techniques except SS (Table 3 and Figure 1). According
    to Shah et al. (1994) the yield parameter of grains per spike is affected by several
    factors like seed rate, sowing time, soil type, fertilizer plan, temperature range
    and variety. The economic yield of wheat is ultimately linked with grains yield.
    The grains yield (kg ha-1) was significantly varied among all the sowing techniques/treatments.
    Higher grains yield was estimated in SS (3497 kg ha-1) followed by ridge sowing
    (3295 kg ha-1), happy seeder (3193 kg ha-1) and CT (3092 kg ha-1). The data showed
    that there were significant variations among all the sowing techniques. Accordingly,
    the higher grains yield was recorded with SS (13.10%), ridge sowing (6.57%) and
    happy seeder (3.27%), respectively as compared to CT (Table 3 and Figure 1).   Table

    et al. (2023) estimated the significant savings in fuel consumption (60.71%),
    labour requirement (77.80%), sowing cost (53%) and gross returns (7.22%) by adopting
    super seeder sowing as compared to conventional/broadcasting sowing. According
    to Iqbal et al. (2022) ridge and bed sowing techniques resulted in higher yield
    and water use efficiency than broadcast tillage of wheat. GoP (2022) has also
    reported that production of wheat crop during fiscal year 2021-22 remained low
    due to reduction in cultivated area, lower fertilizer usage because of short supply
    and price hike, and sudden rise of temperature during the month of March and April
    despite Govt. has fixed a reasonable wheat support price i.e., PKR 2200 for 40
    kg. Reasons for non-adoption of happy seeder machine on large scale Based on field
    survey some following reasons for non-adoption of Happy Seeder were recorded as:
    As the yield with Happy Seeder sowing differs keeping in view the soil type and
    fertility status. Like some farmers reported that this method was more successful
    in light soil; a soil high in sand relative to clay. Small land holding is also
    one of the reasons for non-adoption of happy seeder. Hence some farmers could
    not purchase the machine due to higher investment cost. It could not be used properly
    if there was excess soil moisture due to rains or seepage. As the machine is used
    for wheat sowing only and it is not multipurpose like newly emerged SS; therefore,
    some farmers are reluctant to purchase it. The issue of the unevenly spread of
    residue straw by happy seeders was described by few farmers. The more stiffness
    nature of stubbles forced the farmers to partially burn the field before operating
    the machine. Why super seeder is needed? Based on field survey and field experiments
    data some following key points related to importance and scope of SS are enlisted
    as: It saves money (58.33%) for sowing operation as less time is needed to carry
    out field operation, which in turn reduces fuel and labor costs. This technology
    is eco-friendly and single pass solution to stop burning of paddy residue/straw,
    lower soil pH and improve soil health and fertility by adding organic matter.
    Timely sowing of wheat become possible even after long duration of basmati rice
    varieties. Partially levels the field with attached roller. Direct sowing just
    after rice harvesting reduces soil disturbance. Increase in infiltration rate
    of water in soil due to improved soil porosity as well as Increase in water holding
    capacity of soil. Opportunity of wheat cultivation in residual moisture and ultimately
    saving of irrigation cost (7.14%). Wheat sowing in residue moisture of rice and
    sowing in wet soils is also possible Less weed growth may occur due to less tillage/soil
    disturbance. Higher yield (13.10%) achieved as emergence was much better (211
    plants m-2) in soft soil if compared with other seeding solution. Improved fertilizer
    use efficiency due to fertilizer placement along with seed. It has unique tine
    design which can be used for tillage and fully functional as rotary tiller as
    per seasonal requirements. It may be used as a multi crop planter. Other than
    wheat it may be used for sowing of soybean and grass etc. SS is a combination
    of seed planter and rotary tiller with press wheels. The issue of the crop residue
    and straw which was not being spread uniformly by happy seeder but it has been
    addressed successfully with super seeder. It is operational for removing and incorporating
    of stubble and residue of paddy as well as cotton, sugarcane, banana, maize etc.
    It has a simple and easy metering system that allows changing of seed rates with
    less seed waste and provides assurance of better emergence. The metering device
    is designed with a combination of aluminum and cast iron for better performance
    and durability. Hence it has proved as resource conservation technology regarding
    sowing time (62.50%), irrigation time (7.69%), fertilizer cost (10.81%), seed
    cost (14%) and fuel cost (58.33%) with the constrained requirement of higher hp
    tractor (preferably 85 hp) for operation. Precautions and necessary guidelines
    in operation of super seeder Based on field survey and field experiments data
    some following key points related to guidelines in operation of super seeder are
    enlisted as: After attaching the super seeder to the tractor, check the connection
    of top link, lower link and list link before lifting the machine by the position
    control lever. Always use the lower gear of tractor to obtain fine tilth of soil
    and good cutting of straw residue. The super seeder is a multi seeder machine
    therefore its calibration regarding seed and fertilizer must be performed before
    operation. Like seed rate range of 98 to 185 kg ha-1 was available in some machines
    while found during field survey. Depth of fertilizer, seed boot can be adjusted
    by raising or lowering the depths skids position. The working of machine having
    ‘J’ type blades is better as compared to ‘V’ shaped blades. The dry wheel and
    roller adjustment is necessary for up and down position of machine. For a very
    fine seedbed, drive tractor very slowly in forward (first low). The rice crop
    should not be over matured at harvesting time and rice residues must not be fully
    dry to ease the cutting operation through super seeder machine. Proper soil moisture
    must be present during operation to ease the mulching and seed bed preparation
    by SS. But the Happy Seeder cannot be used properly if there is excess soil moisture
    due to rains. The existing Super Seeder requires a tractor of higher energy like
    85 hp to pull the machine. Most of the farmers have 50 hp tractors, so small sized
    super seeders should also be manufactured to promote this technology. Small and
    uneconomic land holding is biggest constraint in adopting farm mechanization like
    Super Seeder; as currently, 90% of the farmers (7.4 million) have recorded as
    small land holder in Pakistan as they possess below 5 hectares of land. Distribution
    of land in Pakistan is greatly skewed like all other developing countries (Khan,
    2022). Also, higher energy tractor (≥75 hp) is requirement to operate this machine
    while 85% farmers don’t have that. Therefore, eligible service providers should
    be encouraged and supported with Govt. subsidy scheme to propagate this technology
    for farming community on rental basis. Conclusions and Recommendations After comparative
    analysis of all the prevailing sowing techniques of wheat in rice-wheat cropping
    system; the use of Super Seeder (SS) has resulted with significantly higher values
    of Grains Yield, Net Returns and Benefit Cost Ratio. The SS has emerged as best
    sowing machine due to possible factors like conserving soil moisture, increasing
    soil organic matter, and enhancing fertilizer uptake efficiency. Thus, the wheat
    sowing with Super Seeder has proved as saving/resource conservation technology
    regarding time, labour, water, fertilizer, seed and fuel with the constrained/requirement
    of higher hp tractor for its operation. Acknowledgements Agriculture (Ext&AR)
    Department, Govt. of the Punjab, Pakistan is acknowledged for providing the support
    and funding to conduct this study. Novelty Statement In rice-wheat cropping system
    the farmers usually burn the paddy residues for ease of land preparation along
    with cost saving and timely wheat sowing. The emerging Super Seeder has proved
    as a single operational solution to conserve soil moisture with timely sowing,
    increase soil organic matter by avoiding residue burning, reducing smog and air
    pollution, better soil tilth through incorporating paddy residue and enhance fertilizer
    uptake efficiency to ultimately get optimum wheat yield. Author’s Contribution

  description: Promoting appropriate water-saving irrigation is an important pathway
    to alleviate groundwater overexploitation in irrigated agriculture. Whether an
    alternative irrigation method is feasible relies on quantitative assessments of
    its impacts on crop yield and hydrological cycle, especially in the groundwater
    overdraft area that faces a dilemma between water scarcity and food security.
    Using a groundwater-module-improved SWAT (Soil & Water Assessment Tool) model,
    five GCMs (General Circulation Models) projections of CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison
    Project 6), and a linear programming algorithm, sprinkler irrigation was simulated,
    evaluated, and optimized in a representative global groundwater mining location,
    the piedmont plain of the North China Plain. During the historical period (1993–2012),
    the results showed that, in general, sprinkler irrigation had advantages in benefiting
    crop transpiration of winter wheat and reducing percolation, hence improving water
    use efficiency with reference to traditional surface irrigation. Specifically,
    compared to traditional surface irrigation schemes, winter wheat yields increased
    by 12%− 14% with a 225 mm irrigation quota; they were stable with a 150 mm irrigation
    quota; but they decreased by 4% with a 75 mm irrigation quota. The shallow groundwater
    tables would decline at an average rate of 1.29 m/yr, 0.83 m/yr, and 0.35 m/yr,
    respectively, under sprinkler irrigation with 225 mm, 150 mm, and 75 mm irrigation
    quotas. Future climate changes (increased precipitation, air temperatures, and
    CO2 concentration) would bring effects of improving wheat yield by 6%− 7% and
    increasing groundwater vertical recharge by 58%− 122% in 2030–2049. The variations
    of predicted future shallow groundwater tables were − 0.37 m/yr, 0.01 m/yr, and
    0.40 m/yr with the 225 mm, 150 mm, and 75 mm irrigation quotas, respectively,
    in the SSP2–4.5 scenario; and the corresponding results were − 0.45 m/yr, − 0.05
    m/yr, and 0.34 m/yr in the SSP5–8.5 scenario. The optimization results showed
    that sprinkler irrigation could be implemented in approximately 50% of the study
    area to achieve shallow groundwater equilibrium and stable wheat production simultaneously
    in the near future. And the dominant sprinkler irrigation schedule after optimization
    was found to be scheme S3 (irrigation frequency for wheat was 5 times) with a
    limited irrigation quota of 150 mm. This study provides detailed data for planning
    sprinkler water-saving irrigation regimes and groundwater pumping strategies in
    China's breadbasket, as well as a reference for global irrigated agriculture with
    over-drafted aquifers to balance groundwater conservation and grain production.

    China PlainImproved SWAT model 1. Introduction Accounting for approximately 99%
    of all liquid freshwater on earth, groundwater has provided critical support to
    drinking water supplies, crops, industries, and ecosystems (https://www.unwater.org/publications/un-world-water-development-report-2022.).
    However, since it is usually invisible below the ground surface, this natural
    resource is often poorly understood, and consequently undervalued, mismanaged,
    and even abused (Scanlon et al., 2012a; https://www.unwater.org/publications/un-world-water-development-report-2022.).
    Long-term groundwater storage depletion resulting from intensive abstraction has
    led to severe ecological and environmental problems, such as land subsidence and
    drying-up of rivers and wetlands (Döll et al., 2014, Famiglietti, 2014, Jia et
    al., 2020, Su et al., 2021). Nonetheless, due to its ubiquity and continuity of
    supply providing a buffer against droughts, groundwater is still the primary source
    for about nearly half of the world’s population, providing about 40% of the irrigating
    water supply worldwide (Scanlon et al., 2012a, Velis et al., 2017, Jasechko and
    Perrone, 2021; https://www.unwater.org/publications/un-world-water-development-report-2022.).
    Approximately 70% of groundwater withdrawn contributes to the agricultural sector
    globally (Margat and van der Gun, 2013). Expansion of irrigated cropland from
    wells is the primary cause of regional groundwater over-exploitation (Wada et
    al., 2010; https://www.unwater.org/publications/un-world-water-development-report-2022.).
    The locations of aquifer depletion, mostly in irrigated regions, including Indo-Gangetic
    Plains in South Asia (Tulip et al., 2022), the North China Plain (NCP) (Feng et
    al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2022), and the High Plains and Central Valley in the
    U.S. (Scanlon et al., 2012a, Scanlon et al., 2012b, Ashraf et al., 2017, Xiang
    et al., 2022), all rely on groundwater to sustain grain production. In this context,
    how to produce more crops with less groundwater drops to alleviate the conflict
    between water scarcity and food security, has become an essential and critical
    issue in groundwater conservation and governance. Water-saving irrigation technologies
    that aim to maximize beneficial crop water use have long been seen as an effective
    method to mitigate water shortage (Perry and Steduto, 2017, Zhou et al., 2021).
    As an advanced irrigation method, sprinkler irrigation has been proven to be conducive
    to saving water and land, maintaining soil water content, and reducing water transport
    losses (China Irrigation and Drainage Development Center, 2006, Galioto et al.,
    2020, Wang et al., 2020). Since the 1980s, sprinkler irrigation systems have been
    suggested for use on the NCP as a new water-saving irrigation method suited to
    the limited freshwater availability (500 m3 per annum per capita) which is far
    below the international severe water shortage standard (Shen and Chen, 1988, Yang
    et al., 2000, Li, 2006). Rate of shallow groundwater depletion in the piedmont
    plain of NCP is among the highest major aquifers globally (Huang et al., 2015,
    Long et al., 2020); large-scale winter wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) planting along
    with the mismatch between precipitation and the water requirement of this crop
    is the main cause of the rapid decline of shallow groundwater level (over 1.0
    m/yr) in this region (Wang, 2010, Zhang et al., 2017). Therefore, how would the
    crop yield and water use efficiency change if the sprinkler irrigation systems
    were applied for winter wheat cultivars have become a significant topic for agro-hydrologic
    researchers and policy-makers in this important breadbasket of China. Field experiments
    carried out in several experimental stations located within or adjacent to this
    region (Chen et al., 2004, Sun et al., 2006, Yu et al., 2009, Liu et al., 2011,
    Dong et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016b; Jha et al., 2017, Jha et al., 2019; Fang
    et al., 2018; Li et al., 2018, Li et al., 2019a, Li et al., 2019b; Lv et al.,
    2019, Lv et al., 2020) gave various results. Effects of implementing sprinkler
    irrigation schemes on winter wheat yield and soil water dynamics changed along
    with differences in precipitation, soil texture, and irrigation amount. Field
    experiments in different years revealed an increasing effect on wheat production
    of sprinkler irrigation, whereas others showed opposite results, a slight decrease
    trend. Although these field experiments are useful for understanding the impacts
    of sprinkler irrigation on the crop’s physiological characteristics, it is difficult
    to estimate the variations in crop yields and water cycle at the regional scale
    only based on the results that refer to a specific site and a certain year. The
    distributed hydrological model after good calibration, which could conduct simulations
    of what-if scenarios to model the “virtual application of different management
    plans”, would fill the gap of field experiment studies. The Soil and Water Assessment
    Tool (SWAT) model is a physically-based and semi-distributed hydrological model
    (Gassman et al., 2007, Neitsch et al., 2011). The SWAT model along with the improved
    groundwater module (Zhang et al., 2016a, Ren and Zhang, 2020) enables the simulations
    of the Soil-Plant-Atmosphere Continuum (SPAC) in conjunction with the shallow
    groundwater systems under different irrigation scenarios in this region. Global
    warming has triggered changes in the climate system. Several studies have projected
    an increase in precipitation in the NCP in the future (Liu et al., 2013b, Tang
    and Liu, 2021, Wu et al., 2020, Xiao et al., 2020, Zhao et al., 2018). This implies
    that climate change may alleviate the water crisis, presenting an opportunity
    to address the conflict between water availability and crop production in the
    region. Furthermore, global warming also possesses the potential to harm agroclimatic
    conditions and the hydrological cycle (Letz et al., 2021, Getnet et al., 2022,
    Jiang et al., 2022, Son et al., 2022, Senatore et al., 2022). Therefore, it is
    imperative to assess how the SPAC and groundwater systems in the NCP will evolve
    in the future. Notably, General Circulation Models (GCMs) serve as indispensable
    and credible tools for predicting future climate change. The combination of GCMs
    with crop models or hydrological models has been applied to explore the changes
    in grain yield and hydrological processes in the NCP under future climate change
    (Rashid et al., 2019, Xiao et al., 2020, Xiao et al., 2021, Li et al., 2022, Tan
    et al., 2022). However, there is still a lack of detailed simulations on the variations
    in the hydrological cycle, groundwater dynamics, and crop yields when applying
    sprinkler irrigation schemes in the following decades. Moreover, due to the link
    between quantitative prediction and scientific policy-making, it is important
    to explore recommended sprinkler irrigation schemes for heterogeneous areas to
    achieve groundwater sustainability at the regional scale. In this context, this
    study followed a simulation-evaluation-optimization framework using the modified
    SWAT model, multiple GCMs, and linear programming to explore the feasibility of
    sprinkler irrigation schemes and their adaptation to future climate change in
    a representative shallow groundwater overdraft region. The objectives of this
    study were to: (1) simulate the crop yields and shallow groundwater variations
    at a watershed scale under the winter wheat sprinkler irrigation schemes and make
    detailed comparisons with the current surface irrigation; (2) evaluate the future
    climate-driven impacts on the SPAC and groundwater systems under different sprinkler
    irrigation schemes; and (3) optimize the sprinkler irrigation schedule and explore
    whether this irrigation method could achieve the shallow groundwater equilibrium
    and the stable high grain yield in the near future. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.
    Study area The study area is located in the piedmont plain of Mount Taihang in
    the NCP, which is consistent with the area used in our previous research (Fig.
    1) (Zhang et al., 2016a, Zhang et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2022, Zhang and Ren,
    2021). The average annual temperature is about 13–14ºC, and the average annual
    precipitation is 450–550 mm. The precipitation is usually uneven between years
    and seasons, over 75% of the rainfall occurs during July-September, while the
    spring precipitation only accounts for less than 10% (https://data.cma.cn/; Haihe
    River Water Conservancy Commission, 2006–2012). The study area covers approximately
    2.3 × 104 km2, of which about 1.8 × 104 km2 is farmland (Hebei Provincial Bureau
    of Statistics, 1995–2020). The double cropping system of winter wheat and summer
    maize (Zea mays L.) is the predominant planting pattern in the study area and
    plays a crucial role in ensuring China’s food security (Hebei Provincial Bureau
    of Statistics, 1995–2020). However, the precipitation during the winter wheat
    growing season is only 60–150 mm, while the water requirement is approximately
    450 mm (Zhang et al., 2003), which creates a heavy reliance on extensive groundwater
    pumping for irrigation (Zhang, Z.H., Li, L.R., (Eds.), 2005. Groundwater Resources
    of China-Hebei volume.Sinomaps Press, Beijing (in Chinese)., Ren et al., 2007,
    Sun et al., 2015, Yan et al., 2020). This reliance has led to a significant decline
    in the shallow groundwater table, with a rate of over 1 m/yr since the 1990s,
    which has raised global concerns about groundwater sustainability (China Geological
    Survey, 2009; https://www.unwater.org/publications/un-world-water-development-report-2022.).
    In response to this concern, the Chinese government has released a series of policies
    since 2014 aimed at groundwater conservation, with an emphasis on extending the
    implementation areas of water-saving irrigation technologies (The Department of
    Water Resources of Hebei Province, 2014, General Office of the State Council,
    2021; National Development and Reform Commission, 2021). However, in the study
    area, only about 6.2% of sprinkler-irrigated or drip-irrigated fields are found
    in the water-saving irrigation area (Hebei Provincial Bureau of Statistics, 2019).
    Surface irrigation (e.g., basin irrigation and border irrigation), as a traditional
    irrigation method, is still widely used in the study area (Liu et al., 2013a,
    Fang et al., 2018). Fragmented farmland, small-scale management, and uncertainty
    about the potential savings in water and costs for farmers in the NCP have created
    obstacles to the wider adoption of sprinkler irrigation technology in this breadbasket

    of China (http://www.nesdc.org.cn). 2.2. Field data-based model evaluation for
    agricultural water management The SWAT model uses a simplified EPIC (Erosion-Productivity
    Impact Calculator) crop growth model to account for annual variation in growth
    (Neitsch et al., 2011). In each subbasin, the crop variety, irrigation scheduling,
    and nitrogen fertilization scheduling, for the winter wheat and summer maize (Table
    S1) were determined from three field experiments conducted in Luancheng, Quzhou,
    and Dongbeiwang (Cao, 2002, Fan, 2001, Hu, 2000, Li, 2002, Zhang, 2001, Zhang,
    2006). It is worth noting that the groundwater module in SWAT simulates water
    storage changes in shallow aquifers based on the water balance equation at a daily
    time step (Arnold et al., 1993). However, it cannot directly compute or output
    groundwater table depth, limiting the calibration using monitoring well data.
    Zhang et al. (2016a) enhanced the geohydrology modeling function of SWAT by modifying
    the groundwater module (Eq. 1-6, Tables S2-S3 in the Supplementary Materials),
    and calibrated and validated the model using detailed shallow groundwater table
    fluctuation data from 16 national monitoring wells and 148 regional survey wells.
    The values of the determination coefficient (R2) and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency
    (NSE) were above 0.95 in both the calibration and validation periods (Table S4).
    The enhanced SWAT model enabled the simulation of the SPAC system in conjunction
    with the underground hydrology system, avoiding the junction of the crop model
    and groundwater flow model along with the difficulty in data transmission and
    complex parameters. Crop parameters are calibrated and validated based on field
    experiment station data and statistical production data, enabling the model to
    simulate the growth of winter wheat and summer maize more reliably (Sun and Ren,
    2014). Hydrological parameters are calibrated and validated using remotely sensed
    ET data, allowing the model to represent the hydrological cycle process in farmland
    (Sun and Ren, 2014). Additionally, groundwater parameters are calibrated and validated
    based on measured groundwater table data, ensuring a realistic simulation of groundwater
    table dynamics under different scenarios (Zhang et al., 2016a) (Figs. S1-S2, and
    Tables S5-S6). Following the comprehensive calibration of the model using these
    observed field data, the implementation of watershed-scale agricultural water
    management practices, such as sprinkler irrigation, can be further realized. It
    proved to be an effective tool in evaluating the spatiotemporal variability of
    shallow groundwater changes and crop yields (Zhang et al., 2018, Zhang and Ding,
    2021, Zhang and Ren, 2021, Hou et al., 2022), and these two variables are the
    most critical data for the water management and policy making in the NCP. The
    detailed processes of SWAT model inputs and setup are available in Zhang et al.
    (2016a). Although the SWAT model does not have an option to directly simulate
    sprinkler irrigation practices, we have found a workaround by treating the sprinkler
    irrigation as theoretical rainfall, referring to related model (e.g., the Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant
    model, Kroes et al., 2009). In this study, the irrigation amounts in the predefined
    sprinkler irrigation scenarios in SWAT were converted into daily precipitation
    data (Ali M. Sadeghi, personal communication, 2016), which referred to related
    APEX (Agricultural Policy/Environmental eXtender) manual and APEX source code
    (Steglich and Williams, 2019; Luca Doro, personal communication, 2023). Specifically,
    when sprinkler irrigation was defined on a certain day, the amount of water applied
    through sprinkler irrigation was added to the daily precipitation input data of
    the corresponding weather station. The new weather file, which included the adjusted
    precipitation data, was then used to drive the SWAT model for simulations. 2.3.
    Sprinkler irrigation scenarios settings For the studied winter wheat-summer maize
    double cropping system, sprinkler irrigation scenarios were only set for winter
    wheat as the precipitation could generally satisfy the water requirements of summer
    maize (Sun and Ren, 2014, Zhang et al., 2016a) and the interception loss for maize
    is usually large under sprinkler irrigation (Li et al., 2018). Considering the
    current irrigation intensity is not sustainable for this groundwater over-exploitation
    region (Zhang et al., 2016a), the sprinkler irrigation scenarios were designed
    under the limited pumping amounts to ease water shortages. To highlight the benefits
    of employing sprinkler irrigation over surface irrigation, three surface irrigation
    schemes are setup for comparison. By constraining irrigation quota (i.e., a sum
    of the irrigation amount for each application) to three different levels, six
    sprinkler irrigation schemes (S1-S6) along with three traditional surface irrigation
    schemes (L1-L3) as comparison groups were set in this study (Table 1). The detailed
    setting is described as follows: (1) dividing the limited irrigation quota into
    three categories (i.e., 225 mm, 150 mm, and 75 mm) by referring to the field experiments,
    local regulations, and relevant data (Chen et al., 2014, Sun et al., 2014, Hebei
    Provincial Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision, 2012, The People’s Government
    of Hebei Province, 2014), as well as the surface irrigation schemes in Zhang et
    al. (2018) for comparison; (2) designing the irrigation amount for each application
    as 30–50 mm by referring to the field experiments, local regulations, and relevant
    data (Chen et al., 2014, Sun et al., 2014, Hebei Provincial Bureau of Quality
    and Technical Supervision, 2012); and (3) setting the irrigation time and frequency
    according to the previous studies on the key water requirement periods of winter
    wheat and the simulation experiment results in Zhang et al. (2018). The field
    experiment data collected regarding sprinkler irrigation in the study area were
    not sufficient for adapting the crop parameters by a new round of calibration.
    Thus, referring to the similar treatments in Xue and Ren (2016) as well as Li
    and Ren (2022), the crop parameters of winter wheat and summer maize under surface
    irrigation provided by Sun and Ren (2014) were adopted for simulations. The crop
    yield validation effects are provided in Fig. S2. The crop variety, planting,
    and harvest time zones were set according to Sun and Ren (2013) and Zhang et al.
    (2016a). The irrigation schedule for summer maize was constant under different
    scenarios and consistent with the farmers’ historical practices provided by Sun
    and Ren (2014) and Zhang et al. (2016a). Table 1. Scenario design of simulated

    al. (2018). 2.4. Future climate data and scenario design 2.4.1. Future climate
    predictions To provide policy-makers with scientific assessments and put forward
    adaptation and mitigation options for climate change, the Coupled Model Intercomparison
    Project (CMIP), which began in 1995 under the auspices of the World Climate Research
    Programme (WCRP) and is now in its sixth phase (CMIP6) (Eyring et al., 2016),
    is applied in this study. Simulations from CMIP6 and earlier versions have been
    widely used for evaluating climate change impacts and potential agricultural risks
    in the future (Xu et al., 2021, Trnka et al., 2022, Samantaray et al., 2022, Kayhomayoon
    et al., 2023). Future climate projections were obtained based on 27 GCMs from
    CMIP6 (Table S7). Due to the low spatiotemporal resolution of the original GCMs
    from the WCRP, this study used the downscaling method and bias correction method
    developed by Liu and Zuo (2012) to generate a daily weather dataset for the 7
    national meteorological stations. The historical meteorological data were obtained
    from 7 national meteorological stations and 15 provincial rain gauge stations
    located in the study area (Zhang et al., 2016a). To keep consistent with our previous
    studies, the historical analysis period was set as 1993–2012 (20 years), with
    1990–1992 as a warm-up period. Considering the modernization process of Chinese
    agriculture and improving the reference value of our quantified simulation data
    to the policymaker in planning irrigated schemes in the following two decades,
    2030–2049 (20 years, with 2027–2029 as a warm-up period) was set for future predictions.
    Two greenhouse gas emission scenarios of SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 were selected (Table
    S8) (O''Neill et al., 2016) in this study. Based on van Vuuren et al. (2007) and
    Meinshausen et al. (2011), the CO2 concentrations for the future period were estimated
    at 460 ppm (SSP2–4.5) and 489 ppm (SSP5–8.5), respectively. The CO2 concentration
    for the historical period was kept at the default value of 330 ppm. To further
    reduce the uncertainty, this study also corrected the results after GCMs drove
    SWAT using a second deviation correction (Xiao et al., 2021), (1), (2) denoted
    the calculation method for the second deviation correction. (1) (2) where outputvar
    and Δoutputvar are the absolute and relative changes of the simulation results,
    respectively; and SGCM, Shistory, and Smeasured are the SWAT simulated values
    driven by GCM projected climate for the future period, GCM projected climate for
    the historical period, and measured climate from weather stations, respectively.
    2.4.2. Reduction of uncertainty for future climate predictions Using multiple
    GCMs for simulations is one of the main methods to reduce the uncertainty for
    future climate scenarios (Thomson et al., 2005, Faramarzi et al., 2013, Asseng
    et al., 2019); however, the simulation capabilities for multi-meteorological elements
    of different GCMs usually vary at different regions (Hu et al., 2021), and the
    processing with too many GCMs will also bring a tremendous amount of work, especially
    for the simulations in a large-scale hydrological model. Therefore, this study
    used the Taylor Diagram (Taylor, 2001) to preferentially select several GCMs from
    the downscaled 27 GCMs, which present the highest accuracy and best performance
    for simulating the meteorological elements in the study area. Considering that
    the longer period used for selection, the more objective GCMs selection could
    present, we chose the 1961–2012 (52 years) as the selection period, and the results
    of the Taylor Diagram of the 27 GCMs are shown in Fig. S3. By comprehensively
    examining the simulation performances of precipitation, maximum air temperature
    (Tmax), minimum air temperature (Tmin), and solar radiation, five GCMs (ACC1,
    BCCC, Can2, CNR1, and IPSL) with reasonable accuracy and stability were selected.
    These five GCMs were provided by institutes from Australia, China, Canada, and
    France (Table S7). The future climate data projected by these GCMs from CMIP6
    projections were input into the SWAT model to simulate changes in shallow groundwater
    variations, soil water balance, and crop yields from 2030 to the mid-21st century.
    2.5. Optimization of the sprinkler irrigation schedule under future climate change
    The dilemma between groundwater conservation (decreasing irrigation pumping) and
    grain production (stabilizing winter wheat yield) has long been the main point
    for agricultural hydrology studies in this well-known irrigated region. In our
    previous study (Zhang et al., 2018), the surface irrigation schemes were optimized
    considering the trade-off between water and food; and it was found that the minimal
    reduction in the per unit area yield of winter wheat would be 42% to achieve the
    target of stopping the decline of shallow groundwater level (i.e., realize shallow
    groundwater equilibrium). For China’s most important wheat-producing region, this
    reduction might be impractical, considering the national basic self-sufficiency
    of grain (Han, 2012, Wang, 2010, General Office of the State Council, 2022, General
    Office of the State Council, 2023). However, both the sprinkler irrigation technology
    and future climate change might bring the varying environment to alter the groundwater
    sustainability and grain production capacity. Adopting the framework of maximizing
    wheat yield under the constraint of stopping groundwater drawdown or minimizing
    groundwater drawdown under the constraint of stabilizing wheat yield, the optimizations
    were conducted to explore the recommended sprinkler irrigation schemes at the
    regional scale. The optimization in each subbasin was conducted using the 0–1
    integer linear programming (See Supplementary Materials for optimization processing
    details), which is a well-established approach in seeking for recommended irrigation
    plan in NCP (Zhang et al., 2018, Zhang and Ren, 2021, Li and Ren, 2019, Li and
    Ren, 2021, Li and Ren, 2022). The detailed technical processes in this study are
    shown in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (776KB) Download : Download

    in this study. 3. Results 3.1. Comparison between sprinkler and surface irrigation
    schemes 3.1.1. Simulation results of crop yields During the historical period,
    when the total quantity of irrigation was set to 225 mm, the winter wheat yield
    was 6038 kg/hm2 and 5938 kg/hm2 under sprinkler schemes S1 and S2, respectively
    (Table S9). In comparison with the traditional surface irrigation scheme L1 with
    5303 kg/hm2 under the same 225 mm irrigation quota, the sprinkler irrigation increased
    the winter wheat yield by 12%− 14% (Fig. 3a; Table S9). When the total quantity
    of irrigation was set to 150 mm, the winter wheat yield under sprinkler schemes
    S3, S4, and S5 was 5155 kg/hm2, 4892 kg/hm2, and 5015 kg/hm2, respectively (Table
    S9). With reference to the level of 4955 kg/hm2 under surface irrigation scheme
    L2 with the same irrigation quota, approximately a 4% increase in wheat yield
    was found under sprinkler scheme S3, and the variations under schemes S4 and S5
    was less than 1%, which could be considered as a stable yield (Fig. 3a; Table
    S9). However, when the irrigation quota was limited to 75 mm, winter wheat yield
    under sprinkler irrigation scheme S6 would decrease by approximately 4% compared
    to the surface irrigation scheme L3 (Fig. 3a). In consequence, for the study area,
    the effects on winter wheat yield of sprinkler irrigation were related with the
    total quantity of irrigation. It is an attractive finding for this major grain
    production region that a more than 10% increase in wheat yield was presented under
    the 225 mm total irrigation amount. With the reduction of the total irrigation
    amount (limited to 150 mm), the yield response under sprinkler irrigation would
    vary within ± 5% in comparison with surface irrigation. However, there was a decreased
    trend of wheat yield for sprinkler irrigation if the total irrigation amount was
    limited to 75 mm, which implied that surface irrigation was more efficient in
    this case. These characteristics of change were consistent basically in the winter
    wheat growing seasons with different precipitation exceedance probabilities (Fig.
    3a; Table S9). Download : Download high-res image (454KB) Download : Download

    (b) under different precipitation conditions of the six sprinkler irrigation schemes
    and three surface irrigation schemes. S1-S6 represents sprinkler irrigation schemes,
    and L1-L3 represents surface irrigation schemes. Different colors represent different
    irrigation amounts. Quantificationally analyzing sprinkler irrigation schemes
    with the same irrigation quota but different irrigation frequencies could provide
    useful information for specific water-saving irrigation plans. We found that in
    all subbasins except zy2 and zy8, the winter wheat yield under scheme S1 (irrigation
    frequency set as 6 times) was higher than that under scheme S2 (irrigation frequency
    set as 5 times) with a total quantity of irrigation of 225 mm (Figs. S4 and S5),
    indicating that a higher sprinkler irrigation frequency could be conducive to
    obtaining a higher yield level. For the three sprinkler irrigation schemes with
    a total quantity of irrigation of 150 mm, in addition to increasing irrigation
    frequency (the highest yield of winter wheat was found under scheme S3, see Fig.
    3a), the irrigation time should also be considered to obtain a higher yield. The
    simulated results showed that the wheat yield under scheme S4 was lower than that
    under scheme S5 (Fig. 3a, S4, and S5), which implied that scheme S5 with more
    irrigation in the middle and late growth stages of winter wheat might be more
    beneficial in reducing water stress relative to scheme S4, which were all using
    the 150 mm irrigation quota. For the winter wheat-summer maize rotation system,
    the changes in the irrigation methods and pumping amounts during the winter wheat
    growth period might affect the initial soil water content during the subsequent
    summer maize planting. Hence, the differences in summer maize yields between S1-S6
    and L1-L3 irrigation schemes were also provided in Fig. 3b. It can be found that
    increasing the irrigation amount at the middle and late growth stages of winter
    wheat had advantages in alleviating water stress of summer maize and therefore
    improve the harvest yield. For instance, under the same 150 mm irrigation quota,
    the maize yield under schemes S4 and S5 that allocated more irrigation water during
    the heading and filling periods of winter wheat was 6392 kg/hm2, while scheme
    S3 only resulted in a maize yield of 6316 kg/hm2 (Table S10). 3.1.2. Simulation
    results of shallow groundwater variations and soil water balance Although sprinkler
    irrigation was expected to increase winter wheat yield in comparison with traditional
    surface irrigation in most scenarios, meanwhile more serious shallow groundwater
    downdrawn was found. When the total quantity of irrigation was set to 225 mm,
    under the sprinkler irrigation schemes (i.e., S1 and S2 schemes), the shallow
    groundwater table decreased by 1.43 m on average during the winter wheat season
    and increased by 0.29 m on average during the summer maize season, and the average
    annual variation was about − 1.29 m (Fig. 4). Whereas, under the surface irrigation
    schemes L1 with the same 225 mm irrigation quota, the corresponded results of
    the above variables showed a decrease of 1.24 m during the winter wheat season,
    an increase of 0.43 m during the summer maize season, and an average annual change
    of − 0.88 m (Fig. 4). These simulations implied that the sprinkler irrigation
    might accelerate the rate of decline in shallow groundwater table during the winter
    wheat season with intensive pumping, simultaneously alleviate the recovery degree
    of shallow groundwater table during the summer maize season with large precipitation.
    A similar characteristic of these changes was found when the total quantity of
    irrigation was limited to 150 mm or 75 mm (Fig. 4). Other findings showed that
    the effects on groundwater variations brought by the differences in irrigation
    frequencies under the same irrigation quota were not as obvious as that on winter
    wheat yield (Fig. 3 and 4). Download : Download high-res image (352KB) Download

    (2 m deep), shallow groundwater table variation, and components of actual evapotranspiration
    (ETa) in different crop growing seasons and civil year. CANEV represents canopy
    interception; ES represents soil surface evaporation; EP represents crop transpiration.
    The inverted triangle means the shallow groundwater table is declining and vice
    versa. S1-S6 represents sprinkler irrigation schemes, and L1-L3 represents surface
    irrigation schemes. The reduction in percolation from the bottom of the root zone
    (2 m deep) under the sprinkler irrigation scheme compared to surface irrigation
    caused the larger declining degree in shallow groundwater table by decreasing
    the vertical recharge to aquifers. For the sprinkler irrigation quotas of 225 mm,
    150 mm, and 75 mm, the percolation was reduced by 37%, 20%, and 3%, respectively,
    relative to the corresponding surface irrigation schemes (Fig. 4). Most of the
    reduced percolation was converted to the ETa under sprinkler irrigation schemes.
    To further explore the changes in water movement brought by the change in irrigation
    method, crop transpiration (EP), soil surface evaporation (ES), and canopy interception
    (CANEV), which are the subcomponents of ETa, were analyzed. The increases in ETa
    brought by sprinkler irrigation schemes for the irrigation quotas of 225 mm, 150 mm,
    and 75 mm were 41 mm, 11 mm, and 1 mm, respectively. The corresponding changes
    in EP under the three irrigation quotas were 29 mm, 1 mm, and − 6 mm, which could
    explain the variation in winter wheat yields in Section 3.1.1. The ES and CANEV
    under the six sprinkler irrigation schemes all presented an increasing trend compared
    with the surface irrigation under the same irrigation quota (Fig. 4). Despite
    the pumping amounts under sprinkler irrigation schemes S1-S6 had been restricted
    in comparison with the current situations, the over-exploitation of shallow groundwater
    cannot be stopped at the regional scale (Fig. 4). When the total quantity of irrigation
    was limited to 225 mm, 150 mm, and 75 mm, the shallow groundwater table in the
    study area would decline at an average rate of 1.29 m/yr, 0.83 m/yr, and 0.35 m/yr,
    respectively. However, in subbasins, dx1 in the Dianxi Plain of the Daqing River
    basin, and zy1 in the Plain of the Ziya River basin, where the groundwater recharge
    is relatively abundant, the declining trend of the shallow groundwater table could
    be controlled under the sprinkler irrigation scheme with a 75 mm irrigation quota
    (Figs. S6 and S7). These subbasins locate in the western part of the study region,
    which accounts for about 6.7% of the total study area. For the other 93.3% area,
    the shallow groundwater depletion could be slowed down under sprinkler irrigation
    schemes S1-S6, but could not be converted to a recovery trend towards sustainability.
    3.2. Simulation results of sprinkler irrigation schemes under future climate change
    3.2.1. Change in climatic factors In the study area, the projected changes in
    future precipitation during the 2030–2049 period showed slight variability between
    emission scenarios (Fig. S8). Under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, the average
    annual precipitation was 696 mm and 670 mm, respectively (Fig. S8), increased
    by approximately 21%− 27% with reference to the historical period. The increased
    precipitation during winter wheat and summer maize growing seasons was 22% and
    29% under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, and 21% and 22% under the SSP5-8.5 scenario.
    The solar radiation in the SSP5-8.5 scenario was higher than that in the SSP2-4.5
    scenario, with an average difference of 44 KJ/m2 (Fig. S8). All the GCMs showed
    fluctuating upward trends of Tmax and Tmin in the future (Fig. S8). The Tmax raised
    by 1.1 ℃ and 1.5 ℃ during 2030–2049 under the scenarios of SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5,
    respectively. The Tmin elevated more than the Tmax, which increased by 1.6 ℃ and
    1.9 ℃ in the future period under two emission scenarios. 3.2.2. Change in crop
    yields Compared with the historical period, winter wheat yields showed an increasing
    trend, and summer maize yields indicated a slightly decreasing trend generally
    under the changing meteorological factors in the future period (2030–2049). Specifically,
    the average winter wheat yield of the six sprinkler irrigation schemes increased
    by approximately 7% and 6% under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively
    (Fig. 5); and the average summer maize yield changed by approximately − 1% under
    the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios (Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image

    of winter wheat and summer maize of the six sprinkler irrigation schemes under
    the SSP2–4.5 and SSP5–8.5 scenarios during 2030–2049 compared to the historical
    period (1993–2012). S1-S6 represents sprinkler irrigation schemes. Different colors
    represent different irrigation amounts. In detail, the increase in winter wheat
    yield compared with the historical period in sprinkler irrigation schemes S1 and
    S2 (the two schemes with a 225 mm irrigation quota) was 4.6% and 3.7% under the
    SSP2-4.5 scenario. For the sprinkler irrigation schemes S3, S4, and S5 (the three
    schemes with a 150 mm irrigation quota), the increase rate promoted to 7.5%, 6.7%,
    and 5.6%, respectively; and an 11.9% increase rate was found under the sprinkler
    irrigation scheme S6 with a 75 mm irrigation quota. These estimation results indicated
    that the climate-driven impacts on increasing wheat yield would become larger
    with a smaller irrigation quota (i.e., a stricter limit for irrigation pumping);
    and under the same irrigation quota, a higher sprinkler irrigation frequency could
    be conducive to promoting the increase in wheat yield further (e.g., the variable
    presented a trend of S1 >S2 and S3 >S4 >S5). Similar characteristics of these
    changes were found under the SSP5-8.5 scenario (Fig. 5). This suggests that the
    positive impact of future climate on the increase in winter wheat yield could
    partially mitigate the yield loss caused by limited irrigation, and the sprinkler
    irrigation schedules with a higher irrigation frequency are more effective in
    enhancing this yield compensation effect. Under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, the summer
    maize showed an increased yield trend in 11 subbasins (locating at the south of
    the study area, mostly in the Plain of the Ziya River basin, see Fig. S9) and
    a decreased yield trend in the other 11 subbasins. Under the SSP5-8.5 scenario,
    the statistics of the above corresponding trends were 8 and 14 (Fig. S9). The
    spatial distributions in wheat and maize yields are presented in Figs. S10-S13.
    3.2.3. Changes in shallow groundwater variation and soil water balance With future
    climate change, precipitation in the study area was projected to increase, which
    could lead to higher amounts of soil infiltration, percolation, and groundwater
    recharge ultimately. Relative to the historical period, the percolation from the
    bottom of the root zone (2 m deep) during the winter wheat growing season under
    sprinkler irrigation schemes S1-S6 increased by approximately 122% and 71% in
    the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively, and hence reduced the decline
    in shallow groundwater table by 0.21 m and 0.15 m correspondingly (Fig. 6). In
    the summer maize growing season, an increase of approximately 68% and 58% in the
    percolation was found under the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios, respectively,
    and hence accelerated the recovery in shallow groundwater table by 0.25 m and
    0.27 m, correspondingly (Fig. 6). In consequence, the annual percolation under
    the future period could increase by 73 mm (SSP2-4.5) and 61 mm (SSP5-8.5) with
    reference to the historical period, which would alleviate the groundwater withdrawal
    under the six sprinkler irrigation schemes to a certain extent (Fig. 6). It is
    noteworthy that during 2030–2049, the simulated variation in shallow groundwater
    table under sprinkler irrigation schemes using an irrigation quota of 225 mm,
    150 mm, and 75 mm was − 0.37 m/yr, 0.01 m/yr, and 0.40 m/yr, respectively, in
    the SSP2-4.5 scenario, and − 0.45 m/yr, − 0.05 m/yr, and 0.34 m/yr, respectively,
    under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. It implied that the decline in shallow groundwater
    at the regional scale could be stopped generally to the mid-21st century if a
    sprinkler irrigation scheme with a 150 mm irrigation quota was conducted from
    2030; and if the irrigation quota was further limited to 75 mm, approximately
    7–8 m recovery in shallow groundwater table at the regional scale could be achieved
    within the following 20 years, which should contribute a significant effect to
    the groundwater ecological remediation. Download : Download high-res image (617KB)

    In the future period, the ensemble means of the selected five GCMs showed that
    the ETa of the winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system increased by approximately
    4%; and this increased rate was superior under the sprinkler irrigation schemes
    with a smaller irrigation quota (Fig. 6). However, the EP of both winter wheat
    and summer maize presented a decreasing trend, with an average degree of approximately
    12 mm and 5 mm, respectively. The ES during winter wheat and summer maize growing
    seasons increased by 17 mm and 15 mm, respectively, and the CANEV did not show
    a significant change in comparison with the historical period. It reveals the
    necessity to promote techniques of soil and water conservation to help reduce
    ineffective evaporation and preserve soil moisture under sprinkler irrigation
    schemes in the future. 3.3. Optimized sprinkler irrigation schedule for winter
    wheat under future climate change The optimized sprinkler irrigation schedule
    for the study area (i.e., the recommended sprinkler irrigation schemes for the
    22 subbasins) under the constraint of stopping groundwater drawdown is shown in
    Fig. 7. Specifically, under the SSP2-4.5 scenario, the dominant sprinkler irrigation
    schedules after optimization were found to be schemes S3 (with a limited irrigation
    quota of 150 mm) and S6 (with a limited irrigation quota of 75 mm). The 11 subbasins,
    which should conduct sprinkler irrigation scheme S3, could stabilize the winter
    wheat yield, whereas the 8 subbasins in terms of sprinkler irrigation scheme S6
    would face a 16% reduction on average in winter wheat yield (Fig. 7a). Under the
    SSP5-8.5 scenario, sprinkler irrigation schemes S3 and S6 were still the dominant
    recommending plans after optimization, which referred to 17 subbasins in total
    (Fig. 7b). In general, benefiting from the future climate change, 11 subbasins,
    which account for approximately 50% of the study area, could achieve shallow groundwater
    equilibrium and winter wheat yield stabilization simultaneously under the sprinkler
    irrigation schedule with a limited 150 mm or 225 mm irrigation quota. In the other
    11 subbasins, to stop the groundwater drawdown, the sprinkler irrigation quota
    almost must be limited to 75 mm, which would result in at least 12% wheat yield
    reductions on averagely compared with the current production capacity. Averaging
    the simulated results for all 22 subbasins, the mean variation in winter wheat
    yield was approximate − 4% under the optimized sprinkler irrigation schedule for
    achieving shallow groundwater equilibrium. Download : Download high-res image

    condition was converted to stabilizing wheat production (Fig. 8), the dominant
    sprinkler irrigation schedule after optimization that minimized groundwater depletion
    referred to the schemes S3 (with a limited irrigation quota of 150 mm) and S2
    (with a limited irrigation quota of 225 mm). More subbasins were recommended with
    the S3 scheme under the SSP5-8.5 scenario (Fig. 8b). About 11 subbasins, occupying
    about 50% of the study area, could stop groundwater drawdown without losing winter
    wheat yield in response to both climate-driven and sprinkler irrigation effects.
    In the other parts of the study area, where almost all located at the the Plain
    of the Ziya River basin, to ensure a stable or increasing wheat yield in the future,
    the sprinkler irrigation quota could only be limited to 225 mm or 150 mm, which
    would result in a minimum declining rate of 0.39 m/yr in shallow groundwater table
    on average in these subbasins. Download : Download high-res image (734KB) Download

    scheme in groundwater overdraft areas The study area is a representative global
    groundwater mining area that faces an issue of reducing irrigation pumpage and
    maintaining grain production. This study selected the 1993–2012 historical period
    to quantitatively analyze the difference in wheat and maize yields and hydrological
    cycle under sprinkler and surface irrigation at the regional scale. These 20 years
    had the characteristics of high grain production, which were mainly supported
    by irrigation from wells, as the nitrogen stress was dominant before the 1990s
    (Sun and Ren, 2014), and changing boundary conditions after 2012 such as South-to-North
    Water Diversion brought variations in water resources (Long et al., 2020). We
    found that the wheat yield under sprinkler irrigation with a 225 mm quota could
    increase by approximately 12%− 14% in comparison with the surface irrigation under
    the same pumping quota, and the yield-improving effects even existed compared
    with the current surface irrigation schedule (with a 356 mm quota). Liu et al.
    (2013a) conducted a field experiment at Yucheng station (see Fig. S14), and found
    the winter wheat yield in 2002 was 6430 kg/hm2 under sprinkler irrigation with
    223 mm total amount and 4260 kg/hm2 under surface irrigation with 256 mm total
    amount, indicating an increased rate of approximately 50%. The field experiment
    at Xinxiang station (see Fig. S14) by Jha et al. (2019) presented that sprinkler
    irrigation would result in a 2% wheat yield-increasing effect in 2015 and a 1%
    wheat yield-increasing effect in 2016 compared to surface flooding irrigation
    under the same 240 mm total amount. Our simulations showed that the effect of
    increasing wheat yields would reduce under a more restrictive limited irrigation
    amount, which dropped to 1%− 4% under the 150 mm irrigation quota and converted
    to a declining trend under the 75 mm irrigation quota. The field experiment results
    in Liu et al. (2013a) also indicated a lighter increase between the sprinkler
    irrigation with a 150 mm total amount and surface irrigation with a 163 mm total
    amount, which was an 11% increase in Tongzhou station (see Fig. S14) during 2003–2004.
    Fang et al. (2018) revealed a 0.3% increase under 160 mm irrigation amount in
    2013, a − 1.4% decrease under 160 mm irrigation amount in 2014, and a 6.4% increase
    under 90 mm irrigation amount in 2015 at the Luancheng experiment station (see
    Fig. S14). These experimental results at the station level suggested the rationality
    of our simulation results at the regional scale to a certain extent. Compared
    to the adjacent Heilonggang region which faces severe deep groundwater over-pumping,
    the applicability of the sprinkler irrigation scheme seems to be stronger in the
    Taihang Piedmont plain. Li and Ren (2022) indicated that no obvious wheat yield-improving
    effects under sprinkler irrigation were found in the Heilonggang region regardless
    of whether a 225 mm, 150 mm, or 75 mm irrigation quota was set. Owing to the finer
    resolution of soil data used in the SWAP model, Li and Ren (2022) found that sprinkler
    irrigation is recommended in the area with sandy soils in each layer or sandy
    soils in the 0–70 cm layers and loamy soils in the > 70 cm layers. This could
    partially explain the difference in response to wheat yield under sprinkler irrigation
    between Taihang Piedmont plain and Heilonggang region, as the soil is tended to
    be sandy in the upstream piedmont plain due to the sediment transport in rivers
    from the mountains to the lowland (http://soil.geodata.cn/index.html). This comparison
    indicated the priority of Taihang Piedmont plain in planning and promoting sprinkler
    irrigation technology to improve the winter wheat yield of the NCP in the future.
    Percolation from the bottom of the root zone decreased significantly under the
    sprinkler irrigation schemes in comparison with the traditional surface irrigation
    method according to our simulated results. The field experiments conducted by
    Sun et al. (2006) in Tongzhou experimental station in 2003–2004 showed that the
    percolation could be ignored under sprinkler irrigation, whereas it accounted
    for more than 10% of the irrigation amount under surface irrigation. It is well-known
    that the purpose of irrigation should contribute to improving crop yield, not
    to increasing groundwater recharge. From the perspective of water use efficiency,
    although groundwater over-exploitation became more serious under sprinkler irrigation,
    the redistribution of water in soil could be more productive for the growth of
    crops, which should be important for this water shortage region. 4.2. Winter wheat-summer
    maize double cropping system resilience to future climate change How would climate
    changes affect the grain production of winter wheat and summer maize in the NCP
    is important to China’s and even global food security. The simulation results
    of the SWAT model during 2030–2049 driven by the selected five GCMs from CMIP6
    showed an approximately 6% increase in winter wheat yield and a slight decrease
    trend of about 1% in summer maize yield in the studied region with an area of
    2.3 × 104 km2. Xiao et al., 2020, Xiao et al., 2021 used the APSIM model and 33
    GCMs from CMIP5 in the Luancheng experimental station (located at the center of
    our study area, Fig. S14), and found that future climate change during 2031–2060
    (the 2040s) and 2071–2100 (the 2080s) would have a positive impact on wheat yield
    and a negative impact on maize yield, which was consistent with estimations in
    this study. Rashid et al. (2019) applied the AquaCrop model and 10 GCMs from CMIP5
    at Luancheng Station and found that the future climate changes in the 2040s, 2060s,
    and 2080s were also expected to increase winter wheat yields. In the study area,
    the increasing yield of winter wheat benefited from both raising CO2 concentration
    and the warming trend that could ease the low-temperature stress on biomass production.
    Increasing precipitation should be another driving force to mitigate water stress
    and improve wheat yield. Because maize as a C4 crop is less sensitive to changes
    in CO2 concentrations than wheat as a C3 crop (Tao and Zhang, 2011, Bassu et al.,
    2014, Asseng et al., 2019), the contribution of carbon fertilizer and precipitation
    to increase production was not enough to offset the negative impact of high temperature
    in summer, so the maize yield would present a slight decrease trend. In the terms
    of winter wheat-summer maize double cropping system, the annual yield could be
    improved and the wheat that relies on irrigation wound be more efficient in the
    future, indicating a positive effect on improving the resilience of production
    capacity to face the challenge of food security by urbanization and population
    growth. 4.3. Climate-driven and sprinkler irrigation effects on the trade-off
    between groundwater conservation and grain production Reconciling groundwater
    depletion and food security tradeoffs is critical to achieving sustainable development
    in the breadbasket region of NCP. Seeking a solution that could stop groundwater
    drawdown and ensure a stable grain yield simultaneously has long been a complicated
    and interdisciplinary research issue, as well as the water governance target.
    Under the surface irrigation schemes in the historical period, there was an irreconcilable
    tension between groundwater conservation and stabilizing wheat yield (Zhang et
    al., 2018). To achieve shallow groundwater equilibrium, at least a 42% reduction
    in wheat yield would be required (see the orange rhombus in Fig. 9). If the sprinkler
    irrigation for winter wheat was applied in these 20 years, a competition between
    a higher crop yield and a worse groundwater withdrawal occurred using the 225 mm
    and 150 mm irrigation quotas (see the circle locating at the upper left of the
    triangle in Fig. 9), and the losses of both crop yield and groundwater storage
    appeared under the 75 mm irrigation quota (see the circle locating at the left
    bottom of the triangle in Fig. 9). No matter the pumping amount was limited to
    225 mm, 150 mm, or 75 mm, a certain difference between discharge and recharge
    for aquifer still existed, resulting in a decline in the shallow groundwater table.
    It implied that changing the irrigation method to sprinkler irrigation under the
    meteorological conditions during 1993–2012 (characterized by normal and dry seasons
    according to the precipitation exceedance probabilities) could not solve the zero-sum
    game of the nexus between groundwater conservation and crop production. Download

    Trade-offs between groundwater conservation and grain production under the surface
    and sprinkler irrigation schemes in the historical and future periods. Fortunately,
    the future warming and humid environments could improve wheat yield as well as
    increase groundwater recharge in this well-irrigated plain (see the square located
    at the upper right of both circle and triangle in Fig. 9). A sensible opportunity
    for overcoming tradeoffs will embrace promoting the sprinkler irrigation technologies
    in the coming decades, along with changing future climate. Based on simulations
    and optimizations, under the sprinkler irrigation schemes during the future period
    (2030–2049), only an averagely minimal 4% reduction in wheat yield would be sacrificed
    to achieve shallow groundwater equilibrium (see the brown rhombus in Fig. 9).
    To the mid-21st century, approximately 50% of the study area could achieve the
    target of stopping groundwater drawdown and ensuring the stable wheat yield simultaneously
    under the optimized sprinkler irrigation schedule. This is a key finding for the
    current dilemma between saving irrigation pumping and rigid constraint of production
    reduction in this global groundwater mining hotspot. This study made full use
    of the characteristics of the SWAT model to conduct distributed simulations considering
    the heterogeneity of weather conditions and the underlying surface and proposed
    the recommended sprinkler irrigation schemes for 22 subbasins considering the
    double management objectives of water and food. These results could provide alternative
    strategies and quantitative references for water-saving irrigation project planning
    under the changing climate. 4.4. Limitations of this study The SWAT model could
    simulate the hydrological cycle on a finer time step, but the hourly recorded
    precipitation data are needed. Limited to the available weather data, the current
    simulation is conducted on a daily time step for 20 years, which aimed to analyze
    the long-term effects on crop and groundwater of water saving practices. In addition,
    the limitations of SWAT in providing a comprehensive depiction of the water cycle
    under the sprinkler irrigation scheme increase the uncertainty of the outcomes.
    Specifically, the intricate processes associated with sprinkler irrigation, such
    as reducing water transport losses and improving the uniformity of irrigation,
    might be difficult to simulate only using SWAT. Due to the limitations of collected
    data and SWAT model structure, the micro-sprinkler irrigation technologies that
    use dissolved fertilizer along with the sprinkled water cannot be considered in
    these simulations. The above result is based on modeling and should be further
    validated in the future by applying empirical evidence if supported by data. Related
    studies pointed out that the crop uptakes of water and nitrogen could be more
    efficient and wheat yield could be increased under micro-sprinkling irrigation
    scheduling (Dong et al., 2016, Li et al., 2019a, Li et al., 2019b, Lv et al.,
    2020), further work to modify the SWAT model should be performed to evaluate this
    sprinkler irrigation technology. In the hydrological simulations for future periods,
    the effects of groundwater recharge from ecological water supplement in rives
    brought by the South-to-North Water Diversion after 2014 are ignored, which means
    that the recovery in the shallow groundwater table we estimated for policy-making
    should be conservative. With regards to the optimization, the stable wheat yield
    was estimated by comparing it to the production level in the historical period,
    which did not consider the population variation in the future. Morever, the positive
    effects on grain yield of some agronomic measures (e.g., changing the sowing density,
    and soil moisture conservation cultivation) and crop variety improvement cannot
    be reflected in these simulations as well. 5. Conclusions Compared with traditional
    surface irrigation scheme, the sprinkler irrigation scheme was beneficial to increase
    winter wheat yield under the same irrigation quota in general. Based on the measured
    historical weather data, the application of sprinkler irrigation resulted in an
    increase of 12%− 14% in wheat yield under the 225 mm irrigation quota compared
    to the corresponding surface irrigation, and a stable wheat yield for the 150 mm
    irrigation quota. It was related to the variations in ETa of 41 mm and 11 mm,
    and changes in crop transpiration of 29 mm and 1 mm, respectively, under the sprinkler
    irrigation with 225 mm, and 150 mm irrigation quotas. The percolation from the
    bottom of the root zone (2 m deep) decreased by 3%− 37% under sprinkler irrigation
    schemes, which accelerated shallow groundwater depletion during the winter wheat
    season. Future climate favored winter wheat yield, percolation, and groundwater
    recharge. The simulation results for the projected future climate scenarios showed
    a 6%− 7% increase in winter wheat yield under the six sprinkler irrigation schemes
    in comparison with the historical period. The ETa of the winter wheat-summer maize
    rotation system increased by approximately 4%, and most of the increase was due
    to the larger soil evaporation. Increasing precipitation in the future could improve
    the percolation in the growth periods of winter wheat and summer maize by 71%− 122%
    and 58%− 68%, respectively, hence resulting in more groundwater recharge. The
    increasing recharge could potentially lead to a substantial slowing of depletion
    or even aquifer recovery under sprinkler irrigation schemes in the future. By
    the mid-21st century, approximately 50% of the study area could achieve shallow
    groundwater equilibrium and stable wheat production simultaneously under the optimized
    sprinkler irrigation schedules. Optimized sprinkler irrigation with a higher irrigation
    frequency was recommended. If the shallow groundwater equilibrium must be realized,
    sprinkler irrigation schemes with the limited irrigation quotas of 150 mm (S3)
    and 75 mm (S6) were the dominant recommending plans. And if the winter wheat yield
    must be ensured stable, sprinkler irrigation schemes with the limited irrigation
    quotas of 225 mm (S2) and 150 mm (S3) were recommended. These simulation-evaluation-optimization
    results could provide an important reference for the global groundwater mining
    hotspots to balance water scarcity and food security. CRediT authorship contribution

    Municipal wastewater treatment is a crucial issue in terms of environmental pollution
    and public health. Discharging untreated wastewater to the receiving bodies can
    lead to severe environmental problems due to the organic and inorganic pollutants
    it contains. The high amount of municipal wastewater makes the treatment challenging
    due to the high amount of sludge to be produced and the energy requirement. At
    this point, a high rate and effective treatment technology for municipal wastewater
    becomes essential. Besides the effective treatment, the cost of treatment in conventional
    treatment processes is another challenge for decision-makers. It has been estimated
    that the energy consumed by aeration accounts for 45–75 % of the total energy
    cost of a wastewater treatment plant, while the COD-sludge conversion has been
    estimated to account for 25–50 %, resulting in increases in the cost of sludge
    disposal [1]. Municipal wastewater treatment plants account for approximately
    3 % of the U.S. electrical energy demand [2]. The treatment of municipal wastewater
    with conventional aerobic processes such as conventional activated sludge and
    trickling filter is not economically feasible, and the low organic content of
    municipal wastewater makes it particularly challenging to treat with conventional
    anaerobic processes such as continuous stirred-tank reactors, upflow anaerobic
    sludge blankets, and expanded granular sludge beds [3]. Among the available municipal
    wastewater treatment technologies, anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnMBRs) come
    into prominence with their high treatment performance and biogas recovery from
    organics in wastewater. With the widespread use of AnMBRs, wastewater can turn
    from a problem that needs to be eliminated into a value-added energy source. AnMBRs
    gained a growing interest and applied for a variety of wastewater, i.e., municipal
    and industrial [4]. Many applications are available in the lab., pilot, or full
    scales [5]. AnMBRs can be operated in psychrophilic, mesophilic, and thermophilic
    temperature conditions. The effect of temperature on biological reaction rates
    is of great importance to the overall efficiency of the biological treatment process.
    Generally, a decrease in temperature decreases the microorganism activity. In
    addition, temperature has a great influence on the sedimentation characteristics
    of biological solids, biogas solubility, the solubility of inorganic components,
    and viscosity change [6]. Therefore, conventional anaerobic technologies operated
    without external heating may only be favorable for tropical or semi-tropical climates.
    However, AnMBR, on the other hand, may have the advantage of serving a wider temperature
    range because increased biomass retention compensates for the reduced growth rates
    of anaerobic microorganisms in cold climate conditions [7]. The most prominent
    feature of AnMBRs is the effective separation of biomass and increasing the solid
    retention time (SRT) independent from hydraulic retention time (HRT) since the
    growth rate of anaerobic bacteria is quite lower than that of aerobic bacteria
    [8]. However, microbial activity significantly depends on the climate, and microbial
    growth can decrease dramatically at low temperatures. In recent years, submerged
    anaerobic membrane bioreactors (AnSMBRs) have gained attention as an alternative
    due to their advantages, such as high organic loading rates, low energy consumption,
    and lower sludge production [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13]]. The integration of
    membrane filtration in AnSMBRs enables the production of high-quality effluent
    and the retention of microorganisms in the reactor, leading to enhanced treatment
    efficiency [14]. Also, the physical treatment by membranes provides a stable treatment
    efficiency to meet the discharge standards. The permeate of AnMBRs is suitable
    for direct irrigation, which can contribute to circular economy goals. The most
    challenging parameter in AnMBRs is fouling. Due to the accumulation of solid particles,
    extracellular polymeric substances (EPSs), and inorganics within the membrane
    pores or a cake layer on the membrane surface, membrane permeability decreases
    over time [15]. The control of the cake layer to obtain a consistent flux is crucial
    for the operation of AnMBRs. The fouling of membranes reduces permeability and
    increases energy consumption. Also, the life of the membrane significantly depends
    on membrane fouling. Therefore, considerable research has concentrated on fouling
    mechanisms in AnMBRs [5,[15], [16], [17]]. The microbial community within the
    bioreactor plays a crucial role in both treatment efficiency [18] and membrane
    fouling behavior. The diversity and abundance of micro- organisms can affect the
    production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which are major contributors
    to membrane fouling [19]. Despite intensive research on AnMBRs, the complexity
    of municipal wastewater makes it challenging to understand the treatment mechanisms.
    The high amount and low organic content of municipal wastewater make the high
    operational membrane fluxes crucial for feasible AnMBR treatment. Therefore, the
    prevention of fouling on membranes is essential. Membrane fouling results from
    the interaction between the membrane material and the components in biological
    sludge. The seasonal variation of municipal wastewater characterization and amount
    varies seasonally, and this situation affects the operational parameters in AnMBR,
    such as pH, temperature, alkalinity, volatile fatty acids, organic loading rate,
    and hydraulic retention time [20,21]. These parameters can significantly affect
    the energy efficiency (low methane production) and operational conditions (membrane
    flux) of AnMBRs. Also, wastewater treatment bioreactors have one of the most complex
    microbial ecosystems, so this complexity can play an important role in the production
    of microbial metabolites such as EPS and SMP which a play crucial role in membrane
    fouling [22]. There are many different membrane materials, modules, configurations,
    pore dimensions, and operational conditions that can be applied. There is still
    a research gap in the use of AnMBRs for municipal wastewater treatment. Research
    is needed to elucidate the fouling mechanisms, microbial community interactions,
    and conditions for energy-positive processes in municipal wastewater treatment.
    Although some studies have been conducted on the c of AnSMBRs, the microbial community
    dynamics within the reactor remain poorly understood. Therefore, in this study,
    the municipal wastewater treatment performance of a submerged anaerobic membrane
    bioreactor was investigated, and the membrane fouling along with the microbial
    community dynamics within the bioreactor were evaluated. A standardized membrane
    module was modified to prevent membrane fibers'' compaction and increase gas sparging
    efficiency. In the scope of this study, chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nutrient
    removal, methane production, soluble microbial products (SMP) and extracellular
    polymeric substances (EPS), transmembrane pressure (TMP), capillary suction time
    (CST), specific resistance to filtration (SRF), and the microbial community within
    the reactor were investigated in detail to understand the interaction between
    performance, fouling, and the microbial community. The findings of this study
    provide valuable insights into the potential of AnSMBRs for municipal wastewater
    treatment and can contribute to the development of sustainable and cost-effective
    wastewater treatment. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Reactor design and experimental
    set-up A laboratory scale submerged AnMBR system was developed and used in this
    study (Fig. 1). The AnMBR system consisted of a glass reactor and a process automation
    control system. The glass reactor had an effective volume of 7 L and included
    a water jacket for heating and cooling. A circulation water bath (LAUDA Alpha
    RA8, Deutschland) was used for temperature control of AnMBR at mesophilic conditions
    (35 ± 2 °C). The reactor cover included five parts: mixing, sensors, feeding,
    filtration, sampling, and gas collection. Two different mixing mechanisms were
    applied to the system. A mechanical stirrer (IKA RW20, Deutschland) was used for
    mixing at a rate of 150 rpm. A Teflon-coated stirring rod was used for mixing,
    and water sealing was applied to the intersection of the adaptor and rod to prevent
    gas leaks that may arise from mechanical mixing. Also, the produced biogas was
    recycled by a diaphragm pump (KNF, N86 KTDCB, Freiburg, Germany) from the bottom
    of the reactor with a 1 L/min flow rate adjusted by a rotameter (Gentek, 1–5 L/min,
    Kocaeli, Turkiye) to provide a shearing effect on the membrane module and reduce
    the cake development on the membrane. Download : Download high-res image (300KB)

    ORP values were measured online by sensors (HAMILTON Polilyte Plus Arc 120 series).
    Two separate peristaltic pumps, controlled by an automation unit, were used for
    feeding and filtration (LONGER BT101, China). A conductive level sensor measured
    the water level in the reactor. The produced biogas was measured by a gas flowmeter
    (Bioprocess μFlow, BPC Instrument, Sweden). A polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF)
    hollow fiber membrane module (MEM-TEK) with an active filtration area and pore
    size of 0.1 m2 and 0.1 μm, respectively, was used. The bottom of the membrane
    module was cut, and the fibers were released to prevent the compaction of fibers.
    The transmembrane pressure (TMP) was measured online by a pressure sensor (ATEK
    4–20 mA; −1…0 bar, Kocaeli, Türkiye). An automation system controlled by a PLC
    unit was used for the operation of AnMBR to control the pump and data collection.
    The AnMBR control system contains a single-board computer called the Raspberry
    Pi, working with Linux operating system. AnMBR software was written in C Sharp
    (C≠) language with the software program named as QT. The pH, ORP, TMP, and temperature
    values were monitored and recorded by the automation unit. 2.2. Operation procedure
    An acclimation procedure that lasted for 54 days was conducted to enhance the
    treatment efficiency. First of all, acetic acid was fed to AnMBR as the substrate,
    and the ratio of simulated municipal wastewater periodically increased to 100
    %. Sludge was only withdrawn for analysis, which means the sludge age may be accepted
    as infinite. The AnMBR was operated for 121 days at two different hydraulic retention
    times (HRTs). In P1 lasted for 33 days, the HRT and flux averaged 23.5 ± 0.4 h
    and 3 ± 0.1 L/(m2·h) (LMH), respectively. In P2 lasted for 88 days, the HRT and
    flux averaged 12.4 ± 1.2 h and 5.7 ± 0.5 LMH, respectively. The organic loading
    rates were 0.53 ± 0.04 and 1.00 ± 0.14 kg/(m3·d) for P1 and P2, respectively.
    Average total solid (TS) and volatile solid (VS) concentrations were 28.1 ± 2
    gTS/L, 9.5 ± 1.2 gVS/L, and 30.2 ± 5 gTS/L, 9.5 ± 1.2 gVS/L during the P1 and
    P2, respectively. The inorganic solid content in the bioreactor slightly increased
    in P2. The average VS/TS ratios in the bioreactor were 33.8 ± 3.4 % and 32.2 ±
    5.2 % during P1 and P2, respectively. The reactor temperature was set to 36.5
    °C. Fouling on the hollow fiber membrane was mitigated by controlling the biogas
    sparging and filtration regime. The biogas sparging rate was set to 0.9 m3/m2/h.
    The filtration cycle was set to 10 min filtration followed by 1 min relaxation.
    Backwashing was applied when TMP exceeded 0.1 bar by reversing the flow direction
    at the same flow rate for 1 min. 2.3. Seed sludge and wastewater characteristics
    The inoculum used in the study was freshly provided from a full-scale UASB reactor
    treating sugarbeet processing wastewater from a wastewater treatment plant of
    a sugar factory at 35 °C. Simulated concentrated municipal wastewater was used
    as a substrate. The composition of simulated wastewater was modified from Ozgun
    [23]. The composition and characterization of simulated and concentrated municipal
    wastewater are given in Table 1, Table 2, respectively. Table 1. Composition of

    according to standard methods 2540C [24]. COD based on the oxidation with chromosulfuric
    acid method (Analog to DIN 38409 H41, ISO 6060-1989) and total phosphorous (TP)
    were determined with Hach-Lange COD and TP test kits by using Hach Lange DR5000
    spectrophotometer (Hach Lange GmbH, Düsseldorf, Deutschland). Total khejdahl ammonium
    (TKN) was determined with Büchi TKN measurement units (Digest Automat K-438 and
    Büchi Auto Kjeldahl Unit K-370, Flawil, Switzerland), and Büchi 191/2015 procedure
    for TKN measurement in water and wastewater was followed. Alkalinity and volatile
    fatty acids (VFA) analyses were performed using Standard Methods 2320 B and 5560C,
    respectively [24]. The methane content of biogas produced in the reactor was determined
    using gas chromatography (GC, Varian 4900, California, US) equipped with a thermal
    conductivity detector (TCD) and 10 m PPQ column. The temperatures of the injector
    port and column oven were 110 °C, and 50 °C, respectively. Helium was used as
    the carrier gas at a flow rate of 25 mL/min. SMP and EPS contents of sludge were
    measured. The procedure for SMP and EPS measurements was modified from Li et al.
    and presented in Fig. 2 [25]. The phenol–sulfuric acid method was used to determine
    the polysaccharide contents [26]. Bradford method was used to determine the protein
    concentrations [27]. The protein and carbohydrate concentrations were expressed
    as COD using the stoichiometric conversion coefficients of 1.5 and 1.2, respectively,
    where, assuming the formula of the protein and carbohydrate as C16H24O5N4 and
    C6H10O5, respectively [28]. Download : Download high-res image (165KB) Download

    Filterability tests CST and SRF tests were conducted to determine the filterability
    properties of sludge. CST and SRF also can give an idea about the relationship
    between fouling and filterability. CST was measured using Triton Electronics 304
    M with its own filter, and the values were normalized by the TS concentration.
    SRF was determined by a dead-end filtration unit (Sterlitech HP4750, Auburn, US).
    The sludge concentration was set to 10 gTSS/L before the experiment, and it was
    filtered from 0.7 μm standard filter paper under 0.5 ± 0.02 bar pressure. A digital
    manometer (Keller ECO2, Winterthur, Switzerland) was used to adjust the pressure.
    The weight of filtered water was recorded online by a precision scale (AND 6200-J).
    The total filtration time was 30 min, and the first 10 min were excluded due to
    the nonlinear filtration line. The given equation [29] was used to calculate the
    SRF value. (1) Where;ΔP: Pressure (Pa).A: Effective filtration area (m2).b: Slope
    (s·L−2).μ: Viscosity (Pa·s).C: TS concentration (kg·m−3). 2.4.3. Metagenomic analysis
    The samples were collected from AnMBR on days 0, 53, 102, and 142, corresponding
    to the reactor''s startup phase and the final day of each operational period.
    The genomic DNAs were isolated from the samples using the NucleoSpin® Soil Kit
    (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) following the manufacturer''s specifications. The extracted
    DNAs were quantified by NanoDrop 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. DE, USA)
    and then were kept at −20 °C for further analysis. The bacterial communities were
    determined by 16S rRNA gene-targeted sequencing using the Illumina® MiSeq™ platform.
    The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene (Comeau et al. 2011) was targeted in the
    amplicon sequencing using the primers 341F (5′-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3) and 805R (5′-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3′)
    [30]. Following the purification and quantification of the libraries, the sequencing
    was carried out on the MiSeq™ instrument (Illumina®, USA) using 300 bp paired-end
    chemistry. Demultiplexing and clipping of sequence adapters from raw sequences
    were performed by CASAVA data analysis software (Illumina®, USA). The sequences
    were analyzed QIIME2 v2020.2 following amplicon sequencing workflow [31]. First,
    the cutadapt plugin was used to remove the PCR primers from the sequences [32],
    paired-end reads were joined, and a quality filter was applied. Then, the sequences
    were denoised [33]. The taxonomic assignment was done using the SILVA database
    for each amplicon sequence variant (ASV) using the ‘feature-classifier classify-sklearn’
    plugin against the pre-trained Naive Bayes classifier specific for 16S rRNA (classifier_silva_132_99_16S_V3.V4_341F_805R.qza)
    [34]. The community structures were visualized by Krona graphics [35]. The alpha
    diversity was calculated from the final ASV tables, and the beta diversity was
    calculated based on Bray-Curtis dissimilarity between samples. The prediction
    of the functional potentials of the bacterial communities in the AnMBR was performed
    using Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction of Unobserved
    States (PICRUSt) software from 16S rRNA gene data (Galaxy version 1.0.0) [36]
    on the data analyzed by the Greengenes database (version 13.5). For the annotations,
    the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases were used at level
    2. The raw sequences in this study were submitted to the EMBL-EBI database with
    the accession number PRJEB44727 (ERP142206). 2.4.4. Energy balance The system''s
    overall energy balance was evaluated. The total energy consumption comprises feeding,
    membrane filtration, biogas sparging, mechanical mixing, and heating related energy.
    The generated energy estimation was based on the produced biogas. Estimations
    of energy consumption and generation were calculated based on one cubic meter
    of treated wastewater. The energy requirements for the pumps (feeding and membrane
    filtration) were calculated by the given eq. (2) where P is the power requirement
    (kW), Q is the flow rate (m3/s), γ is 9800 N/m3, E represents the hydraulic pressure
    head (m), and η is the pump efficiency of 75 %. The energy requirement for heating
    of reactor was calculated by the given equation. (3) where: C1 = specific heat
    capacity of feedstock accepted as 4.18 (MJ tonne−1 °C−1), Q = volume to be added
    (m3), ΔT = temperature difference (°C). The energy production through methane
    was calculated (Eq. (4)). The energy content of 1 m3 methane was accepted as 10.55
    kWh. The energy conversion coefficients were accepted as 40 % and 45 % for electricity
    and heat, respectively. (4) where: E = energy production (kWh), Q = volume of
    methane (m3), C2 = energy equivalent of one cubic meter methane (kWh) and η is
    the conversion efficiency. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. AnMBR treatment performance
    The COD removal performance of AnMBR was evaluated after the acclimation period.
    Therefore, data assessed in Fig. 3 initiated by the end of the acclimation period.
    CODs, both in the permeate and the supernatant, were analyzed to assess the performance
    of biological treatment and membrane separately. In P1, the average COD values
    of feed, supernatant, and permeate were 447 ± 55 mg/L, 58 ± 11 mg/L, and 26 ±
    15 mg/L, respectively. In P1, the COD removal efficiency of AnMBR averaged 94.3
    ± 2.9 %. In the AnMBR system, it is seen that the permeate COD value increases
    over time in P1, parallel to increasing feed COD. Membrane filtration performance
    varied depending on the load. The average COD removal efficiency in P1 remained
    86.7 % ± 2.9. In P2, the permeate COD is less stable compared to P1 as the feed,
    supernatant, and permeate values averaged 457 ± 87 mg/L, 71 ± 26 mg/L, and 33
    ± 14 mg/L, respectively. In P2, the average COD removal efficiencies in the supernatant
    and permeate were 85 ± 5 % and 93 ± 3 %, respectively. In the AnMBR system, there
    was a slight increase in the permeate COD after day 73 parallel to feed COD. The
    observed COD concentration in the bioreactor was less affected by the variation
    of the feed COD concentration compared to the one in permeate. In the P2, decreasing
    the HRT caused the increase of flux together with the organic loading rate in
    parallel. High and stable COD removal performance was achieved during the operation
    of AnMBR. High COD removal efficiency was obtained in the bioreactor due to high
    biological treatment performance. When the COD values of the bioreactor and permeate
    were compared, it has seen that only 7–15 % of COD was rejected by the membrane.
    Compared to the literature, relatively similar COD removals were obtained in the
    present study [37,38]. Download : Download high-res image (451KB) Download : Download

    of simulated domestic wastewater by a 3 L submerged AnMBR [39]. KUBOTA''s polyethylene
    flat-layer membrane module with a pore diameter of 0.4 μm was used. Membrane flux
    changed between 10 and 20 LMH. The study investigated the effect of the HRT on
    treatment performance. The COD concentrations in the supernatant at 3, 6, 12,
    and 24 h HRTs were 147.4 ± 3.3 mg/L, 133.2 ± 5.4 mg/L, 118.0 ± 3.2 mg/L and 115.1
    ± 3.3 mg/L, respectively. The COD concentrations in the permeate were 45.2 ± 2.7
    mg/L, 38.0 ± 2.4 mg/L, 37.7 ± 2.7 mg/L and 33.8 ± 2.1 mg/L in respective order.
    In our study, the obtained COD values in the supernatant at 24 HRT hours were
    nearly half of Hu and Stuckey [39]. Nevertheless, The COD concentrations in permeate
    for 12 and 24 h HRT are similar in both studies. Huang et al. investigated the
    effect of SRT (30, 60, and 90 days) on domestic wastewater treatment efficiency
    with externally submerged AnMBR [37]. A polyether sulfone flat layer membrane
    module with a pore diameter of 0.45 μm was used. The study used real pre-settled
    wastewater with a COD concentration of 426.8 ± 59.4. In all three SRTs, nearly
    60 mg/L permeate COD concentration was reached, corresponding to over 83 % removal
    efficiency. Compared to our study, a similar permeate COD concentration was obtained,
    and the overall COD removal efficiency was slightly lower. Gouveia et al. investigated
    the treatability of real municipal wastewater in a pilot scale AnMBR with a volume
    of 326 L [38]. In the study, a ZW-10 Zenon, GE ultrafiltration membrane module
    with a pore diameter of 0.045 μm was placed on the upper part of the UASB. The
    system was operated at a temperature of 18 °C. The COD concentration of the feed
    wastewater was 978 ± 210 mg/L. In the study, when the hydraulic retention time
    was reduced from 20 h to 12 h, the permeate COD concentration increased from 93.7
    ± 11.2 mg/L to 147 ± 17.5 mg/L. In both HRTs, approximately 89 % COD removal efficiency
    was obtained. Compared to our study, the permeate COD concentration was quite
    higher; however, the overall removal efficiency was higher due to higher feeding
    concentration. Ozgun et al. investigated the treatability of simulated municipal
    wastewater with an external AnMBR [40]. In the study, UASB was followed by upstream
    filtration. A polyethersulfone ultrafiltration membrane module with a pore diameter
    of 0.03 μm was used. The reactor was operated at 25 °C and 6 h at HRT. The COD
    concentration of the feed wastewater is 530 ± 30 mg/L. Ozgun et al. achieved a
    COD removal efficiency of 92 % [40]. Compared to our study, higher COD removal
    efficiency was achieved. Lei et al. investigated the treatment of synthetic sewage
    at an ambient temperature of 25 °C. The effective reactor volume was 6 L, and
    two parallel flat sheet membranes made of polyvinylidene fluoride, with an average
    pore size of 0.1 μm, was used. Lei et al. achieved 95.7 % ± 1.6 % COD removal
    efficiency with an effluent COD concentration of <50 mg/L [17]. The methane yield
    is the most critical factor in determining whether the AnMBR system is economically
    feasible. For AnMBR systems to be preferable to conventional aerobic processes
    that are currently widely used in municipal wastewater treatment, it is crucial
    that the investment (high tank volume) and operational (membrane and pumping energy
    requirement) costs of the AnMBR system can be partially met with the energy produced.
    In order to reveal the methane production efficiency and economic feasibility
    of the AnMBR system, the methane yields obtained per gCOD removed were calculated.
    The variation of methane production efficiency obtained in the AnMBR system over
    time was presented in Fig. 3(d). At the beginning of P1, the bioreactor was exposed
    to atmospheric oxygen when the system was opened due to the problems such as enstrumentation
    and clogging. Since N2 gas was purged through the bioreactor to maintain anaerobic
    conditions, it took time for the gas composition in the reactor to reach equilibrium.
    Accordingly, the methane production efficiency remained at low levels for a while.
    Then, the system reached equilibrium at the end of the 1st period. Excluding the
    first week measurements during the P1, the average methane yield was 197.5 ± 32.4
    mL CH4/gCODconsumed. Methane yields were stable during the first 35 days of P2.
    On the 69th day, a new membrane module was installed in the AnMBR system due to
    the damage to the existing membrane, and the bioreactor was exposed to the atmosphere
    again. Therefore, the gas composition has changed, and the methane production
    efficiency decreased. On the 116th day, the methane production efficiency was
    low due to the system sealing problem. Excluding the low methane production efficiency
    due to technical problems, methane yield averaged 207 ± 17.3 mL CH4/gCODconsumed.
    When the 121-day operating period of the AnMBR system was evaluated, it was revealed
    that the methane yields were not affected by the COD loading rate, and averaged
    value was calculated as 200 ± 23 mL CH4/gCODconsumed. Martinez-Sosa et al. determined
    the methane yield as 270 mL CH4/gCOD and 240 mL CH4/gCOD at 35 °C and 20 °C, respectively,
    for the treatment of dilute wastewater consisting of municipal wastewater and
    glucose in AnMBR [41]. Lin et al. investigated the treatability of real municipal
    wastewater for 106 days with a laboratory-scale 60 L submerged AnMBR system [42].
    Temperature and HRT were 30 °C and 10 h, respectively. While 90 % COD removal
    efficiency was obtained in the study, 260 mL CH4/gCOD methane production efficiency
    was obtained. Mei et al. studied the treatment of real municipal wastewater at
    low HRT in an external submerged AnMBR with a volume of 60 L [43]. The AnMBR was
    operated at 2.2 h HRT. A flat sheet membrane module with a pore diameter of 0.2
    μm was used in the AnMBR system, and the system was operated at 6 LMH. During
    the 340 days of operation, an average of 87 % COD removal and 120 mL CH4/gCODconsumed
    methane production efficiency were obtained. Mei et al. stated that only 30 %
    of the inlet COD could be converted to methane [43]. Peña et al. investigated
    the treatment of real municipal wastewater in a pilot-scale external submerged
    AnMBR with a volume of 496 L [9]. The COD of the wastewater used in the study
    was 1729 ± 914 mg/L, which was quite high compared to the one used in our study.
    The permeate COD value was around 150 mg/L, corresponding to ≥90 % COD removal
    at an HRT range of 8–10 h. The highest methane production rate was 140 mL CH4/gCODconsumed.
    Lei et al. obtained a high-quality biogas with a methane content of over 85 %
    in a lab-scale AnMBR operated at 25 °C. The methane yield was 0.298 LCH4/gCODremoved,
    which corresponds to 78 % of the influent COD was converted to methane [17]. The
    methane yield in our study is in line with the values reported in the literature.
    A considerable amount of methane may not be recovered as lost with the permeate
    as dissolved methane. The recovery of dissolved methane in the permeate may increase
    the energy efficiency of the process with additional processes such as degasification
    [44]. The pH plays an essential role in anaerobic digestion (AD) processes as
    it influences the chemical equilibria of NH3, H2S, and VFAs, which could inhibit
    the microorganisms'' activity and cause the failure of AD [45]. The methanogenesis
    phase, at which CO2, H2, and VFAs were converted into CH4, proceeds at pH 6.5–8.2,
    while the optimum range for hydrolysis and acidogenesis is pH 5.5 and 6.5, respectively.
    Taking all this into account, it has been reported that the optimum pH range for
    anaerobic digestion is 6.8–7.4 [46]. The initial pH in the AnMBR was 7.5, showing
    a decreasing trend during P1 and lasting at pH 7. The average permeate pH during
    P2 was 7 ± 0.1 (Fig. 4(a)). Anaerobic reactor content and permeate pH values increased
    or decreased, usually in parallel with the pH value of the simulated municipal
    wastewater. The pH value of the feed varied between 6.8 and 7.5 during 121 days
    of operation and averaged 7.1 ± 0.1. Download : Download high-res image (210KB)

    and alkalinity concentrations in the AnMBR. Alkalinity and VFA are critical parameters
    for the stable operation of anaerobic bioreactors [47]. During the study, the
    AnMBR system was operated with alkalinity provided in simulated municipal wastewater.
    Alkalinity was only added to the system to eliminate the possibility of inhibition
    on days when the pH value suddenly decreased. On the 37th, 74th, and 76th days,
    500 mg CaCO3/L alkalinity was externally added to the system. The alkalinity in
    the permeate ranged between 340 and 590 mg CaCO3/L and averaged 457 mg CaCO3/L.
    The alkalinity value of the wastewater ranged between 300 and 480 mg CaCO3/L and
    averaged 380 mg CaCO3/L. The alkalinity in the bioreactor was higher than feed
    for almost the entire operation. It is estimated that the alkalinity increases
    were due to the breakdown of proteins in simulated domestic wastewater into amino
    groups and the breakdown of microorganisms in the AnMBR system [48]. VFA analysis
    was performed to determine whether acid accumulation occurred into the AnMBR system.
    VFA concentrations mostly ranged between 25 mg/L and 50 mg/L in the P1 (Fig. 4(b)),
    and P2, respectively. The VFA concentrations showed a slight increase and fluctuated
    during the first 40 days due to increased organic load. From day 76, the VFA concentration
    showed a stable change. On the 73rd and 74th days, the VFA concentration increased
    due to interference with the system but decreased again in a short duration. In
    P2, the average VFA concentration was 27 mg/L. Especially after the 110th day,
    the VFA concentrations were relatively low. VFA:Alkalinity ratio is a practical
    indicator to observe the acid accumulation in anaerobic reactors. The sudden increase
    in the VFA:Alkalinity ratio indicates a possible failure in AD. The ratio in a
    well-operated system ranges between 0.1 and 0.35. If the ratio exceeds 0.8, it
    is regarded as indicative of the overloading of the system [49,50]. In our study,
    VFA:Alkalinity ratio was mostly below 0.35 and never exceeded 0.8 in AnMBR. The
    nutrient removal only occurred due to sludge production since microorganisms take
    nutrients for their metabolism. The average TKN and TP concentrations in feed
    and permeate were 55 ± 3 mgTKN/L, 14 ± 1 mgTP/L, and 47 ± 5 mgTKN/L, 13 ± 1 mgTP/L,
    respectively. Using permeate in microalgae production via algae photo-bioreactors
    can be an outstanding alternative as post-treatment in AnMBR processes. It is
    reported that algae photo-bioreactors could remove 34 %–67 % of ammonia and >75
    % of phosphate from the AnMBR permeate, even under harsh conditions [51]. Also,
    the cost of chemical fertilizers used in the market puts pressure on farmers and
    institutions. Given that treated wastewater has a significant nutrient content,
    the use of treated wastewater as liquid fertilizer can reduce this financial pressure
    on agricultural operations. Peña et al. investigated the potential use of municipal
    wastewater treated with submerged AnMBR for irrigation [9]. The permeate obtained
    was rich in nutrients and met the highest standards in the Spanish irrigation
    water use regulation. The use of innovative technologies is another alternative
    for nutrient recovery. The Phosphogreen process invented by Suez Company enables
    the recovery of phosphate as valuable fertilizer via struvite precipitation, which
    can be used directly on soil [52]. 3.2. AnMBR filtration performance 3.2.1. Flux
    and TMP Flux and TMP are the two important factors determining the filtration
    performance of MBRs. Flux is desired to be as high as possible in MBRs to decrease
    the required membrane area and, accordingly, decrease the cost. However, decreasing
    the membrane area may lead to increased operational costs due to more frequent
    membrane cleaning and increased pumping costs related to increased TMP. Hence,
    flux optimization has a great importance, as membranes account for approximately
    46.4–72.3 % of the total investment cost of a large-scale AnMBR treating MWW [42].
    Cicekalan et al. reported that the share of membrane replacement cost in the HRAS
    + MBR process was 20 % of the annual operating and maintance (O&M) costs [53].
    Another challenge in MBRs being an economical process is the increased transmembrane
    pressure. Depending on the cake layer formed on the membrane over time, the flux
    decreases, and the pump energy required to obtain the desired permeate flow rate
    increases. Hence, membrane fouling is one of the major problems for the operation
    of MBRs, especially for the anaerobic MBRs, due to the higher amount of biomass
    and difficulty in biogas sparging. In this study, biogas recirculation and an
    intermittent filtration regime were applied to prevent excessive cake layer formation.
    Gas sparging and filtration regimes are used to control cake layer formation and
    TMP. There is a wide range of sparging rates applied in the literature, ranging
    from 0.01 m3/m2 h to 94 m3/m2 h [9,54]. In our study, a 0.9 m3/(m2·h) sparging
    rate was applied. At the beginning of P1, TMP was 30 mbar and gradually increased,
    especially after the 30th day, from 70 mbar to 160 mbar at the end of P1 (Fig.
    5(a)). At the beginning of P2, backwashing was applied for 1 min to remove the
    cake layer deposited on the membrane. Also, short-term backwashes were performed
    on the 41st, 44th, and 50th days due to sudden TMP increases. After the 50th day,
    stable TMP values were obtained. The TMP was measured as 10 mbar until the 112th
    day and increased to 20 mbar on the 112th day. The flux value determined on the
    same date also decreased from 6.2 LMH to 5.7 LMH. A wide range of TMP values have
    been obtained in studies in the literature. Ozgun et al. obtained stable operating
    conditions at 85 mbar TMP at 12.3 LMH with a PES tubular membrane with a pore
    diameter of 0.03 μm in the external membrane module [40]. Huang et al. obtained
    TMP ranging from 0 mbar to 300 mbar with a polyether sulfone flat layer membrane
    module with a pore diameter of 0.45 μm in an external submerged AnMBR [37]. In
    literature, higher TMP values were reported for similar membrane fluxes. Yurtsever
    et al. obtained approximately 200 mbar TMP at 4 LMH for the treatment of textile
    wastewater with AnMBR [55]. Pena et al. reported TMP values above 500 mbar at
    2–3.5 LMH for treatment of municipal wastewater with hollow fiber membrane modules
    in long-term operation [9]. The TMP values obtained in this study are quite low
    compared to the literature. Thanks to the modified membrane module, no significant
    membrane fouling occurred during operation. However, compared to the TMP values
    and the operational flux values, it seems possible to obtain higher flux values
    at higher operational TMPs. Download : Download high-res image (352KB) Download

    profile in AnMBR, (c) SMP profiles in AnMBR, (d) EPS profiles in AnMBR. 3.2.2.
    SMP and EPS EPS and SMP are the main components that cause membrane fouling. EPS
    consists of components located on or outside the cell surface, such as proteins,
    polysaccharides, nucleic acids, lipids, and humic acid. SMP, on the other hand,
    are organic compounds dissolved in the medium as a result of substrate metabolism
    or cell growth [16]. There are many studies in the literature reported that EPS
    and SMP are responsible for membrane fouling [4,16,40,[56], [57], [58], [59],
    [60], [61]]. Jang et al. stated that with the decrease of SMP concentration, the
    fouling index also decreased [59]. Zhang et al. stated that SMP plays a more important
    role in fouling than TS concentration [62]. Lin et al. stated that EPSs are biological
    substances that largely determine sludge flock properties, hydrophobicity, adhesion,
    flocculation, precipitation, and dewatering and therefore significantly affect
    membrane fouling in the MBRs [63]. SMP and EPS analyses were performed on the
    samples taken from the bioreactor. In addition, SMP analysis was performed in
    permeate; however, it was below the detection limit (DL: 5 mgProtein/L; 1 mgGlucose/L).
    SMPs may be retained in the bioreactor due to the thick cake layer formed on the
    membrane, which decreases the effective pore size of filtration. The variation
    of SMP in the AnMBR over time was presented in Fig. 5(c). The carbohydrate (SMPcarb)
    and protein (SMPpro) fractions of measured SMP varied in the range of 2.2–20 mgGlucose/L
    and 11–37.6 mgProtein/L, respectively, in P1. The average SMPcarb and SMPpro concentrations
    were determined as 8.9 mgGlucose/L and 21.8 mgProtein/L, respectively. Theoretical
    COD values corresponding to these SMPcarb and SMPpro values were calculated in
    the range of 3–24 mg/L and 17–56 mgCOD/L, respectively. The average total SMP
    as COD was around 44 mg/L, of which 25 % and 75 % were due to SMPcarb and SMPpro,
    respectively. Considering the average removed COD of 421 mg/L, around 10 % of
    the feed COD was converted to SMP in P1. In P2, the concentration ranges of SMPcarb
    and SMPpro were 1.5–25.8 mg Glucose/L and 2–39.1 mg Protein/L, respectively (Fig.
    5(a)). The average SMPcarb and SMPpro concentrations were determined as 10.1 mgGlucose/L
    and 17.5 mgProtein/L, respectively. Theoretical COD values corresponding to these
    SMPcarb and SMPpro values were calculated in the range of 2–31 mg/L and 3–59 mg/L,
    respectively. The average COD equivalents were around 38 mgCOD/L, of which around
    69 % and 31 % were due to SMPcarb and SMPpro, respectively. The average removed
    COD concentration in P2 was 426 mg/L; hence, around 9 % of the COD fed to the
    system was converted to SMP in P2. Although SMP concentrations change in a wide
    range, it was observed that they did not accumulate in the bioreactor. The ratio
    of feed COD conversion to SMP was approximately 10 %, which was much higher than
    the previous studies as Yurtsever et al. and Aquino and Stuckey determined this
    value in anaerobic bioreactors as 2 % and 1.2–2 %, respectively [28,64]. The reason
    for this observation may be due to the differences in the feeding composition
    of the studies. The variation of EPS in the AnMBR over time was presented in Fig.
    5(d). The carbohydrate (EPScarb) and protein (EPSpro) fractions of EPS varied
    in the range of 7.4–15.1 mgGlucose/gVS and 13.3–19.0 mgProtein/gVS, respectively,
    in P1. The average EPScarb and EPSpro concentrations were determined as 9.7 mg
    Glucose/gVS and 16.6 mg Protein/gVS, respectively. In P2, EPScarb and EPSpro concentrations
    ranged between 7 and 13.6 mgGlucose/gVS and 9.2–32.1 mgProtein/gVS, respectively.
    The average EPScarb and EPSpro concentrations were determined as 10.1 mgGlucose/gVS
    and 15.6 mgProtein/gVS, respectively. The average total EPS concentration was
    25.6 mg/gVS. Similarly, Yurtsever et al. determined the EPS concentration as 24.4
    ± 8.4 mg/gVSS under stable conditions [64]. No correlation was observed between
    fouling determined as TMP increase and SMP or EPS concentrations in our study
    (Fig. 5), similar to the conclusion drawn by Dereli et al. [65]. 3.2.3. CST and
    SRF CST and SRF analysis were performed to evaluate the filterability of the sludge
    in the AnMBR system. Although these parameters do not provide direct information
    about the actual membrane filtration process, they are useful tools for comparing
    the filterability of the sludge from different reactors or operating conditions
    [29]. By dividing the CST values by the TS concentration, the effect of the solid
    concentration on the value was eliminated, i.e., normalized CST (Fig. 5(b)). During
    the operation, the average CST and normalized CST values were 51.9 s and 1.8 s·L/g,
    respectively. Pollice et al. measured the CST value as 6–24 s in municipal wastewater
    treatment with submerged MBR [66]. On the other hand, Dereli found relatively
    high CST and SRF values in the AnMBR treating wastewater originating from ethanol
    production from corn at the sludge age of 20, 30, and 50 days, as 951 s, 1743
    s, and 2414 s, respectively [29]. It has been seen that diverse values in a wide
    range have been reported in the literature. It has been reported that the CST
    value is significantly affected by the substrate, sludge age, and, accordingly,
    sludge structure. Yurtsever et al. found CST and normalized CST in AnMBR as 102
    ± 39 s and 20 ± 6 s·L/g, respectively [55]. Although it is quite close to the
    CST value obtained in this study, the difference between the normalized CST values
    is greater. The SRF decreased up to 15 days of operation and then increased gradually.
    The highest SRF value was determined as 1.3 × 1014 m/kg at the end of the operation
    (Supplementary File, Table A.1). Yurtsever et al. found the SRF value in AnMBR
    as 10.8 ± 4 × 1014 m/kg in their study [55]. Dereli determined the SRF value as
    20 × 1014 m/kg, 31 × 1014 m/kg, and 30 × 1014 m/kg at 20, 30, and 50 days sludge
    age, respectively [29]. The SRF increased when the SRT increased to 30 days and
    stayed steady when the SRT was set to 50 days. In our study, SRT was infinite,
    and at the beginning of P1, the SRF decreased and came to its initial value at
    the end of P1. In P2, SRF showed a relatively steady trend. Various CST and SRF
    values have been reported in the literature. Although the CST and SRF values obtained
    in this study were incompatible with the literature, it is more appropriate to
    compare these parameters within the system since CST and SRF values are generally
    related to system-specific parameters such as sludge structure and operating conditions.
    3.3. AnMBR bacterial community On the first day of the operation, the bacterial
    community was dominated by Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria species; together, they
    represented 50 % of the total sequences (Fig. 6). Firmicutes (13 %), Synergistetes
    (12 %), and Acidobacteria (5 %) were also found in the bacterial community. 6
    % of the total reads were assigned to the phylum Armatimonadetes. At the family
    level, the majority of the sequences belonged to Anaerolineaceae, Syntrophaceae,
    and Synergistaceae. At the genus level, Smithella (phylum: Proteobacteria) was
    by far the most abundant among all classified genus representing 15 % of the bacterial
    community, followed by Longilinea (phylum Chloroflexi; representing 9 %). While
    Smithella are bacteria that engage in syntrophic propionate oxidation, resulting
    in the production of acetate and butyrate [67], Longilinea species are classified
    as carbohydrate-utilizing genera producing short chain fatty acids as end-products
    [68]. The acclimation to the synthetic wastewater and reactor conditions resulted
    in a shift in the bacterial communities, and the abundances changed regarding
    the operation conditions. In general, during the AnMBR operation, Chloroflexi
    and Bacteroidetes members proliferated, and the abundances ranged between 38 and
    43 % and 10–14 %, respectively. Chloroflexi and Bacteroidetes are generally abundant
    phyla in anaerobic reactors. Chloroflexi members may have a role in organic matter
    degradation, and Bacteroidetes species have the ability to degrade proteins and
    carbohydrates [68]. On the other hand, acclimation conditions resulted in a decrease
    in the abundance of Proteobacteria species, and the pattern did not change during
    the operation period (represented 10–13 % of the total reads). Moreover, a significant
    decrease was observed in Synergistetes abundance at the end of the acclimation;
    only 2 % of the bacterial reads were assigned to Synergistetes members, which
    are known to convert amino acids and produce volatile fatty acids [69,70]. In
    the following operation stages, Synergistetes represented 6 % and 5 % of the community,
    respectively. While only 1 % of the sequences were assigned to Zixibacteria on
    the first day, there was a slight increase in the abundance during the operation
    period (representing 3–5 %). The bacterial family fermenting carbohydrates under
    anaerobic conditions Anaerolineaceae [71] and anaerobic mesophilic acetogens Bacteroidetes
    vadinHA17 [72] were the predominant families in the bacterial community, followed
    by Syntrophaceae and Synergistaceae species. Longilinea abundance went up right
    after the acclimation period at the genus level and represented 18 % of the reactor''s
    bacterial community. On the other hand, the abundance gradually decreased with
    decreasing HRT, and on the final day of the operation, the abundance was determined
    as 11 %. While the bacterial community was dominated by Smithella species at the
    beginning of the operation period, the abundance significantly diminished after
    the acclimation period, and only 2–3 % of the total reads were assigned to this
    genus. While Trichococcus was enriched during the acclimation representing 5 %
    of the bacterial community (day 53), the abundance decreased in the following
    operational stages (1–2 %). Download : Download high-res image (369KB) Download

    community structure on the first day of the reactor operation, and a clear separation

    of the functional profiles of the bacterial community in AnMBR. The comparison
    of the alpha diversity indices for the samples collected from different stages
    of the operation period is depicted in Table 3. The decrease in the HRT during
    the operation period resulted in a more even community in the AnMBR, and the highest
    evenness index was observed in the sample collected on the last day of operation
    (day 142). The index revealed that phylogenetic diversity gradually decreased
    regarding the operation conditions. Contrarily, there was not a general pattern
    for the Shannon diversity. Table 3. Summary of alpha diversity indices of bacterial
    communities. Sample No. of observed OTUs Faith''s PD Shannon Pielou''s evenness

    Day-142 240 24.31 6.23 0.79 The predicted functions of AnMBR microbiota based
    on KEGG pathways at level 2 are presented in Fig. 7(b). Generally, the majority
    of the sequences were assigned to the functional category metabolism, accounting
    for 50 % ±0.3. It was followed by genetic information processing (16.3 % ± 0.2),
    environmental information processing (15.5 % ± 0.4), and cellular processes (3.3
    % ± 0.4). In the metabolism cluster, carbohydrate metabolism was the most function
    increased in the acclimation period, and a minor gradual decrease was observed
    during the operation period. In the same cluster, amino acid metabolism was the
    second abundant function, which slightly increased over time. The functions related
    to membrane transport were predicted with by far the greatest abundance in the
    bacterial communities of AnMBR. An apparent increase in abundance was observed
    after the acclimation on day 53. On the other hand, increasing organic loading
    by decreasing HRT did not reveal any changes in the functions in the microbial
    dynamics. Within the genetic information category, functions related to replication
    and repair were the most abundant, followed by translation. In the cellular processes
    cluster, functions related to cell motility had the greatest share, in which the
    reactor conditions revealed a decrease during the operation. 3.4. Energy balance
    The energy consumption and power generation normalized per volume of wastewater
    treated were calculated. All assumptions and constants related to energy calculations
    were given in Table 4. The hydraulic head (E) for feeding was accepted as 10 m.
    The pressure drop due to permeation through the membrane was 0.02 bar, however,
    in real-scale applications, TMP may increase to higher values due to membrane
    aging and using real wastewater. Hence, TMP was accepted as 0.3 bar (E = 3.0 m)
    in filtration energy calculation. The energy consumptions for feeding and filtration
    pumps were calculated as 0.036 kWh/m3 and 0.011 kWh/m3, respectively. Table 4.

    d Energy equivalent of one cubic meter methane was assumed 10.55 kWh. The energy
    consumptions for mixing and gas sparging were accepted from the study of Lim et
    al. as 0.004 kWh/m3 and 0.19 kWh/m3, respectively [73]. The average wastewater
    temperature was accepted as 20 °C. The temperature of the reactor was set to 36.5
    °C. The energy consumption for heating was calculated as 19.1 kWh/m3. The total
    energy consumptions of AnMBR with and without heating were calculated as 19.4
    kWh/m3 and 0.28 kWh/m3, respectively. The methane yield was 207 mL CH4/gCODconsumed.
    The produced methane for 1 m3 wastewater was 0.094 m3, and the produced equal
    electricity was calculated as 0.4 kWh/m3. The produced heat energy was calculated
    as 0.45 kWh/m3. When heating is applied, 98.5 % of total energy consumption is
    accounted for heating, and the ratio of produced energy to total energy consumption
    was only 4.3 %. Therefore, using the AnMBR process for municipal wastewater treatment
    with heating is not feasible. However, if methane yield from this study can be
    obtained at ambient temperatures, an energy-positive process can be achieved.
    The ratio of total energy consumption without heating to produced energy is only
    70 % without using waste heat energy. Without heating, gas sparging accounts for
    68 % of total energy consumption, whereas the ratio of feeding and filtration
    in energy consumption is only 17 %. With the optimized gas sparging conditions,
    the energy demand can be reduced, and an energy-positive process can be achieved.
    It is challenging to achieve an energy-positive process with continuous gas sparging.
    Hence, novel gas sparging patterns, such as intermittent sparging, sparging only
    when the membrane is relaxed, and high/low alternate sparging can be used to reduce
    energy demand and membrane fouling [74]. The energy production via dissolved methane
    recovery can increase the energy efficiency of AnMBR. However, the contribution
    of this energy to total energy generation may be negligible due to the low amount
    of dissolved methane and the cost of its recovery. Benitez et al. reported that
    the energy recovery in semi-industrial AnMBR plant from dissolved methane was
    between 0.02 kWh/m3 and 0.04 kWh/m3 for dissolved methane recovery ratios of 50
    % and 70 %, respectively [75]. Kong et al. achieved a practical net energy potential
    as −0.014 kWh/m3 in a pilot-scale submerged AnMBR at ambient temperature whereas
    practical net energy potential was −0.421 kWh/m3 for the conventional activated
    sludge process [1]. Based on the results, the use of the AnMBR process in mesophilic
    conditions can be feasible when a waste heat stream originating from industry
    for heating bioreactors is available. This can eliminate the required heating
    energy to sustain an energy-positive process. Furthermore, this contributes to
    industrial symbiosis and circular economy goals. Another energy-positive option
    can be the treatment of municipal wastewater with an AnMBR at ambient temperatures
    in tropical climates with similar performance. 4. Conclusions • Stable membrane
    flux and TMP were obtained. It is considered that modification of the membrane
    module has contributed to the prevention of cake deposition and/or pore blocking
    in membranes. • The capture of organic carbon in municipal wastewater can contribute
    to energy-positive treatment plants, resource recycling, and circular economy
    goals. • Optimized biogas sparging conditions may reduce the energy demand and
    control membrane fouling. • AnMBR permeate has the potential to be used for irrigation
    with its high nutrient content and high effluent quality. In particular, it can
    potentially be beneficial in meeting the nutrient needs of plants where intensive
    agricultural activities are carried out. • Higher organic loading rates and lower
    HRTs can be studied to improve the system''s efficiency and economic effectiveness.
    • For future studies, the treatment in ambient temperatures should be investigated.

  description: Furrow irrigation with surge flow is a management strategy to improve
    irrigation performance compared to furrow irrigation with continuous flow. Successful
    management of surge irrigation corresponds to accurate field practices that depend
    on different flow hydraulic parameters that make it complex in practice. However,
    because of this complexity, very few surge infiltration models have been developed.
    So far, no study has been done to evaluate infiltration equations subject to different
    surge irrigation modelling concepts under field surge irrigation scenarios. This
    study investigates two surge infiltration equations of Modified Kostiakov-Lewies
    (MKL) and Branch Function (BF) using WinSRFR that is the only modelling tool to
    simulate surge irrigation by using two surge infiltration modelling concepts of
    Blair-Smerdon (BS) and Izuno-Podmore (IP). Field data were collected on different
    combinations of two furrow lengths (70 m and 90 m; open-end furrows), two inflow
    rates (0.4 l s−1 and 0.6 l s−1), and two cycle ratios (0.5 and 0.33). Field measurements
    confirmed that switching from continuous to surge irrigation significantly improved
    irrigation performance. Evaluation of the surge infiltration modeling concepts
    showed that IP had higher accuracy in simulating irrigation performance compared
    to BS. The MKL(IP) and BF(IP) had the highest accuracy in the simulation of advance
    time, infiltrated water depth, and runoff. Further analyses showed that decreasing
    the cycle ratio from 0.5 to 0.33 improved simulation accuracy in advance time,
    runoff, and irrigation performance, but it reduced the accuracy of simulated infiltrated
    water depth. Increasing the inflow rate from 0.4 l s−1 to 0.6 l s−1 decreased
    the accuracy of irrigation performance. However, field observations were only
    under a limited number of furrow lengths and inflow rates that might not be the
    best management field practices to increase irrigation performance. Scenario analyses
    were done to simulate irrigation performance under a combination of possible irrigation
    managements. The optimal irrigation scenario consisted of adjusting the different
    inflow rate (0.5–1.2 l s−1), furrow length (100–300 m), cutoff time (360–600 min),
    and on-time (20–60 min). Results show that using cutoff 360 min and on-time 60
    min led to reducing deep percolation and runoff and increasing the distribution
    uniformity. Based on the scenario analyses for the most efficient irrigation performance
    in terms of irrigation efficiencies and water losses (runoff and deep percolation),
    the best irrigation management could be attributed to the furrow length of 200
    m that occurs for on-time of 60 min, with a cutoff time of 360 min, and an inflow
    rate of 0.7 l s−1 although Zreq = 50 mm is not fully irrigated over the whole
    furrow. Under this scenario, 35 % of the furrow is under deficit irrigation. Scenario
    analyses showed that we may propose a new surge irrigation management named as
    “wet-cycle surge irrigation” such that the first surge completes the whole furrow
    length, and then the subsequent surges will run on wet soil.

    1. Introduction Surface irrigation is the most common, low cost, and energy efficient
    irrigation practice (Koech et al., 2014). Previous studies have reported that
    surface irrigation covers about 70–75 % of the irrigated farms in Iran, and the
    furrow irrigation system is the dominant one (Lalehzari et al., 2014, Ahmadabad
    et al., 2021). Wu et al. (2017) reported that furrow irrigation is the best method
    of surface irrigation because of suitable aeration in the root zone. However,
    it might suffer from poor design and imprecise irrigation management that are
    the important reasons for low performance of surface irrigation systems (Ebrahimian
    and Liaghat, 2011) such as low efficiency, poor distribution uniformity, excess
    deep percolation, and high runoff (Moravejalahkami et al., 2009, Mazarei et al.,
    2021). Therefore, in the arid and semi-arid regions of the world that are experiencing
    climate changed-based lack of water, it is critical to use the current water resources
    efficiently (Abbaspour et al., 2009). For these reasons, accurate studies are
    required to improve the performance of surface irrigation management (Walker and
    Skogerboe, 1987). In this regard, many researchers have tried to improve surface
    irrigation performance and reduce water losses via different strategies such as
    optimizing field length, furrow width, and slope (Xu et al., 2019, Mazarei et
    al., 2020), optimizing the combination of inflow rate and cutoff time (the time
    when inflow to the furrows is stopped) (Morris et al., 2015, Anwar et al., 2016,
    Nie et al., 2019), and optimizing the field design by accurate determination of
    infiltration parameters and using surge irrigation (Kifle et al., 2017, Ojaghlou
    et al., 2020, Ahmadabad et al., 2021). Among the other strategies, improving surface
    irrigation efficiency could be potentially achieved by shifting from continuous
    to surge irrigation. Surge irrigation may potentially provide the benefits of
    furrow irrigation without the need for expensive equipment (Horst et al., 2007).
    Surge irrigation is the most efficient method of reducing runoff volume during
    irrigation by the intermittent application of water into the furrow (Ojaghlou
    et al., 2020, Ahmadabad et al., 2021). The most important feature in surge irrigation
    is the on and off times that are defined as the time duration at which water is
    applied (on-time) and the time duration at which water is not applied (off-time)
    to the furrow (Ismail and Depeweg, 2005). Surge irrigation is practiced through
    different numbers of cycles in which one cycle is comprised of a single set of
    on and off times. Indeed, the number of cycles is an important parameter of surge
    irrigation, which means the number of required cycles to complete the advance
    process in the furrow. Surge irrigation improves uniformity of advance time (the
    time it takes for the water to reach the end of the field or a specified point
    along the field), which is due to the entry of water in several cycles, which
    results in an increase in the uniformity of infiltrated water depth (Allen and
    Schneider, 1992, Horst et al., 2007). Surge irrigation based on optimal inflow
    parameters (e.g. inflow rate, cutoff time, and furrow length) and effective surge
    parameters (i.e. cycle ratio and on-off time) facilitates uniform irrigation of
    crops, reduces deep percolation and runoff volume, and increases irrigation efficiency
    through uniform infiltration rate over the furrow (Kifle et al., 2017). In fact,
    high infiltration rates may lead to low irrigation performance because of deep
    percolation and non-uniform distribution across the field, but surge irrigation
    reduces the infiltrated volume and increases irrigation performance (Benham et
    al., 2000). Several reasons such as sealing because of the expansion of clay particles
    after hydration, reduction in soil hydraulic gradient as soil get wetting, consolidation
    of surface soil layer during the off time, hysteretic behaviour of the soil hydraulic
    properties; air entry and entrapment that occurs between surges, and sealing because
    of clogging from sediment particles are the main factors that reduce infiltration
    in surge irrigation compared to continuous irrigation (Izadi et al., 1995, Smerdon
    and Blair, 1985). Therefore, a precise surge irrigation design is the first step
    to improve the irrigation performance and to reduce on-farm water losses. So far,
    several computer models have been developed to evaluate and simulate surface irrigation
    systems, such as SURDEV (Jurriens et al., 2001), SIRMOD (Walker, 2005), SIDES
    (Adamala et al., 2014), SURCOS (Burguete et al., 2014) and SISCO (Gillies and
    Smith, 2015), and WinSRFR (Bautista and Schlegel, 2019, Bautista et al., 2009).
    Among them, the WinSRFR model has been used extensively as a reference model in
    simulating surface irrigation and irrigation management under continuous and surge
    irrigation (Brunetti et al., 2018). In addition, WinSRFR is a powerful modeling
    package for analysing different surface irrigation systems. Compared to the other
    well-known common irrigation models such as SIRMOD, WinSRFR offers several distinctive
    advantages that underscore its suitability in various contexts. The most notable
    feature of WinSRFR is its simplicity and high accuracy (Radmanesh et al., 2023).
    It has a user-friendly graphical interface (Alavi et al., 2022) that allows easy
    data input, simulation running, result visualization, and report exporting. Moreover,
    WinSRFR presents a more comprehensive range of computational capabilities and
    water infiltration features (Bautista and Schlegel, 2019), enhancing its potentials
    for accurate and reliable decision-making in agricultural water management. WinSRFR
    has also the ability and great flexibility to simulate surge irrigation with different
    cycle ratios that makes it a unique choice for simulating surge irrigation. WinSRFR
    is able to evaluate the surge irrigation infiltration equations subject to different
    surge irrigation modelling concepts of BS (Blair and Smerdon, 1987) and IP (Izuno
    and Podmore, 1985, Bautista and Schlegel, 2019). These diverse simulation features
    and options included in the model allow the irrigation managers and engineers
    to test and assess various irrigation scenarios enabling them to identify optimal
    irrigation strategies. Last but not least, the WinSRFR is regularly under continuous
    development and updates, indicating a commitment to modified versions for better
    simulations. Various studies have been done while using the WinSRFR model to evaluate
    the physical design (Bo et al., 2012, Xu et al., 2019), optimize inflow variables,
    such as inflow rate and cutoff time (Morris et al., 2015, Anwar et al., 2016,
    Nie et al., 2019), and determining infiltration parameters (Mazarei et al., 2020).
    Nevertheless, most previous studies have focused on continuous irrigation, and
    there are few studies on surge irrigation because of the complexities involved
    in managing and implementing surge irrigation (Salahou et al., 2018, Smith and
    Uddin, 2020, Fadul et al., 2020). Surge irrigation has a number of concerns related
    to its design and implementation cycle ratio (the ratio of on-time to the cycle
    time) and the number of surge and infiltration parameters. However, the lack of
    research records on using WinSRFR for evaluating and simulating surge irrigation
    strategies and scenarios is obvious in the literature, which has been highlighted
    and investigated in this study. Surge irrigation had been originally introduced
    for large fields and long furrows (Ismail and Depeweg, 2005). However, in small
    fields with short furrows (less than 100 m) that globally prevail in developing
    countries, Ismail et al. (2004) showed that surge irrigation decreased the advance
    time, increased uniformity and application efficiency by decreasing deep percolation,
    and reduced applied irrigation water by 15–35 %. Our study focused on field observation
    and simulation of surge irrigation and evaluation of the infiltration equations
    under short furrows, which was followed by extensive scenario analyses for a range
    of short to long furrows for best irrigation management practices. In this approach,
    the two surge irrigation infiltration concepts of BS and IP were implemented to
    evaluate surge irrigation performance. The main objectives of the study were 1)
    comparison and simulation of different surge irrigation managements in the field
    using WinSRFR, 2) assessment and simulation of irrigation performance indicators
    under different surge irrigation management compared with continuous irrigation,
    3) conducting scenario analyses for determining the best surge furrow irrigation
    management. The implication of this study is that it could serve as a concise
    guideline for irrigation engineers and field practitioners to design appropriate
    and effective surge irrigation systems. The findings would bridge a crucial research
    gap by highlighting the advantages of surge irrigation over continuous irrigation,
    especially pertinent in arid and semi-arid regions. The significance of this endeavour
    lies in its potential to find the best on-farm irrigation water management. By
    identifying best management irrigation scenarios by switching from continuous
    to surge irrigation, this research can have multiple benefits including but not
    limited to enhanced irrigation efficiency, reduced environmental impact through
    minimized deep percolation and reduced nitrogen leaching, and diminished runoff
    volume to prevent negative environmental impacts by reducing furrow soil erosion
    and nutrient loss (such as phosphorous and nitrogen). Runoff plays an important
    role in exacerbating soil erosion while also serving as a key transporter of soil
    nutrients, which can lead to detrimental environmental pollution (Rodríguez et
    al., 2022, Zuazo and Pleguezuelo, 2009). Given that soil nutrients act as non-point
    sources, effective water management in the field is imperative to control and
    limit them (Iida and Shock, 2007, Bjorneberg et al., 2006, Bjorneberg et al.,
    2002). This study strives also to offer effective irrigation solutions for finding
    the best scenarios to reduce water application and losses in areas where we are
    facing water shortage. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Study area Field experiments
    were carried out at the School of Agriculture, Shiraz University, Shiraz, located
    in a semi-arid region in the south of Iran (latitudes 52°32ʹ and longitudes 29°36ʹ00)
    in summer 2016 with long term annual average rainfall of about 386 mm (Ahmadi
    et al., 2018). The experimental field has a deep and uniform silty clay loam soil
    texture. All experiments were carried out in furrows with lengths of 70 m (L1)
    and 90 m (L2), width of 0.75 m, and longitudinal slope of 0.002, and on bare soil
    under open-end boundary conditions with buffer furrow between furrows. 2.2. Irrigation
    methods and practices Inflow rates of 0.4 l/s (Q1) and 0.6 l/s (Q2) were applied
    to irrigate the furrows at constant rates. Furrow lengths and inflow rates were
    selected considering the standard local design of small farms in the area. The
    Washington State College (WSC) flume type 1 was installed at the end of the furrows
    to measure runoff volume. The required irrigation depth was considered as 50 mm
    for all experiments based on the current practices in the region to ensure uniform
    seed germination and crop establishment recommended by the Office of Farm Management,
    School of Agriculture. The two types of irrigation methods, continuous (as the
    benchmark and traditional irrigation method) and surge irrigation, were practiced.
    In surge irrigation, the cycle time is the total of on-time (the time water is
    applied to the furrow) and off-time (the time water is not applied to the furrow)
    in each cycle, and the cycle ratio (CR) is on-time divided by the cycle time (Ismail
    and Depeweg, 2005). Based on the preliminary field assessment, the two cycle times
    were selected as 16 min (8 min on-time and 8 min off-time) and 24 min (8 min on-time
    and 16 min off-time) that represent CR values of 0.5 and 0.33, respectively. We
    monitored the infiltrated water depth based on the gravimetric soil water content
    measurements. The measurements were done using a metal spiral auger to collect
    soil samples down to a depth of 100 cm according to the practical guide of International
    Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (2008). The initial soil water content was measured
    prior to starting the experiments. Following the experimental procedures and 48
    h after each irrigation event, soil samples (ca. 100–150 g) were collected at
    20 cm intervals over the soil profile, encompassing five distinct depths, including
    0–20, 20–40, 40–60, 60–80, and 80–100 cm. The soil sampling points consisted of
    five chosen stations at distances of 0, 15, 35, 60, and 70 m and seven stations
    (0, 15, 30, 50, 60, 80, and 90 m) along furrows of 70 m and 90 m furrow lengths,
    respectively. The soil samples were weighed right away in the field to obtain
    their wet weight. Subsequently, the samples were dried in an oven at 105 °C for
    24 h to determine their dry weight, allowing for the calculation of gravimetric
    soil water content. To convert gravimetric soil water content to volumetric soil
    water content, we utilized the soil bulk density ( ) (1.4, 1.5, and 1.5 g cm−3
    at the soil depths of 0–30, 30–60, and 60–90 cm, respectively). The volumetric
    soil water content was then used in calculating the infiltrated water depth by
    multiplying it with the associated soil depth (20 cm). According to previous studies
    in this area, the Manning roughness coefficient in bare soil is constant and is
    equal to 0.04 (Sepaskhah and Bondar, 2002). The cross-section of the furrows was
    determined at the first, middle, and end stations by a profilemeter. Table 1 summarizes
    the field measurement data. Table 1. Field data for the experimental furrows.

    equations One of the most difficult parameters to determine in the field is infiltration
    parameters, which are key parameters on irrigation performance (Nie et al., 2019).
    The infiltration equations used in surface irrigation are usually empirical (Oyonarte
    et al., 2002). In this research, we have used modified Kostiakov-Lewis (MKL) and
    Branch Function (BF) equations, which are among the most useful and practical
    furrow irrigation equations (Clemmens and Dedrick, 1981, Clemmens and Bautista,
    2009). 2.3.1. Modified Kostiakov–Lewis equation (MKL) The infiltration parameters
    of furrow irrigation are described by the Kostiakov–Lewis’s equation as Eq. (1):
    (1) where shows the cumulative infiltration (m3m−1); is the opportunity time (the
    time water is in contact with the soil) of infiltration (min); is the basic infiltration
    rate (m3m−1min−1); and, and are the empirical coefficients (  = dimensionless,  =
    m3 min−α m−1). c is assumed 0 as soil cracking, and depression storage is negligible.
    Generally, it is not required to have both terms of and c simultaneously (Walker,
    2005). In this study, the two-point method (Elliott and Walker, 1982; Izadi et
    al., 1988) was used for parameterizing the infiltration equation (i.e., , and
    ). The basic infiltration rate is determined using the following equation (Walker
    and Skogerboe, 1987): (2) where and are the inflow and outflow rate (m3min−1),
    and is the furrow length (m), respectively. The two-point method is commonly employed
    to estimate infiltration parameters in surface irrigation due to its mathematical
    simplicity and practical applicability (Bautista et al., 2009). Hence, numerous
    scholars have utilized this method to determine infiltration parameters in both
    continuous (Bo et al., 2012, Anwar et al., 2016, Xu et al., 2019, Mazarei et al.,
    2021) and surge irrigation (Izadi et al., 1988, Ojaghlou et al., 2020, Ahmadabad
    et al., 2021). However, inherent limitations are associated with the two-point
    method. We followed the procedures recommended by the previous researchers as
    explained below to overcome these limitations and do accurate analysis. Notably,
    the reliance on just two data points during field data collection for parameter
    estimation can prove challenging. This constraint raises questions about whether
    these measurements accurately represent true values or are influenced by spatial
    variability within the field (Bautista and Schlegel, 2019). To address these concerns
    and enhance the method''s precision, Bautista et al. (2009) proposed enhancing
    accuracy by increasing the data collection to include more measurement points.
    In our study, we implemented this recommendation by measuring advance and recession
    times along with water depth at multiple stations, spaced at intervals of 5 m.
    Furthermore, to improve accuracy, we also opted to employ a runoff hydrograph
    rather than relying solely on total runoff. This choice aligns with the insights
    of Gillies et al. (2007) and Bautista et al. (2009), who suggested for using a
    runoff hydrograph due to its ability to capture the temporal variability of runoff,
    in contrast to total runoff which only represents cumulative volume. Thus, we
    utilized the runoff hydrograph to comprehensively assess and simulate the irrigation
    process. 2.3.2. Branch function (BF) In MKL formulation, f0 represents the final
    infiltration rate, however it is not actually the final infiltration rate during
    irrigation because the exponential term does not reach zero quickly (Clemmens
    and Bautista, 2009). Clemmens (1981) suggested the branch infiltration function
    as a solution to this problem and to make the analysis simpler. In this function,
    the infiltration follows a power function until it reaches a constant value (the
    final infiltration rate), and then it stays at that value. The branch function
    is divided into two parts and permits the infiltration rate to become stable at
    a certain opportunity time known as the branch time (Strelkoff et al., 1999, Bautista
    and Schlegel, 2019). Branch function is described by: (3) (4) where is the cumulative
    infiltration in volume per unit length (L2), and are the opportunity time and
    the time at which the basic infiltration rate comes into effect (i.e. the duration
    of the first surge on-time), respectively. (L2 T−α) and (unitless) are the empirical
    parameters derived from field data, and is the basic infiltration rate (L2 T−1).
    The infiltration parameters, and , of the Kostiakov-Lewis and branch function
    equations were calculated using the two-point method during the first cycle. After
    the last surge, the irrigation continued for a long time, and the runoff ( ) from
    the end of the field reached a steady value, indicating that the infiltration
    at all points along the furrow has reached its final value , which was measured
    using Eq. (2) (Khatri and Smith, 2005). 2.4. Cutoff time management Cutoff time
    is vital as it significantly affects the efficiency of irrigation. So as to address
    the minimum required infiltrated water depth (Zreq = 50 mm) at the end of each
    furrow, the parameters of the Kostiakov-Lewis infiltration equations (Eq. (1))
    were first determined in one set of furrows. For this purpose, twelve experimental
    furrows were used to measure the infiltration parameters of the Kostiakov-Lewis
    equation (a combination of inflow rate of 0.4 l/s and 0.6 l/s and furrow lengths
    of 70 m and 90 m under continuous and surge irrigation with cycle ratios of 0.5
    and 0.33). Then in the second adjacent set of furrows, the advance-recession times,
    infiltrated water depth, volume of applied water, and runoff hydrograph were monitored
    and measured for irrigation performance analyses. Conducting the experiment on
    two sets of furrows would take into account soil spatial variability and its possible
    effect on the variability of infiltration parameters (Childs et al., 1993, Rasoulzadeh
    and Sepaskhah, 2003). However, previous studies on our experimental field (Sepaskhah
    and Bondar, 2002, Sepaskhah and Afshar-Chamanabad, 2002) revealed that the spatial
    infiltration variability was not considerable. With regard to this, after extensive
    field measurements, Trout and Mackey (1988) reported that the furrow-to-furrow
    infiltration variability basically happens because of uneven tractor and implement
    wheel compaction of furrows, which did not occur in our small experimental field.
    Moreover, the soil texture of the experimental site is uniform, which confirms
    the lack of influential infiltration variability as Childs et al. (1993) reported
    that soil texture variability leads to greater infiltration variability than the
    variability in intake opportunity time. Our further confirmatory analyses revealed
    that the application of the parameterized infiltration equations obtained under
    a combination of inflow rate (Q) and furrow length (L) did not show high spatial
    variability among different furrows (data not shown). 2.5. WinSRFR model WinSRFR
    is a software package for the hydraulic analysis of surface irrigation systems
    (Bautista and Schlegel, 2020), which was developed by the Agricultural Research
    Service of the United States Department of Agriculture. WinSRFR was developed
    for a couple of practical uses and research studies. WinSRFR integrates different
    models, including SRFR (Strelkoff et al., 1998), BORDER (Strelkoff et al., 1996)
    and BASIN (Clemmens et al., 1995). The latest version of WinSRFR 5.1 was used
    in this study. WinSRFR needs different input data for simulation and evaluation
    of the irrigation practice, including inflow rate, cutoff time, furrow geometric
    properties, advance-recession times, soil infiltration parameters, depth of applied
    water, cycle time, and cycle ratio in surge irrigation. There are four analytical
    functionalities in WinSRFR for different analysis processes, which are “Event
    Analysis”, “Simulation”, “Physical Design”, and “Operation Analysis”. In this
    study, we used the Event Analysis function for assessing the field irrigation
    performance and calibrating the WinSRFR model, and we employed the Simulation
    function for evaluating and simulating continuous and surge irrigation methods.
    The zero-inertia model was used for simulation and evaluation of furrow irrigation
    in WinSRFR because of open-ended boundary conditions and low slopes in furrows
    (Radmanesh et al., 2023). The zero-inertia model assumes that the pressure gradient,
    friction, and gravity are the only forces acting on the flow (Bautista and Schlegel,
    2019) and is accurate for furrow irrigation (Schwankl and Wallender, 1988). The
    model was first modified for simultaneous advance and recession and then developed
    for surge irrigation (Oweis and Walker, 1990). WinSRFR offers two empirical approaches
    for modelling the effect of surge on infiltration as follows: Blair-Smerdon (BS):
    Blair and Smerdon (1987) assumes that the infiltration rate will continue to decrease
    during the off-time, just as if water was flowing continuously. Therefore, the
    opportunity time at any point is a function of the total time. It should be noted
    that the Blair-Smerdon approach (BS) works with any infiltration equation (Bautista
    and Schlegel, 2019). Izuno-Podmore (IP): This option assumes that the infiltration
    rate during the second and subsequent surges is set to the steady infiltration
    rate (Izuno and Podmore, 1985, Izuno et al., 1985). This approach works only with
    the Kostiakov–Lewis or branch function equations because those empirical equations
    have a constant infiltration rate parameter (Bautista and Schlegel, 2019). It
    should be noted that WinSRFR does not directly apply the equations of Blair-Smerdon
    and Izuno-Podmore for simulation. Rather, it performs modelling by using the concepts
    of these two approaches. In other words, the software just calculates infiltration
    rates as a function of the opportunity time and uses those rates to calculate
    the cumulative infiltration. This is consistent with the concept behind BS and
    IP. 2.6. Calibration of infiltration parameters in WinSRFR The calibration of
    the infiltration equations in WinSRFR was done by trial-and-error procedure that
    is recommended by the WinSRFR model developers (Bautista and Schlegel, 2019).
    The trial and error is a common procedure in calibration of agro-environmental
    models (Moghaddam et al., 2023, Jahangirlou et al., 2023) and is particularly
    reliable when the number of model parameters to calibrate is small, which prevents
    overparametrization that could yield poor simulations under scenario analysis
    (Wallach et al., 2019a, Wallach et al., 2019b). To calibrate the infiltration
    parameters in continuous irrigation, the Merriam-Keller post-irrigation volume
    balance approach (Merriam and Keller, 1978) in the Event Analysis world was used
    due to its ability of simulating advance-recession times, infiltrated water depth,
    and runoff in continuous irrigation (Xu et al., 2019, Mazarei et al., 2021). In
    this approach, the values of and were iteratively changed to find the best match
    between the measured and simulated advance-recession times, infiltrated water
    depth, and runoff. In the Merriam-Keller post-irrigation volume balance approach,
    is automatically estimated based on the irrigation’s infiltrated volume and opportunity
    time and the estimated and (Bautista and Schlegel, 2019). Since the Event Analysis
    world of WinSRFR cannot evaluate surge irrigation, the Simulation World was used
    to calibrate infiltration parameters. Moreover, since Merriam-Keller post-irrigation
    volume balance approach uses runoff for the simulation, and there is no runoff
    in the first surge, this approach cannot be used to calibrate the infiltration
    parameters. To calibrate the infiltration parameters of surge irrigation in the
    Simulation world, the measured and of the first surge and final were used and
    changed iteratively in a trial and error procedure to reach the best match between
    the measured and simulated advance-recession times and infiltrated water depth
    (Bautista and Schlegel, 2019). The calibrated parameters of infiltration equations
    are summarized in Table 3. Table 3. Calibration of infiltration parameters of
    surge irrigation in WinSRFR. Furrow Name MKL(BS) BF(BS) MKL(IP) BF(IP) a k f0

    indicators Four performance indicators were selected to evaluate continuous and
    surge irrigation methods, including application efficiency (AE), distribution
    uniformity (DU), deep percolation (DP), and tail-water ratio (TWR). The field
    observations of these indicators were compared to simulated values using WinSRFR.
    (5) (6) (7) (8) where Dad, Dap, Dmin, Davg, Ddp, and Dro are the depth of total
    water stored in the 1 m soil profile over the furrow length (mm), depth of water
    applied to the furrow (mm), minimum depth of infiltrated water (mm), the average
    depth of infiltrated water over the furrow length (mm), depth of deep percolated
    water (mm), and the depth of runoff (mm), respectively. 2.8. Irrigation scenarios
    for best management practices 2.8.1. Scenarios and decision variables In the design
    and management of surface irrigation systems, irrigation efficiency components
    and uniformity are of paramount importance. The optimal irrigation scenario consisted
    of adjusting the different inflow rate, furrow length, cutoff time, and on-time
    in the allowable range to obtain the best performance indicators of each irrigation
    management. This process was conducted using the Simulation World option included
    in the WinSRFR model. For this purpose, eight inflow rates (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8,
    0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 1.2 l s−1), five furrow lengths (100, 150, 200, 250, 300 m), three
    cutoff times (360, 480, 600 min), and three on-times (20, 40, 60 min) were chosen
    as decision variables to be optimized. All of the scenario analyses were done
    for CR = 0.5. The 1.2 l s−1 is the maximum allowable inflow rate reported for
    the soil of the study area (Sepaskhah and Afshar-Chamanabad, 2002). The maximum
    furrow length is also determined according to Cuenca (1989) and Brouwer et al.
    (1988). The cutoff times are determined based on irrigation scheduling in the
    study area. The on-times are chosen in regard to our analysis of the advance-recession
    times of the field experiment. 2.8.1.1. Objective function When the WinSRFR model
    was run for scenarios, the performance parameters of the irrigation scenarios
    such as application efficiency (AE), storage efficiency (SE), deep percolation,
    (DP) and Runoff (RO) were recorded. An objective function (OF) was defined and
    employed to quantify the performance of the furrow irrigation system scenarios
    as [9] The maximum value of objective function is 1, implying irrigation perfection
    without any water loss as RO and DP and full irrigation uniformity and efficiency.
    The minimum value of objective function is −1, implying that there was no infiltration,
    and all the applied water came out as runoff (e.g. in water repellent soils).
    2.9. Evaluation of irrigation models Three statistical criteria of Normalized
    Root Mean Squared Error (NRMSE) (Jamieson et al., 1991), and Mean Absolute Error
    (MAE) were used for evaluating the performance of WinSRFR in the simulation of
    field measurements. The NRMSE shows the percentage of error and its value below
    10 %, and between 10 % and 20 % shows excellent and good simulations, respectively
    (Jamieson et al., 1991). The NRMSE < 10 % was the criterion to calibrate the infiltration
    parameters of continuous and surge irrigation. The criterion of Relative Error
    (RE) was used to evaluate the total simulated runoff volume compared with the
    measured value. Positive and negative values of RE indicate overestimation and
    underestimation, respectively. (10) (11) (12) where Mi and Si are the measured
    and simulated values, respectively; N is the number of measurements, and finally
    ( ) is the average measurement. It is important to mention the fact that the statistics
    related to the evaluation of the model are highly influenced by large errors and
    extreme values, especially when they are used in small datasets because of the
    squared differences (Ritter and Munoz-Carpena, 2013, Krause et al., 2005). However,
    it should be also mentioned that these factors are all subjective because of their
    magnitude, the number of data points, repeated data, and the existence of outliers,
    meaning that a number of these factors should be used so as to be able to interpret
    the model performance (Ritter and Munoz-Carpena, 2013). The schematic procedure
    of the field experiment measurements and the surge irrigation modeling is illustrated

    observations 3.1.1. Advance times Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5 show the results
    of simulated advance times in furrows with surge irrigation with cycle ratios
    of 0.5 and 0.33, respectively. Based on the statistical criteria, WinSRFR models
    for surge irrigation with cycle ratios of 0.5 and 0.33 are highly accurate (NRMSE
    values in all simulations are less than 10 %). According to the results, however,
    IP was more accurate than BS for predicting advance time in surge irrigation.
    IP showed an improvement of 2 % in NRMSE in advance time simulation compared to
    BS. Comparing the cycle ratios showed that increasing the off time from 8 (CR
    = 0.5) to 16 min (CR = 0.33) may increase simulation accuracy, and NRMSE values
    decreased in the surge ratio of 0.33 compared to 0.5. In two cycle ratios of 0.5
    and 0.33, MKL(IP) model achieved the highest level of simulation accuracy. Download

    Comparison of the measured and simulated advance times by IP with CR = 0.33. The
    WinSRFR had higher accuracy in furrow length of 70 m compared to 90 m under surge
    irrigation with a cycle ratio of 0.5, while there is an inverse relationship for
    the cycle ratio of 0.33. For example, by increasing the furrow length from 70
    m (in Q1L1R0.33 and Q2L1R0.33) to 90 m (in Q1L2R0.33 and Q2L2R0.33), the values
    of NRMSE increased by 2.37 % and 0.65 %, respectively. It is clear that simulation
    of advance time for the inflow rate of 0.4 l s−1 is more accurate than 0.6 l s−1
    for any combination of the infiltration equations (MKL and BF) and surge infiltration
    concepts (BS and IP) (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5). When the number of cycles
    increased (e.g., Q1L2R0.5 with eight cycles), the accuracy in simulation of advance
    time decreased. At a furrow length of 70 m, the NRMSE value decreased by increasing
    the inflow rate from 0.4 to 0.6 l s−1, though this reduction was not significant.
    Meanwhile, the NRMSE value decreased by increasing the inflow rate from 0.4 l
    s−1 to 0.6 l s−1 in furrows length of 90 m. 3.1.2. Infiltrated water depth Fig.
    6, Fig. 7 illustrate the simulation of infiltrated water depth with two cycle
    ratios of 0.5 and 0.33, respectively. WinSRFR simulated infiltrated water depth
    with excellent accuracy (NRMSE values in all furrows are lower than 10 %). The
    highest accuracy was obtained in Q2L1R0.5 and Q1L1R0.33 with the NRMSE of 2.58
    % and 6.40 % for Q2L1R0.5 and Q1L1R0.33, respectively. Download : Download high-res

    and simulated infiltrated water depth with CR = 0.33. Comparing the results of
    different models showed that the accuracy of BF(IP) was higher than MKL(BS), BF(BS),
    and MKL(IP) in simulating infiltrated water depth (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). For example,
    the best values of NRMSE in cycle ratio of 0.5 were 3.13, 3.64, 1.60, and 6.09
    % in Q1L1R0.5, Q1L2R0.5, Q2L1R0.5, Q2L2R0.5, and in cycle ratio of 0.33 were 3.25,
    10.11, 4.19, and 6.31 % in Q1L1R0.33, Q1L2R0.33, Q2L1R0.33, Q2L2R0.33, respectively,
    which were obtained in BF(IP). Increasing the inflow rate from 0.4 l s−1 to 0.6
    l s−1 decreased the accuracy of the WinSRFR model in simulating infiltration water
    depth under surge irrigation. In contrast, changing the furrow length from 70
    m to 90 m led to increasing simulation accuracy of WinSRFR in infiltrated water
    depth. Therefore, higher accuracy was achieved under lower inflow rates and longer
    furrow length. 3.1.3. Runoff hydrograph The results of Table 1 showed that the
    use of surge irrigation in both cycle ratios decreased the runoff volume significantly
    compared to continuous irrigation. For example, the volume of runoff was reduced
    to 5.45 % and 8.18 % in Q1L1R0.5 and Q1L1R0.33 as opposed to Q1L1. Fig. 8 illustrates
    the simulation of runoff in CR = 0.5. The results of RE values depict that MKL(BS),
    BF(BS), MKL(IP), and BF(IP) models in WinSRFR had high accuracy in the simulation
    of runoff, with the highest accuracy being related to Q1L2R0.5 furrow. Fig. 8
    clearly demonstrates that WinSRFR could simulate the runoff peak accurately at
    CR = 0.5 by increasing the length of furrows, which implies that it is accurate
    in simulating the runoff peak for long furrows at CR = 0.5. In addition, the increase
    in the furrow length from 70 m to 90 m represents that using MKL increased simulation
    accuracy, while BF behaved the opposite (Fig. 8). For instance, by increasing
    the furrow length from 70 m (Q1L1R0.5) to 90 m (Q1L2R0.5), RE improved by 5.34
    % and 1.14 % in the MKL(BS) and MKL(IP), and these improvements were 1.94 % and
    5.21 % from Q2L1R0.5 to Q2L2R0.5 furrows. Hence, BF and MKL are sensitive to the
    furrow length. As can be seen in the above-mentioned figure, all infiltration
    models underestimated runoff in CR = 0.5 (except BF(IP) for Q1L2R0.5). Download

    Comparison of the measured and simulated runoff under surge irrigation by CR =
    0.5. The results of runoff simulation under surge irrigation in CR = 0.33 are
    shown in Fig. 9. WinSRFR had high accuracy in the simulation of runoff based on
    different models. The highest accuracy in runoff simulation is related to Q1L2R0.33,
    which is similar to the results of CR = 0.5. Fig. 9 confirms that runoff peak
    could be simulated more precisely in CR = 0.33 except in the Q2L1R0.33 (i.e.,
    high inflow and short furrows). In addition, runoff was generally underestimated
    in all models of surge irrigation in CR = 0.33 except in Q2L2R0.33 that runoff
    was overestimated. Download : Download high-res image (352KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 9. Comparison of the measured and simulated runoff under
    surge irrigation by CR = 0.33. According to Fig. 8, Fig. 9, with an increase in
    the inflow rate from 0.4 l s−1 to 0.6 l s−1, the simulation accuracy of WinSRFR
    decreased for both cycle ratios (except for Q2L1R0.33 and Q2L2R0.33 furrows).
    In contrast to inflow rate, increasing the furrow length from 70 m to 90 m at
    cycle ratios of 0.5 and 0.33 improved the accuracy of runoff simulation. Finally,
    WinSRFR simulated runoff volumes slightly better at cycle ratio of 0.33 compared
    to cycle ratio of 0.5. The results imply that more accurate simulation of runoff
    peak in surge irrigation could be achieved under smaller cycle ratios, lower inflow
    rates, and longer furrows. This is an important issue when the WinSRFR would be
    used for runoff simulation for reuse of tail water and designing the sump and
    pump rate. 3.2. Evaluation of irrigation performance indicators 3.2.1. Field measurement
    Table 4 summarizes the measured performance indicators for continuous and surge
    irrigation with cycle ratios of 0.5 and 0.33. Based on Table 4, continuous irrigation
    performs poorly compared to surge irrigation, and shifting to surge irrigation
    can significantly improve irrigation performance on farms. For instance, for the
    worst case in continuous irrigation with the lowest AE and highest TWR in Q2L1,
    the high values of DP and TWR caused a decrease in irrigation performance and
    reduced AE to 47 %. However, the results indicated that surge irrigation could
    increase AE values by 17.99 % and 9.79 % in Q2L1 under cycle ratios of 0.5 and
    0.33, respectively. In addition, the values of DP and TWR were reduced by 1.64
    % and 22.49 % in CR = 0.5 and 2.63 % and 13.30 % in CR = 0.33, respectively. Table

    8 min) and 24 min (on-time = 8 min, off-time = 16 min) in surge irrigation. In
    general, the results indicate a significant effect of surge irrigation on improving
    irrigation performance in field conditions when compared to continuous irrigation.
    Most of the time, when the furrow length increased from 70 m to 90 m under continuous
    and surge irrigation, AE and DP increased, while DU and TWR values decreased (Table
    4), which showed that increasing the furrow length improved irrigation performance
    under continuous and surge irrigation. Under continuous and surge irrigation,
    the results indicated an inverse relationship between inflow rates and performance
    indicators, resulting in decreasing AE and DP but increasing TWR and DU. 3.2.2.
    Irrigation performance under surge irrigation with WinSRFR Table 5, Table 6 summarize
    the results of WinSRFR simulations of irrigation performance indices under surge
    irrigation with cycle ratios of 0.5 and 0.33, respectively. Based on the comparison
    between the measured (Table 4) and simulated performance indicators, WinSRFR was
    highly accurate in simulating irrigation performance indices and its components
    under surge irrigation. Therefore, all simulation models used in WinSRFR to simulate
    surge irrigation had similar accuracy. The results also showed that the highest
    and lowest accuracy was obtained in DU and DP estimation, respectively (Table
    5, Table 6). The best simulation accuracy was obtained in MKL(IP) and BF(IP) under
    cycle ratios of 0.5 and 0.33, respectively, which means that IP has been more
    accurate than BS. Comparing both infiltration equations showed that MKL had higher
    accuracy in CR = 0.5, while BF was more precise in CR = 0.33. Overall, by changing
    the cycle ratio from 0.5 to 0.33, the accuracy of AE and TWR increased, while
    the accuracy of DU and DP decreased. Based on the comparison of different methods,
    IP had higher accuracy in simulating surge irrigation with WinSRFR (Table 5, Table
    6). Table 5. Simulated irrigation performance indicators (%) by the WinSRFR model

    Cycle time is 24 min (on-time = 8 min, off-time = 16 min). 3.3. Surge irrigation
    management scenarios For the scenario analyses, we used the average of the , and
    measured in continuous irrigation infiltration equations (Table 2) because our
    investigation showed that the estimated infiltrated water depth using the average
    infiltration coefficients ( , and ) in continuous irrigation resulted in nearly
    similar estimated infiltrated water depth with the most accurate infiltration
    coefficients ( , and ) in surge irrigation (data not shown). This helps designers
    to be able to model the surge treatments from the measured continuous irrigation
    parameters because it is usually difficult to collect surge irrigation infiltration
    data, and designers can use easily measured continuous infiltration coefficients
    in surge irrigation equations. The results of different irrigation management
    scenarios based on the combination of inflow rate, furrow length, cutoff time,
    and on-time in surge irrigation were analyzed and reported as follows. The outcomes
    of this analysis help to identify the best irrigation management scenarios to
    practice in order to achieve the desired irrigation performance. 3.3.1. Infiltrated
    water depth Fig. 10, Fig 11 show the infiltrated water depth for two representative
    lengths of 150 and 250 m for three inflow rates of 0.5, 0.9, and 1.2 l s−1 (minimum,
    mean, and maximum inflow rates). Determining these two lengths has been based
    on avoiding the shortest and longest furrow lengths and willing to make comparisons
    for the middle furrow lengths. Download : Download high-res image (555KB) Download

    Simulated infiltrated water depth for the furrow length of 250 m for three inflow
    rates of 0.5, 0.9, and 1.2 l s−1. As Fig. 10 shows, at an inflow rate of 0.5 l
    s−1 with a length of 150 m in all combinations of cutoff and on-times, water front
    advance does not reach the end of the furrow, and Zreq = 50 mm is not supplied
    at the end of the furrow. At this inflow rate, increasing the cutoff time led
    to an increase in the infiltrated water depth (80–120 mm), especially at the beginning
    of the furrow. Despite the fact that the infiltration pattern at different on-times
    is almost similar, the on-time of 20 min has reduced the irrigation adequacy.
    The pattern of infiltrated water depth is also similar at inflow rates of 0.9
    and 1.2 l s−1. In all the scenarios related to these two inflow rates, the water
    front advance has reached the end of the furrow, and Zreq = 50 mm has been provided
    in the entire furrow. Similar to the inflow rate of 0.5 l s−1, at the inflow rate
    of 0.9 and 1.2 l s−1, the infiltrated water depth has increased with increasing
    the cutoff time. It is obvious that on-time plays an important role in the distribution
    uniformity. The higher the on-time, the higher the distribution uniformity. On
    the other hand, at long on-times (60 min), the effect of inflow rate has decreased
    for the high inflow rates (0.9 and 1.2 l s−1), and as can be seen, at on-time
    of 60 min, in all three cutoff times, the infiltrated water depth is almost similar.
    Therefore, by increasing the inflow rate from 0.9 to 1.2 l s−1, the infiltrated
    water depth has not changed, and it only caused higher runoff volume. In general,
    based on a comparison of the three inflow rates, the best irrigation management
    to provide Zreq = 50 mm at the end of the 150 m long furrow happens at on-time
    of 60 min, with the cutoff time of 360 min, and the inflow rate of 0.9 l s−1.
    According to Fig. 11 and similar to the length of 150 m, the inflow rate of 0.5
    l s−1 is not suitable for long furrows like 250 m because despite the fact that
    the advance phase never completes, under all different cutoff times and on-times,
    the water front advance is almost the same (approximately 148 m from the beginning
    of the furrow), and especially at high cutoff times, the infiltrated water depth
    at the beginning of the furrow is very high. As can be seen, for the inflow rate
    of 0.9 l s−1, the end of the furrow has not received Zreq = 50 mm in any of the
    scenarios. By increasing the on-time, the advance phase has increased, and a longer
    length of the furrow has received water, meaning that except for the on-time of
    20 min at which the water front advance does not reach the end of the furrow,
    at on-times of 40 and 60 min, the advance phase completed, and water front advance
    has reached the end of the furrow. At a constant on-time, the pattern of advance
    phase does not change with the increase of the cutoff time. In addition, as the
    cutoff time increases, deep percolation increases greatly. In all of the scenarios
    associated with the 250-meter furrows, the use of 1.2 l s−1 inflow rate has resulted
    in the completion of the advance phase. At this inflow rate, a rise in the cutoff
    time has increased deep percolation, especially at the beginning of the furrow
    such that at the cutoff time of 600 min and on-time of 20 min, the first 100 m
    of the furrow length had more than 120 mm of infiltrated water depth. On-time
    of 20 min, especially at low cutoff times, has led to deficit irrigation at the
    end of the furrow. The increase of on-time has increased irrigation adequacy and
    distribution uniformity. Therefore, the best irrigation management corresponding
    to the furrow length of 250 m occurs at on-times of 40 and 60 min, with a cutoff
    time of 360 min, and an inflow rate of 1.2 l s−1 although Zreq = 50 mm is not
    fully supplied in the last few meters of the furrow length. Reducing the cutoff
    time and increasing the on-time led to the completion of the advance phase, thus
    reducing deep percolation and increasing distribution uniformity. 3.3.2. Objective
    function (OF) Fig. 12 shows the values of OF in different furrow lengths. It is
    obvious that for all furrow lengths, the highest values of OF were obtained in
    cutoff 360 min and on-time 60 min. By contrast, the lowest value of OF is in cutoff
    600 min and on-time 20 min. Download : Download high-res image (487KB) Download
    : Download full-size image Fig. 12. Objective function (OF) in different furrow
    lengths. By increasing the furrow length, the optimal value of OF occurs at a
    higher inflow rate. This means that by increasing the furrow length, the inflow
    rate should also increase to achieve the best irrigation performance. However,
    the optimal OF under the maximum allowable inflow rate of 1.1 l s−1 occurs for
    the furrow length of 300 m, which implies that furrows longer than 300 m are not
    recommended in this area. The maximum values of OF at the lengths of 100, 150,
    200, 250, and 300 m were estimated 0.38, 0.73, 0.75, 0.71, and 0.70, respectively.
    Except for the length of 100 m, the maximum value of OF is around 0.70–0.75 at
    other lengths. Considering that OF is an objective function that considers plausible
    efficiencies (AE and SE) and non-plausible losses (DP and RO) of irrigation performance
    components, the results of OF in Fig. 12 show that the highest OF = 0.75 belongs
    to the furrow length of 200 m, inflow rate of 0.7 l s−1, cutoff time of 360 min,
    and on-time of 60 min. These values correspond to AE = 91 %, SE = 92 %, DP = 9
    %, and RO = 0 %. Under this irrigation scenario, the irrigation adequacy is 65
    %, and 35 % of the furrow length is under deficit irrigation. Therefore, our results
    imply that that this is the recommended irrigation management practice among the
    other surge irrigation management scenarios. 4. Discussion Because of the lack
    of water resources worldwide, specifically in arid and semi-arid regions, it is
    inevitable that irrigation methods have to change to reduce water consumption
    in agriculture, which could lead to improved irrigation performance and decreased
    water losses. In evaluating and simulating surge irrigation, advance time, infiltrated
    water depth, and runoff are the important parameters (Gudissa and Edossa, 2014,
    Kifle et al., 2017, Ojaghlou et al., 2020). Because of the high sensitivity of
    irrigation performance such as application efficiency and distribution uniformity,
    the infiltrated water depth is the most important parameter in choosing the method
    of evaluation of surge irrigation (Kifle et al., 2017, Onishi et al., 2019). 4.1.
    Evaluation of field observations The advance time of surge irrigation occurs in
    several cycles, which causes uniform water movement in the furrow (Ismail et al.,
    2004, Ismail and Depeweg, 2005). In addition, Gudissa and Edossa, (2014) showed
    that infiltrated water depth is dependent on advance time. Therefore, by increasing
    the advance time in surge irrigation, the infiltrated water depth occurred with
    a more uniform distribution (Fig. 6, Fig. 7), which could lead to a lower runoff
    volume (Table 1). Ojaghluo et al. (2020) indicated that decreasing the infiltrated
    water depth and subsequently increasing the advance time are the most important
    advantages of surge irrigation compared to continuous irrigation. Infiltrated
    water depth is the most important parameter in performance assessment of surface
    irrigation. Using surge irrigation may increase infiltration volume through increasing
    opportunity time along the furrow length, which would consequently reduce the
    runoff volume (Kifle et al., 2017). For this reason, increasing the furrow length
    on the one hand and decreasing the inflow rate on the other hand may increase
    the opportunity time and lead to a more uniform infiltrated water depth. Changes
    in the CR value are one of the most important and significant parameters on the
    infiltration parameters and surge irrigation performance. This is due to its direct
    effect on the cutoff time and opportunity time. Comparing the cycle ratios, it
    was found that decreasing the cycle ratio from 0.5 to 0.33 increased accuracy
    in predicting advance time, infiltrated water depth, and runoff (Fig. 2, Fig.
    3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9). This is due to a longer opportunity
    time in the cycle ratio of 0.33 (by increasing the off-time from 8 to 16 min).
    In agreement with our results, Younts et al. (1996) reported that increasing the
    opportunity time in surge irrigation is due to the entry of water into the furrow
    during several cycles. Furthermore, changing the cycle ratio from 0.5 to 0.33
    improves the distribution of infiltrated water depth (Fig. 6, Fig. 7). This is
    also highlighted by Izuno and Podmore (1985) saying that the on-time duration
    has large effects on the accurate simulation of surge irrigation advance phase
    and irrigation performance indicators, which means that the optimum management
    of on-time and CR is necessary for precise field management. 4.2. Surge infiltration
    models IP and BS are two approaches that WinSRFR uses in surge irrigation modelling.
    In both cases, the basic infiltration rate term f0 is non-zero. Hence, the opportunity
    time at any point is a function of the total time. Nevertheless, “One thing to
    be careful about is that there is no strong body of evidence to support either
    method. Reports of the effect of surge irrigation on infiltration rates are inconsistent
    and very soil dependent. This is definitely a topic that requires extensive investigation”
    (Personal communication with Eduardo Bautista; September 23, 2019). Based on Fig.
    6, Fig. 7, BF was more accurate as an infiltration equation than MKL. Moreover,
    using surge irrigation modelling concept of IP showed high accuracy in simulating
    the infiltrated water depth. The main reason for the better performance of BF
    and IP is the entry of a branch of water into the furrow, which is similar to
    the entry of water in surge irrigation in different cycles. The advance time,
    infiltrated water depth, and runoff were also evaluated in WinSRFR to compare
    the accuracy of MKL(BS), BF(BS), MKL(IP), and BF(IP) models. However, because
    of the high sensitivity of irrigation performance indicators, such as application
    efficiency and distribution uniformity, the amount of infiltrated water depth
    in the furrow is the most relevant parameter when evaluating surge irrigation
    (Ismail and Depeweg, 2005). Although both surge irrigation concepts were highly
    accurate and precise, IP was slightly more accurate than BS (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig.
    4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9). This shows that BS that benefits from
    CR in its formulations may not fully represent the infiltration process though
    it is not also a function of the basic infiltration rate as IP is. Indeed, the
    bold difference between IP and BS is that the major reduction in the effective
    infiltration rate in IP happens during the off time in the first cycle, whereas
    in the BS, a reduction in the infiltration rate occurs during every off time period
    though the amount of the reduction would decrease during each successive off time.
    During a real surge irrigation, however, a portion of the furrow would be wetted
    during the early part of the off time when water continues to advance. Ignoring
    this wetted part will make biases when calculating the infiltration during the
    next cycles (Blair and Smerdon, 1987). Changing the irrigation method from continuous
    to surge irrigation is a recommended approach to improve irrigation performance
    and reduce water losses in surface irrigation systems. The WinSRFR model is highly
    useful for simulating and assessing surge irrigation under BS and IP because it
    is user-friendly and has a comprehensive set of features. Bautista and Schlegel
    (2019) emphasized that the infiltration process of surge irrigation is yet not
    well understood and that we should be cautious when evaluating and simulating
    surge irrigation. However, an important knowledge gap for surface irrigation systems
    was the lack of evaluation and comparison of the surge irrigation models and the
    associated infiltration processes that was attempted to address in this study.
    Our study proved that WinSRFR is a reliable tool for surge irrigation modelling,
    and further studies are required to check the accuracy of BS and IP in other field
    conditions such as long furrows, higher inflow rates, different cycle times and
    cycle ratios, and soil texture variations. 4.3. Irrigation performance under surge
    irrigation The main purpose of evaluating irrigation systems is to examine the
    parameters affecting the irrigation performance and provide different scenarios
    to increase it. In general, surge irrigation increased irrigation performance
    and reduced water losses compared to continuous irrigation because of its effect
    on the process of infiltration and more uniform distribution of water in the field
    compared to continuous irrigation (Benham et al., 2000; Horst et al., 2007; Ojaghlou
    et al., 2020). The off time in surge irrigation increases the opportunity time
    in all stations, and because a part of the soil water content is provided in the
    first cycles, the water movement in the next cycles is done more quickly and uniformly.
    These factors lead to greater uniformity of infiltrated water depth, as a result
    of which the AE and DU increase, and TWR decreases. According to Ismail and Depeweg
    (2005), the most important effect of surge irrigation is on the value of f0, which
    leads to an increase in DU value. Kifle et al. (2017) showed that the use of surge
    irrigation leads to an increase in performance indicators, such as AE up to 60
    % and DU up to 87 %. Also, Kanber et al. (2001) showed that the use of surge irrigation
    can reduce TWR by 21 % to 38 % and DP by 19 % to 70 %. The inflow rate, cutoff
    time, and cycle ratio are the management parameters that can be controlled by
    the farmer in the field, and the evaluation of these parameters are most effective
    in improving irrigation performance (Kifle et al., 2017, Ojaghlou et al., 2020,
    Mazarei et al., 2021). The results showed that using the cycle ratio of 0.33 leads
    to improved performance particularly for the DU and DP (Table 4). This can be
    due to increasing the off time from 8 to 16 min in the field, which leads to an
    increase in the possibility of infiltration and uniform infiltrated water depth
    in the root zone (in this study, a depth of 1 m). Former studies have also confirmed
    that smaller CR in heavy texture soils is more beneficial for achieving higher
    distribution uniformity (Alemi and Goldhamer, 1988, Izuno and Podmore, 1986, Boldt
    et al., 1994). Also, by increasing the opportunity time and higher infiltration
    volume, the amount of runoff decreases. Runoff reduction is an important feature
    of using surge irrigation, which can be minimized by optimizing the cycle ratio
    and cycle time. Moreover, longer furrow length and lower inflow rate (i.e. Q1L2)
    resulted in higher opportunity time that ultimately led to improved irrigation
    performance under surge irrigation (Table 5, Table 6) (Ojaghlou et al., 2020).
    However, it should be remembered that although higher opportunity time under long
    furrow and low inflow rate would reduce runoff volume (Fig. 6, Fig. 7), it might
    cause excess percolation (Fig. 8, Fig. 9) that under field conditions leach nutrients.
    Therefore, optimum conditions could be modelled to reduce the likely environmental
    impacts of this trade off by choosing the appropriate cycle ratio/time, infiltration
    model, as well as optimizing the field length and the inflow rate, which lead
    to improvements in the performance of surface irrigation systems and reduction
    of water losses (runoff and excess percolation). 4.4. Scenario analysis 4.4.1.
    Irrigation management practices Surge irrigation is the intermittent application
    of water to furrows in a series of on and off time periods until the water reaches
    the end of the furrow, and the required water is provided (Gudissa and Edossa,
    2014). Our scenario analyses run on different furrow lengths showed that under
    higher inflow rates and longer on-times the water front in the first surge reaches
    the end of the furrow. This means that under this surge irrigation management
    the whole furrow length would become wet during the first surge, and therefore
    there is no dry and transition phases of infiltration stages (Izuno and Podmore,
    1985). This is noteworthy that the water from the first surge disappear during
    the off-time, implying that the following surge will be applied on wet soil surface.
    So, overall, the recession time is shorter (5 to 6 min) than the off-time (20,
    40, and 60 min). By this analysis, we propose a new surge irrigation strategy
    as “wet-cycle surge irrigation” with long pulses (on-time) that will cause the
    stream reach the furrow end, as will does a larger inflow rate. This surge strategy
    allows the water to reach the end of the field more easily. The scenario analyses
    of the wet-cycle surge irrigation show that if the water reaches the end of the
    furrow with one or two surges, it will improve the performance of the irrigation
    system (Fig. 10, Fig 11). However, if the inflow rate and applied volume are not
    sufficient enough to force the stream to advance steadily, the stream will eventually
    halt. In practice, an irrigation engineer never designs a furrow system that is
    similar to such conditions. The proper application of wet-cycle surge irrigation
    strategy is in the soils in which deep percolation is potentially high, and the
    application of surge irrigation leads to higher deep percolation, especially at
    the beginning of the furrow. Therefore, when the inflow rate and on-time increase,
    the stream reaches the end of the furrow easily with one or two surges, leading
    to a reduction in deep percolation and an improvement in distribution uniformity.
    However, it is required to verify the new proposed wet-cycle surge irrigation
    in further field experiments, particularly for different soil types. While field
    experiments are invaluable in collecting data and observation, there are some
    limitations in conducting field experiments for a wide range of applications and
    practices. The first limitation is that field experiments are time-consuming and
    costly. The second limitation is that it is not feasible and practical to test
    several scenarios and treatments. Therefore, numerical simulation models are useful
    and efficient in scenario-analysis using a well calibrated and validated model.
    Utilizing irrigation models allows for the exploration of various irrigation management
    scenarios tailored to a specific region, and model users could make the best decisions
    based on them. These models take into account the field management and hydraulic
    parameters such as furrow length, inflow rate, on-time, and cutoff time. By implementing
    these parameters, the irrigation engineer may recommend the best possible irrigation
    management option. For this purpose, we considered these parameters as management
    scenarios that resulted in multiple nomographs (Fig. 13). These nomographs are
    graphical tools that users can impliment to design irrigation systems based on
    the specific conditions, goals, and criteria (Zerihun et al., 1993). The nomographs
    for designing the inflow rate and furrow length in different cutoff times and
    on-times are illustrated in Fig. 13. These nomographs provide combinations of
    irrigation decision variables for scenario analyses. The contour lines in the
    nomographs are application efficiency (%), storage efficiency (%), and runoff
    (%). For example, the user might be interested in choosing two types of irrigation
    management depending on water availability as full irrigation and deficit irrigation.
    In the first case, the objective is to achieve full irrigation, meaning that all
    furrows receive the required water depth. However, despite achieving a storage
    efficiency of 100 % in this situation, there is a decrease in application efficiency.
    Additionally, excessive runoff and deep percolation would occur. In the second
    case, the objective is deficit irrigation with no runoff. In this situation, users
    should focus on the sections of the nomographs that indicate no runoff. By doing
    so, the application efficiency increases, while the storage efficiency, runoff,
    and deep percolation decrease. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download

    efficiency, storage efficiency, and runoff based on furrow lengths, inflow rates,
    cutoff times, and on-times. In a specific condition where designers have an option
    of runoff reuse system at the end of the land that runoff is collected (Lehrsch
    et al., 2014), the design can be tailored to accommodate runoff. These nomographs
    serve as helpful tools for achieving an optimal design, especially when designers
    tend to design irrigation systems as well as the reuse system simultaneously.
    It is noteworthy that this scenario analysis has been only done for CR = 0.5.
    The reason is that for CR = 0.33 that the off-time is longer than the on-time
    (20, 40, and 60 min) would lead to a similar irrigation strategy as wet-cycle
    surge irrigation where the next surges will run on wet soils because of short
    recession time. Therefore, for simplicity, emphasis was on CR = 0.5 that is the
    most common cycle ratio in practice (Henggeler et al., 1986, Fekersillassie and
    Eisenhauer, 2000, Fipps, 2012). Furthermore, other surface irrigation models such
    as SIRMOD only considers CR = 0.5 (Walker, 2005). So, our proposed analysis would
    serve as an analysis approach that could be followed by other irrigation researchers
    and engineers. 4.4.2. Objective function as an agro-environmental irrigation decision
    making tool In this study, we investigate the multifaceted aspects of optimal
    irrigation performance, focusing on key performance parameters AE, SE, DP, and
    RO. AE reflects the proportion of applied water that effectively reaches the rooting
    zone; SE shows the percentage of water storage in the root zone; DP assesses infiltrated
    water below the root zone; and RO accounts for runoff-associated wastage and erosion.
    OF was chosen to concurrently encompass both the agricultural (AE and SE) and
    environmental (DP and RO) components. The multiplication of AE and SE indicates
    how much of the water that has entered the field is stored in the rooting zone
    and would be used by the plant. Consequently, this concept is tied to agricultural
    management. On the other hand, the excess water that is not stored in the rooting
    zone is deep percolation and/or runoff, which cause environmental concerns, including
    soil erosion and nutrient loss, which are interconnected with environmental management.
    In areas where water resources are limited and/or water prices are high in terms
    of price per volume or groundwater extraction costs (Berbel et al., 2018, Gonzalez-Alvarez
    et al., 2006), AE is an indicator that affects the irrigation system efficiency
    of how delivered water is utilized and stored (SE) in the field and how it would
    contribute to water losses (extra environmental costs) in terms of RO and DP.
    Moreover, by increasing the applied irrigation water that impacts the (AE × SE),
    there would be obvious consequences on runoff and deep percolation. Therefore,
    the contribution of improving the irrigation efficiency (AE × SE) would be on
    controlling the environmental flows (RO and DP) and associated costs (Linstead,
    2018) associated with sediment control, nutrient management, and grey water footprint
    (Jia, 2023, Chukalla et al., 2018, Mekonnen and Hoekstra, 2015). Also, OF helps
    to manage irrigation practices according to the water resource availability. For
    example, if the required water resources are limited, a deficit irrigation management
    should be adopted that would be associated with higher AE and lower RO and DP.
    However, if sufficient water sources are available, a full irrigation management
    is designed, which may even allow the irrigation engineer design runoff reuse
    and tail-water return system (Omer et al., 2019, Falconer et al., 2015, Schwankl
    et al., 2007) to reduce the environmental impacts of RO and increase irrigation
    efficiency at field and regional scales (Scott et al., 2014). As a result, the
    simultaneous integration of agricultural and environmental terms enables us to
    comprehensively analyze and manage various aspects, including costs, environmental
    impact, and water resource management. Therefore, the proposed OF is a useful
    management tool for the irrigation engineers and stakeholders to design the best
    management irrigation practices that suits the local agro-environmental conditions.
    4.5. Limitations and challenges in switching to surge irrigation While surge irrigation
    offers a promising approach to enhance irrigation efficiency and reduce water
    losses, it is essential to acknowledge and address the limitations and challenges
    inherent in this irrigation technique (Borhade, 2018). We emphasize the need for
    a more balanced narrative that encompasses both the benefits and potential drawbacks
    of surge irrigation, including considerations of excessive percolation leading
    to nutrient leaching. Incorporating a comprehensive understanding of these limitations
    and challenges into the broader discourse on surge irrigation will pave the way
    for informed decision-making and the development of context-specific strategies
    (Younts and Eisenhauer, 2008). Moreover, the practical implementation of surge
    irrigation introduces specific challenges that merit careful consideration. The
    transition from continuous irrigation to surge irrigation necessitates infrastructural
    adjustments and associated costs (Bryant et al., 2021, Wood et al., 2017, Shock
    and Welch, 2011). The economic feasibility of this transition, alongside available
    resources, assumes significant importance in determining the viability of adopting
    surge irrigation. Furthermore, the applicability of surge irrigation may vary
    across diverse global contexts, shaped by distinct environmental, climatic, and
    geographical conditions. Variations in soil types, regional climate patterns,
    and geographical constraints can impact the effectiveness of surge irrigation,
    potentially limiting its universal suitability, which highlight site-specific
    testing and assessment (Goldhamer et al., 1987). Consequently, discussions around
    the regional adaptability and practicality of surge irrigation are indispensable
    for a holistic evaluation of its potential benefits and challenges. 5. Conclusion
    One of the crucial strategies to optimize water consumption and reduce water losses
    on the farm is to switch from continuous to surge irrigation. This study evaluated
    and simulated surge irrigation with two cycle ratios of 0.5 and 0.33 at different
    furrow lengths, and inflow rates and field data were compared to simulated data
    by the WinSRFR model. Furthermore, this study was carried out to investigate modified
    Kostiakov-Lewis and branch function equations as infiltration equations and IP
    and BS as surge irrigation modelling concepts. The results showed that WinSRFR
    had high accuracy in the simulation of advance time, infiltrated water depth,
    and runoff simulation under surge irrigation. The highest accuracy in the simulation
    was achieved at MKL(IP) for advance time and at BF(IP) for infiltrated water depth
    and runoff. IP was slightly more accurate than BS. Changing the cycle ratio from
    0.5 to 0.33 improved simulation accuracy in advance time and runoff while reducing
    the accuracy of infiltrated water depth; however, it specifically improved the
    distribution uniformity and deep percolation. Increasing the inflow rate from
    0.4 l s−1 to 0.6 l s−1 reduced simulation accuracy in advance time, infiltration
    water depth, and runoff. However, changing the furrow length from 70 m to 90 m
    decreased the accuracy of advance time simulation while increasing the accuracy
    of WinSRFR in infiltrated water depth simulation and runoff. Switching from continuous
    to surge irrigation could significantly improve irrigation performance. Surge
    irrigation increased application efficiency and decreased deep percolation. Results
    indicated that increasing the furrow length from 70 m to 90 m and reducing the
    inflow rate from 0.6 l s−1 to 0.4 l s−1 increased application efficiency and decreased
    runoff. The results showed that the best irrigation performance was achieved with
    an inflow rate of 0.4 l s−1 and a furrow length of 90 m. The optimal irrigation
    scenario involved adjusting parameters such as the inflow rate, furrow length,
    cutoff time, and on-time to achieve the best irrigation performance. In general,
    the results indicated that for all inflow rates and furrow length, a cutoff time
    of 360 min and an on-time of 60 min reduced water losses and improved distribution
    uniformity. The findings of this study suggest the potential for proposing a new
    surge irrigation management approach named as \"wet-cycle surge irrigation\".
    In the proposed approach, the first surge would advance the entire furrow length,
    and the subsequent surges would be applied to the wet soil. This alternative surge
    irrigation strategy would certainly require further investigations and experimentations
    under diverse field managements and hydraulic parameters to investigate its effectiveness
    in optimizing irrigation performance and efficiency for minimizing irrigation
    water losses. Dedication Seyed Hamid Ahmadi would like to sincerely dedicate this

  description: The objective of this study is to verify the overall performance and
    evaluate the wastewater quality of the wastewater treatment plant at the Abu Ghraib
    Dairy Factory and compare the results with the Iraqi Quality Standards (IQS) for
    effluent disposal and with the national determinants of treated water use. Agricultural
    irrigation wastewater, which included daily assessment records of the main parameters
    affecting wastewater [five-day biochemical oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen
    demand (COD), total dissolved solids (T.D.S), total suspended solids (TSS), phosphate
    (PO4), nitrate (NO3), hydrogen ion concentration (pH)] obtained from the quality
    control department of Abu Ghraib dairy plant registered from January 2017 to December
    2020. The results of the studied treatment plant showed that the removal efficiency
    of the influencing parameters is BOD5, COD, TDS, SS, PO4, NO3 were 95.25, 96.61,
    71.54, 32.50, and 4.43%, respectively, based on the results obtained from the
    daily records of laboratory examinations of the plant. These results indicate
    that the quality of treated wastewater was not following the Iraqi Quality Standards
    (IQS) for liquid waste disposal due to the failure to achieve the required treatment
    for phosphate. It is not allowed to use in agricultural irrigation due to the
    inability to achieve the necessary treatment for the total suspended solids. According
    to the national determinants of reusing treated wastewater for irrigation, the
    performance of the treated plant was not efficient enough to achieve the required
    wastewater treatment.

  description: Wetland systems are inexpensive and easy-to-operate wastewater systems
    and are widely used globally at different scales for the safe treatment of wastewater.
    This study aims to evaluate a pilot-scale vertical flow wetland system treating
    wastewater under different loadings. The wetland system was constructed using
    indigenous plants (Imperata cylindrical) and operated using actual wastewater
    for twelve-months. Samples from influent and effluent of the wetland system were
    collected weekly. They were analyzed for parameters listed in the Kuwait Environment
    Public Authority standards for reuse in irrigation, such as organic matter, nutrients,
    heavy metals, and microorganisms. The results showed that the high hydraulic loading
    rate (1.67 m3/m2.d) phase was more efficient than the low hydraulic loading rate

    systems are inexpensive and easy-to-operate wastewater systems and are widely
    used globally at different scales for the safe treatment of wastewater. This study
    aims to evaluate a pilot-scale vertical flow wetland system treating wastewater
    under different loadings. The wetland system was constructed using indigenous
    plants (Imperata cylindrical) and operated using actual wastewater for twelve-months.
    Samples from influent and effluent of the wetland system were collected weekly.
    They were analyzed for parameters listed in the Kuwait Environment Public Authority
    standards for reuse in irrigation, such as organic matter, nutrients, heavy metals,
    and microorganisms. The results showed that the high hydraulic loading rate (1.67
    m3/m2.d) phase was more efficient than the low hydraulic loading rate (1.04 m3/m2.d)
    phase in terms of organics and nutrient removal efficiency. The range of the removal
    efficiency of organic matter in low and high loading rates was around 48.5–49.0%
    and 59.1–59.1%, respectively. In addition, the range of the removal efficiency
    of nutrients in low and high loading rates was around 43.7–67.7% and 24.7–76.6%,
    respectively. Moreover, the range of the removal efficiency of heavy metals under
    the low and high loading rates was − 134.3–93.8% and − 1545.7–92.6%, respectively.
    It was evident that he metals were leaching from the soil. Moreover, it was found
    that the system performance was closely linked to the ambient temperature effects
    during the start-up (r = 0.59) and high hydraulic loading (r = 0.43) phases for
    example. While ambient temperature has wider effects on wetland biota, its effects
    on the plants are more pronounced. In conclusion, wetland systems can be constructed
    using indigenous plants to treat office wastewater efficiently under the harsh
    climate conditions of Kuwait with adjustments in capacity, loading rates, and

    treatmentWetland Introduction Wastewater treatment could offer a valuable water
    resource for Kuwait and other arid and semi-arid countries with shortages in freshwater
    supply [1] and could significantly bridge the gap between water supply and demand.
    However, the main concern with wastewater treatment reuse or recirculation is
    its composition (that is, nutrients [nitrogen; N, phosphorus; P], chemicals, and
    pathogens), which can be detrimental to human health and aquatic life and might
    present environmental hazards if not appropriately treated [2], [3]. Additionally,
    inappropriate wastewater discharge would release nutrients and waterborne pathogenic
    microbes into the receiving environment and may raise environmental issues. Small-scale
    (in situ) wastewater treatment technology is receiving significant attention worldwide
    and could help address the issue of rising water demand. For example, recently,
    the government of Kuwait has turned its attention to wastewater treatment and
    reuse in the irrigation of landscapes to reduce the cost and demand of the limited
    freshwater [4], [5]. Many parts of the world are not connected to a centralized
    sewer system and mainly depend on limited wastewater treatment and disposal practices
    such as septic or storage tanks [6], [7]. On the other hand, centralized wastewater
    management systems are capital-intensive and often need to be more economical.
    In-situ wastewater management systems could offer an alternative inexpensive source
    of water for reuse at the generation point, and, therefore, it is advantageous
    to have a suitable and cost-effective in-situ wastewater treatment system to treat
    wastewater and reuse it for irrigation [8], [9]. Wetland systems are considered
    one of the in situ wastewater treatment technology that is easy to operate, cost-effective,
    consumes less energy, and is environmentally friendly (green systems) [10], [11],
    [12]. Wetland systems can be used for small communities, as well as for areas
    that are not connected to the sewer system [13], [14], [15]. Therefore, this research
    study aimed at designing, constructing, and evaluating the performance of a small-scale
    wetland system to treat the wastewater generated at Sulaibiya Research Plant (SRP).
    A wetland system is a system that can biodegrade/remove organic matter (OM), nutrients,
    heavy metals, and so on by the bacteria attached to the media and in the plants.
    The treatment process is also enhanced by passing the wastewater media (filtration)
    and plant roots horizontally or vertically and reusing it for irrigation [16].
    Several research studies [17], [18], [19] evaluated the performance efficiency
    of vertical flow constructed wetland (VFCW) systems. These studies revealed that
    the system is a suitable treatment technology with respect to water quality parameters.
    In addition, these studies revealed that VFCW systems’ performance was satisfactory
    in suspended solids (SS) and OM, as represented by chemical oxygen demand (COD)
    and biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and was limited in P removal due to the insufficient
    interaction between the wastewater and the substrate media. Other studies mentioned
    that VFCWs can also achieve a satisfactory level of nitrification [20], [21],
    [22]. However, some research studies pointed out that the performance of VFCWs
    was poor regarding denitrification [23], [24]. Furthermore, many recent research
    studies have demonstrated that VFCWs with intermittent loading regimes can denitrify
    effectively with some amendments and modifications to the system [25], [26], [27].
    VFCWs are primarily used in Europe, predominantly in Austria, Denmark, Germany,
    the United Kingdom (UK), France and the United States of America (USA) [28]. The
    application of VFCWs is gradually developing in Asia and Africa [29], [30]. In
    addition, in Kuwait, the wetland system was applied at Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh Camp
    from 2008 to 2013 for 500 people to treat their wastewater onsite [31]. Results
    showed that the system was successfully applied under Kuwait’s conditions with
    removal efficiencies of 93.3% for COD, 92.5% for BOD, 74% for NH4+-N, 43% for
    PO4-P, and 99.9% for total coliform. Also, the results showed that the treated
    wastewater met the specifications for its reuse for irrigation purposes (Kuwait
    Environment Public Authority (KEPA) standards). However, the disadvantages of
    the constructed wetlands (CWs) include high land area requirements (depending
    on the design), the need for a preliminary treatment before the treatment of the
    wastewater by the system, and the need for higher retention time than a conventional
    system [32], [33]. For that reason, VFCWs have the advantage over horizontal flow
    type since they are more efficient and require less land area [34], [35]. This
    research paper examines the VFCW pilot for wastewater treatment under Kuwait conditions
    and its reuse potential according to KEPA standards using tidal flow strategy
    to enhance the oxygen into the VFCW. Specifically, this research aims to design
    and construct a small-scale wetland system using indigenous plants suitable for
    treating office wastewater generated at a selected office complex site. Specifically,
    under the harsh climate conditions of Kuwait, the project objectives are to infer
    about the feasibility of VCWS suitability, evaluate the quality of treated wastewater
    from the wetland treatment system, and understand its limitations. This work is
    vital since many areas in Kuwait and globally are not connected to centralized
    wastewater treatment systems and need adequate environmentally friendly treatment.
    Methods and materials This study utilized the wetland system to treat wastewater
    and reuse it for irrigating the landscape at Kuwait''s SRP. A VFCW system was
    fabricated in the mechanical workshop at the KISR and transferred to SRP. The
    CW has an impermeable lining and is slightly inclined to facilitate the movement
    and collection of the water flow from the influent to the effluent. The VFCW system
    has a height of 1 m, a width of 60 cm, and a length of 60 cm. It was fabricated
    using acrylic sheets installed on a steel base, and its outlet is situated at
    a height of 50 cm from the ground surface, as shown in Fig. 1. The single CW system
    consists of the following three layers: • At the bottom, a drainage layer, filled
    with gravel media, having a height of 20 cm, to facilitate the drainage of the
    wastewater, • On the top of the drainage layer is the primary filter consisting
    of a random packing media with a height of 50 cm, and • At the top is the distribution
    layer, primarily soil media of 10 cm depth planted with macrophytes. Download

    Schematic diagram of the wetland system. The top layer is designed to distribute
    the wastewater uniformly over the surface area of the VFCW system. Random packing
    was used as a biological support media in the VFCW system since it provides a
    large surface area for microbial growth, enhancing the biodegradation component
    of the treatment process. The type of macrophytes used is Imperata cylindrical.
    The wastewater was pumped from the existing septic tank located at the parking
    area of the SRP to a storage tank (volume 500 L) to feed the wetland system, as
    shown in Fig. 1. Initially, during the start-up period (3 months, from 12 January
    to 9 April 2022), the system was fed with wastewater from the storage tank every
    1–2 d to allow biofilm development. During the start-up period, the CW system
    was filled 2–3 times per week (the system can treat up to 130 L per cycle). One
    sample was collected weekly, 1 L (influent and effluent, before and after the
    wetland system). In situ measurement was conducted for pH, temperature, dissolved
    oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity (EC), and oxidation-reduction potential (ORP).
    The collected samples were analysed for other wastewater parameters, including
    BOD5, COD, TPO4, NH3, TN, Al, As, Ba, B, Cd, Cr, Ni, Hg, Co, Fe, Sb, Cu, Mn, Zn
    and Pb at KISR laboratories and compared with KEPA standards for irrigation water
    purposes [36], as shown in Table 1 along with the characteristics of the wastewater.
    Field and laboratory analysis was conducted according to Carranzo [37]. After
    the start-up, full operation with a low hydraulic loading rate (HLR) was started
    on 10 April 2022 with 3 cycles per day (100 L per cycle). Each cycle comprised
    6 h (3 h wet and 3 h dry). One sample (influent and effluent, before and after
    the wetland system) per week was collected during this stage with parameters similar
    to that of the start-up stage. During the low HLR period, a volume of 0.3 m3/d
    (2.1 m3/week) of wastewater was used to operate the system, resulting in a hydraulic
    retention time (HRT) of 10.4 h. The low HLR stage ended on 30 July 2022, and the
    high HLR stage started on 31 July until 31 December 2022 with 3 cycles per day
    (160 L per cycle). Each cycle comprised 6 h (3 h wet and 3 h dry). During this
    stage, one sample was taken every two weeks, with the same parameters as in the
    previous two phases (influent and effluent, before and after the wetland system).
    It is important to mention that the HLRs (1.67 and 1.04 m3/m2.d) are similar to
    the operation range (0.25–1.5 m3/m2.d) as mentioned by Metcalf and Eddy [38].

    Statistical methods were used separately to assess raw wastewater concentrations
    and removal rates for the start-up, low, and high HLRs. Analysis was first carried
    out using the typical statistical measures to determine the data''s location (mean
    and median) and variability (standard deviation and coefficient of variation).
    The statistical analysis, including parametric and non-parametric tests, was conducted
    using Excel (2016). Results and discussion The wetland system was operated in
    three phases; 1) Start-up phase (12 January to 9 April 2022), 2) Low HLR phase
    (10 April to 30 July 2022), and 3) High HLR phase (31 July until 31 December 2022).
    The results of the three phases are presented as follows: Wastewater samples were
    collected once every week from influent and effluent and analyzed for the parameters
    listed in Table 1. In total, 22 samples were collected (11 influent and 11 effluent).
    The start-up phase was 3 months [39]. It is important to know that during the
    start-up period, plant growth, microbiological growth, and the interception properties
    of the wetland are expected to change until the wetland system is fully developed
    and its efficiency reaches a stable value. VFCWs utilize microbial-mediated removal
    pathways to treat biodegradable contaminants such as organics and nutrients [40].
    This is clearly reflected in Fig. 2. Download : Download high-res image (231KB)

    start-up phase. As shown in Fig. 2, the removal efficiency after start-up reached
    (74.7% and 74.0% for BOD and COD, respectively) which is typical of VFCW systems
    > 70.0% [41], [42], [43] with an average of 46.9% and 48.1% for BOD and COD, respectively.
    Table 2 shows the average concentrations of the measured parameters and their
    average removal efficiencies during the low HLR phase (1.04 m3/m2.d), which was
    operated for a period of (4.5 months). An average efficiency of 48.5% for BOD
    and 49.0% for COD was similar to previous results [44], [45], [46]. One investigation
    Li, M. et al. [44] examining a pilot-scale CW planted with Salicornia bigelovii
    and treating artificial mariculture wastewater under different hydraulic operating
    regimes using haydites as a main filter media. This study achieved removal rates
    between 33.9% and 44.6%. Another study Wang, Q. et al. [45] focused on using intertidal
    wetland sediment (IWS) as an innovative source for treating saline wastewater
    in CWs, both with and without Phragmites australis plants, using gravel and sand
    as the primary filter media, achieving removal rates from 51% to 80%. Additionally,
    another investigation Saeed, T. et al. [46] aimed to enhance the removal performance
    of organics and nutrients in four hybrid wetland systems, which employed landfill
    leachate as the influent. These wetlands used either organic materials like coal
    and coco peat or construction materials like concrete blocks, bricks, and sand
    as fillers, and they were planted with Phragmites australis or Chrysopogon zizanioides
    (Vetiver) species. This study achieved removal rates ranging from 55% to 76% in
    line with these studies. The low removal rates were attributed to hydraulic operating
    regimes (Intermittent or Batch operating regimes), the microbial communities abundant,
    and oxygen transportation and consumption rate. In our study, the main reasons
    for lower values could be attributed to the characteristics of the offices wastewater,
    HRT and oxygen transfer into the system. However, for some metals, a negative
    removal was observed (for example, Cd and Ni in Table 2). This typical fluctuation
    in metal concentrations could be attributed to resuspension or leaching from the
    soil layer [47], [48]. Table 2. Parameters and removal efficiencies during the

    high HLR was run for a period of (4.5 months). Table 3 shows the average concentrations
    of the measured parameters and their average removal efficiencies during the high
    HLR phase. During this phase, a removal efficiency of 59.1% and 59.1% for BOD
    and COD was reached, similar to previous studies [49], [50], [51]. For example,
    Tan, X. et al. [49] investigated the long-term operation of a Tidal Flow Constructed
    Wetland (TFCW) for treating domestic wastewater and achieved pollutant removal
    rates in the range of 37.5–68.8%. This TFCW used activated alumina as a substrate
    in parallel with shale ceramsite layer. Another study Ung, T. et al. [50] demonstrated
    a straightforward method to enhance the treatment efficiency and contaminant removal
    in the CW process for domestic wastewater. They combined a CW (planted with Cyperus
    involucratus) with a flowform cascade system and used crushed stone as the primary
    filter media, achieving removal rates between 60% and 65%. Furthermore, another
    investigation Mittal, Y. et al. [51] explored various types of CWs for the treatment
    of domestic wastewater. These CWs employed gravel as the primary filter media
    and were planted with Canna indica. They were followed by a slow sand filter (SSF)
    for wastewater treatment and disinfection, achieving an average removal efficiency
    of 67.0 ± 2.4%. The low removal rates in this study were attributed to high organic
    content, oxygen transfer into the system, and HRT. In our study, the main reason
    for lower values could be attributed to the characteristics of the offices wastewater,
    HRT and oxygen transfer into the system limitations. Table 3. Parameters and removal

    0.0087 -25.2 The removal rates achieved in this study are superior to the low
    HLR efficiencies and could be attributed to a lower F/M ratio resulting in inferior
    biological degradation [52]. Additionally, the roles of nutrient concentration
    and organics to nutrient ratio (COD/TN is 2.7 and COD/ TPO4 is 5.5) may have played
    a role in the process performance [38]. Overall performance of the wetland system
    It is usually believed that a single-stage CW system cannot effectively remove
    organics, nutrients, and heavy metals because of its inability to provide alternate
    aerobic and anoxic conditions within the single stage [53]. Consequently, to enhance
    removal effectiveness, either a recirculation strategy or multistage CWs should
    be used [54]. As described in the methodology, an independent samples t-test,
    or its non-parametric equivalent Mann-Whitney test, was performed for each variable,
    comparing inflow and outflow concentration levels during the start-up, low HLR,
    and high HLR operational modes. The results of these tests indicate, with p exact
    (<0.05), that some variables (for example, As, B, Cd, and Co) are not effectively
    removed in the wetland system. However, during both low and high HLR, the wetland
    system effectively treated some organics, nutrients, and metals. Low hydraulic
    loading rate phase During this period, the organics (BOD and COD) were the main
    indicators for the system’s performance. BOD and COD concentrations and efficiency
    variation of the wetland system with time is shown in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, respectively.
    The increase in efficiency was steady and almost identical for BOD and COD, indicating
    that the office wastewater does not contain hard-to-degrade organics and is similar
    to domestic wastewater in terms of organic load [55]. The average efficiencies
    achieved were 48.5% and 49.0% for BOD and COD, respectively, similar to previous
    results [44], [45], [46]. While these efficiencies seem slightly more than those
    achieved during the start-up period, the effluents’ quality was much better than
    those for both BOD and COD. For example, the average effluent for the start-up
    period was 76.9 and 120 mg/l for BOD and COD, respectively. During the low loading
    rate, the effluent concentrations were 52.4 and 85.8 mg/l for BOD and COD, respectively.
    During the low loading rate stage, the COD was below thresholds (Table 1), indicating
    that possible improvements in effluent quality could be observed during the next
    high loading rate stage. Download : Download high-res image (129KB) Download :

    and P) are the leading indicator for the system’s performance and the plants.
    Excessive nutrients would contaminate the water, causing severe problems for human
    health and the environment, which affect the economy: for example, the eutrophication
    phenomenon, deterioration of water quality, contamination of soils and plants,
    and transmission of diseases [56]. Eutrophication can be defined as an ecosystem
    rich in nutrients in the water body, which causes a dense growth of plant life
    (e.g., algae) on its surface. Eutrophication reduces the light reaching the bottom
    of the water body resulting in a decreased amount of sunlight for infiltration
    [57]. As a result, the death and decomposition of blooming algae affect the DO
    levels by depleting and minimizing the DO in the water. It reduces the DO that
    fish and other aquatic life need to survive, leading to considerable fish sickness
    and subsequent death [58]. Moreover, anoxic and anaerobic reactions take place
    in the water system. In addition, human health is affected by blooming algae due
    to high toxins produced from the algae and bacterial growth, which can make people
    sick if they come into contact with or drink contaminated water and consume tainted
    fish or shellfish [59]. The concentrations of TPO4, NH3, and TN and the efficiency
    variation of the wetland system with time are shown in Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6.
    The increase in efficiency was steady, and a single CW system was expected to
    have a low-efficiency removal, especially for TPO4, as the CW system was not designed
    to treat P. The increased nutrient removal indicates healthy wetland plants, microorganisms,
    and flora and fauna growth [60], [61]. The concentrations of TPO4, NH3, and TN
    and the efficiency variation of the wetland system with time are shown in Fig.
    5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7. The effluents of TPO4 were below the Kuwait reuse standards,
    which ranged from 2.2 to 29.3 mg/l, with an average removal efficiency of 43.7%,
    within the range of previous findings [62], [63]. In a previous study, Ruan, W.
    et al. [62] investigated and evaluated the purification capacity of 15 CWs that
    treated rural/urban domestic sewage and industrial park wastewater in China using
    several types of plants. It also assessed the growth, adaptation, and contribution
    of plants to the performance of these CWs, reporting a removal efficiency of 45.2%.
    Another study Shang, Z. et al. [63] focused on the use of a novel substrate media
    called Lanthanum-ammonia-modified hydrothermal biochar (La-A-HC) to enhance P
    removal and planted with Phragmites australis. As reported in Fig. 4, in this
    study, a removal efficiency of 47.8% was achieved. As for the effluents of NH3,
    five out of fifteen samples were above the Kuwait reuse standards, which ranged
    from 26.2 to 41.3 mg/l, whereas the remaining samples were below the Kuwait reuse
    standards, which ranged from 0.2 to 15.9 mg/l, with an average removal efficiency
    of 67.7% as previously reported [64], [65]. Another study by Zhang, Q. et al.
    [64] investigated the performance of TFCWs in removing ammonium through substrate
    optimization, specifically using gravel and a mixed filler of gravel and zeolite.
    This study achieved removal rates ranging from 61% to 89.7% without the use of
    plants. Another study Xu, J. et al. [65] explored the impact of root exudates
    from M. aquaticum and the effects on ammonium removal. This investigation used
    washed sand as the primary filter media and achieved removal rates between 69.3%
    and 90.4%. In addition, all of the TN effluents were below the Kuwait reuse standards,
    ranging from 16 to 62.6 mg/l, with an average removal efficiency of 46% as reported
    earlier [66], [67]. Xiong, C. et al. [66] examined the impact of a combination
    sequence of traditional hybrid constructed wetlands (HCWs) on N removal in raw
    sewage wastewater and achieved removal rates of approximately 50%. Another investigation
    Liu, Y. et al. [67] assessed the effectiveness of CWs in treating carbon-limiting
    wastewater and utilized pyrite and steel slag as substrates for N removal. This
    study reported N removal efficiencies in the range of 40–54%. Download : Download

    Fig. 7. Removal efficiency of TN in low HLR phase. The removal rates of nutrients
    were attributed to influent characteristics, CW design, operational conditions,
    substrate media, microbial activities, the availability of oxygen and carbon source,
    climates, and plant uptake. In our study, the main reasons for the nutrients removal
    rates could be attributed to the HRT, oxygen transfer into the system for nitrification
    process, the availability of carbon source for denitrification process, climate,
    microbial activities, and plants uptake. Heavy metals in wastewater, even at low
    concentrations, could harm receiving water bodies, the surrounding environment,
    and public health [68], [69]. CWs can also remove heavy metals through different
    kinds of media and macrophytes [70], [71]. The results demonstrate an increase
    in the heavy metals removal efficiency during the low HLR phase (13.6–93.4, 80.2–97.8,
    −1 to 99.5, 51.2–92.6, 62–97.2, and −118.1 to 90.9% for Al, Cr, Hg, Fe, Cu, and
    Zn, respectively). In addition, the average removal efficiencies for Al, Cr, Hg,
    Fe, Cu, and Zn were above 70%, conforming to previous findings [72], [73], [74].
    Kumar, S. et al. [72] investigated the effectiveness of different macrophytes
    in adsorbing heavy metals from domestic wastewater. They used various substrate
    media such as crushed stone, sand, and soil and achieved removal efficiencies
    ranging from 75.9% to 92.1%. Another research Nguyen, T. et al. [73] evaluated
    the feasibility of using clamshells as a substrate media in CWs planted with cattails
    for removing heavy metals from acid mine drainage. In this study, removal efficiencies
    ranged from 83.8% to 99.7%. Furthermore, Faisal, A. et al. [74] focused on the
    effectiveness of VFCWs planted with Typha domingensis and Canna indica. They used
    sewage sludge as the primary substrate media to remove heavy metals from wastewater
    containing cadmium ions, achieving removal rates exceeding 82%. Except for B and
    Hg, some of the effluent samples were above the Kuwait reuse standards, and their
    average removal efficiencies were − 5.8% and 82.9%, respectively. However, all
    heavy metals were either influents or effluents within Kuwait reuse standards.
    As a result, there was an improvement in the removal efficiencies of heavy metals
    in this phase compared to the start-up period. The high removal rates were attributed
    to sedimentation, filtration, precipitation, adsorption, plant rhizofiltration
    uptake, microbial reactions, and types of substrate media. In our study, it can
    be concluded that the main reasons for high values could be attributed to the
    plants uptake and substrate media, whereas the negative removal due to leaching
    and resuspension yielded. As evident from the results of the system under low
    HLR of 1.04 m3/m2, the system’s effluents met KEPA standards for all of the listed
    parameters (Table 1), except BOD and Hg, which failed to meet the standards. The
    average removal efficiency of the majority of the organic elements was 48.5%.
    However, the effluents'' Hg concentrations were slightly high, although the average
    removal efficiency was 82.9%. The SRP laboratory''s disposal of industrial wastewater
    into its septic tank is the only reason or source of the Hg [75], [76]. High hydraulic
    loading rate phase The concentration of organics (BOD and COD) and the efficiency
    variation of the wetland system with time are shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9. The average
    efficiencies achieved were 59.1% and 59.1% for BOD and COD, respectively. These
    efficiencies were found within the range of previous results [49], [50], [51].
    Although these efficiencies appear higher than those attained during the low HLR
    phase, the effluents'' quality was significantly better for both BOD and COD.
    For example, the average effluent concentrations for the low HLR were 52.4 and
    85.8 mg/l for BOD and COD, respectively. During the high loading rate, the effluent
    concentrations were 33.1 and 53.8 mg/l for BOD and COD, respectively. During the
    high loading rate stage, the COD was below thresholds, and the BOD was slightly
    above the thresholds (Table 1). Download : Download high-res image (123KB) Download

    Fig. 9. Removal efficiency for COD in high HLR phase. The concentrations of TPO4,
    NH3, and TN and the efficiency variation of the wetland system with time are shown
    in Fig. 10, Fig. 11, Fig. 12. The effluents of TPO4 were below the Kuwait reuse
    standards, which ranged from 1.9 to 22.5 mg/l, with an average removal efficiency
    of 24.7%. This low removal was previously reported [77], [78]. On average, the
    removal efficiency was higher at a high hydraulic loading rate compared to a low
    hydraulic loading rate. Nevertheless, in certain cases, better performance was
    observed at the low hydraulic loading rate, attributed to the use of actual wastewater
    with varying characteristics depending on the various staff activities at the
    SRP and the treatment efficiency of the wetland system i.e. type of contaminants,
    microbial interactions, climatic factors, etc. [79], [80]. Wu, H. et al. [77]
    evaluated the feasibility and effectiveness of achieving simultaneous efficient
    removal of N and P in CWs planted with Iris pseudacorus and using gravel as the
    primary substrate media. This research reported removal rates ranging from 10%
    to 20% for P. In addition, Krzeminska, D. et al. [78] examined the sediment and
    P removal efficiency in CW over the long term and through seasonal variations,
    particularly in treating agricultural runoff. In this case, the study achieved
    a removal efficiency of 22% for P. As for the effluents of NH3, two out of thirteen
    samples were above the Kuwait reuse standards (19.8 and 30.9 mg/l), whereas the
    remaining samples were below the Kuwait reuse standards, which ranged from 0.3
    to 10.6 mg/l, with an average removal efficiency of 76.6% similar to previous
    results [81], [82]. In a previous study Liu, C. et al. [81] evaluated the application
    of shale ceramsite overlaid onto active alumina to function as a double-layer
    substrate in unplanted TFCW for decentralized domestic sewage treatment, specifically
    focusing on N removal. This investigation achieved ammonium removal rates in the
    range of 72–80%. Another research Luo, P. et al. [82] investigated ammonium removal
    in swine wastewater with varying strengths in CWs planted with Myriophyllum aquaticum.
    The substrate used in this study was local paddy soil containing sand, silt, and
    clay. Ammonium removal efficiencies in this research ranged from 40% to 90%. In
    addition, all of the TN effluents were below the Kuwait reuse standards, which
    ranged from 3 to 39.7 mg/l, with an average removal efficiency of 55% within the
    range of values reported earlier [83], [84]. Additionally, Wang, H. et al. [83]
    investigated the removal of N and Pb using a novel material, peanut shell biochar,
    as a substrate in CWs. This research focused on the combination of organic and
    inorganic electron donors to drive denitrification for treating wastewater containing
    both N and Pb. The study reported N removal efficiency of 52.5%. Another investigation
    Zheng, X. et al. [84] explored the enhanced removal mechanism of iron-carbon CWs
    planted with Phragmites communis and Iris tectorum for N removal. They used coarse
    sand, gravel, and iron-carbon as substrate media and achieved N removal efficiency
    of 58.3%. Download : Download high-res image (128KB) Download : Download full-size

    The results demonstrate an increase in the heavy metals removal efficiency during
    the high HLR phase (−167.2 to 97.2, 53.7–97.1, 45.6–99.9, −49.7 to 97.7, −386.5
    to 95.8, and −43.4 to 88.6% for Al, Cr, Hg, Fe, Cu, and Zn, respectively). In
    addition, the average removal efficiencies for Cd, Cr, Hg, and Fe were above 70%,
    and similar values have been reported [68], [85], [86]. Different types of substrates
    in recirculating standing hybrid constructed wetlands (RSHCWs) planted with Canna
    indica were investigated by Zhang, X. et al. [68]. They used substrates such as
    gravel, bio-ceramic, or lava rock and exposed them to varying heavy metal inflow
    loads to assess their potential and the underlying mechanisms for removing heavy
    metals from simulated mixed wastewater. The removal efficiencies reported were
    greater than 85%. Another research Chang, J. et al. [85] examined the efficiency
    of Hg removal in continuously running biochar-packed CWs planted with Lythrum
    salicaria compared to traditional gravel substrates. In this study, the removal
    efficiencies reported were greater than 97%. Furthermore, another investigation
    Yang, Z. et al. [86] aimed to create a suitable environment for multiple-phase
    interactions with soluble metals. In this study, removal efficiencies for heavy
    metals ranged from 83% to 100%. Except for B and Hg, some of the effluent samples
    were above the Kuwait reuse standards, and their average removal efficiencies
    were − 33.6% and 80.3%, respectively. However, all heavy metals were either influents
    or effluents within Kuwait reuse standards. To sum up, the results of the system
    under high HLR (1.67 m3/m2.d) indicated that the system effluents met KEPA standards
    for all of the listed parameters (Table 1), except BOD and Hg, which failed to
    meet the standards due to the same reasons in low HLR phase, with average removal
    efficiencies of 59.1% and 80.3%, respectively. The BOD removal efficiency increased
    in this phase compared to the previous phase, whereas Hg removal efficiency remained
    above 80%. Effect of wastewater characteristics on the VFCW performance During
    the start-up, low HLR, and high HLR phases (one-year period in total), the load
    and characteristics fluctuated in addition to the climate. All of these factors
    have a crucial role in the VFCW system. Although it is impossible to infer these
    effects during the whole year due to changes in loading, the variation can be
    seen in Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, Fig. 8, Fig. 9, Fig. 10, Fig.
    11, Fig. 12 and Table 1 for every phase. However, a Pearson correlation [87] was
    conducted to detect the effects of the wastewater characteristics and ambient
    temperature on the removal efficiency during start-up, low HLR, and high HLR phases,
    separately. The average temperatures for the three phases were 18.0, 35.5, and
    27.2 °C, respectively. The results of Pearson''s correlation for the start-up
    phase indicated that during start-up, the removal efficiency was dependent on
    almost all parameters (r = 0.59, 0.80, 0.74, 0.63, 0.53, and >0.50 for ambient
    temperature, BOD, COD, TP, TN, and metals, respectively). For the low HLR phase,
    dependency was limited to BOD and COD (r = 0.64 and 0.63, respectively). The high
    HLR was similar to the low HLR but with some dependency on metals and a weaker
    dependency on ambient temperature (r = 0.43). Since the climate and temperatures
    affect plant functioning, these findings suggest that ambient temperature is not
    the main factor to explain removal efficiency variation and that there is no explicit
    dependency on ambient temperature. The findings suggest that temperature changes
    explain some variations during the start-up and high HLR. In contrast, temperature
    is not responsible for the variation in removal efficiency during low HLR. In
    summary, organic and metal loads have the most significant effect on the operation
    of the VFCW system [88]. The complicated nature of the wetlands removal processes
    (such as filtration, biodegradation, plant and uptake, among others) may have
    dampened the effect of seasonal variation in this research [89]. Conclusion This
    study has successfully constructed a pilot scale VFCW systems using indigenous
    plants to treat office wastewater efficiently under the harsh climate conditions
    of Kuwait. The VFCW system was operated under various operating conditions, and
    the results showed that removal efficiency was better operating under high HLR
    (1.67 m3/m2.d) than the low HLR (1.04 m3/m2.d). Evidently, at low HLR, the amount
    of nutrients and organics is low, thereby reducing the activity of the biota in
    removing wastewater contaminants, which leads to the conclusion that wetland systems
    can be operated at higher loading rates. This \"design conclusion\" is essential
    for the future implementation of the wetland system on a full scale. The specific
    conclusions of this study are as follows: • The average removal efficiencies in
    the high HLR phase were higher than those in the lower phase. • For OM (expressed
    as BOD and COD), the average removal efficiencies for BOD and COD were 48.5% and
    49%, respectively, in the low hydraulic loading rate phase. In contrast, the average
    removal efficiencies for BOD and COD were 59.1% and 59.1%, respectively, in the
    high hydraulic loading rate phase. • The average removal efficiencies for nutrients
    (expressed as TPO4, NH3, and TN) were 43.7%, 67.7%, and 46.1%, respectively, in
    the low hydraulic loading rate phase, and were 24.7%, 76.6%, and 55%, respectively,
    in the high hydraulic loading rate phase. Interestingly, the removal efficiency
    for N was good with respect to a single unit treatment (CW); however, there was
    marginal P removal as this CW system was not designed to treat P. • For heavy
    metals, the average removal efficiencies for Al, Cr, Hg, Fe, Cu, and Zn were above
    70% in the low hydraulic loading rate phase, whereas the average removal efficiencies
    for Cd, Cr, Hg, and Fe were above 70% in the high hydraulic loading rate phase.
    However, some of the analyzed parameters'' concentrations in the effluents were
    greater than those in the influents (indicating leaching), yet they all remained
    within KEPA standards. • Ambient temperature affected the removal during the start-up
    and HHL phases, indicating seasonality. However, these effects are strongly linked
    to the content of organics, nutrients and metals. Declaration of Competing Interest

  description: This study underscores the critical importance of assessing the performance
    of the Upper Ganga Canal (UGC) and its minors, Harchandpur and Naserpur. The UGC
    serves as a lifeline, providing water for both agricultural and non-agricultural
    purposes in the region, making it vital for food security, rural economies, and
    environmental sustainability. The uniqueness of this study lies in its comprehensive
    evaluation of the efficiency of UGC using a multifaceted approach, encompassing
    meteorological data, field observations and remote sensing. The monetary aspects
    of the irrigation system performance, which were often ignored in previous studies,
    have also been included in this study. The study, conducted from 2012 to 2018,
    assesses various performance indicators. The findings reveal that the capacity
    of UGC to meet peak irrigation requirements highlights the potential for increased
    crop production. However, it also demonstrates a concerning decreasing trend in
    the availability of water, driven by rising non-agricultural water demands. Several
    performance indicators, such as relative irrigation supply (RIS), relative water
    supply (RWS), depleted fraction (DF), and crop water deficit (CWD), expose inefficiencies
    in the system, especially during the sugarcane growth period. Despite supplying
    ample water, sugarcane exhibits a water deficit, possibly due to the annual maintenance
    closure of the UGC. This calls for a revision of irrigation scheduling to address
    changing agricultural practices. Future research can expand this work to include
    climate change impact assessment, economic analyses, advanced technologies, and
    socio-economic factors. In summary, this study provides critical insights into
    the performance of UGC, highlighting the need for modernization and equitable
    water distribution to meet evolving agricultural demands while addressing the
    challenges of decreasing water availability and the changing climate.

    The UGC serves as a lifeline, providing water for both agricultural and non-agricultural

    assesses various performance indicators. The findings reveal that the capacity
    of UGC to meet peak irrigation requirements highlights the potential for increased

  description: Sedimentation determines how optimal a reservoir functions throughout
    its design life. The Sempor Reservoir in Central Java, Indonesia, will be 45 years
    old in 2023. At least 15 million m3 of particles have been sedimented in the reservoir
    for >30 years, reducing its function as an irrigation water source to only 60%.
    Therefore, assessing its performance in providing irrigation water and generating
    hydropower electricity is essential, given that its design life ends in 2028.
    This study was conducted to analyse the sedimentation and estimate the useful
    life of the Sempor Reservoir based on the erosion potential in its catchment area.
    The potential sedimentation rate was formulated from erosion potential assessed
    using the universal soil loss equation (USLE) model, sediment delivery ratio (SDR)
    and trap efficiency (TE). By contrast, the actual sedimentation rate was determined
    from changes in the dead storage capacity from 2013 to 2023. The interpolation
    performance evaluation of the bathymetric survey results was tested using the
    coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), and mean absolute
    percentage error (MAPE) which resulted in values of 0.917; 0.87; and 13.03%, respectively.
    The results show that the catchment area had an erosion potential of 3,405,353.86
    t·a-1, resulting in a potential sedimentation rate of 309,106.63 m3·a-1. The calculated
    actual sedimentation rate was 33,903.28 m3·a-1. Therefore, the useful life of
    the Sempor Reservoir was estimated to end in 0.5 years and 4.59 years based on
    the potential and actual sedimentation rates, respectively.

    This article investigates the performance of the doubly fed induction motor (DFIM)
    in smart irrigation systems, where the motor’s ability to control water flow by
    adjusting its speed is explored. The study demonstrates that DFIM can be treated
    as a variable-speed synchronous motor with similar torque-speed characteristics.
    A mathematical model is developed to optimize its performance in smart irrigation
    systems, considering specific application conditions. The experimental setup results
    show a good correlation with the theoretical findings, indicating the potential
    of using DFIM in smart irrigation systems to enhance their efficiency and control
    while lowering costs. The results also investigate the influence of stator and
    rotor voltage and current variations on the motor’s characteristics and power
    factor, highlighting the DFIM’s ability to change its power factor by adjusting
    the rotor current and thus improve its performance as a synchronous motor. Keywords:

    state performancepower factor 1. Introduction The doubly fed induction motor (DFIM)
    is a promising solution for variable speed drives due to its lower capacity frequency
    converter in the rotor, which results in significant cost savings compared to
    systems that use a full power converter [ 1–3]. DFIM is a wound rotor induction
    motor with a rotor that is supplied from a variable frequency converter. DFIM
    is widely used as a generator for wind energy conversion systems due to the constant
    frequency of the generated voltage, which is maintained even with varying rotor
    speeds. Additionally, the rotor speed can be controlled to obtain maximum power
    from the wind turbine. DFIM also has various applications in electric and hybrid
    electric vehicles [ 1, 2], marine propulsion [ 3, 4], pumping systems [ 5, 6],
    and traction [ 7]. The steady-state performance of DFIM has been the subject of
    investigation in several studies, including [ 7–9]. The DFIM''s speed variation
    is typically achieved by altering the injected rotor voltage. These studies have
    demonstrated that the DFIM''s torque-speed characteristics are like those of the
    induction motor. Additionally, a theoretical study of the steady-state operation
    of DFIM has been conducted, as reported in Ref. [ 10]. The stator in this study
    is excited at the supply frequency, while the rotor is supplied with a voltage
    of a frequency that differs from the slip frequency. However, this approach leads
    to unstable machine operation and higher torque pulsations, as reported in the
    study. Different control strategies have been proposed recently to achieve speed
    control of DFIM. One such strategy is the field-oriented control of DFIM without
    a rotor position sensor, as presented in Refs. [ 11–13]. In this method, a single
    frequency converter is used in the rotor side while the stator side is connected
    directly to the grid. Another study, as discussed in Ref. [ 14], presents a sensor-less
    field-oriented control of DFIM using two converters, one in the stator side and
    the other in the rotor side. However, this method increases the system cost and
    complexity. The direct torque control of DFIM has been investigated in Refs. [
    15–17], which use the space vector modulation technique to achieve direct and
    independent control of the motor torque and flux. A fuzzy logic controller has
    been employed in direct torque control as an alternative to the PI controller
    in order to eliminate the torque and flux ripples, as suggested in Ref. [ 18].
    In addition, sliding mode control has been proposed as a novel control strategy
    for DFIM speed control in Ref. [ 19]. This adaptive control scheme achieves robust
    motor drive performance despite the variation in parameters. All recent studies
    indicate that the performance of DFIM is similar to that of conventional induction
    motors. This article provides the following key contributions: Investigating the
    performance characteristics of DFIM under speed and load variation. Developing
    and implementing a mathematical model for DFIM in smart irrigation systems to
    predict its performance under different operating conditions. Building and testing
    an experimental setup to validate the theoretical results and demonstrate the
    correlation between the theoretical and experimental results. 2. System Description
    and Principle of Operation A schematic diagram of the DFIM drive system is presented
    in Figure 1. The stator three-phase terminals are directly supplied from the main
    power source, while the rotor windings are connected to the grid through a variable
    frequency converter. To reduce the output voltage from the converter and make
    it suitable for the rotor windings, a three-phase transformer is employed after
    the converter. FIGURE 1. A schematic diagram of DFIM drive system. Display full
    size In DFIM, the stator windings are excited by the three-phase ac currents from
    the grid, which establishes a rotating field in the stator. This rotating field
    is also created in the rotor windings as they are fed from the grid via the frequency
    converter. The interaction between the two rotating fields results in motor rotation,
    and the speed and direction of both fields are the primary parameters that control
    motor speed. When both magnetic fields rotate in the same direction, the rotor
    rotates at a speed equal to the difference between the speeds of the two rotating
    fields, resulting in a motor speed less than the synchronous speed. Conversely,
    when both magnetic fields rotate in opposite directions, the rotor rotates with
    a speed equal to the sum of the speeds of the two magnetic fields, causing the
    motor speed to exceed the synchronous speed. This behavior can be described by
    Eq. (1) as in Ref. [ 20]: N r = N s 1 ± N s 2 = 60 ( F 1 ± F 2 ) P  (1) where
    Nr is the motor speed in (rpm), Ns1 is the rotating magnetic field speed in the
    stator in (rpm), and Ns2 is the rotating magnetic field speed in the rotor in
    (rpm). F1 represents the frequency of the AC currents fed into the stator windings,
    while F2 represents the frequency of the AC currents fed into the rotor windings,
    and P is the number of pair poles of DFIM [ 3]. 3. Methodology In this section,
    the mathematical model and the experimental setup of DFIM are presented, as elaborated
    in the following subsections. 3.1. Theoretical Analysis The steady-state mathematical
    model of DFIM is established based on the fundamental principles of induction
    motor, as described in Ref. [ 20]. Figure 2 illustrates the per-phase equivalent
    circuit of the wound rotor induction motor when the rotor windings are energized
    from the supply. FIGURE 2. Equivalent circuit per phase of DFIM. Display full
    size The voltage equations can be written as [ 20]: V 1 = I 1  ( R 1 + j X 1 )
    + E 1  (2) V 2 = I 2  ( R 2 + j X 2 ) + E 2 (3) where V1 is the stator input voltage
    per phase, V2 is the rotor injected voltage per phase, E1 is the induced EMF at
    the stator windings per phase and E2 is the induced EMF at the rotor windings
    per phase. I1 is the stator phase current and I2 is the rotor phase current. R1
    is the stator phase resistance, R2 is the rotor phase resistance, X1 is the stator
    phase leakage reactance, and X2 is the rotor phase leakage reactance. The input
    power to the stator (P1) and the input power to the rotor (P2) can be determined
    as following: P 1 = 3 V I 1  cos φ 1  (4) P 2 = 3 V I 2  cos φ 2  (5) where cosφ1
    is the power factor at the stator side and cosφ2 is the power factor at the rotor
    side. By neglecting the iron loss, the total losses can be calculated as: P loss
    = P c 1 + P c 2 (6) P c 1 = 3 I 1 2  R 1 (7) P c 2 = 3 I 1 2  R 2 (8) where PC1
    is the stator copper loss and PC2 is the rotor copper loss. Accordingly, the DFIM
    mechanical power (Pm) and developed torque (T) become: P m = P 1 + P 2 − P loss
    (9) T = P m / ω (10) where ω is the motor speed in (rad/s). 3.2. Experimental
    Setup A laboratory experimental prototype of the DFIM drive system has been constructed
    to verify the theoretical analysis presented in the above subsection. As shown
    in Figure 3, the setup consists primarily of a DFIM motor rated at (0.3 kW, 230/400 V,
    2.2 A, 1395 rpm), a DC generator acting as a mechanical load, a three-phase transformer
    linked to the rotor side, and a variable frequency converter for controlling the
    motor’s speed. Two three-phase autotransformers are also included in the setup.
    One is used to regulate the strength of the stator voltage between the grid side
    and the stator, while the other regulates the strength of the rotor voltage between
    the grid and the rotor. Table 1 lists and labels all of these components. FIGURE

    Theoretical Results The performance of DFIM is assessed under various conditions
    using the mathematical model in MATLAB Simulink. The study examines three steady-state
    scenarios: Constant stator voltage of 210 V with varying rotor frequencies (F2
    = 40, 20, and 30 Hz). The response of stator current to the variation of rotor
    current is illustrated in Figure 4 for the specified rotor frequencies. The results
    show that the behavior of DFIM is analogous to that of a synchronous motor, where
    the stator current increases with an increase in rotor frequency. The torque-speed
    characteristics of DFIM for various rotor frequencies are presented in Figure
    5. While the motor speed is constant during torque variation, it changes with
    the rotor frequency, resulting in the motor speed and rotor frequency being synchronized.
    As a result, DFIM produces a synchronous torque at steady state. The DFIM is tested
    under a constant rotor frequency of 15 Hz while varying the stator voltage to
    evaluate its performance. The stator current variation via rotor current for different
    stator voltage levels is illustrated in Figure 6. The (V-curves) of DFIM varies
    similar to synchronous motor (V-curves). Typically, the stator voltage raises
    leading to increasing in stator current. FIGURE 4. Stator current versus rotor

    The motor characteristics investigated at rotor voltage variation for constant
    rotor frequency and stator voltage. The values of rotor frequency and stator voltage
    are 15 Hz and 210, respectively. For different rotor voltage levels, the variation
    in stator current via rotor current adopts the behavior of (V-curves) as cleared
    in Figure 8. It is noticed that the rotor voltage and stator current are inversely
    related. Moreover, rotor voltage has no impact on the torque–speed curve, as evidenced
    in Figure 9. FIGURE 9. Torque–speed curve of DFIM at different rotor voltages

    results are investigated for four conditions as follows. The First condition is
    recorded at various rotor frequencies of 10, 15, and 20 Hz and a 210 V stator
    voltage. The variation in rotor current and stator current for rotor frequencies
    is displayed in Figure10. It is noticed that the rotor voltage remains constant
    with the rotor current change. However, according to the ratio (V2/F2 = constant),
    rotor voltage change is proportional to the rotor frequency. Furthermore, the
    motor speed is fixed at load torque and changes with the rotor frequency as shown
    in Figure 11. This demonstrates that the DFIM has similar torque-speed characteristics
    of synchronous motor. The variation in stator current with rotor current, at various
    rotor frequencies, is recorded as illustrated in Figure 12. FIGURE 11. Torque–speed
    curves of DFIM at different rotor frequencies and (V1 = 210 V). Display full size
    FIGURE 12. Stator current with rotor current at different rotor frequencies and
    (V1 = 210 V). Display full size The Second condition is examined the stator voltage
    variation on the motor characteristics. This condition is recorded for a specific
    rotor frequency of 15 Hz and different values of stator voltage. Additionally,
    the motor speed is constant at 1050 rpm, which corresponds to the rotor frequency
    (F2 = 15 Hz) and is unaffected by variations in the stator voltage or load torque,
    as is evident, in Figure 13. In other words, at various values of stator voltage,
    the stator current varies with the rotor current in the form of (V-curves), as
    shown by Figure 14. Whenever the rotor current is low, the stator current is observed
    to decrease by reducing the stator voltage, however as the rotor current increases.
    The stator current curves are converging. FIGURE 13. Torque–speed curve of DFIM

    the influence of rotor voltage variation on the motor characteristics at a fixed
    stator voltage and rotor frequency (V1 = 210 V), (F2 = 15 Hz). Despite of the
    variation in torque and rotor voltage, motor speed is still constant equals (1050 rpm)
    which correlates directly to rotor frequency (F2 = 15 Hz), as displayed in Figure
    15. FIGURE 15. Torque–speed curve of DFIM at different values of rotor voltage
    and at (V1 = 210 V, F2 = 15 Hz). Display full size According to Figure 16, the
    stator current increases with the rotor current throughout the rotor voltage changes.
    The stator current is seen to increase throughout a wide variety range for rotor
    current when rotor voltage is decreased. FIGURE 16. Stator current versus rotor
    current considering different rotor voltage and at (V1 = 210 V, F2 =1 5 Hz). Display
    full size Finally, the impact of modifying the rotor current on DFIM’s power factor
    are discussed. For various levels of rotor current, the stator current and voltage
    with rotor current equals 0.8 A are recorded at (F2 = 15 Hz and V1 = 180 V). Figure
    17 illustrates the output waveforms for stator phase voltage and current with
    rotor current equals 0.8 A. Stator current appears to be lag the phase voltage.
    FIGURE 17. Waveforms of stator phase voltage and current of DFIM at (I2 = 0.8
    A). Display full size By raising the rotor current to 1.5 A, the current and voltage
    are in phase and the power factor is nearly unity, as demonstrated by Figure 18.
    Continually raising in rotor current until a certain value of 2.8 A, achieves
    a leading power factor as evident by Figure 19. According to the previous figures,
    the voltage multiplied by a factor of 10, and the current is divided by a factor
    of 50. The DFIM''s ability to change its power factor by adjusting the rotor current
    improves its performance as a synchronous motor. FIGURE 18. Waveforms of stator
    phase voltage and current of DFIM at (I2 = 1.5 A). Display full size FIGURE 19.

    full size 5. Conclusion The performance evaluation of DFIM has been presented
    in this article based on both theoretical and experimental studies. The steady-state
    behavior of DFIM has been investigated for different operating conditions. The
    experimental results have shown that the motor speed is constant at 1395 rpm,
    and the stator voltage has no impact on the motor speed. The impact of rotor frequency
    on the stator current has also been investigated, and it has been found that an
    increase in rotor frequency leads to an increase in stator current. Moreover,
    the motor speed is fixed during torque variation, and it changes with the rotor
    frequency. The experimental results have shown a respectable degree of agreement
    with the theoretical predictions, which validates the mathematical approach. These
    findings highlight the potential use of DFIM in smart irrigation systems, which
    can lead to improved performance and efficiency, better control, and lower costs.

  description: 'This work assessed the performance of the Akumadan and Kaniago irrigation
    schemes in the transition agro-ecological zone of Ghana using a set of comparative
    performance indicators. The performance of the schemes spanning the years 2018
    – 2022 was evaluated using selected comparative indicators categorized into five
    (5) groups, namely: water delivery, physical structures, financial, environmental
    condition and agricultural production performance. The challenges of the schemes
    were also identified through the study. It was revealed that the main pipe at
    Akumadan had 100% maximum flow length whiles the canal system at Kaniago recorded
    a flow length of 64% due to low gravity-flow in the downstream of the canal. The
    developed irrigable areas in Akumadan and Kaniago were under-utilised with irrigation
    rates ranging from 15% – 36% and 18% – 57% respectively. The sustainability indices
    of the irrigated areas in Akumadan and Kaniago were low with recorded values of
    31% and 28% respectively. Irrigation service charges recovery was poor in the
    Kaniago scheme with recovery efficiency ranging from 25% – 59% whereas that of
    the Akumadan scheme was good with efficiency ranging from 80% – 88%. A low degree
    of financial autonomy (25%) was recorded in Akumadan whereas a high degree of
    financial autonomy (100%) was recorded in Kaniago. Some irrigation structures
    in the Akumadan and Kaniago schemes were in poor working condition having recorded
    poor structure indices of 27% and 14% respectively. The road network in the Akumadan
    scheme was in good working condition as roads pass ability efficiency of 100%
    was achieved whereas Kaniago had no major road construction in the scheme. The
    schemes recorded statistically significant p-values of 0.0036, 0.00641 and 0.010697
    for soil salinity, sodicity and pH measurements in the irrigable areas respectively.
    Production in the schemes was gradually declining due to the constant reduction
    in size of the cultivable area of the schemes. Poor agronomic practices, inadequate
    surface materials and low gravity-flow were major causes of the low production
    performance in the schemes.'

  description: The performance of Hormat Golina-7 drip irrigation in Kobo-Girana valley
    of Ethiopia has been extensively developed into modern drip irrigation system
    employing groundwater resources. The emitter discharge and soil moisture content
    were collected from the field and relevant hydro-meteorological data were collected
    from Sirinka Agricultural Research. The emitter flow was measured by using a direct
    graduated container in the study area. Engineering, field water use, crop and
    water productivity, and socio-economic and agricultural performance indicators
    were considered the performance evaluation indicators. For each indicator, application
    efficiency (Ea), equity water delivery performance (PE), reference evapotranspiration
    (ETO), delivery performance ratio (DPR), and distribution uniformity characteristics
    such as emission uniformity (EU), emitter flow rate variation (qvar), coefficient
    of variation (Cv), and coefficient of uniformity (Uc) were assessed. Based on
    the results, Ea (62.85%), PE (0.21), DPR (1.56%), EU (49.28%), Pvar (73.92%),
    CV (43.80%), and UC (56.20%) were assessed. During the field research, it was
    observed that there is emitter clogging, lack of irrigation infrastructure and
    training, and inaccurate lateral collection after irrigation. Considering all
    the facts and parameters studies including field assessment, it has been evaluated
    that Hormat Golina-7 drip irrigation system is a poor-performing scheme.

    The performance of Hormat Golina-7 drip irrigation in Kobo-Girana valley of Ethiopia
    has been extensively developed into modern drip irrigation system employing groundwater
    resources. The emitter discharge and soil moisture content were collected from
    the field and relevant hydro-meteorological data were collected from Sirinka Agricultural
    Research. The emitter flow was measured by using a direct graduated container
    in the study area. Engineering, field water use, crop and water productivity,
    and socio-economic and agricultural performance indicators were considered the
    performance evaluation indicators. For each indicator, application efficiency
    (Ea), equity water delivery performance (PE), reference evapotranspiration (ETO),
    delivery performance ratio (DPR), and distribution uniformity characteristics
    such as emission uniformity (EU), emitter flow rate variation (qvar), coefficient
    of variation (Cv), and coefficient of uniformity (Uc) were assessed. Based on
    the results, Ea (62.85%), PE (0.21), DPR (1.56%), EU (49.28%), Pvar (73.92%),
    CV (43.80%), and UC (56.20%) were assessed. During the field research, it was
    observed that there is emitter clogging, lack of irrigation infrastructure and
    training, and inaccurate lateral collection after irrigation. Considering all
    the facts and parameters studies including field assessment, it has been evaluated
    that Hormat Golina-7 drip irrigation system is a poor-performing scheme. Similar

    Article 12 October 2021 Introduction Irrigation has been the main driver of increasing
    food production worldwide, and irrigated land produces 40% of the total grain
    output from only 20% of global arable land, while 80% of land under rain-fed agriculture
    produces about 60% of grain output [1]. Irrigation plays a pivotal role in agricultural
    production like stabilizing the harvest fluctuations and improving the average
    yields throughout the growing season, and in some cases, improves the control
    circumstantially over available water resources at global level [2]. Ethiopia’s
    water and land resources have enormous potential, and it has a high-water resource
    potential, accounting for 122 billion cubic meters of annual surface runoff and
    2.9 billion cubic meters of groundwater, despite uneven geographical and temporal
    patterns [3]. Ethiopia, on the other hand, is only employing a small portion of
    its incredible water resource potential for irrigated agriculture (EATA 2016).
    Ethiopia has tremendous irrigation potential, even though there is no consistent
    information from various sources [4]. It is renowned as Africa’s water tower because
    of its rich water resources, which include more than ten river basins and 22 natural
    and artificial lakes (ADF 2005). Irrigation development is vital to the sustainable
    and reliable agricultural developments in Ethiopia. Subsistence-dominated smallholder
    farmers’ economy can be improved through the use of irrigation in agriculture
    (MoWIE 2013). Correspondingly, the use of irrigation agriculture is going to be
    a means for improved agricultural production to meet the growing food demands
    of rapid population growth [5]. Irrigation development in Ethiopia can be considered
    a basis of food security and poverty reduction tool as it has a power to inspire
    economic growth and rural developments [6, 7]. The current irrigation development
    in Ethiopia is about 0.7 million hectares [8], Mekonnene et al. 2022). Improving
    irrigation system performance through various interventions is found as a critical
    issue in addressing the requirement for higher irrigated land productivity [9,
    10]. Many irrigation schemes, especially in developing countries, perform poorly.
    Irrigation water has been used unproductively in some irrigation schemes, and
    also irrigation service to farmers has been very poor. Inadequate institutional
    settings and non-flexibility of scheme hardware were the primary causes of poor
    performance [11]. Kobo-Girana valley Development Program is one of the Ethiopia’s
    largest irrigation projects, combining surface and pressurized irrigation systems
    with groundwater as a source of water. It is critical to operate and irrigate
    the field crop according to the design criteria to boost crop yield and solve
    water management issues for the system’s long-term viability. Evaluating the project’s
    performance in a judicious manner is required to ensure the effective functioning
    of each ancillary structure. Therefore, agricultural water productivity is reduced,
    the land is lost, net return income is reduced, and irrigation output is not optimized.
    This study was carried out to assess the performance of the drip irrigation system
    at the field level in the Kobo-Girana Valley. The goal of this research is to
    assess the overall performance of drip irrigation systems in the Kobo-Girana valley
    at the field level, as well as to introduce the productivity of pressurized irrigation
    systems. Materials and Methods Description of the Study Area The Kobo-Girana Valley
    is located in the Amhara National Regional State’s North Wello Zone of Ethiopia.
    The project Hormat Golina (HG-7) is located at latitude 12° 07′ 40.5″ N and longitude
    39° 37′ 56.92″ E, with an elevation of 1467 to 1482 m above mean sea level. The
    region’s average annual temperature and precipitation are 22.0 °C and 815 mm,
    respectively (Fig. 1). Fig. 1 Location map of the Hormat Golina-7 scheme Full
    size image Hormat Golina Seven (HG-7) is part of a drip irrigation system located
    2.5 km south of Kobo Town. The total irrigable land in the HG-7 irrigation systems
    though adequate but only limited area is irrigated with countable farmers getting
    benefit out of it due to poor management and ignorance. Data Collection Relevant
    data from March to June 2021 of the study area were collected from various sources.
    To achieve this research goal, important data were collected from the field and
    various water-related institutions. Primary Data The primary data were collected
    in the field by monitoring various hydraulic parameters in different plot areas
    and reaches in the scheme (Fig. 2). The sample land was used for measuring the
    discharge and had a sizeable area. The emitter discharge was measured at the inlet,
    middle, and outlet of the drip lines, in the same manner soil sample was collected
    at different soil layers. Fig. 2 Primary data collection: a land preparation and
    lateral line lay for drip irrigation and b flow measurement at lateral inlet and
    at emitter with graduated container Full size image Secondary Data Meteorological
    data such as relative humidity, temperature, rainfall, wind speed, pan evaporation,
    and hydrological data were collected from Sirinka Agriculture Research Center.
    The Kobo Girana Valley Development Program Office helped in procuring the relevant
    information. Filter For this study locally available plastic screen filters were
    used to remove very fine or large debris inlet of the drip lines. These screen
    filters are simple and economical filtration devices of various shapes and sizes,
    most frequently used for the removal of physical contaminants. Pressure at Which
    the Flow Rate of Droplet Discharges The time it took to gather the required amount
    of water in a cash cane was measured together with the discharge rates at various
    operating pressures. The discharges were computed as follows: \\(Q=(V/t)\\), where
    water volume collected in cash cane, dripper discharge (lph), and time taken to
    gather volume (V) of water (h). A pressure gauge that was connected to the inflow
    lateral of the dripper was used to measure the input pressure. The pressure-discharge
    observational data were used to create the mathematical and pictorial relationship.
    The following formula was used to express the dripper flow rate as a function
    of pressure: \\(Q=K{P}^{x}\\), where Q is the dripper’s discharge in lph, P is
    the operating pressure in kg cm−2, K is the dripper’s proportionality coefficient,
    which depends on the size and shape of the nozzle, and X is the emitter’s discharge
    exponent, which describes the flow regime. Excel was used to exhibit the observed
    data for Q and P. Performance Evaluation and Indicators of Irrigation Engineering
    Indicators The current performance level of an irrigation scheme was evaluated
    using performance indicators [12]. A single indicator is not enough to show the
    performance level of the scheme,consequently, engineering, field water use, crop
    and water productivity, and socio-economic and agricultural performance indicators
    were considered so as to get an overall picture of the irrigation project [13].
    Delivery Performance Ratio (DPR) Delivery performance ratio (DPR) was calculated
    using Eq. (1) to determine the field performance of the schemes and it is the
    most operational performance indicator (Shahrokhnia et al. 2019). $$\\mathrm{DPR}=\\frac{\\mathrm{Qdes}}{\\mathrm{Qact}}*100$$
    (1) where Qact is the actual measured discharge in each emitter and Qdes is the
    intended design discharge. Reference Evapotranspiration (ETo) CROPWAT software
    gives reference evapotranspiration by using climate data as an input. Climatic
    data was collected from different meteorological stations around the study area.
    Using climate data reference evapotranspiration (ETo) was calculated by using
    Penman–Monteith (Eq. (2)). $$\\mathrm{ETo}=\\frac{0.408\\Delta \\left(Rn+G\\right)+r*\\frac{900}{T+273}u2(es-ea)}{\\Delta
    +r(1+0.34u2)}$$ (2) where ETo = reference evapotranspiration (mm day − 1); Δ = slope
    vapor pressure curve (kPa oc − 1), Rn = Net radiation at the crop surface (MJ
    m − 2 day − 1), G = soil heat flux density (MJ m − 2 day − 1), T = mean daily
    air temperature at 2 m height, r = psychrometric constant (kPa oc − 1), u2 = wind
    speed at 2 m height (ms − 1), es = saturation vapor pressure (kPa), ea = actual
    vapor pressure (kPa), (es-ea) = saturated vapor pressure deficit, emitter was
    measured repeatedly, and the average discharge passing through the lateral pipe
    was taken and multiplied by the time of whole irrigation season to get the volume.
    Relative Water Supply (RWS) To calculate the volume of irrigation water delivered,
    the discharge measurements at the emitter were repeated, and the average discharge
    traveling through the lateral pipe was collected using Eq. (3). $$\\mathrm{RWS}=\\frac{\\mathrm{Total\\;
    water\\; supply}}{\\mathrm{Total\\; crop\\; water\\;demand}}$$ (3) where the total
    water supply is calculated at the emitter by pressurized drip irrigation and rainfall
    calculated in m3. Relative Irrigation Supply (RIS) RIS was calculated to determine
    the level of irrigation water stress or abundance of the irrigation demand (Eq.
    (4)) [14]. $$\\mathrm{RIS}=\\frac{\\mathrm{Irrigation\\; supply}}{\\mathrm{Irrigation\\;
    demand}}$$ (4) where irrigation supply is only pressurized for irrigation (m3)
    and irrigation demand is the crop ETo excluding rainfall (m3). Equity of Water
    Delivery Equitable water distribution is achieved when the ratio of water delivery
    to head outlets to the outlet at the tail outlets is equal to 1. Kharrou et al.
    [15] also described that equity of water delivery indicates the ability of a system
    to uniformly deliver water to the users, and it can be expressed by (Eq. 5) $$PE=\\frac{1}{T}\\sum_{T}CVR(\\frac{Qd}{Qr})$$
    (5) where PE = equity, T = time (week, month, season); for this study, week, R
    = region (plots, reaches, sections); for this study, plots, CVR = spatial coefficient
    of variation of the ratio of delivery water to required water (Qd/Qr) over the
    region R, Qd is the delivered discharge measured on the experiment plot, and Qr
    is the required discharge in the designed emitter. PE approaches to 0 if there
    is equitable water distribution in the system for the period; but as PE becomes
    greater than 0.25, the equitable distribution of water becomes low. Field Water
    Use Indicators Application Efficiency Water application efficiency was calculated
    for depth of water stored in the root zone by depth of water applied on the farm
    (Eq. 6). $$\\mathrm{Ea}=\\frac{\\mathrm{ Average\\; depth\\; of\\; water\\; stored\\;
    in\\; the\\; root\\; zone }}{\\mathrm{Average\\; depth \\;applied \\;to \\;the\\;
    farm}}$$ (6) where Ea is the application efficiency Distribution Efficiency (Uniformity)
    Distribution efficiency of a drip irrigation system is influenced by the distribution
    of water pressure in the pipe network as well as the hydraulic qualities of the
    emitters, and it can be expressed by (Eq. 7) [16] $$\\mathrm{DU}=\\frac{\\mathrm{Average\\;
    of \\;lowest\\; one\\; quarter\\; emitter\\; flow}}{\\mathrm{Average\\;of\\; all\\;
    emitter\\; flow}}$$ (7) Emitter Flow Variation (qvar) Emitter flow variation is
    one of the uniformity parameters in irrigation schemes which was calculated using
    (Eq. 8) [17] $$\\mathrm{qvar}=\\frac{\\mathrm{qmax}-\\mathrm{qmin}}{\\mathrm{qmax}}$$
    (8) where qvar = emitter flow variation, qmax = maximum emitter flow rate (l/h),
    and qmin = minimum emitter flow rate (l/h). Coefficient of Variation (Cv) Coefficient
    of variation is the uniformity parameter in irrigation schemes and was estimated
    using (Eq. 9) $$Cv=\\frac{S}{\\mathrm{qavr}}$$ (9) where S = standard deviation
    of emitter flow rates (l/h) and qaver = average emitter flow rate (l/h). Uniformity
    Coefficient The uniformity parameter used is uniformity coefficients (Uc) which
    is described in terms of the coefficient of variation defined as the ratio of
    the standard deviation to the mean, and it is calculated using (Eq. 10) $$\\mathrm{UC}=\\left(1-\\frac{\\mathrm{Sq}}{\\mathrm{qavr}}*100\\right)$$
    (10) where UC = uniformity coefficient (%); Sq = average absolute deviation of
    all emitters flow from the average emitter flow (l/h), and qaver = average emitter
    flow rate (l/h). Crop and Water Productivity and Land Irrigation Ratio (IR) IR
    indicates how much of the available command area for irrigated agriculture is
    being used at any one time (Eq. 11). $$\\mathrm{Irrigation\\; ratio}=\\frac{\\mathrm{Irrigated\\;
    area }\\;(\\mathrm{ha})}{\\mathrm{Command }\\;\\left(\\mathrm{nominal}\\right)\\;\\mathrm{
    area }\\;(\\mathrm{ha})}$$ (11) Irrigation Water Productivity (IWP) IWP for different
    irrigation treatments was calculated by Eq. (12) to determine the performance
    level of irrigation water actually used in the scheme [18]. $$\\mathrm{IWP}=\\frac{y}{\\mathrm{Ig}}$$
    (12) where y = yield (kg/ha) and Ig = gross irrigation (mm). Socio-economic Performance
    Indicators Irrigation Cost per Unit Area It is the cost of irrigation for a unit
    area for successful crop production, i.e., Cost per unit area (Birr/ha) = (cost
    of irrigation, in Birr)/(quantity of the irrigated area, ha). Where; Birr is the
    currency of Ethiopia. Irrigation Benefit-to-Cost Ratio It is the ratio of the
    benefit obtained from unit land to the cost of production for that land (Eq. 13).
    $$\\frac{B}{c}=\\frac{I}{C}$$ (13) B/C = benefit–cost ratio, I = total income
    obtained from 1-hectare land in birr, and C = cost of production for that land
    in Birr. Agriculture Performance Indicators For the evaluation of agricultural
    performance, indicators related to the output of various units were used and these
    indicators were stated in Eqs. (14)–(17). $$\\frac{\\mathrm{Output}}{\\mathrm{Irrigated\\;
    area}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{Cost \\;of\\; production}}{\\mathrm{Irrigated\\; cropped\\;
    area }\\;(\\mathrm{ha})}$$ (14) $$\\frac{\\mathrm{Output}}{\\mathrm{Unit\\; command\\;
    area}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{Cost\\; of\\; production}}{\\mathrm{Command \\;area }\\;(\\mathrm{ha})}$$
    (15) $$\\frac{\\mathrm{Output}}{\\mathrm{Irrigated\\; supply}} =\\frac{\\mathrm{Cost\\;
    of\\; production}}{\\mathrm{Diverted\\; irrigation\\; supply }\\;\\left({\\mathrm{m}}^{3}\\right)}$$
    (16) $$\\frac{\\mathrm{Output}}{\\mathrm{Unit\\; water\\; consumed}}=\\frac{\\mathrm{Cost\\;
    of\\; production}}{\\mathrm{Irrigated\\; cropped \\;area }\\;\\left(\\mathrm{ha}\\right)}$$
    (17) Results and Discussions Performance Evaluation and Indicators of Irrigation
    Engineering Indicators Delivery Performance Ratio (DPR) The result showed that
    81.25% of the emitters measured discharged are more than 0.9 L/h, while 18.75%
    discharged are less than 0.9 L/h (Table 1). With the poor lateral installation
    and the farmer’s illegal rip of the clogged emitters with an awl, knife, and nail,
    more water is lost. Since, the farmers just drilled a hole in the blocked emitters
    without taking into account the typical emitter spacing and diameter resulting
    to a loss of large quantity of water [19, 20]. Table 1 Delivery performance ratio
    (DPR) Full size table The experimental plot P1 was close to the source and received
    more water than the plots in the middle and tail. Plot P1 has a delivery performance
    ratio of more than four hand folds of the specified emitter discharge. Plot P1
    received a lot more water than the other plots in each reach. The average DPR
    obtained in the reaches at the head, 1/3rd middle, 2/3rd middle, and tail reach
    was 1.82, 1.64, 1.33, and 1.45, respectively. Reference Evapotranspiration (ETO)
    By using CROPWAT software, the ETO of all months in the study area was ranging
    from 4.27 to 6.96 mm/day by multiplying with the day in each month. ETo ranges
    from 132.4 to 215.8 mm. The effective rainfall value for all months also ranges
    between 7.8 and 157.4 mm; the maximum average monthly effective rainfall was observed
    in August, while the minimum was observed in February, which are expressed in
    Table 2 and Fig. 3. Table 2 Average monthly ER and ETO of the study area Full
    size table Fig. 3 Effective rainfall and referenced evapotranspiration, 2021 Full
    size image For this study the maximum effective rainfall was recorded in the months
    of July and August, whereas the minimum effective rainfall was recorded in the
    months of January, February, and December, respectively. Reference evapotranspiration
    was maximum through the whole months relative to the effective rainfall in Hormat
    Golina-7 irrigation scheme. Relative Water Supply (RWS) During March to June,
    the average monthly water supply and average monthly crop demand were 7.99, 7.32,
    4.68, 4.13 m3/s and 0.015, 0.017, 0.023, 0.025 m3/s, respectively (Table 3). The
    average scheme relative water supplies for the four months were 532.57, 436.12,
    200.54, and 163.74 m3/s, respectively. The scheme’s overall relative water supply
    was 333.24 and this suggested that there was a discrepancy between irrigation
    supply and crop demand [21]. Table 3 Average RWS and RIS of the scheme Full size
    table Relative Irrigation Supply (RIS) The overall scheme’s irrigation water supply
    and irrigation water demand are 7.89, 7.11, 4.56, 4.08 m3/s, and 0.012, 0.013,
    0.021, 0.023 m3/s, respectively (Table 3). The scheme’s average relative irrigation
    supply and relative water supply were 389.38 and 333.24 m3, respectively, and
    depending on this result, the overall scheme performance in irrigation water supply
    is adequate. The RIS number greater than 1 indicates that irrigation supply exceeding
    irrigation demand, while a value less than 1 shows that irrigation supply fell
    short of demand [22]. Based on the results, both RWS and RIS values at HG-7 are
    greater than 1, which implies that the current irrigation water supply was very
    high in comparison to the irrigation water demand at the scheme level (Fig. 4).
    Fig. 4 RWS and RIS of the scheme from March to June, 2021 Full size image Based
    on the result obtained, the relative water and relative irrigation supply were
    maximum in the months of March and April, respectively, whereas the relative water
    and relative irrigation supply were minimum in the months of May and June, respectively.
    The result of RWS at HG-7 is very excessive. The result of RWS and RIS showed
    that it could irrigate additional farm land with these delivery amounts and available
    effective rainfalls in this study. The results were supportive for the plan to
    increase the command area. Equity of Water Delivery Equity of water distribution
    was calculated as the coefficient of variation of the adequacy values between
    different locations. The results of spatial coefficient of variation (PE) of water
    distribution over the investigation period are given in Table 4. Equity of water
    distribution at the head was relatively fair, and at the middle and at the tail
    it was poor, in which the users in middle and tail reaches perceived unfair water
    distribution. Average overall equity of the delivery system of the scheme is found
    to be 0.21. Therefore, based on the equity of water delivery result, the overall
    scheme performance level regarding the equality of water delivery system is fair
    [23]. Table 4 Equity of water delivery analysis Full size table Field Water Use
    Indicators Application Efficiency The result showed that the average application
    efficiencies of the scheme were 57.5%, 60.08%, 50.13%, and 83.6% at the head,
    middle 1/3rd, 2/3rd, and tail reach, respectively (Table 5). The overall application
    efficiency of this scheme was 62.8%, and according to the performance criteria,
    the current efficiency status of the scheme is poor. Low scheme application efficiency
    caused long service time (17 years) of the lateral and improper use of irrigation
    water at the head of the emitter [24]. Table 5 Irrigation efficiency analysis
    Full size table Distribution Uniformity The overall scheme distribution uniformities
    were 53.44%, 51.50%, and 42.89% in Table 6, for the three experimental plot areas,
    respectively. As a result, the average distribution uniformity of the scheme is
    49.28%; therefore, based on the result obtained, the scheme distribution uniformity
    classification for a drip irrigation system is in poor level of performance [25].
    Insufficient working pressures, clogged emitters, and a high coefficient of variation
    of the emitters are the main causes of this problems. Table 6 Uniformity characteristics,
    emitter flow variation, and coefficient of variation Full size table Emitter Flow
    Variation (qvar) The scheme emitter flow variations which depend on the emitter
    flow variation criteria of the results obtained were found to be 67.04%, 73.0%,
    and 81.73% (Table 6). The results show that they are under the unacceptable range..
    This unacceptable flow variation due to the long period of service of the lateral
    17 years in case of HG-7, poor water quality due to the addition of fertilizer,
    the temperature of the area, emitter manufacturing variation, and emitter clogging
    was explained by Demir et al. [26]. Plots of different uniformity coefficient
    values and emitter flow variation showed that uniformity coefficients of 98%,
    95%, and 90% equal emitter flow variations of 10%, 20%, and 30%, respectively.
    The findings showed that the flow rate variance and the homogeneity coefficient
    are inversely related. It signifies those variations in flow rate have a significant
    impact on the uniformity coefficient [27]. The flow rate variation in Fig. 5 at
    the head, middle, and tail reaches was extremely high. Therefore, there was a
    lot of flow rate fluctuation between each drip emitter at all levels of the scheme.
    Fig. 5 Coefficient of variation (Cv) and flow rate variations for experimental
    plot areas and reaches Full size image Coefficient of Variation (Cv) For this
    study the coefficient of variation and average coefficient of variation of the
    experimental plots were determined to be 33.92%, 45.34%, 52.16%, and 33.92%, 53.4%,
    and 52.16% at the head, middle, and tail, respectively, in Table 6 and Fig. 5,
    which can be characterized as marginal to unacceptable, while the overall average
    coefficient of variation was 43.80%, which is an unsatisfactory result [28]. Uniformity
    Coefficient (Uc) The scheme uniformity coefficient was calculated to be 66.08%,
    54.66%, and 47.84% for each experimental plot areas, respectively. According to
    Al-Ghobari [29] this result fell to poor and unacceptable. The average uniformity
    coefficient at the head was relatively good when compared with the middle and
    tail reaches as expressed in Fig. 6. The water pressure at the head reach is high
    and as the head increased from head reaches to tail reach, the water pressure
    becomes low and it cannot easily pass through the clogged emitters. The overall
    uniformity of the scheme has been found to be 56.2% and it is an unacceptable
    value. Fig. 6 Statistical uniformity coefficients Full size image Crop, Water
    Productivity, and Land Irrigation Ratio (IR) The irrigation ratio showed the degree
    of irrigation land utilization as a good indicator of whether there are factors
    contributing to the command areas under irrigation; the result of this study were
    expressed in Table 7. Table 7 (IR) and comparison of common and control farming
    on onion production. Full size table The result showed that 45.42% of the entire
    command area of 48 hectares was irrigated. Illegal perforation of lateral pipes
    and enlarging of emitter holes with an awl and a sharped nail were the causes
    of the lower value. Similarly, from one season to the other, efficiency drops
    consistently. Irrigation Water Productivity (IWP) Irrigation water productivity
    of the controlled farming system is lower than that of the common farming system.
    The common IWP was 27.71 kg/ha/mm, while the regulated IWP was 5.40 kg/ha/mm (Table
    7). Due to illegal lateral pipe enlargement, production with land use was higher,
    and the water that was issued from the emitter covered a larger area and caused
    runoff in some places. At the head, vegetation covered the wetted region, whereas
    the tail was bare soil with no plants. Socio-economic Performance Indicators Irrigation
    Cost per Unit Area The result showed that irrigation cost per unit area (ha) obtained
    from the scheme HG-7 was 43,350 birr (Ethiopian currency). Irrigation Benefit–Cost
    Ratio According to the findings, the benefit-to-cost ratio is more than 1. As
    a result, planting and harvesting in the area were a success. The ratio of greater
    than 1 implies that the project is economically viable, but a ratio of less than
    1 indicates that the project needs to be abandoned [30, 31]. Agriculture Performance
    Indicators When land is a limiting factor in comparison to water, the output per
    unit of irrigation water delivered was 85 birr/m3 (Table 8), but if water is not
    a limiting element for production, output per unit of land may be more essential
    than output per unit of water [32]. In fact, water is not a limiting component
    in the HG-7 irrigation plan in comparison to land. Farmers paid over costs that
    were not used by irrigated regions, according to the aforementioned value. The
    output per cropped area was 455,155 birr/ha, while the output per command area
    was 206,716 birr/ha. These scores showed that the price was quite high. This indicated
    that the cost of a small command area was much higher than the cost of the larger
    ones [33]. Table 8 Irrigation benefit–cost analysis and agricultural performance
    indicators Full size table Conclusion The performance level of a pressurized irrigation
    system was evaluated in the Kobo Girana Valley under Hormat Golina-7 drip irrigation
    systems. The scheme’s overall performance level is poor depending on the performance
    evaluation criteria, though the service year and replacement of old materials
    did not occur within the scheme’s specified lifespan and the command area was
    reduced by half. Irrigation systems must be properly maintained and handled to
    increase the performance level of the scheme. Emitter clogging, problems with
    water sharing between the beneficiary at the head and tail, users’ illegal enlargement
    of clogged emitters, a lack of maintenance and improper collection of laterals
    after irrigation, and excessive water use at the head without the water association
    committee’s approval are the primary difficulties. To address these issues, all
    laterals must be updated, forming a new irrigation water association committee
    for fair and equal irrigation water based on the ground rules and creating awareness
    about the water users on how to correctly utilize laterals, save water, and avoid
    unnecessary costs when harvesting various crops. Accordingly, the direct users
    of the techniques practice in traditional experience, which leads to low performance
    of the system. However, due to poor management and maintenance practice, the overall
    performance of the scheme is low. So, the concerned institutions are expected
    to give due emphasis to these innovative technologies, not only transferring them
    but also adequate training should be given to the water users. Fertilizer application
    was done manually and put directly into the farmland without a fertilizer tanker;
    as a result, fertilizer clogged the emitter. If this problem continues in this
    type of tearing of the emitter, the system will fully stop working and the pipes
    that laid from head work to the manifold will burst and it may request additional
    investment costs. This research work has made a substantial contribution to understanding
    the drawbacks and best practices at various levels of the system. The investigation
    was carried out to change the irrigation system and discover the optimal solution
    for maintenance and enhancing crop output productivity. The socio-economic aspect
    of this research is to develop effective use of irrigation water for the community
    as the whole, reduce the conflict at upstream and dawn stream water users, introduce
    how to apply the fertilizer mechanically with the system rather than manual application,
    and finally create the overall awareness about drip irrigation system for the
    whole community. The study provided direction for the concerned sectors on how
    to expand the best technology to smallholder farmers using low-cost and locally
    available materials to improve the farmers’ productivity and provide the right
    direction for future irrigation water management. Finally, this study evaluated
    overall performances of drip irrigation systems and give direction for a mitigation
    option regarding the poor performance and improper irrigation water management
    practices in the scheme at field level in the HG-7 drip irrigation system. Data

    measure for post-operative PJI and would seem to be the most feasible for TJA
    protocol. Peer Review reports Introduction Background Peri-prosthetic joint infections
    (PJI) after total joint arthroplasty (TJA) is among the most serious challenges
    in orthopedics, worldwide [1]. Although significant attempts have been done to
    minimize surgical site infections (SSI) during recent decades, PJI is still estimated
    to occur in around 0.3 to 1.9% of total hip and knee replacements [2]. The severity
    and length of the treatment approach for PJI place a major load on the healthcare
    system, despite being uncommon [3]. Even though the World Health Organization
    (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control have published two guidelines recommending
    intraoperative lavage with diluted Povidone Iodine (PI) [4, 5], SSI related to
    general surgery is distinct from PJI [6] and the beneficial effect of diluted
    PI for PJI prevention is still debatable [7, 8]. Rationale The findings of review
    articles on this subject are even more debatable. Two systematic reviews and meta
    analyses on the topic were recently published, one of which found positive results
    in terms of prosthesis infection prevention [9], and the other found no difference
    with PI irrigation [10]. In Kobayashi et al. study, the groups were sub analyzed
    regarding the control comparator agent. When PI was compared with normal saline
    (NS) irrigation, excluding studies that applied chlorhexidine (CHG) as a control
    or didn’t give enough information, they found that PI causes a significant drop
    in PJI postoperatively. However, in comparison with CHG, as an active control
    agent, these two solutions did not differ in their infection rate following joint
    replacement [8]. Kim et al., on the other hand, did not perform subgroup analysis
    based on the control agent, and finally found no difference in terms of infection
    rate between PI and non-PI application [9]. Moreover, Cacciola et al. did not
    conclude if diluted PI is effective in PJI avoidance or not [11]. Due to the dispute
    and the lack of a comprehensive systematic review that also assesses review articles
    (meta-research), we attempted to perform a systematic literature evaluation in
    the hopes of arriving at a conclusion for this critical clinical condition. Objectives:
    The major question addressed in this systematic review is: Does the application
    of diluted PI irrigation before wound closure prevent PJI after TJA operations?
    More specifically, we aim to determine diluted PI relative effectiveness, compared
    with NS, CHG, and other studied control agents. Materials and methods Protocol
    While conducting this systematic review and meta research, we implemented the
    Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement
    standards [12]. Search strategy The papers from databases Medline, Scopus, Web
    of science, and Cochrane library were screened without time limitation, using
    following terminology: (“povidone-iodine” OR “betadine” OR “iodo-povidone” OR
    “povidone”) AND (“arthroplasty” OR “TJA” OR “knee arthroplasty” OR “hip arthroplasty”
    OR “peri-prosthesis \" OR “PJI” OR “joint arthroplasty” OR “total knee replacement
    OR “total hip replacement”) AND (“infection” OR “biofilm” OR “organism”). English
    articles were reviewed without any other filter in effect. We also looked through
    the citations of the articles to see whether any of the papers were relevant.
    Eligibility criteria and study selection The present study aims to review investigations
    fulfill the PICOTD methodology criteria: P (Problem): post-operative PJI; I (Intervention):
    diluted PI wound irrigation; C (Comparison): comparison of PI and non-PI lavage
    groups; O (Outcomes): PJI odds ratio; T (Timing): ≥ three months’ follow-up for
    clinical diagnosis; D (Design): clinical trial, original prospective and retrospective
    articles. Additional inclusion criteria are pure PI lavage regimen, not one that
    includes additional solutions like Chlorhexidine Gluconate, and primary or revision
    arthroplasty procedure. We have also evaluated review articles (meta research),
    that have reviewed articles investigating dilute PI efficacy in post-operative
    prevention. The exclusion factors are defined as follows: experimental studies,
    biomechanical studies, case-reports, book chapters, letters to the editor, expert
    comments, and duplicate research. Two researchers scanned 158 articles based on
    title and abstract, 38 of them were read in full, and 19 papers (13 originals
    and 6 reviews) were included for qualitative and quantitative analysis. The search
    strategy flow diagram and included reports at each step are depicted in Fig. 1.
    Fig. 1 Flowchart indicating systematic search method and the number of excluded
    documents at each stage Full size image Data extraction Using a pre-designed Excel
    form, the data including first author name, study year, study design, type of
    surgery, sample size in case and control groups, mean age and sex ratio, follow
    up duration, betadine solution concentration and volume, intervention method,
    control group comparator, investigated infection site, infection rate in PI and
    control group, P value, and final conclusion were extracted. Quality assessment
    Two reviewers evaluated each study using Methodological Index for Non-Randomized
    Studies (MINORS) score criteria [13] for each study methodological quality assessment.
    The criteria are given a score of 0 (not reported), 1 (reported but inadequate),
    or 2 (reported and adequate). For non-comparative research, the maximum score
    is 16, while for comparative studies, it is 24. The included articles’ score ranges
    were between 15 and 24, with the mean of 16.3. Statistical analysis A meta-analysis
    of pooled odds ratios with 95 percent confidence intervals (CI) was created to
    qualitatively summarize the findings of the systematic review. Using Comprehensive
    meta-analysis software (Version 4 Biostat, Englewood, NJ 2022), meta-analysis
    was conducted. The analysis of the PJI rates between the PI and non-PI pre-closure
    wound irrigation groups was the primary outcome of this meta-analysis. The infection
    rate comparison in general, as well as the subgroup analyses for control-agent
    and primary vs revision arthroplasties, were conducted. Statistical significance
    was defined as a P value < 0.05. By calculating I2, the measure of treatment effect
    heterogeneity across studies was assessed. A random effects model was applied
    when conducting all the subgroup analysis. The results, pooled estimate of odds
    ratio, and overall summary effect of each study were displayed using Forest plots.
    Results Study characteristics In total, 13 original and 6 review articles (two
    meta-analysis) were reviewed. Of original papers, 11 were retrospective cohort
    and two were clinical trials. The control comparators were NS in five studies,
    CHG in three researches, one sterile water, and no data available in four studies.
    Of all included papers, there was one clinical trial study with infection diagnosis
    based on culture after 48 h, and not clinical diagnosis. There were 63,950 cases
    of TJA (mean age: 65.69 ± 1.96, sex ratio: 55.72% female) recorded in total, with
    22,765 cases undergoing PI lavage and 41,185 cases not. All of the studies included
    in this review were reporting THA or TKA, with 11 focusing on primary arthroplasty
    and two on aseptic revision arthroplasty. The further information of sample sizes,
    follow-up period for diagnosis of postoperative infection, and results are presented
    in Tables 1 and 2. Included studies were similar in terms of demographic parameters
    of age and sex ratio. Table 1 Included studies’ characteristics Full size table
    Table 2 Included studies’ results Full size table Individual original study results
    During a retrospective cohort, dilute PI 0.35% lavage for 3 min has revealed to
    be efficient method for reducing acute PJI, when compared with isotonic sodium
    chloride solution irrigation (P = 0.04) [14]. Hernandez and Hart conducted two
    large cohorts on primary and revision TJA in 2019. After 3 and 12 months of follow
    up, they did not find any difference between infection rate between patients received
    PI and non-PI irrigation, neither in primary nor in revision arthroplasty [7,
    15]. In contrast, there are investigations which resulted in significant decline
    in rate of infection with application of PI [16]. Just recently, Shohat et al.
    compared PI with sterile saline in a cohort with 31,331 cases, and estimated an
    absolute risk reduction of 0.73% when applied PI [17]. Another study with similar
    methodology in 2022, resulted a notable drop in any infection when arthroplasty
    wounds were irrigated with PI (P < 0.005) [18]. Three active comparator studies
    between PI and Chlorhexidine concluded in similar efficiency in infection prevention
    for these two agents (P = 0.53 and 0.46) [19,20,21]. However, a very recent retrospective
    analysis revealed that greater wound concerns with PI resulted in readmission
    to the emergency room. [21]. After performing a randomized clinical trial on 457
    patients with revision TJA, Calkins et al. concluded that diluted PI lavage is
    a safe and beneficial approach to lower the incidence of acute postoperative PJI,
    compared with NS [8]. Another RCT with laboratory diagnosis of PJI 48 h after
    TJA, PI significantly reduced rate of positive culture results in comparison with
    sterile water (P < 0.001) [22]. Individual review study results Recently, two
    systematic and meta-analysis reviews have been published which came out with different
    conclusions [9, 10]. Kobayashi et al. indicated that PJI rate with dilute PI was
    notably lower than NS irrigation (P = 0.004) [9], while Kim et al. noted no difference
    between dilute PI and non PI (including NS) irrigation (P = 0.17) [10]. Current
    work includes all the studies from the 2 aforementioned review articles. Two other
    reviews considered betadine as an inexpensive and simple method, with PJI [23]
    and SSI [24] prevention potentials. One systematic review found no difference
    between PI lavage and non-PI agents lavage for prevention of PJI in primary and
    revision joint replacements [11] (Table 3). Table 3 Included review articles’
    characteristics and results Full size table Safety of PI versus non-PI Hart et
    al. found no significant disparity in the occurrence of reoperation due to infection
    at both 3 and 12 months for revision total hip arthroplasty (THA) and revision
    total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Hernandez et al. discovered no difference in the
    likelihood of septic reoperations between groups after using propensity score.
    Calkins et al. reported that there was no significant difference in wound complications
    between groups. Lung et al. revealed that patients who received chlorhexidine
    gluconate (CHG) lavage during total joint arthroplasty (TJA) had a significantly
    lower rate of wound complication-related emergency room readmissions at both 30
    and 90 days. Quantitative results In general, analysing 11 retrospective cohorts
    and two clinical trials comparing PI with control group, the odds ratio for PI
    irrigation is 0.79 (CI 95%: 0.52–1.18), which is not statistically significant
    (P = 0.25) (Fig. 2). The results reveal no difference between PI and non-PI irrigation.

    four retrospective cohorts and two clinical trials, comparing PI with NS or SW,
    the odds ratio for PI irrigation is 0.44 (CI 95%: 0.34–0.56), which is statistically
    significant (P < 0.001) (Fig. 3). The results reveal notable superiority between
    PI and NS irrigation. The heterogeneity index (I2) was 0% (P = 0.63). Fig. 3 Forest

    PI compound, made up of Polyvinylpyrrolidone and iodine, is a bactericidal agent
    works by slowly releasing free iodine, which is detrimental to bacteria [25].
    When compared to other PJI preventive solutions, such as Chlorhexidine or Vancomycin,
    Betadine demonstrated greater bactericidal activity, killing all bacteria assayed
    promptly in an in vitro setting [26]. After one randomized clinical trial study,
    patients irrigated with PI had significantly lower positive culture rate after
    48 h of arthroplasty [22]. However, there have been worries about PI irrigation
    safety profile. Even at low concentration, free iodine has been shown to be toxic
    to chondrocytes, osteoblasts, synovial cells, and bone tissues in several experiments,
    particularly when used more than 1 min [27,28,29]. Building on the most recent
    systematic review conducted by Kobayashi et al., our review has incorporated three
    additional original studies published subsequent to the Kobayashi study, along
    with a review of the previous reviews, to arrive at a comprehensive conclusion
    on this topic. The main outcome from this systematic review and meta-analysis
    reveals that diluted PI is superior to NS, but similar to antiseptic agents, regarding
    prosthesis infection prevention. Two prior meta-analyses by Kobayashi and Kim,
    that appears to have controversial outcomes, are consistent with our quantitative
    results. There is also an ongoing RCT, comparing 3.5% PI, 0.05% chlorhexidine,
    and sterile water, in terms of microbial growth in TJA instrument. Considering
    the large number of estimated participants (270 patients) and the randomized trial
    design, the outcomes from this study which will probably be revealed in 2023 would
    be helpful (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04274517). A review article
    with meta-analysis, concluded that CHG was superior to PI in SSI prevention in
    general [30]. When skin preparation with iodine and CHG studied, iodine was superior
    in PJI prevention [31]. There are two recent large retrospective cohorts by one
    research team, in which the control group solution agents were not defined [7,
    15]. Hart and Hernandez evaluated more than 10,000 individuals retrospectively
    with primary and revision TJA, and concluded a non-significant higher infection
    rate with 0.25% PI, compared with non-PI agents. These studies results are similar
    to the CHG control subgroup; as such, we assume they have applied an active antiseptic
    as the control. The PI concentration in these cohorts were lower than most of
    other researches using 0.35% PI, that may be hypothesis for the controversy. Of
    course the type of control comparators is also important in more interpretations.
    The clinical trial study with the highest score in quality assessment, showed
    that PI is an effective approach to lessen acute PJI risk [8]. Consistent with
    most of other studies, one another cohort in 2022, compared dilute betadine with
    NS on this issue, and reached to a lower rate of any infection type with betadine
    lavage, more notably in SSI rate [18]. CHG has been shown to reduce PJI rate more
    efficiently than diluted PI, albeit not significant. As such, diluted PI could
    be a feasible, less expensive alternative agent for CHG. The heterogeneity among
    studies with not reported control agent, shows that the results of the Hart and
    Hernandez investigations are more in line with the CHG comparator subgroup, whereas
    those of the Matsenko and Fleischman studies are more in line with the NS comparator
    subgroup. Having stated that, we surmise that Hart and Hernandez used an antiseptic
    control comparator, whereas Matsenko and Fleischman used an inactive comparator
    (NS, SW, etc.). Limitations: Due to the low incidence of PJI, almost all of the
    studies were retrospective, using different control agents and intervention approaches,
    resulting in heterogeneity that affected the meta-analysis results. We conducted
    subgroup analyses and were able to reach a homogeneous group in some cases. However,
    to arrive at a more robust conclusion, further well-designed prospective studies
    are necessary. Conclusion Application of diluted PI solution for pre closure wound
    irrigation reduces infection rate, compared with NS lavage. In this regard, PI
    is probably not superior to other antiseptic agents. Data availability The data

  description: 'Accurate reference evapotranspiration (ETo) estimation is crucial
    for water irrigation management and sustainable agriculture planning. The difficulty
    in obtaining several data requirements for employing the recommended Food and
    Agriculture Organization Penman-Monteith method (FAO-PM) for reliable estimation
    of ETo has led to the development of many empirical models. This is particularly
    crucial for Iraq, located in West Asia (29°15′00″-38°15′00″ N; 38°45′00″-48°45′00″
    E), where meteorological data are often limited or missing. The objectives of
    the present study were to assess the performance of 40 ETo empirical models (13
    radiation-based, 13 mass-transfer-based, and 14 temperature-based) against the
    FAO-PM model and identify alternative models with the minimal available data in
    three major climatic zones of Iraq: the Mediterranean climate (MCZ), semiarid
    (SCZ), and arid desert (ACZ). The recent ERA5 data set was adopted. The results
    indicate that (1) the Rohwer mass-transfer method is the best for estimating ETo
    for two-thirds of Iraq with a mean correlation coefficient (R2) of 0.97, mean
    Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.84, mean percent bias (PBIAS) of -8.92%, mean
    Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) of 0.92, and root mean square error
    (RMSE)-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) of 0.27, followed by the Penman
    (R2=0.90, KGE=0.75, NSE=0.77, RSR=0.46, and PBIAS=6.36%) and Caprio (R2=0.90,
    KGE=0.66, NSE=0.54, RSR=0.58, and PBIAS=24.64%) models; (2) Caprio is the best
    radiation-based model for estimating ETo, mainly in the ACZ, whereas Kharrufa
    is the best temperature-based model for estimating ETo, primarily in the SCZ and
    ACZ. Overall, the mass-transfer-based models performed better than other-based
    models for ETo estimation. The outcomes of this study provide a scientific reference
    for accurate ETo estimation using empirical models under limited data sets, which
    is valuable for irrigation management in Iraq.'

    Abstract Accurate reference evapotranspiration ( ET o ) estimation is crucial
    for water irrigation management and sustainable agriculture planning. The difficulty
    in obtaining several data requirements for employing the recommended Food and
    Agriculture Organization Penman-Monteith method (FAO-PM) for reliable estimation
    of ET o has led to the development of many empirical models. This is particularly
    crucial for Iraq, located in West Asia (29°15′00″–38°15′00″ N; 38°45′00″–48°45′00″
    E), where meteorological data are often limited or missing. The objectives of
    the present study were to assess the performance of 40 ET o empirical models (13
    radiation-based, 13 mass-transfer-based, and 14 temperature-based) against the
    FAO-PM model and identify alternative models with the minimal available data in
    three major climatic zones of Iraq: the Mediterranean climate (MCZ), semiarid
    (SCZ), and arid desert (ACZ). The recent ERA5 data set was adopted. The results
    indicate that (1) the Rohwer mass-transfer method is the best for estimating ET
    o for two-thirds of Iraq with a mean correlation coefficient ( R 2 ) of 0.97,
    mean Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.84, mean percent bias (PBIAS) of − 8.92
    % , mean Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE) of 0.92, and root mean square
    error (RMSE)-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) of 0.27, followed by
    the Penman ( R 2 = 0.90 , KGE = 0.75 , NSE = 0.77 , RSR = 0.46 , and PBIAS = 6.36
    % ) and Caprio ( R 2 = 0.90 , KGE = 0.66 , NSE = 0.54 , RSR = 0.58 , and PBIAS
    = 24.64 % ) models; (2) Caprio is the best radiation-based model for estimating
    ET o , mainly in the ACZ, whereas Kharrufa is the best temperature-based model
    for estimating ET o , primarily in the SCZ and ACZ. Overall, the mass-transfer-based
    models performed better than other-based models for ET o estimation. The outcomes
    of this study provide a scientific reference for accurate ET o estimation using
    empirical models under limited data sets, which is valuable for irrigation management
    in Iraq. Practical Applications Accurately estimating ET o is vital for effective
    water irrigation management and sustainable agriculture planning. However, the
    recommended method for estimating ET o , the FAO-PM method, requires various data
    inputs that may not always be readily available, especially in regions like Iraq.
    Therefore, this study assessed the performance of 40 empirical ET o models, categorized
    into radiation-based, mass-transfer-based, and temperature-based models, against
    the FAO-PM model in three major climatic zones of Iraq: the Mediterranean climate,
    the semiarid region, and the arid desert. The study found that the Rohwer mass-transfer
    method showed the best performance in estimating ET o for two-thirds of Iraq.
    The Penman and Caprio models also performed well in estimating ET o in specific
    areas. The study revealed that the choice of the ET o model varied depending on
    the climatic zone. The Caprio model performed best for radiation-based estimation
    in the arid desert, whereas the Kharrufa model was most effective for temperature-based
    estimation in the semiarid region and arid desert. Overall, the mass-transfer-based
    models outperformed other types of models in ET o estimation. Introduction Evapotranspiration
    (ET) is a vital process of the global hydrological cycle. ET plays a substantial
    role in determining irrigation water requirements (Allen et al. 1998a), crop yield
    simulation (Kumar et al. 2008), irrigation scheduling calculations (Shahid 2011;
    Kumar et al. 2012), surface streamflow modeling (Ellenburg et al. 2018), groundwater
    level assessment (Salem et al. 2018), agricultural water balance (Wanniarachchi
    and Sarukkalige 2022), and climate change evaluation (Salehie et al. 2022; Shiru
    et al. 2018). Hence, it can influence water management for agricultural purposes
    (Allen et al. 1998a; Salem et al. 2018). ET is critical for soil moisture, surface
    runoff, and groundwater recharge and is essential to understanding the complex
    interaction between energy and water cycles (Jiang et al. 2019; Singer et al.
    2021; Zhang and Wang 2021). Variations in ET might considerably influence crop
    growth and water availability, which could cause adverse implications for water
    availability and agricultural production (Pour et al. 2020; Li et al. 2021). Three
    closely related terms of the ET concept are actual evapotranspiration (AET), potential
    evapotranspiration (PET), and reference crop evapotranspiration ( ET o ) ET o
    is hypothetically a grass reference crop under special conditions, including a
    fixed surface resistance of 70 s m − 1 , an assumed crop height of 0.12 m, and
    an albedo of 0.23 (Allen et al. 1998a). Crop actual evapotranspiration ( ET c
    ) is driven indirectly by multiplying ET o and a crop coefficient ( K c ), which
    depends on diverse crop characteristics and environmental factors such as soil
    evaporation, climate, crop type, and crop growth stages. For instance, K c values
    vary systematically from 0.69 to 1.02 depending on the periods of crop growth
    stages, including initial, midseason, or end season (Allen et al. 1998b; Wang
    et al. 2019). ET o is considered one of the most decisive factors for hydrometeorological
    and agricultural studies (Pinos 2022). Therefore, accurate calculation of ET is
    imperative to sustainable agriculture systems, water resources management, and
    climate change adaptation strategies. Direct experimental measurement is one of
    the most accurate methods for estimating ET. Examples of directly instrumental
    methods include lysimeters (Jia et al. 2006), Bowen ratio (Irmak and Irmak 2008),
    and evaporation pans (Muhammad et al. 2019). In general, in situ ET measurement
    is considered laborious, expensive, and difficult for untrained users to employ.
    Therefore, it is associated with considerable complexity and uncertainties (Muhammad
    et al. 2019; Pinos 2022). Alternatively, numerous indirect empirical models of
    ET o estimation have been developed, often used as an appropriate substitute for
    in situ measurement in different regions. Because ET o is a complicated process
    that depends primarily on several climatic parameters (e.g., air temperature,
    wind speed, and solar radiation), the ET o estimation models can mainly be classified
    into four groups according to these variables. They include radiation-based, temperature-based,
    combination, and mass-transfer-based models. Among these empirical models, the
    recommended Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)-56 Penman-Monteith combination-based
    technique (FAO-PM) is the most widely accepted method for accurate ET o calculation
    (Allen et al. 1998b; Muhammad et al. 2019; Singer et al. 2021; Sobh et al. 2022).
    Numerous studies validated and compared the FAO-PM model results with the direct
    measurement of lysimeters and found them to perform relatively well (Kumar et
    al. 2008; Trajkovic and Kolakovic 2009; Muhammad et al. 2019; Bakr et al. 2021).
    Therefore, the FAO-PM method has been widely used to validate and assess other
    empirical models for calculating ET o under different climatic and geographical
    conditions without local calibration (Allen et al. 1998a; Ravazzani et al. 2012;
    Tabari et al. 2013; Kisi 2014). One primary reason is that the FAO-PM is a physical
    equation, considering energy balance and aerodynamic theories (Wang et al. 2019;
    Ippolito et al. 2023). The main difficulty of applying this method is related
    to various climatic parameter requirements (e.g., mean air temperature, vapor
    pressure, wind speed, dew point temperature, solar radiation, and relative humidity).
    Long-term data records of all these meteorological variables are not always available
    in data-scarce areas in developing countries. Thus, it has limited the use of
    this model because coverage of meteorological stations is either weak in remote
    areas or does not measure all the required weather data. Accordingly, less data-intensive
    empirical models for estimating ET o , including the radiation-based, temperature-based,
    and mass-transfer-based, are employed to address this limitation. ET o formulations
    are subject to restrictions, viewpoints, and uncertainty (Muhammad et al. 2019).
    However, the primary constraint of these methods is that they may perform differently
    owing to their different parameter requirements and theoretical assumptions. Accordingly,
    empirical models cannot be applied directly to different climatic types. It is
    primarily because each model has developed for a specific climatic zone. Hence,
    conducting a comprehensive evaluation is essential to detect the best alternative
    empirical models to calculate ET o accurately with available limited climatic
    parameters before direct adoption in a particular region. Iraq is suffering increasingly
    from water scarcity. The country has experienced a notable decline in precipitation
    and surface flow of the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers. It is related to intensive
    anthropogenic activities, i.e., the large dam construction in the upstream catchments
    and global climate change in the region (Al-Hasani 2021; Al-Ansari et al. 2018).
    Except for the northern rainfed provinces, agriculture is mainly irrigated and
    depends largely on the available surface water resources. In addition, Iraq is
    vulnerable to climate change because most of the central, western, and southern
    parts are semiarid and arid, where precipitation variability and temperature extremes
    are common (Salman et al. 2018b, 2017). Since the early 1990s, climatic events
    such as frequent droughts, dust storms, and flash floods have been observed frequently
    (Salman et al. 2018b). It has exacerbated the issue even further, leading to severe
    land degradation and desertification. For instance, the deteriorated area has
    expanded rapidly during the recent persistent drought over the last 3 years, from
    2019 to 2021, causing increasing desertification, soil erosion, and dust storms
    in many parts of Iraq. Hence, agricultural arable lands have declined noticeably,
    especially in the most vulnerable communities in rural areas. Many smallholder
    farmers and small-scale producers have become at risk of unemployment, poverty,
    instability, and hunger (Al-Hasani and Shahid 2022). Accordingly, water shortages
    have been among the uprising challenges confronting the expansion of agriculture
    and economic improvements (Salman et al. 2021). Because ET o tends to be relatively
    high in Iraq, particularly throughout the dry summer, it is one of the principal
    sources of water loss. More importantly, any governmental measures to address
    the problem of water scarcity, including the development of irrigation use efficiency
    in the Iraqi agriculture sector, should depend on an accurate estimation of ET
    o . Therefore, investigating the performance of ET o empirical models can help
    to extend the knowledge regarding the most reliable model for estimating ET o
    , especially under no record of long-term data of direct in situ measurements
    in the country. It can result in accurate management of water resources, efficient
    use of irrigation, and increased agricultural productivity. Research has been
    undertaken to explore applicable ET o models with available weather data in various
    regions such as Canada, Iran, China, Malawi, Senegal, and the US (Singh and Xu
    1997; Irmak et al. 2003b; Martinez and Thepadia 2010; Tabari et al. 2013; Ngongondo
    et al. 2013; Djaman et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2021). However, the results of the
    best empirical models for estimating ET o varied over regions. For example, Nandagiri
    and Kovoor (2006) evaluated the performance of seven ET o empirical models in
    diverse climatic zones in India. They revealed that the temperature-based Hargreaves
    model was the best method to compute ET o compared with the FAO-PM model. Muniandy
    et al. (2016) studied the performance of 26 models in Malaysia, and they found
    that Penman was the most appropriate ET o model. Sobh et al. (2022) compared the
    performance of 31 ET o empirical models in arid regions in Egypt and indicated
    that Jones-Ritchie was the best model for calculating ET o . Hamed et al. (2022)
    assessed the performance of 30 empirical ET o models in different climate regimes
    of Pakistan. They concluded that the Hamon temperature-based model showed the
    highest performance among other models. Generally, performance assessments have
    been conducted over several regions to detect the most reliable empirical methods
    for ET o estimation. Despite the extensive research globally, the reviewed literature
    presented limited published studies that assessed the performance of empirical
    models for estimating ET o in Iraq. AlJumaili et al. (2014) estimated the ET o
    for two irrigation projects located in the Karbala province in central Iraq based
    on five ET o empirical models. The performance of each model was measured using
    correlation coefficient ( R 2 ), root mean square, and bias error. They found
    that the FAO-PM model produced the best estimation of ET o . Saud et al. (2014)
    also studied four temperature-based methods for determining ET o in semiarid zones
    of the Al-Anbar province. They reported that Thornthwaite, Blaney-Criddle, and
    Kharrufa equations underestimated the ET o values, whereas the Ivanov formula
    was the most suitable for estimating ET o . These previous studies had the drawbacks
    of the limited number of considered models, specific methodology, and restricted
    study area. Bakr et al. (2021) validated the results of four ET o models (i.e.,
    the FAO-PM, Thornthwaite, Kharrufa, and Ivanov) against lysimeter measurements
    in Baghdad, Basrah, Mosul, and Al-Anbar provinces using R 2 and mean absolute
    error. They showed that the standard FAO-PM equation had the most reliable estimation
    of ET o for all four considered locations. Thus, it is valid to assume that the
    FAO-PM model can use as a reference estimate in the region in the context of the
    absence of direct in situ measurements record in Iraq. However, this model requires
    several agrometeorological data that are scarce in Iraq. Regardless of data quality,
    which is often questionable, most data sets are either incomplete or freely unavailable.
    Thus, no published study has been conducted on calculating ET o using the standard
    FAO-PM model for all of Iraq and determining the best alternative ET o models
    using a comprehensive evaluation with limited meteorological data appropriate
    for different climatic regions of Iraq. Therefore, the present study aims to employ
    the decision-making methods for ranking various empirical models of estimating
    ET o over Iraq. The specific objectives are to (1) calculate the daily ET o for
    the long term from 1959 to 2021 in different climatic zones of Iraq using the
    FAO-PM model as a reference estimate, (2) assess the performance of 40 widely
    applied empirical models versus the FAO-PM model by ranking them based on five
    standard statistical metrics, and (3) recommend the most reliable alternative
    model to the standard FAO-PM for estimating ET o from each category for major
    climatic regimes of Iraq with the least available climatic data. The findings
    can provide an inclusive understanding of the most applicable empirical models
    to the diverse climatic regions of Iraq for accurate estimation of ET o , which
    can improve crop irrigation estimation, water resources planning, and climate
    change resilience plans. Data Description and Methods Study Area Iraq is located
    geographically in West Asia ( = 29 ° 15 ′ ′ – 38 ° 15 ′ ′ N ; 38°45–48°45 E).
    It covers a territory area of 434,128 km 2 . Iraq is bordered by six countries,
    Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to the south, Syria
    to the northwest, and Jordan to the west, as presented in Fig. 1. Iraq is the
    land between the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers. The streamflow of these two rivers
    and their streams, representing the vital water resources in Iraq, jointly created
    the Iraqi Mesopotamian fertile alluvial plain, also supplying the Iraqi marshes
    or Mesopotamian wetlands in the south. Iraq has diverse topography, ranging from
    high mountains and hills to alluvial plains and deserts. The elevation varies
    from greater than 4,000 m in the northeastern and northern mountainous areas to
    about − 40 m in the south and southeastern of the alluvial plain (Fig. 1). Fig.
    1. Map of Iraq with its spatial elevation distribution. Dots denote the grid points
    of ERA5 in the three major climate zones (I to III). (Map by authors.) The country
    has three main climatic zones (Salman et al. 2018a). Zone I covers the northern
    and northeastern mountainous regions having a Mediterranean climate (MCZ); Zone
    II is the central plain lands, classified as subtropical semiarid or steppe (SCZ);
    and Zone III is the southern lowlands that have an arid or subtropical desert
    (ACZ). The characteristics of the climate are dry and hot summers and cold winters.
    Winter is relatively short, from December to February, and summer is from early
    May to September, except in some mountainous upland regions where it lasts from
    June to August. The annual mean air temperature varies from higher than 44°C during
    summer to less than 16°C in winter. Iraq has a high evaporation rate, which exceeds
    2,000 mm / year . The rainfall over Iraq mainly occurs between November and April
    and varies spatially from about 150 mm in the dry southeast to above 400 mm in
    the relatively humid northeast (Al-Hasani and Shahid 2022). The precipitation
    occurs between November and April, and snow forms only in the northern mountainous
    region. Data Sources The European Reanalysis version 5 hourly (ERA5) data set
    from 1959 to 2021 was adopted for this study (Muñoz-Sabater et al. 2021). ERA5,
    also known as ERA5-Land, improved by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
    Forecasts (ECMWF), represents the fifth generation of European reanalysis data.
    The ERA5 is a data set of numerous atmospheric and land variables at a global
    scale from 1959 to the present with a high-resolution spatial grid of 0.10° or
    ∼ 9 km . It comprises mainly satellite historical observation data with additional
    existing observatory gauging records and improved numerical prediction models.
    ERA5 offers a better understanding of various climatic environments and reliable
    interpretations of the weather and climate. This study utilized several climatological
    parameters of the ERA5 data set, namely, dew point temperature; maximum, minimum,
    and mean air temperature; surface and thermal solar radiation; u and v components
    of wind; relative humidity; and atmospheric surface pressure, for estimating ET
    o . Singer et al. (2021) described the applied procedures for calculating ET o
    from these variables in detail. The ERA5 data have several advantages; for example,
    the data provides many atmospheric variables in ungauged locations, specifically
    mountainous regions and remote deserts. Also, the data considers the uncertainty
    in the initial data (Gleixner et al. 2020) and their temporal consistency (Muñoz-Sabater
    et al. 2021). Besides, the data set is freely available on the Copernicus Climate
    Change Service of the European Commission web platforms. Although more than 50
    ground weather gauging stations of the Iraqi Meteorological Organization and Seismology
    Organization are distributed over the country, they either have missing data due
    to years of subsequent wars or are freely inaccessible. Thus, this study used
    the ERA5 of gridded hourly data. Methods for Calculating Reference Evapotranspiration
    Iraq’s calculated pan evaporation, lysimeter, or eddy covariance ET data are unavailable
    for the required long-term record. This study, therefore, first adopted the FAO-PM
    equation (Allen et al. 1998a) as a reference estimate for daily ET o using the
    ERA5 data set at different climatic zones of Iraq. Then, the most well-known 40
    empirical ET o models, including various radiation-based, temperature-based, and
    mass-transfer-based ones, were used to generate the modeled ET o . Afterward,
    a comparison between the referenced FAO-PM ET o and the simulated ET o was conducted
    to evaluate the performance of those 40 empirical ET o equations. Subsequently,
    the multicriteria group decision-making approach was applied to ranking each model
    of the major climatic zones in Iraq based on five robust statistical metrics.
    Finally, the best three estimation models of ET o have been chosen for each grid
    point located in Iraq. FAO Penman-Monteith Model The FAO-PM equation was employed
    to calculate the daily ET o in this study. The combination-based FAO-PM equation
    requires a full set of climatic variables data to compute the daily ET o values,
    i.e., wind speed, dew point temperature, solar radiation, air temperature, relative
    humidity, and atmospheric pressure. The ET o rate is computed meteorologically
    using the FAO-PM method. The procedure for computing the FAO-PM standard method
    is described in Chapter 3 of FAO 56 (Allen et al. 1998b), as shown in Eq. (1):
    ET o = 0.408 Δ ( R n − G ) + γ ( 900 T + 273 ) u 2 ( e s − e a ) Δ + γ ( 1 + 0.34
    u 2 ) (1) where ET o = reference evapotranspiration ( mm / day ); Δ = slope of
    the saturation vapor pressure versus temperature curve ( kPa / ° C ); γ = psychrometric
    constant ( kPa / ° C ); R n = net solar radiation ( MJ / m 2 / day ); G = soil
    heat flux density ( MJ / m 2 / day ); T = mean air temperature measured at 2 m
    (°C); u 2 = average daily wind speed ( m / s ) calculated at 2 m height above
    the ground surface; e s = saturation vapor pressure (kPa); e a = actual vapor
    pressure (kPa); and ( e s − e a ) = saturation vapor pressure deficit (kPa) (Allen
    et al. 1998a). Empirical ET o Models The present study adopted the most widely
    used 40 empirical ET o models in different regions and diverse climatic conditions.
    They include 13 radiation-based models, 14 temperature-based models, and 13 mass-transfer-based
    models. Table 1 lists the 40 models based on their names, required weather data,
    equations, and class groups. Table 1. Details of the selected 40 empirical ET

    and Statistical Analysis In the present study, statistical tests have been employed
    to assess the ET o estimation performance quantitatively. Therefore, the performance
    of 40 empirical models was evaluated to detect the best estimation models of ET
    o against the standard FAO-PM model in Iraq. These 40 ET o models were ranked
    according to five statistical criteria methods. These include Kling-Gupta efficiency
    (KGE), percent bias (PBIAS), coefficient of determination ( R 2 ), Nash-Sutcliffe
    efficiency coefficient (NSE), and root-mean square error (RMSE)-observations standard
    deviation ratio (RSR). Equations of those approaches employed to evaluate the
    statistical performance of each model are described as follows: KGE = 1 − ( r
    − 1 ) 2 + ( γ − 1 ) 2 + ( β − 1 ) 2 (2) γ = μ s μ o (3) β = σ s μ s σ o μ o (4)

    (8) where O i = observed values; n = observation number; S i = modeled values;
    r = Pearson’s correlation between the observed data ( O ) and simulations ( S
    ); β = bias (i.e., normalized by the standard deviation of the monitored data;
    γ = fraction of the coefficient of variation showing changeability at spatial
    scale; S ¯ and O ¯ = corresponding mean value for the simulation and observation,
    respectively; and μ and σ = standard deviation and the mean, respectively (Moriasi
    et al. 2007; Gupta et al. 2009; Muhammad et al. 2019). The perfect values, range,

    Making This study employed the multicriteria group decision making (MCGDM) to
    rank each ET o empirical method of Iraq. First, according to the rank done by
    each equation at various grids ( n ), it is given a weight to compute an integrated
    index (Gleixner et al. 2020). Then, an inverse of the rank is provided based on
    the weight of Eq. (9). The integrated index of any empirical method is calculated
    as follows: I x = ∑ i = 1 n 1 rank for only the top 10 ranks (9) The top 10 ranks
    indicate that only the model that attained either a rank of 10 or greater at each
    grid cell was considered. The best method obtains a weight of 1 as ( 1 / 1 ),
    the second-best method receives a weight of 0.5 as ( 1 / 2 = 0.5 ), the third-best
    the weight of 0.33 as ( 1 / 3 = 0.33 ), and so on up to the 10th-best model. The
    models ranked below 10 are considered unable to estimate ET o at a certain grid
    cell and thus, are given a zero weight (Hamed et al. 2022). Lastly, the final
    ranking of all 40 models is based on the value of I x , which denotes the performance
    capability of each method in calculating ET o for the entire Iraq. Results Correlation
    between ET o of the Standard FAO-PM and Modeled ET o Figs. 2–4(a–an) show scatter
    plots of the referenced FAO-PM ET o against the estimated ET o of each empirical
    model for all considered grid points across Iraq’s three major climatic zones:
    MCZ, SCZ, and ACZ. The figures clearly illustrate that Rohwer, Szasz, and Penman
    are the best mass-transfer-based models to estimate the referenced FAO-PM ET o
    in all climatic zones, with a mean R 2 value of 0.97, 0.95, and 0.90, respectively.
    However, other mass-transfer-based models underestimated the referenced FAO-PM
    ET o , except for the Harbeck, Rohwer-2, and Romanenko models, which tended to
    overestimate the ET o values. Fig. 2. Scatter plots of the referenced (FAO-PM)

    WMO. For radiation-based models, Caprio, Jensen-Haise, McGuinness-Bordne, and
    Jones-Ritchie models obtained the best estimation results in this group, with
    a mean R 2 value of 0.90, 0.90, 0.88, and 0.85, respectively. Although some models
    like Makkink, Turc, Abtew, and Irmak-Rn overestimated the FAO-PM ET o values in
    MCZ, they produced fluctuating results, ranging from moderate to slightly underestimating
    the FAO-PM ET o values in SCZ and ACZ. It indicates that radiation-based equations
    perform comparatively well in semiarid and arid regions compared with the humid
    Mediterranean northern areas due to their high dependency on total solar radiation
    and mean air temperature. Other radiation-based models, including Modified Turc,
    Priestly-Taylor, Irmak-Rs, Irmak-Rs1, and Irmak-Rs2, were observed to underestimate
    the calculated FAO-PM ET o in all the climatic zones. Unlike most mass-transfer-based
    and radiation-based methods, all the temperature-based methods tended to overestimate
    the ET o values compared with the referenced FAO-PM ET o values, excluding the
    Hargreaves-Samani, Thornthwaite, Hargreaves-Samani1, and Hargreaves-Samani2, which
    underestimated the observed ET o values calculated from the FAO-PM method. The
    best-performing estimation models in the temperature-based category are Linacre,
    Kharrufa, and Hamon, with a detected mean R 2 of 0.90, 0.85, and 0.84 for all
    three climatic zones. Models such as Ravazzani and Linacre showed almost no significant
    correlation to the referenced ET o calculation method in the ACZ [Figs. 4(w and
    ac)]. Overall, mass-transfer-based formulas performed better than radiation-based
    and temperature-based ones. The Rohwer model estimation aligned better with the
    diagonal ∶ 1 ∶ 1 line [Figs. 2–4(am)]. Performance Assessment of ET o Empirical
    Methods Using Statistical Methods Figs. 5–8 illustrate the results of the spatial
    patterns of the long-term estimated ET o by the 40 empirical models using four
    statistical criteria methods (i.e., KGE, PBIAS, NSE, and RSR) at all the grid
    points in different climatic zones. The distribution maps demonstrate that among
    the 40 empirical equation models to estimate the ET o , the Kharrufa, Penmen,
    Rohwer, Jensen-Haise, and Caprio models performed well in MCZ, SCZ, and ACZ of
    Iraq. It is important to note that temperature-based models (i.e., Ivanov, Linacre,
    Ravazzani, Papadakis, and Trajkovic) and radiation-based models (i.e., Abtew,
    Irmak-Rn, Makkink, Jensen-Haise, and Turc) performed poorly in MCZ [Figs. 5–8(a,
    m, q, r, t, v, z, ac, al, and am)]. This might be due to the high sensitivity
    of those ET o models for air temperature and solar radiation in the MCZ compared
    with SCZ and ACZ. Also, it can be related to wind speed in the mountainous area,
    which did not consider in all these radiation-based and temperature-based methods,
    except for Modified Turc (Table 1). Accordingly, the Modified Turc performed well
    in the MCZ compared with other parts located in SCZ and ACZ. Fig. 5. Spatial distribution

    Trajkovic; (am) Turc; and (an) WMO ET o models of the study period 1959–2021 in
    Iraq. In contrast, other radiation-based models (i.e., McGuinness-Bordne, Jones-Ritchie,
    Irmak-Rs, Irmak-Rs1, and Irmak-Rs2) and temperature-based models (i.e., Hamon)
    performed in the MCZ much better than in the SCZ and ACZ [Figs. 5–8(h, i, n, o,
    p, w, and ad)]. The relative performance of these models requires further analysis
    to determine their significance. Thus, quantitative statistics of all models versus
    the standard FAO-PM model for estimating daily ET o in the study area from 1959
    to 2021 have been computed. The mean statistical results are described in the
    following subsections. Mass-Transfer-Based ET o Equations Table 3 presents the
    statistical analysis results of the 13 evaluated mass-transfer-based methods and
    compares them with the FAO-PM formula. The results from the table showed that
    the Rohwer formula had the best performance ( KGE = 0.84 mm / day , NSE = 0.92
    , RSR = 0.27 , and PBIAS = − 8.92 % ) among the mass-transfer-based methods, followed
    by Penman ( KGE = 0.75 mm / day , NSE = 0.77 , RSR = 0.46 , and PBIAS = 6.36 %
    ). Furthermore, Harbeck and Rohwer-2 equations provided the greatest overestimation
    average KGE of 1.57 and 1.43 mm / day and the highest average error RSR of 3.04
    and 2.96. On the other hand, the Albrecht and Szasz equations yielded the least
    underestimated average KGE of 0.25 and 0.21 mm / day and the lowest average error
    RSR of 1.04 and 1.09. The results demonstrated that other models such as World
    Meteorological Organization (WMO), Mahringer, Dalton, Trabert, Meyer, Brockamp-Wenner,
    and Romanenko had mostly poor performances among this group with the average KGE
    of − 0.15 , − 0.10 , − 0.05 , − 0.08 , − 0.08 , 0.14, and − 0.55 mm / day , respectively.
    Overall model performances indicated that Rohwer, Penman, Albrecht, and Szasz
    performed well with the minimum mean error and bias compared with other mass-transfer-based
    models in this group of study area. Table 3. Statistical performance of the 13

    is the mean value of all grid points over Iraq. Radiation-Based ET o Equations
    The statistical analysis results of the 13 assessed radiation-based methods against
    the FAO-PM model across all grids in Iraq are presented in Table 4. The results
    showed that Caprio ( KGE = 0.66 mm / day , NSE = 0.54 , RSR = 0.58 , and PBIAS
    = 24.64 % ) showed the best relative performances among the radiation-based models
    for estimation ET o in all the climatic zones of Iraq. According to the attained
    results of Table 4, the Jensen-Haise is the second-best method with KGE = 0.63
    mm / day , NSE of 0.47, error RSR of 0.62, and PBIAS of 29.08%. Turc, Jones-Ritchie,
    Abtew, and Irmak-Rn models obtained performance ranging from satisfactory to poor
    with average KGE values of 0.49, 0.46, 0.36, and 0.26 mm / day , respectively.
    However, the ET o calculated by Priestley-Taylor and Makkink formulas were the
    worst matched with the ET o estimated by the FAO-PM formula with the highest bias
    rate ( PBIAS = − 80.35 % and − 76.46 % ). Irmak-Rs, Irmak-Rs 1, Irmak-Rs 2, Modified
    Turc, and McGuinness-Bordne also performed poorly, as indicated by the high percentage
    of error ( RSR = 1.09 , 1.09, 1.15, 1.11, and 1.01) and high bias ( PBIAS = −
    43.17 % , 60.70%, − 49.10 % , − 57.04 % , and − 49.10 % ), respectively. Therefore,
    results suggested that Caprio and Jensen-Haise were the best radiation-based options
    to compute ET o in the different climatic zones of the study area. Table 4. Statistical

    methods for all cell grids in Iraq by comparing them with that from the FAO-PM

    , RSR = 0.45 , and PBIAS = 4.22 % ) among the temperature-based models, followed
    by Linacre ( KGE = 0.45 mm / day , NSE = 0.14 , RSR = 0.87 , and PBIAS = 49.42

    underestimated the FAO-PM ET o by average KGE values of 0.27, 0.24, and 0.10 mm
    / day , respectively. Besides, Hargreaves-Samani, Hargreaves-1, and Hargreaves-Samani-2
    methods heavily underestimated ET o , with average KGE = − 0.16 , − 0.25 , and
    − 0.12 mm / day , and PBIAS = – 25.20 % , − 20.11 % , and − 20.91 % . Other models,
    including Trajkovic, Ravazzani, and Ivanov, produced poor statistical results,
    which overestimated the FAO-PM ET o values (Table 5). Table 5. Statistical performance

    0.48 mm / day and NSE = − 3.50 ) and Schendel ( KGE = − 1.96 mm / day , NSE =
    − 12.81 ) highly overestimated the referenced ET o . Hence, they had by far the
    worst performances among the ET o temperature-based methods evaluated, as indicated
    by the relatively high error ( RSR = 2.07 and 3.65) and bias ( PBIAS = 49.42 %
    and 168.81%) statistical values in all climatic zones, particularly in MCZ (Figs.
    5 and 6). Thus, Kharrufa, Linacre, and Baier-Robertson had the best estimation
    results in the temperature-based models to compute ET o in all climatic zones
    of Iraq. Ranking of ET o Models The ET o was calculated using 40 empirical formulas
    at each grid point across Iraq and then compared with the standard FAO-PM ET o
    using the KGE. The ET o models have been ranked from 1 to 40 at each grid cell.
    Seven top models were chosen from the 40 models based on KGE. Fig. 9(a) illustrates
    the first-ranked ET o models at each grid point in different climatic zones over
    Iraq. More than 37% of the grid points in MCZ, SCZ, and ACZ showed the mass-transfer-based
    Rohwer as the best-performing model. Penman was the second-best-performing model
    (about 22% of grids) in MCZ, SCZ, and ACZ. Temperature-based Kharrufa was ranked
    first in (more than 10% of grids) mostly lying in the SCZ and ACZ, whereas the
    radiation-based Caprio was ranked first in (22% of grids) located primarily in
    the ACZ. The radiation-based Jones-Ritchie and McGuinness-Bordne were ranked first,
    mainly in the MCZ, at approximately 7% and 2% of the total grids, respectively.

    at different grid cells in Iraq. In addition, Fig. 9(b) shows the second ET o
    top models at each grid point across Iraq. The figure showed that the mass-transfer-based
    Rohwer was the second-best-performing model (about 35% of all grids) distributed
    in three major climatic zones over Iraq. More than 20% of grids, mostly in SCZ
    and ACZ regions, exhibited Penman as the second-best-performing model. The temperature-based
    Kharrufa was ranked the second-top model by about 14% in all the climatic zones.
    Likewise, the radiation-based Jensen-Haise was ranked the second-best by 14%,
    but it was mostly observed in the ACZ of Iraq. Approximately 12% of total grids
    displayed the radiation-based Caprio as the second-best-performing model in the
    three major climatic zones. Only a few grids in the MCZ, representing nearly 3%
    and 0.3% of total grids, demonstrated that Jones-Ritchie and McGuinness-Bordne
    were the second-best-performing models. Ranking of ET o Models for All of Iraq
    Table 6 presents the top three ET o models from different categories detected
    by MCGDM appropriate for calculating ET o for Iraq. The table indicates that Rohwer
    (mass-transfer-based) was ranked first among all ET o methods evaluated in the
    study area, with an I x value of 459.58, representing about 64% of total grid
    points. The mass-transfer-based Penman ( I x of 325.77 equal to about 45%) and
    the temperature-based Caprio ( I x of 302.18 representing about 42% of grids)
    had the second and third top models. Among the mass-transfer-based methods, Rohwer
    performed best, followed by Penman and Szasz, with I x values of 459.58, 325.77,
    and 64.15 for these three models, respectively. Table 6. Ranking of the best three

    Kharrufa had the best performance ( I x of 272.24), followed by Linacre ( I x
    of 92.77) and Baier-Robertson ( I x of 49.73). Table 7 illustrates the overall
    ranking of the 40 models for estimating ET o in Iraq. The Rohwer model was the
    top-ranked estimating ET o method in this study. The Penman, Caprio, Kharrufa,
    Jensen-Haise, Turc, Jones-Ritchie, Linacre, Szasz, and Baier-Robertson were ranked
    the from 2 to 10, respectively. The last five models were Papadakis, Romanenko,
    Rohwer-2, Harbeck, and Schendel. Therefore, the mass-transfer-based models’ rankings
    were better than all other groups of ET o models, as explained by the result of
    I x values for Rohwer and Penman, which had the highest performance compared with
    the other 38 models. The radiation-based models performed noticeably better than
    the temperature-based models, which had the worst performance. Table 7. Ranking

    Discussion The results of this paper bridge the knowledge gap and address the
    urgent need to distinguish the best alternative empirical model for precisely
    estimating ET o with minimum climatic data requirements in three major climate
    regions of Iraq. The study is the first published attempt to evaluate the performance
    of 40 ET o empirical models throughout literature and over Iraq to determine simplified
    estimates of ET o using reliable statistical metrics. The study used the MCGDM
    approach to overcome the limitation of applying different statistical metrics
    for ranking ET o models at various grid points, often producing contradictory
    results. Also, the study provides detailed information about performance variations
    in the empirical ET o models validated to the standard FAO-PM method applicable
    under different climate conditions. Obtained results indicated that Rohwer is
    the most accurate ET o estimation model in the diverse climatic conditions of
    Iraq. The results revealed the strongest correlation between the modeled Rohwer
    and referenced FAO-PM daily ET o across Iraq, as indicated by the highest mean
    coefficient of determination R 2 of 0.97 (ranging from 0.96 to 0.98) compared
    with other models. The results of other statistical metrics demonstrated that
    the mean KGE = 0.84 and NSE = 0.92 values were close to the optimal value of 1,
    and it had a mean bias (PBIAS) equal to − 8.92 % and small error of RSR = 0.27
    , which was close to the optimal value of zero. It indicates that Rohwer achieved
    the best correlation with the lowest bias and variability of model performance.
    In addition, the Rohwer model had the highest I x value of 459.58 based on the
    MCGDA method, representing about 64% of the total Iraqi lands. Accordingly, after
    the FAO-PM model, the Rohwer is the most suitable model for calculating ET o in
    most Iraq, especially in SCZ and ACZ. It is a significant result for the study
    area because it is not mentioned in the literature. The outcome of the present
    paper also concurs with the results of Singh and Xu (1997), who studied 13 mass-transfer-based
    models in the northwestern parts of Canada and stated that the Rohwer was the
    best mass-transfer-based model to estimate ET o in different climatic zones. It
    is also consistent with obtained outcomes of Yang et al. (2021), who assessed
    18 models by comparison with pan evaporation at diverse climatic zones in China
    and recommended Rohwer as the only mass-transfer-based model to calculate ET o
    accurately. Hence, it concluded that the Rohwer model is an alternative model
    for the standard FAO-PM model under different climatic conditions in Iraq. Furthermore,
    results found that the Penman of mass-transfer-based was the second top model
    in three major climatic zones, with an I x value of 325.77, corresponding to almost
    45% of the grid points. The results showed that Penman had a mean R 2 of 0.90
    (ranging from 0.86 to 0.97), with a mean KGE, PBIAS, NSE, and error of RSR corresponding
    to 0.75, 0.77, 6.36%, and 0.46, respectively. The outcome of this study largely
    agrees with other research conducted in other regions. For instance, Muniandy
    et al. (2016) assessed the performance of 26 models using eight statistical metrics
    at the Senai station in Malaysia. They indicated that Penman had performed the
    best among other ET o models. Muhammad et al. (2019) also evaluated the 31 ET
    o empirical models in peninsular Malaysia using four statistical tests. They reported
    that the mass-transfer-based Penman model was the best ET o model in terms of
    performance. Numerous researchers have considered Penman most applicable model
    for estimating ET o (Oudin et al. 2005; Ahmadi and Javanbakht 2020). Therefore,
    this study suggested that the mass-transfer-based Rohwer and Penman models can
    be valid alternatives for estimating daily ET o instead of the referenced FAO-PM
    model with the limited number of required data inputs in different climatic zones
    in Iraq. The performance of the top ET o models varied spatially across the country.
    The spatial distribution of ET o showed Rohwer as the best-performing model in
    about 40% of the grid points over all three climatic zones (MCZ, SCZ, and ACZ),
    especially in the west and southwest (Fig. 9). Penman showed superior performance
    in determining ET o in the eastern and northeastern regions. Accordingly, Penman
    was the second-best-performing model in nearly 22% of grids located in all climatic
    zones using the KGE. It shows that Rohwer and Penman models are suitable for estimating
    ET o in different climatic regions of Iraq. In contrast, the radiation-based Caprio
    was ranked first in about 22% of grids located predominantly in the ACZ, particularly
    in the south, which has semiarid and arid climatic conditions. It is due to the
    heavy reliance of the input data of this model on solar radiation and air temperature.
    The best-performing temperature-based model was Kharrufa, which ranked first in
    around 11% of total grids, located in the SCZ and ACZ in the middle of the country.
    Although there has been poor performance of temperature-based models, Linacre
    and Baier-Robertson were the second and third top ET o models in this category.
    The spatial distribution maps of the statistical metrics exhibited that out of
    the 40 ET o models, 10 temperature-based and radiation-based models, including
    Ivanov, Linacre, Ravazzani, Papadakis, Trajkovic, Abtew, Irmak-Rn, Makkink, Jensen-Haise,
    and Turc, had poor performance in MCZ compared with their moderate performance
    in the SCZ and ACZ. Yet, 6 out of the 40 ET o models, namely, Hamon, McGuinness-Bordne,
    Jones-Ritchie, Irmak-Rs, Irmak-Rs1, and Irmak-Rs2, were identified to perform
    well in the MCZ. Analysis revealed that the radiation-based Jones-Ritchie and
    McGuinness-Bordne were ranked the first models in the only MCZ based on the KGE
    at nearly 43% of grids in MCZ and 9% of the total grids. It indicates that those
    radiation-based models are applicable in the Mediterranean climate, which is a
    crucial finding in the considered study area of Iraq. Therefore, in addition to
    the Rohwer and Penman models, both Jones-Ritchie and McGuinness-Bordne models
    can be appropriate for calculating ET o in the MCZ of the northern region. Among
    these 40 models, the Hamon, Baier-Robertson, Blaney-Criddle, Thornthwaite, Modified
    Hargreaves-Samani1, Modified Hargreaves-Samani2, Hargreaves-Samani, Makkink, Modified
    Turc, Priestley-Taylor, McGuinness-Bordne, Irmak-Rs, Irmak-Rs2, Dalton, Meyer,
    Trabert, Brockamp-Wenner, Mahringer, Albrecht, and WMO equations underestimated
    the referenced daily ET o at most of the grid points. This finding agrees with
    the outcomes of other studies undertaken in different regions. For instance, Tabari
    et al. (2013) showed that the Mahringer, Dalton, WMO, Trabert, and Meyer formulas
    systematically underestimated the ET o values in Iran, with a mean error of 31%,
    14%, 44%, 26%, and 14%, respectively. Ngongondo et al. (2013) also evaluated the
    Hargreaves-Samani, FAO-PM, and Priestley-Taylor models for estimating ET o in
    southern Malawi. They found that the Hargreaves-Samani and Priestley-Taylor models
    underestimated the calculated ET o values, which is mainly consistent with the
    result of this study. Djaman et al. (2015) assessed the performance of 16 ET o
    models in Senegal and concluded that the Makkink equation underestimated ET o
    . Ahmadi and Javanbakht (2020) indicated that Thornthwaite, Priestley-Taylor,
    and Makkink equations underestimated ET o values in southwestern Iran. On the
    contrary, ET o overestimation by some of these models was identified in other
    climatic zones. For example, Djaman et al. (2017) measured 12 ET o models’ performance
    in Tanzania and Kenya under humid climates. They concluded that the Dalto, Albrecht,
    Meyer, and Brockamp-Wenner ET o methods overestimated the calculated daily ET
    o for all climate stations. Muhammad et al. (2019) reported that the Hamon, Blaney-Criddle,
    Hargreaves-Samani, Priestley-Taylor, McGuinness-Bordne, Irmak-Rs, and Brockamp-Wenner
    models overestimated the calculated ET o in Malaysia. The present study also found
    that Schendel, Ivanov, Papadakis, Ravazzani, Trajkovic, Irmak-Rs1, Irmak-Rn, Rohwer-2,
    Harbeck, and Romanenko overestimated the daily ET o in most of Iraq. It is similar
    to the result of Djaman et al. (2015), who stated that Tralkovic and Ravazzani
    systematically overestimated ET o under the Sahelian conditions in Senegal. However,
    the Harbeck and Schendel models were ranked the last models in this study using
    the MCGDA approach. The obtained result of this study confirms the conclusion
    of Tabari et al. (2013) on the poor performance of the Schendel model in estimating
    ET o in the humid climate of Iran. The outcomes of this study indicated that the
    sensitivity of these formulas to the specific meteorological parameters utilized
    in models might have led to performance variations of each model. The ET o equations
    of temperature-based (Kharrufa, Linacre, Baier Robertson, and Hamon), radiation-based
    (Caprio, Jensen-Haise, Turc, Jones-Ritchie, McGuinness-Bordne, and Abtew), and
    mass-transfer-based (Rohwer, Penman, and Szasz) models showed overall good performance
    at different grid points in the study area. These models were ranked the best
    13 out of 40 models based on the MCGDA method (Table 7). However, Rohwer and Penman
    ranked the best-performing and second-best-performing models. Accordingly, the
    results suggested that the mass-transfer-based models performed the best compared
    with temperature-based and radiation-based models in different climatic zones
    of Iraq. It implies that climatic factors, including wind speed, relative humidity,
    mean temperature, and surface pressure, might significantly influence ET o estimation
    because the mass-transfer models depend heavily on these meteorological variables.
    This is supported largely by Ahmadi and Javanbakht (2020), who evaluated the performance
    of 17 empirical and physical ET o methods in the southwest of Iran close to the
    Iraqi borders. They reported that the mass-transfer-based models, particularly
    the Penman (1948) model, performed better than the examined temperature-based
    and radiation-based models, which produced unsatisfactory results. Contrary to
    this finding of the present study, Sobh et al. (2022) reported that the performance
    results of most radiation-based models were better than the mass-transfer-based
    and temperature-based models, except for Penman (1948) in the arid climate in
    Egypt. It is important to mention that the Rohwer model uses two equations to
    estimate ET o throughout the literature. In the present study, Rohwer refers to
    the formula employed by Tabari et al. (2013). However, Rohwer-2 represents the
    equation applied by Muhammad et al. (2019) (Table 1). Moreover, although some
    empirical models were originally utilized for estimating ET o or PET, this paper
    aimed to assess these models to explore their applicability for determining ET
    o in the study area. The present study did not evaluate the considered 40 empirical
    models based on the ET o calculated using pan evaporation, lysimeter, or eddy
    covariance for Iraq due to the lack of the necessary long-term record data for
    the study area. Therefore, it was beyond the scope of the study. The study suggests
    building a long-term reliable climatic data record for estimating ET o in Iraq.
    It recommended that calibration versions using some calibrated methods at the
    local scale can help to enhance the accuracy of the best models for estimating
    ET o with limited data in this study, which need further exploration and consideration
    in future research for practical applications. Furthermore, the study suggests
    employing other available observatory and gridded climate data to reproduce the
    simulated and referenced ET o to provide a deep insight into the associated uncertainty
    with estimated ET o in the study area. Besides, using the MCGDM methodology to
    rank the best model is suggested to reduce the possible contradictory results
    combined with the ranking ET o models. One of the key strengths of this study
    is the use of more than 60 years of long-term data, extending from 1959 to 2021,
    which have helped to enhance the performance of the selected empirical ET o models
    and consider the climate change impacts in the region. Also, the performance evaluation
    conducted in this study can duplicate in neighboring countries sharing similar
    climatic environments as Iraq to select the best alternative ET o estimation model
    with the minimal required weather data. It can be possible by utilizing the freely
    accessible global ERA5 data set. The obtained outcomes can help a profound understanding
    of the best appropriate empirical methods for accurately estimating ET o , which
    can enhance agricultural water management in various climatic zones of Iraq. Conclusions
    The present study assessed the performance of 40 empirical ET o models using five
    quantitative statistical tests to select the best alternative model for estimating
    daily ET o to the globally endorsed FAO-PM model over diverse climate regions
    of Iraq. The standard FAO-PM and simulated ET o were studied using the most recent
    European reanalyzed ERA5 data from 1959 to 2021 for each grid point in the Iraqi
    territory. The main findings of this study are in the following points: • The
    present study indicated that the mass-transfer-based Rohwer and Penman are suitable
    alternative models for calculating ET o to replicate the FAO-PM model with the
    minimum required meteorological data in different climatic zones in Iraq. It is
    helpful to address the problem of restricting the applicability of the FAO-PM
    method due to limited, incomplete, or poor data observation records for the necessary
    inputs in many areas of Iraq. • The Rohwer, Penman, Jones-Ritchie, and McGuinness-Bordne
    models are the best for estimating ET o in the Mediterranean climate across the
    northern region of the study area. • The ET o formulas of Caprio, Kharrufa, Jensen-Haise,
    Turc, Jones-Ritchie, Szasz, Abtew, Baier-Robertson, FAO Blaney-Criddle, Linacre,
    and Hamon had a performance ranging from good to moderate in the diverse regions
    of Iraq. • The Harbeck and Schendel models had the worst performance for estimating
    ET o in Iraq. • The mass-transfer-based models performed best, followed by the
    radiation and temperature-based models. It indicates that meteorological data,
    namely mean wind speed, air temperature, and relative humidity, might be more
    influential on ET o estimation than other parameters. The study recommends that
    any ongoing or future governmental measures to overcome the problem of water scarcity,
    such as the development of effective irrigation management, water-use efficiency,
    and advanced agricultural technologies in the Iraqi agriculture sector, should
    rely on an accurate and uncomplicated estimation of ET o . Developing a reliable
    empirical ET o model for the study area is recommended for future research. In
    the future, other gridded climate data can be used to rank ET o models to validate
    the ranking obtained in this study. Besides, the coefficients of the best-performing
    models can be calibrated for different climate zones to improve the efficiency
    of the models in estimation ET o in Iraq. Precise measurements of ET o remain
    vital for the optimal use of irrigation efficiency in Iraq. Overall, the findings
    offer a deep understanding of the reliable selection of empirical ET o models
    in various climatic zones and a scientific reference for accurate agrometeorology,
    sustainable agriculture, and efficient irrigation use in Iraq. Notation The following

  description: The Food and Agriculture Organization recommends that the Penman–Monteith
    Method contains Equation 56 (PMF) as a widely accepted standard for reference
    evapotranspiration (ETo) calculation. Despite this, the PMF cannot be employed
    when meteorological variables are constrained; therefore, alternative models for
    ETo estimation requiring fewer variables must be chosen, which means that they
    perform at least as well as, if not better than, the PMF in terms of accuracy
    and efficiency. This study evaluated five machine learning (ML) algorithms to
    estimate ETo and compared their results with the standardized PMF. For this purpose,
    ML models were trained using monthly time series climatic data. The created ML
    models underwent testing to determine ETo under varying meteorological input combinations.
    The results of ML models were compared to assess their accuracy and validate their
    performance using several statistical indicators, errors (root-mean-square (RMSE),
    mean absolute error (MAE)), model efficiency (NSE), and determination coefficient
    (R2). The process of evaluating ML models involved the utilization of radar charts,
    Smith graphs, heatmaps, and bullet charts. Based on our findings, satisfactory
    results have been obtained using RBFFNN based on M12 input combinations (mean
    temperature (Tmean), mean relative humidity (RHmean), sunshine hours (Sh)) for
    ETo estimation. The RBFFNN model exhibited the most precise estimation as RMSE
    obtained values of 0.30 and 0.22 during the training and testing phases, respectively.
    In addition, during training and testing, the MAE values for this model were recorded
    as 0.15 and 0.17, respectively. The highest R2 and NSE values were noted as 0.98
    and 0.99 for the RBFNN during performance analysis, respectively. The scatter
    plots and spatial variations of the RBFNN and PMF in the studied region indicated
    that the RBFNN had the highest efficacy (R2, NSE) and lowest errors (RMSE, MAE)
    as compared with the other four ML models. Overall, our study highlights the potential
    of ML models for ETo estimation in the arid region (Jacobabad), providing vital
    insights for improving water resource management, helping climate change research,
    and optimizing irrigation scheduling for optimal agricultural water usage in the
    region.

    climatic data Graphical Abstract 1. Introduction Providing water to dry and semi-arid
    regions has become a worldwide challenge. As the global population rises, countries
    seek new and improved water supply management methods [1]. Improving water management
    systems and quantitatively scheduling irrigation is crucial to addressing water
    scarcity issues. Irrigation scheduling, which may be calculated based on evapotranspiration
    (ET), refers to providing crops with the ideal quantity and timing of water. ET
    comprises water evaporation into the atmosphere from the soil surface, groundwater
    table’s capillary fringe, and land-based water bodies. Water flow from the ground
    to the atmosphere through plants is also included in ET [2]. ET can be directly
    estimated using lysimeter, eddy covariance system, surface renewal, flux variation
    and Bowen ratio methods. The high initial, continuing, and maintenance costs of
    these methods hinder ET estimation [3,4,5]. Therefore, indirect methods are used
    to quantify ET. The indirect methods use empirical models, categorized into temperature-based,
    radiation-based, and mass-transfer-based. Including an estimate of the reference
    evapotranspiration (ETo) is a basic factor in the empirical models. The difficulty
    in ascertaining the ET for each individual crop is the underlying factor contributing
    to this issue. Hence, indirect methods are used to estimate ETo and crop coefficients,
    which are further utilized to quantify ET for individual crops of interest. The
    Penman–Monteith (PMF) approach, first introduced by Allen in 1998 and subsequently
    validated in several climatic conditions [4,6], is now endorsed by the Food and
    Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations and the American Society
    of Civil Engineers (ASCE) committee. In order to complete PMF ETo calculations,
    it is important to possess a comprehensive meteorological data collection for
    several places around the globe. Although the relative importance, interdependence,
    and interrelationships among the components were previously unclear, recent studies
    provided ML-based projections of the PMF ETo using a substantial amount of meteorological
    data [7,8]. Ravindran et al. [9] employed the PMF using the available meteorological
    data to calculate ETo and then compared it with a deep neural network (DNN) model
    that only takes sun radiation (Rn) as an input parameter [9]. Zhou et al. [10]
    investigated the efficacy of machine learning (ML) models, namely deep factorization
    machine (DeepFM), gradient boosting with categorical feature support (CatBoost),
    light gradient boosting (LightGBM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and gradient
    boosting decision tree (GBDT), for estimating the ETo. Basagaoglu et al. [7] determined
    that Rn is the most important meteorological variable for determining ETo in a
    semi-arid location. However, sunshine hours (Sh) might be substituted when Rn
    is unavailable. The analyses of previous studies revealed that Sh exhibits a closer
    association with Rn than the other meteorological variables and can be used in
    the absence of Rn [11,12,13]. The current study used the Sh variable in the analysis
    for ETo estimation because of the deficiency in the Rn factor. A major barrier
    in ETo estimation using the PMF is the unavailability of several meteorological
    variables and uncertainty in collected data [14,15]. Despite the availability
    of critical climatic variables, a scarcity of automated weather stations installed
    at specific sites necessitates the presence of climatic data in numerous locations.
    Additionally, the use of obsolete weather stations raises issues with data quality.
    Data calibration is required since the sensor’s inconsistent performance exposes
    several variances. In this scenario, the inconsistency of ETo estimates opens
    the door for developing alternative techniques that use fewer inputs to calculate
    ETo similarly or at least approach the PMF. Several studies have been conducted
    that demonstrate an analogy between proposed models based on meteorological data
    and the PMF. These studies aim to provide alternate ways for ETo estimates because
    of the frequent absence of meteorological variables [16,17,18,19]. Despite this,
    ML based on various algorithms (cuckoo, water wave optimization, coactive neuro-fuzzy
    inference system, decision support system) has become popular for ETo modeling
    in comparison with empirical equations (the PMF, Hargreaves, Turc, Jensen–Haise,
    Hargreaves–Samani) using limited climatic data [20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28]. The
    ML models provided good output (ETo) that approached the corresponding empirical
    equation (PMF) because the optimal selection of input variables against the output
    factor by adding or eliminating an input variable is considered the main advantage
    in increasing the efficacy of input versus output relation [29,30,31,32,33,34,35].
    The subject of ETo modeling using ML has gained significant attention in recent
    academic studies, raising interest among hydrologists and meteorologists across
    different countries. Yin et al. [36] calculated daily ETo in a Hilly interior
    watershed in northwest China and found support vector machines (SVMs) worked best
    using daily meteorological data. Wen et al. [37] compared ML with four empirical
    models in an arid region of China and found temperatures (minimum and maximum)
    as effective parameters for ETo estimation. Wang et al. [38] analyzed the efficacy
    of two ML models, namely gene expression programming (GEP) and artificial neural
    networks (ANNs), in the Karst area of Guangxi Province located in China, for calculating
    daily ETo. The research showed that ML outperformed with fewer meteorological
    inputs. Sanikhani et al.’s [39] study showed that the monthly ETo in the Isparta
    and Antalya region (Turkey) was successfully quantified by employing ML models
    using limited (temperature) data. In an arid region (Sistan and Baluchestan Province)
    of Iran, Pour et al. [40] used ML with varying input climatic combinations and
    found that the ML model (SVM) exhibited superior performance in comparison with
    the other models for the estimation of ETo. In Jiangxi Province (China), Wu et
    al. [41] examined the efficacy of ML models using cross-station and synthetic
    data to measure monthly mean daily ETo and concluded that tree-based ML outperformed
    other models. Daily ETo using limited climatic data was estimated by Saggi and
    Jain [42] in Punjab province, India. They found deep learning exhibited superior
    performance compared with the other models. Similarly, Shiri et al. [43] found
    good performance of ML for ETo estimation using 29 weather stations in Iran. Tikhamarine
    et al. [44] compared five ANN-based meta-heuristic algorithms (gray wolf optimizer,
    multiverse optimizer, particle swarm optimizer, whale optimization algorithm,
    ant lion optimizer) to estimate monthly ETo using limited data in the Uttarakhand
    State (Himalayan Region) of India and found that gray wolf optimizer performed
    well in comparison with the targeted empirical (valiantzas) model. Likewise, Ferreira
    et al. [45] found that the performance of ML (ANN, GEP) models was good and close
    to the PMF with minimal climate data in several regions of Brazil. Granata [46]
    estimated ETo using climate data collected from eddy covariance (EC) flux tower
    stations set up at a location (Floral City) in central Florida with a humid subtropical
    environment and found that the chosen ML models were capable of ETo modeling with
    limited input data in the studied area. Keshtegar et al. [47] compared tree-based
    and ANN-based ML models with polynomial chaos expansion and the response surface
    method in the Mediterranean region (Isparta and Antalya) of Turkey for estimating
    ETo. Likewise, Nourani et al. [48] estimated ETo using climatic data in different
    climatic regions across five countries (Turkey, NC, Iraq, Iran and Libya) by employing
    ML ensemble based models and found ANN based ML performed good in comparison to
    other models. Shiri [49] used limited climatic input in ML models for estimating
    ETo in an arid region of Iran, and comparison results with six empirical equations
    showed the supremacy of the chosen ML model. Recent advances have made it easier
    to access weather records, yet a lack of meteorological data persists in many
    locations. Raza et al. [50] systematically reviewed research articles on ETo estimation
    using ML under Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
    (PRISMA) guidelines and suggested the comparison of ML algorithms for ETo using
    fewer inputs, especially in developing countries (Pakistan) due to the lack of
    climatic data. When conventional methods (like the PMF) cannot be used because
    of excessive input demands or the unavailability of climatic parameters like Rn
    [36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49], the task of improving methods that
    rely on fewer climatic inputs and developing ML models for ETo estimation with
    minimal climatic records becomes of great relevance. Kushwaha et al. [51] concluded
    that ML might capture time series data without discretization when handled correctly
    and be able to estimate ETo accurately. Similar findings were obtained by Wu et
    al. [52] in the Poyang Lake basin in southern China, Roy et al. [53] in the Gazipur
    District in Bangladesh, Ahmadi et al. [54] in the arid and semi-arid climate of
    Iran, Sattari et al. [55] in the Corum province of Turkey, and Malik et al. [56]
    in the Uttarakhand State of India in comparison with the empirical (PMF) method
    for ETo modeling. Meteorologists have always monitored the conditions of the atmosphere
    that impact the weather, but over time the equipment they use has changed. As
    technology advanced, our scientists began to use more efficient equipment to collect
    and use weather data. These technological advances enabled meteorologists to make
    better predictions faster than ever before. These instruments include Doppler
    radar, Satellite data, Radiosondes, Automated surface-observing systems, and AWIPS
    (NOAA’s Advanced Weather Information Processing System). The current study obtained
    climatic data of Jacobabad Meteorological Observatory (JMO) from the Regional
    Meteorological Center (RMC) Karachi. It is the official meteorological department
    which is run by the Pakistani government. The current study obtained climatic
    data (1987–2016) of Jacobabad Meteorological Observatory (JMO) from the Regional
    Meteorological Center (RMC) Karachi, Pakistan. According to Germanwatch, the environmental
    NGO, Pakistan is the eighth most vulnerable country to extreme weather due to
    climate change. Natural catastrophes, including floods, droughts, and cyclones,
    have been catastrophic in recent years, resulting in hundreds of deaths, millions
    of displaced people, and extensive property damage. Jacobabad is an arid city
    in the province of Sindh, Pakistan. The city’s administration is split into eight
    different Union Councils. The average summer temperature is 37 °C, while the winters
    are mild, with an average temperature of 7.7 °C. Precipitation in the city ranged
    from a high of 838.7 mm in 2022 to a low of 3.3 mm in 1922, with an annual average
    of 122.5 mm between 1991 and 2020. During the South Asian heat wave in 2022, the
    average monthly temperature recorded was 43 °C (109 °F), including four days of
    temperatures equal to or above 50 °C. People in Jacobabad moved during the city’s
    hottest months (June–August) to avoid the oppressive heat. City heat-reduction
    services need personal care from government sectors. Being higher in elevation,
    Quetta (the northern side of Pakistan) is more appealing to locals during the
    warmer summer. Access to clean water in Pakistan is unreliable and costly because
    of widespread shortages and significant infrastructure problems. Consequently,
    monitoring and managing agricultural water usage in this arid region is crucial.
    With the recent development in ETo modeling based on ML algorithms using less
    climatic data, the current study explores five ML algorithms’ performances for
    estimating ETo in the arid region (Jacobabad) of Sindh province, Pakistan. The
    main goal of this study is to determine effective climatic variables for ETo estimation.
    In the current study, a total of 17 different input models were initially formulated
    based on different combinations made by using the meteorological inputs which
    are mainly used in the PMF for ETo estimation. We tried to accurately estimate
    ETo with limited climatic data and the best input combination to calculate ETo,
    which can be used as an alternative to the PMF in Jacobabad. The novelty of this
    study is that a comparison of five ML algorithms, namely Iterative dichotomizer
    (ID3), gradient boosting (GB), Random forest (RF), multilayer neural network (MLNN),
    and radial basis function neural network (RBFNN), for ETo estimation using less
    climatic data is not yet explored in an arid region (Jacobabad) of Pakistan. In
    a nutshell, the following are three objectives of this study: ETo estimation using
    five ML (ID3, GB, RF, MLNN, and RBFNN) algorithms. Identifying an effective combination
    of meteorological inputs for ETo estimation. Performance evaluation of ML algorithms
    through visualization (radar, heatmap, bullet, and Smith graphs) based on different
    statistical indices to determine the best one among them. The findings of the
    current study practically contributed in a way that the ETo retrieved from the
    ML model may be interpolated into monthly and yearly ETo maps depicting ETo variations
    over the studied area. Agronomists, hydrologists, and agricultural engineers may
    use the ETo maps to more accurately determine the water needed to irrigate the
    crops (via drip and spray irrigation). 2. Study Area and Dataset Pakistan lies
    between moderate to scorching climatic zones [52]. Temperatures vary widely from
    location to location, but the climate is generally arid, with scorching summers
    and frigid winters. The current study obtained climatic data of Jacobabad Meteorological
    Observatory (JMO) from the Regional Meteorological Center (RMC) Karachi (weblink:
    https://rmcsindh.pmd.gov.pk/, accessed on date 15 August 2023). The observatory
    (index number 41715) installed by the RMC is situated at a latitude of 28°18′,
    longitude of 68°28′, and altitude of 56 m (Figure 1). Table 1 displays a summary
    of 30 years (1987–2016) of climatic variables obtained from the RMC. Furthermore,
    Figure 2a,b present monthly and interannual changes in the climatic variables
    utilized in the present study. Figure 2a shows a notable trend wherein the minimum
    temperature (Tmin) exhibited an initial increase from January to July, followed
    by a slow decline until December. The observed pattern in Tmax was consistent,
    as shown in Figure 2a. The fluctuation in seasons can be attributed to the solar
    radiation emitted by the sun, as depicted in Figure 2a. Sh witnessed the summer’s
    peak and the beginning of winter’s decline. The variable RHmean exhibited a relationship
    with both Tmax and Tmin, as it was seen that the periods of elevated air temperature
    coincided with the highest levels of humidity. According to the data presented
    in Figure 2a, the average relative humidity (RHmean) exhibited its maximum values
    throughout July to September, which can be attributed to the impact of wind, and
    there could be much more important meteorological reasons, such as the atmospheric
    circulation pattern together with the surrounding ocean and topography of the
    selected regions. During the summer season, it can be observed from Figure 2a
    that there is an upward trend between wind speed and humidity levels in the air.
    The summer months exhibited the most notable rise in average and maximum humidity
    levels. In addition, Figure 2b indicates cyclical conditions of climatic variables
    starting from 1 January to 31 December for the years 1987 to 2016. Figure 1. Map
    indicating the location of Jacobabad District (highlighted in red) within the
    Sindh province of Pakistan. Figure 2. (a) Monthly variations in climatic and ETo
    variables obtained from JMO, RMC, Karachi. (b) Interannual variations in climatic
    and ETo variables obtained from JMO, RMC, Karachi. Table 1. Summary of 30 years
    (1987–2016) of climatic data obtained from Jacobabad weather station installed
    by the RMC. Physical–Geographical Conditions Jacobabad is geographically situated
    in a manner that it shares its boundaries with three provinces concurrently. These
    provinces include the Rajanpur District of Punjab Province and the Nasirabad district
    of Balochistan Province. The Indus River influences the district, resulting in
    direct effects on the Kashmore and Kandhkote Tehsils. The Guddu Barrage in the
    Kashmore Tehsil serves as the point of origination for historical water channels,
    such as the Pat feeder canal. The total land area of Jacobabad district is 2686
    square kilometers. The district encompasses Kacha communities residing in the
    Kandhkote and Kashmore Talukas, occupying extensive land parcels on both banks
    of the Indus River. The agricultural output of the Kacha region is limited to
    Rabi crops due to the annual flooding of the river during the summer. The investigated
    site exhibits varied topography and variations in elevation, resulting in significant
    variations in evapotranspiration values. The gradual decrease in elevation from
    Kashmore to Jacobabad and its surrounding areas has not obstructed the river’s
    continuous flow. The Indus River has facilitated social and agricultural development
    by watering and feeding the surrounding landscape, enabling the cultivation of
    crops twice a year without the need for fallow periods. During the Kharif season,
    most of the paddy is harvested and rabbit crop wheat is sown, both of which need
    a lot of water. Nevertheless, the issues of floods and salinization have emerged
    as significant challenges, resulting in detrimental effects on agricultural land
    and a decline in crop productivity. Attempts to mitigate the prevailing circumstances
    involve implementing drainage systems and excavation activities aimed at reducing
    the water table. However, despite such efforts, the situation continues to progressively
    deteriorate. The management of sewage systems is a prevalent concern across the
    western bank, necessitating the implementation of a siphon mechanism to divert
    the flow of wastewater towards the left bank. 3. Study Methodology 3.1. PMF The
    CROPWAT software version 8.0 from the FAO of the United Nations was used to compute
    the ETo using meteorological input values. The PMF approach was used to determine
    the value of ETo in this software (Weblink: https://www.fao.org/land-water/databases-and-software/cropwat/en/,
    access date, 20 September 2023). The PMF developed by Allen et al. [4] in 1998
    determines ETo values based on a combination of meteorological and aerodynamic
    parameters (es, ea, emin, emax, Δ, G, and Ɣ). The mathematical notation of the
    PMF is described as follows: 𝐸𝑇 𝑜 = 0.408∆( 𝑅 𝑛 −𝐺)+𝛾× 900 𝑇 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 +273 ×𝑊𝑠×( 𝑒
    𝑠 − 𝑒 𝑎 ) ∆+Ɣ(1+0.34𝑊𝑠) (1) where: ETo is measured in mm/day; Rn = net radiation
    at the surface (MJ/m2/day); G = soil heat flux density (MJ/m2/day); Tmean = air
    temperature at 2 m height (°C); es = saturation vapor pressure (kPa); ea = actual
    vapor pressure (kPa); Δ = slope of vapor pressure curve (kPa/°C); γ = psychrometric
    constant (kPa/°C); Ɣ = 0.000665 × p (kpa); es is saturation vapor pressure (kPa);
    Ws = wind speed. 3.2. Proposed ML Framework PMF ETo was used as the benchmark
    for output (ETo) values when chosen ML algorithms were applied. For this purpose,
    we used Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) software version 3.9.4.
    It is a collection of machine learning algorithms for data mining tasks. It contains
    tools for data preparation, classification, regression, clustering, association
    rules mining, and visualization. It is an open-source software issued under the
    GNU General Public License (weblink: https://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/, accessed
    date, 5 August 2023). Weka was used in this study, and the following steps were
    implemented. The dataset used was pre-processed in the first step (1). The data
    file was prepared in comma-separated values (CSV) file format (2), and it was
    uploaded to Weka software by using the import feature (3). The optimal parameters
    related to ML algorithms were selected (4), data were classified (5), and the
    nearest neighbor was chosen as the estimation function (6). In the cross-validation
    process, K-means clustering was utilized (7), association rules were performed
    (8), and, in the last step, the model was evaluated (9). A schematic framework
    of the ML models suggested for ETo estimation is shown in Figure 3. Figure 3.
    Proposed framework of ETo estimation used in current study. 3.2.1. Iterative Dichotomizer
    (ID3) The ID3 algorithm relies heavily on the measurement of entropy and information
    gain. Both entropy (E) and information gain (IG) may be defined in terms of the
    predicted decrease in entropy (Purity) and the homogeneity (H) of a learning set
    (Impurity), respectively. E and IG may be written in general mathematical form
    using Equations (2) and (3), respectively. If p is the fraction of S in class
    i, then both terms are provided by Equations (4) and (5) in the discrete case.
    E=−A log 2 A−B log 2 B (2) IG= S b − S a (3) (E) b = ∑ i=1 k − p i log 2 p i (4)
    (IG) b = ∑ i=1 k p i 2 (5) where Sb is the entropy of distribution before the
    split, Sa is the entropy of distribution after the split, (E)b is the entropy
    for the k-wise classified function, and (IG)b is the information gain for the
    k-wise classified function. The decision model may benefit significantly from
    simplification by following the top-down greedy (TDG) search process. The TDG
    process is straightforward and consists mainly of two parts. Using the provided
    data, initial calculations for each characteristic are made. Second, we determine
    a function that optimally divides the node. The TDG procedure and the depth of
    the resulting tree are also critical factors in the categorization of datasets.
    The ideal value of each characteristic is evaluated and then used to divide the
    tree node. The E and IG are then compared for each characteristic. The property
    with the highest IG and lowest E value is chosen as the root node’s primary identifier.
    IG aims to create a hierarchy in which attributes are ranked from top to bottom,
    starting at the root node. There is currently insufficient evidence to conclude
    that the attribute present in each node with a greater value of IG and a lesser
    value of E is adequate to establish a root node. This hierarchy aims to facilitate
    the desired moderation of the decision-making process. As a result, we created
    a forest of little trees with shallow roots. A smaller tree facilitates faster
    dataset identification. We chose the attribute with the highest E and IG values
    from the training data and assigned it to the root node. We created smaller subsets
    of the training data that were assembled into a larger whole. Each attribute value
    should be consistent across all datasets used to create the subset. Recursion
    happens until a child node has been formed for each branch. Ultimately, we compared
    the recorded attribute values to the original attribute. 3.2.2. Gradient Boosting
    (GB) Gradient boosting is a method through which a prediction function is increased
    by repeated use. After that, we add each function’s output according to its relative
    importance. By taking this measure, prediction will get closer to accuracy, and
    errors will be eradicated. Because of this helpful property, GB is often represented
    as a linear model. The ability of this approach to decouple dependent and independent
    variables is a significant plus. Equation (6) is a numeric representation of the
    GB model, and it is written as predicted target = Fo + B1 × T1 (X) + B2 × T2 (X)………………+
    Bm × Tm (X) (6) where Fo is the starting value in the series, X is the vector
    of “pseudo-residual” values remaining at this point in the series, Tx(X) represents
    the trees fitted to the pseudo-residuals (here, x = 1, 2, 3…….m), Bx is the coefficient
    of the tree node predicted values (here, x = 1, 2, 3…….m). The boosting procedure
    will use a primary tree ensemble mechanism, as seen in Figure 4. It has been discovered
    that a succession of three trees is connected. Tree 2 receives the residual values
    that Tree 1 produces. Likewise, the values of Tree 2’s residuals may be found
    in Tree 3’s structure. Furthermore, there is no apparent connection between Trees
    1 and 3. This procedure was repeated until every relevant data subset was included
    in the phase. Next, the weighting index of each tree is added to the dataset,
    and the misclassification error is calculated. Figure 4. Construction of linking
    tree process in the boosting mechanism. There are several ID3-style trees inside
    a GB ML algorithm. Each of these supplementary trees is connected to the others.
    Thus, there is a link between the neighboring trees. So, it is a chain of trees
    connected. In this investigation, we explored the following applications of the
    GB algorithm: (i) The climate predictor variables and their corresponding input
    parameters. (ii) Misclassification errors that occurred during model calibration
    were eliminated using the Huber loss function and the surrogate splitter technique.
    The K-type classification was employed for dataset segregation, partitioning it
    into k and k−1 subsets. Following multiple trials and an error-based approach,
    tree numbers for the GB model at minimum and maximum level were allocated to create
    a series that enables ensemble processing. The k-test subsets were thoroughly
    tested, with the k-1 subset serving as a means for instruction. The overall ETo
    value was predicted by averaging the values from the various subsets. 3.2.3. Random
    Forest (RF) The bagging technique is a collection of untrained decision trees
    utilizing bootstrap samples. The underlying structure of the method used to build
    the RF model may be grasped quickly. Treat the whole dataset as if it were N observations.
    Select the desired subset of N observations from the data collection. Bagging
    is the term for this operation. Some observations are utilized many times in the
    bagging process. Thus, not all of them are included in the analysis. Two-thirds
    of a data collection is often sampled, with the other third classified as “out
    of bag” (OOB) information. Each tree is built using a random subset of the available
    data. The data from the chosen rows are then used to construct a decision tree.
    It is intriguing to learn that, unlike the ID3 and GB models, the RF model does
    not need tree pruning. The bagging procedure is performed recursively until all
    trees have been built. Only a subset of the available predictor variables is used
    when building a tree. Each node’s potential splitter is chosen randomly from this
    collection of predictor factors. For instance, if there are six predictor variables,
    three will be selected randomly to be used as splitter candidates. Nonetheless,
    the uninvolved variables might be utilized for another node split in the same
    tree. Not all of the predictor variables have to be used in the separation. Thus,
    some predictor variables may need to be used throughout a tree’s structure. This
    procedure is repeated until a wooded area has been established. After a subset
    has been chosen, the scoring process involves cycling over each tree in the forest
    in turn with each data row. The scoring method generates projected values that
    are used in the development of terminal nodes. Using several techniques, the RF
    model yields accurate predictions in regression and classification analyses. When
    doing a regression analysis, the typical score predicted by all trees is determined.
    The “votes” for the best variable in a classification study come from the variables
    predicted for each tree. The most popular predictor variable is used to provide
    a score for each row in the tree. There are two forms of randomness in an RF algorithm.
    First, a subset of rows from the data is used as an input for each tree, and then
    a predictor variable is utilized to determine how to divide up the nodes in the
    tree. These supplementary characteristics significantly boost the RF model’s overall
    predictive accuracy when added to forecasts. The following procedures were used
    to create the TF model for this investigation: Climatic variables were chosen
    as predictors/inputs. The sample data constituted 70% of the total dataset, separated
    using the randomization function. Analysis was performed using dataset (OOB),
    and residual values were stored separately. The ETo obtained from each tree as
    output was gathered and stored. The mean values of the output variable (ETo) were
    computed as a whole. Figure 5 shows the procedure for using ML algorithms that
    make decisions. As a starting point, we feed in data on temperature ranges, humidity
    averages, wind speeds, and sunshine totals. Separate sets of data, known as train
    and testing, were created. Second, we tuned ideal parameters to improve the performance
    of the ID3, GB, and RF algorithms used to calculate ETo. Table 2 overviews the
    best possible ID3, GB, and RF parameters. Figure 5. Stepwise process for tree-based
    ML models on ETo modeling. Table 2. Tuned values of parametric variables for decision-based
    ML algorithm. 3.2.4. Multilayer Neural Network (MLNN) An input layer, a hidden
    layer, and an output layer make up the MLNN architecture. There are a certain
    number of neurons in each layer, all of which communicate in the same way. Predictor
    variables from the previous layer are stored in each neuron, as are the number
    of outputs to the next layer. The structure’s overall effectiveness depends on
    the contributions of each layer. Weights establish the precise nature of the connections
    between neurons in different layers. The results are supposed to be carried by
    these kilos from one layer to the next. Each neuron in the input layer sends its
    output to a corresponding neuron in the hidden layer. Just as the output of one
    neuron in the hidden layer becomes the input of another neuron in the output layer,
    the reverse occurs in the output layer. Figure 6 depicts an MLNN architecture
    with a single hidden layer. The input layer neurons are all linked to one another
    in the hidden layer, while the hidden layer neurons are only linked to one another
    in the output layer. Input and output layers do not have any “direct” connections
    between their neurons. The name “feed-forward neural network model” comes from
    the unidirectional nature of the data flow it facilitates. The following procedures
    were used to determine ETo using the MLNN: Figure 6. General structure of the
    MLNN for input–output relationship. Climate-related input variables were chosen
    as predictors. Sigmoid and linear activation functions were used in the input-hidden
    and hidden-output layers. The weight connection between interconnected neurons
    was adjusted via the adoption of a back-propagation procedure. The kernel functions
    utilized were Traditional Conjugate Gradient (TCG) and Scaled Conjugate Gradient
    (SCG). The ETo was estimated as an output. 3.2.5. Radial Basis Function Neural
    Network (RBFNN) There are three distinct layers in the RBFNN: the input, the hidden,
    and the output. Simply put, the input layer is made up of a large number of neurons
    that are linked to the hidden layer through weighted connections. These weights
    convey the values from one layer to the next. The input layer neurons utterly
    unconnected to one another form the output layer. Both a hidden layer and an output
    layer need linear and transfer functions. Activation functions are another term
    for these mathematical operations. A parametric vector accompanies the neurons
    in the buried layer. This vector, known as the hidden layer’s center, may be considered
    a weighted index. The distance between an input vector and the hidden layer’s
    center is quantified using the Euclidean distance (E). The RBFNN network used
    in this analysis was developed as follows. We used V-fold cross-validation to
    ensure the integrity of the dataset, tuned the RBFNN network to optimal performance
    by selecting a population size of 200 and a maximum generation of 20, and used
    the radial basis function’s activation function in both the hidden and output
    layers. Figure 7 depicts a schematic representation of the RBFNN algorithm used
    in this investigation, illustrating the input–output link between climate variables
    and ETo. Figure 7. Schematic diagram of RBFNN for ETo estimation. 3.2.6. Selection
    of Meteorological Input Combinations A total of 17 meteorological input combinations
    were used as input, which are tabulated in Table 3. It can be perceived that M1
    contains inputs Tmin, Tmax, RHmean, Ws, and Sh for ETo estimation. When M2 is
    used to estimate ETo, ML algorithms (ID3, GB, RF, MLNN, and RBFNN) with the RHmean
    and Sh variables are considered as inputs. Likewise, Table 3 provides information
    on the other 15 input combinations (M1 through M17) in the same format as M1 and
    M2. Previous research evaluated the performance of the ML algorithms using various
    statistical criteria [40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,50]. The ML algorithms’ performance
    using all 17 input combinations was measured using the statistical indices root-mean-square
    error (RMSE), determination coefficient (R2), mean absolute error (MAE), mean
    bias error (MBE), and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). 𝑅 2 = ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ∑ n i=1

    to estimate ETo. R2 is the goodness-of-fit parameter, which may be from 0 to 1.
    It is a number between −1 and 1 that has no dimensions. A correlation coefficient
    near 1 indicates a strong association. The MSE calculates the average squared
    deviation between observed and anticipated values. When comparing errors between
    experimental and anticipated values, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is often
    utilized. Model performance improves when the MSE, RMSE, and NRMSE values decrease.
    The NSE index is a regularly used goodness of fit statistic to evaluate a model’s
    effectiveness. The NSE may be measured from −1 to 1. Lower RMSE and MAE values
    and greater R2 and NSE values indicate a superior model. 4. Study Results Figure
    8, Figure 9, Figure 10 and Figure 11 show the findings as several statistical
    indices (RMSE, R2, MAE, and NSE). The 30-year, 360-record dataset was split into
    training (252 records) and testing sets (108 records). Each ML model’s performance
    accuracy over all seventeen scenarios was evaluated using the testing set. The
    training set was utilized for calibration and model development. The ETo estimated
    with the PMF was used as the standard for assessment of both decision-based and
    neural network-based ML algorithms. Figure 8. Selection of the best AI model via
    a bullet chart (MAE, RMSE, and MBE unit: mm/day). Figure 9. Heatmap-based strategy
    for selecting the AI model (MAE, RMSE, and MBE unit: mm/day). Figure 10. The identification
    of the best AI model for the implementation of a radar chart (MAE, RMSE, and MBE

    of a Smith graph (MAE, RMSE, and MBE unit: mm/day). The study considered various
    meteorological variables’ possible combinations (M1 = Tmin, Tmax, RHmean, Ws,
    Sh to M17 = Tmean, Ws) to determine their impact on ETo prediction. The performance
    of ETo prediction was evaluated by adding and removing different meteorological
    variables. The interpretation of the performances was based on a combination of
    statistical indicators and graphical approaches. Figure 8 presents the performance
    evaluation of ML models using bullet charts. The structure of statistical metrics
    for each model in the training and testing phases is provided. It is worth mentioning
    that all the ML models created attained high levels of accuracy. Nevertheless,
    after scrutinizing the NSE and R2 values, it can be deduced that the RBFNN algorithms
    and the M12 and M13 combinations showed the highest precision. Likewise, examining
    the RMSE and MAE values, it was concluded that the M12 combination exhibited the
    lowest error rate and yielded the most precise prediction results using the RBFNN
    ML algorithms. In Figure 9, the selection of the optimal ML model is evaluated
    through performance metrics and addressed with heatmap representations. Different
    data densities represent different levels of relationship and measurement. The
    combinations M1, M5, M6, M7, M10, M11, M12, M13, and M14 exhibit similar and satisfactory
    levels of prediction accuracy based on R2 and NSE values. However, the highest
    prediction for ETo was achieved using RBFFNN algorithms. When evaluating ML model
    performances based on RMSE and MAE error metrics, the suitable input combination
    was found to be M12. Additionally, the model combinations M1, M11, M12, and M13
    stand out for their low RMSE and MAE and high accuracy (NSE and R2) as compared
    with other input combinations. Furthermore, when the optimal algorithm is considered,
    the RBFNN algorithm was tested to yield the highest prediction performance. According
    to this, the optimal model has RMSE values of 0.30 during training and 0.22 during
    testing. Additionally, the MAE values for this model are 0.15 during training
    and 0.17 during testing. When examining the R2 and NSE values, they were observed
    to be 0.98 during the training phase and 0.99 during the testing phase. Figure
    10 shows the performance evaluation of the ML models for ETo prediction using
    radar charts. When evaluating the R2 and NSE values, it is observed that the models
    M1, M5, M6, M7, M11, M12, M13, and M14 exhibit high prediction accuracy, with
    the RBFNN algorithm achieving the highest accuracy. The GB algorithm is also successful
    as a second-degree model. On the other hand, the highest error (RMSE and MAE)
    was obtained with the ID3 algorithm. When performing a performance analysis based
    on RMSE values to determine the optimal model for ETo prediction, the RBFNN model
    emerges as the model with the lowest error. The second-best ML model is identified
    as GB, followed by GB and ID3. Additionally, analyzing the MAE values reveals
    that the algorithm with the lowest error is the RBFNN, while the second-best ML
    model was RF, followed by GB and ID3. Overall, RMSE and MAE obtained the highest
    in the case of ID3 ML algorithms. Input and output values may be visually converted
    using a Smith chart. A planar grid is constructed for this purpose, allowing the
    output value to be calculated for a particular input. The Smith Chart is only
    a plane with circles superimposed on top to determine the results of each independent
    variable. In Figure 11, the Smith chart further supports the abovementioned results
    and explains the efficiency (R2, NSE) and error (MAE, RMSE) of the applied ML
    models. The Smith chart is a particular kind of impedance chart that has parallel
    series of lines. Lines in the first set, called constant resistance lines, display
    mutual tangency along the right side of the horizontal diameter and form circles.
    Constant resistance (j) circles are the conventional name for these spherical
    formations. The values of the resistances represented by the j circles are shown
    on the horizontal diameter where the circles connect with the line. The circle
    of positive resistance is shown on the top side of the horizontal line, while
    the circle of negative resistance is shown on the bottom side of the horizontal
    line. It is observed in Figure 10 that statistical indices (R2, NSE, MAE, and
    RMSE) of the ML models lie on the top side of the horizontal line, which corresponds
    to the positive value ranging between 0 and 1. In addition, it was noted that
    the RBFNN approaches 1 for R2 and NSE while MAE and RMSE decline to 0, indicating
    the superior performance of the RBFNN as compared with other applied ML models.
    Figure 12 shows a scatter plot and temporal variation by comparing ETo estimated
    with the RBFNN using the M12 input combination (best model) and standardized PMF
    in the training and testing phases over the studied region. It is clearly observed
    in Figure 11 that RBNN trailed well with the PMF and could be used in cases of
    limited climatic input data. In addition, Figure 13 indicates temporal variation
    in ETo estimated with the RBFNN and PMF from 1986 to 2016 in the training and
    testing phases. It can be concluded that the RBFNN algorithms performed well and
    coincide with the ETo values of the PMF. Figure 12. Comparison of ETo estimated
    with RBFNN using M12 input combination (best model) and standardized PMF. Figure
    13. Temporal variation in ETo estimated with RBFNN and PMF from 1986 to 2016 in
    training and testing phases. In addition, the MBE captures the average deviations
    between two datasets. It has the units of the variable. Values near 0 are the
    best; negative values indicate underestimation and positive values indicate overestimation.
    Moreover, RMSE combines the spread of individual errors. Figure 8, Figure 9, Figure
    10 and Figure 11 indicate that the MBE produced by ML models at all the 17 input
    climatic combinations found nearly zero, which indicated the superior performance
    of the chosen ML models. The results also affirmed the use of ML models in cases
    of limited climatic data because there is no underestimation and overestimation
    found in the dataset. It can also be confirmed that the dataset used in the current
    study has no missing values and no abnormality was detected during data analysis.
    5. Study Discussion Within the scope of the presented study, various machine learning
    models were evaluated to the peak for the estimation of ETo values. Accordingly,
    the RBFFNN model had the highest accuracy and ID3 showed the weakest prediction
    success. It was deduced that the Tmean, RHmean, and Ws input variables had the
    highest effect on ETo estimation. Pal and Deswal [57] employed the M5 model tree
    method to model daily ETo in the climatic data of Davis station, which California
    maintains. The inputs for the model were solar radiation, average air temperature,
    average relative humidity, and average wind speed. The M5 model tree model successfully
    predicted meteorological data and ETo values, as evidenced by the results of this
    research. The outputs of this research support the presented study. The study
    conducted by Vaz et al. [58] employed machine learning and deep neural networks
    to construct a model for evapotranspiration, utilizing only a limited number of
    weather variables, including temperature, humidity, and wind. The presented research
    coincides with this research, as both establish the Random forest algorithm’s
    potential to provide satisfactory outputs for ETo estimation. Also, LSTM-ANN recommends
    a hybrid approach for ETo estimation. The estimation of ETo has been predicted
    by Wang et al. [59] through the utilization of a combination of time granulation
    computing techniques and gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) with Bayesian
    optimization (BO). Subsequently, GBDT is deployed to anticipate evapotranspiration,
    while BO determines the optimum hyperparameter values from the pared-down granules.
    The study’s findings align with current research, indicating that the GB algorithm
    substantiates the sufficiency of ET prediction. The effectiveness of various types
    of ML algorithms, including tree-based, neural network-based, multifunction-based
    algorithms, and a combination of ML and physical models, have been investigated
    in predicting hydrological variables (ETo, river discharge, precipitation, monitoring
    droughts) and their related factors [60,61,62,63,64,65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74].
    Wang et al. [59] analyzed temperature data from several different climatic stations
    located in Pakistan [60]. The TB model produced outperforming results (R2 and
    NSE = 1.00, MAE and RMSE = 0.26 and 0.37) when an input combination based only
    on temperatures (Tmax and Tmin) was used. The study’s outputs support the current
    study in terms of tree-based algorithms showing high performance in ETo model
    estimation. However, ETo estimation established only with the maximum and minimum
    temperatures does not overlap in delivering the highest performance. In the current
    research, Tmean, RHmean, and Sh were critical indicators of ET0 in our study.
    The study’s findings supported the assertion made by [75] that increased air moisture
    content causes relative humidity to have greater impacts in wet locations; as
    a result, when the aridity index increases, air moisture content is constrained,
    and its effects are less. Temperature and relative humidity were discovered to
    be the most important predictors of ETo in a study conducted by Estévez et al.
    [76]. Eslamian et al. [77] investigated the effect of weather parameters on ETo
    estimation in Esfahan province. The study concluded that Tmin, Sh, and RHmean
    found effective parameters on ETo estimation in this region. Similarly, it was
    observed by [45] that climatic variables related to RHmean significantly influenced
    the ML modeling of ETo. Including RHmean in ML models increased performance by
    up to 24%. These earlier observations support our finding in the selection of
    the best input combination. However, it is recommended to employ ML over empirical
    and locally calibrated models in cases where climatic data are unavailable, inconsistent,
    or of poor quality. Calibration of ML models in the training phase is critical
    to avoid over- or underestimation of ETo values. ETo is underrated with more training
    data, but it is overestimated with less training data. The use of ML models requires
    a sufficient amount of input data for good calibration. Therefore, in order to
    test the efficacy of the ML models, the current study evaluated ML models using
    various set of climatic variables. The data requirements for ETo estimation using
    the PMF and ML models are displayed in Table 4. The PMF may be observed in Table
    4 to depend on numerous characteristics that are difficult to obtain, especially
    in the Sindh and Balochistan areas (underdeveloped provinces of Pakistan). As
    an alternative to the PMF approach, ML models use fewer parameters that yield
    ETo-value approaches to the PMF which aid in crop scheduling and irrigation planning.
    In Table 4, the parameters required for ETo estimates are denoted by “▀▀”, while
    “X” denotes that they were not employed in the corresponding method. Sabino and
    Souza [78] indicated that changes in solar radiation, relative humidity, and wind
    speed are the main driving forces that impact the ETo. In addition, RHmean and
    Ws have higher sensitivity indices during the dry season, which is also affirmed
    in our study area as it is arid in nature. Table 4. Data requirements for ETo
    estimation using PMF and ML models. 6. Conclusions This study evaluated the performance
    of various decision tree-based machine learning models for estimating ETo values
    at the Jacobabad, Sindh, Pakistan station. It also aims to analyze the effect
    of various model input combinations on the ETo prediction. Model performances
    were evaluated according to Smith chart heatmap, radar chart, and bullet chart
    results. As a result of the analysis, M2 (RHmean, Sh), M3 (RHmean, Sh, Ws), M4
    (RHmean, Ws), M8 (Tmax, Tmin, RHmean, Sh), M9 (Tmean, RHmean, Sh), M15 (Tmean,
    RHmean), and M16 (Tmean, Sh) model combinations exhibited lower levels of prediction
    success compared with the remaining model combinations. When evaluating model
    performances based on statistical criteria, the most suitable model combination
    is M12 (Tmean, RHmean, Ws). In general, satisfactory results have been obtained
    in the models where WS and T values are used together as inputs for ETo estimation.
    The RBFFNN model, which exhibits the most precise estimation results, demonstrates
    RMSE values of 0.30 during the training phase and 0.22 during the testing phase,
    according to the findings. In addition, during training and testing, the MAE values
    for this model are 0.15 and 0.17, respectively. The R2 and NSE value analysis
    revealed that they were 0.98 and 0.99 in the training and testing phases, respectively.
    The conducted analyses have provided empirical evidence indicating that the ID3
    model demonstrates relatively inferior performance in comparison with alternative
    models. Limitations, Suggested Improvements, and Future Directions The suggested
    ETo ML models can only be used in the research area and only with the available
    meteorological data. Therefore, it is required to design comparable or innovative
    ML models using less or similar meteorological data to examine how well the established
    ML models function in various places. In addition, the present study’s suggested
    ETo model must be calibrated and appropriately trained before being used in other
    locations. Furthermore, ML does not have physical processes, and the user is just
    aware of the input and the anticipated output of the model. Therefore, developing
    an appropriate ML model is complex without understanding functional criteria.
    Because the dataset was divided at random, over-fitting and under-fitting issues
    may arise during the ML model’s training and calibration. The following steps
    for this research will include developing further ETo models using EM and ELM
    that consider a more comprehensive range of climate types (from humid to desert)
    and, if applicable, the impacts of climate change. Since extensive and trustworthy
    data on ETo modeling is necessary for successfully planning, managing, and controlling
    water resource systems, gap-in-filling strategies must be actively pursued. Regional
    models are critical because they develop local models in regions with little data.
    Crop water needs (CWRs) may be used to manage crucial data about ground and surface
    water resource planning and management, regional water use analysis, water allocation,
    water consumption, and water rights. Water resource planning for seasonal variation
    (summer, winter, autumn, and spring) can benefit from estimating ETo in different
    months for determining CWRs. While this study focused on arid climates, future
    research should include other climate types to examine climatic variability in
    greater depth. Author Contributions Conceptualization, A.R., R.F. and N.R.S.;

  description: Overapplication of nitrogen fertilizer and water in vegetable production
    is popular and serious in China and other developing countries, leading to severe
    environmental pollution. To date, most model-based decision support systems, which
    are believed to be powerful tools for improving fertilizer and water management
    in vegetable production, have been established by developed countries, and the
    weather, soil, hydrology, facility type and vegetable species of developing countries
    have been less considered. In this study, a water level component and a new vegetable
    species, pakchoi (Brassica campestris ssp. Chinese) were incorporated into EU-Rotate_N,
    a simulation model developed by the European Union for open field vegetable cultivation.
    The experiment was carried out in typical vegetable plastic tunnels in Jiangsu
    Province, China, an area with high groundwater level. The results indicated that
    the water level algorithm which differentiate the soil into saturated and unsaturated
    layers enhanced the model simulation accuracy of the soil nitrogen and water content
    in the 30 cm soil layer, indicating the significant influence of groundwater on
    the soil water and nutrient movement. The pakchoi experiment suggest that new
    vegetables could be added into the crop list of EU-Rotate_N by adjusting parameters
    with ‘trial and error’ methods after considering its biological characteristics.
    Furthermore, a novel module was added for recommendations of fertilization and
    irrigation on daily basis in accordance with reasonable upper and lower thresholds
    of soil water content and soil available nitrogen after a series of adjustment.
    Finally, a user-friendly application (APP) was developed based on the improved
    model. The evaluation experiments in 2021 and 2022 showed that APP could significantly
    improve nitrogen and water use efficiency without obvious yield loss in pakchoi
    production. We conclude that simulation models for vegetable fertilizer and water
    management established by developed countries could be modified by several operable
    steps to expand its application area.

    Vegetables are essential daily agricultural products for people''s lives. To date,
    the global cultivation area of vegetables has reached 110 million ha (FAO, 2022),
    and this area is expected to increase with the growth of the global population.
    Due to the high demand for nitrogen (N) nutrients in most vegetable crops, the
    N fertilizer application rates in vegetable fields are often 3–5 times higher
    than those in grain crops (Diao et al., 2013, Geng et al., 2021). However, the
    N use efficiency (NUE) of harvested vegetables is only 20–50% of the applied N
    in China (Gu et al., 2020). In some intensive vegetable production systems, such
    as Chinese plastic greenhouses, the quantities of N fertilizer application and
    N loss are even greater than the average level (Yan et al., 2014). The long-term
    excessive application of N fertilizers has resulted in nutrient imbalances, secondary
    soil salinization, serious N leaching and greenhouse gas emissions, poor soil
    microbial communities and other problems, which seriously limit sustainable vegetable
    production (Zhang et al., 2020). On the other hand, most vegetables have high
    water content and need frequent irrigation during cultivation (Yao et al., 2019).
    Unreasonable irrigation also leads to low water use efficiency and N leaching
    (Wang et al., 2019). Soil testing and nutrient balance strategies are widely used
    to determine appropriate fertilizer formulas for grain crop and vegetable production
    (Celestina et al., 2019). However, due to abundant varieties and cultivars, flexible
    planting and harvesting schedules and nonstandardized production methods of vegetables,
    the practical application of these precise fertilization technologies mentioned
    above in vegetables is not as efficient as in other cereal crops (Gu et al., 2020).
    Compared with precise fertilization, precise irrigation is even more underappreciated
    in vegetable production (Incrocci et al., 2017). To date, most so-called smart
    fertilization or irrigation systems for vegetables in China depend on soil nutrient
    and water sensors or even experience. However, it has been reported that sensor-based
    fertilization and irrigation systems are not comprehensive enough to accurately
    meet the nitrogen and water requirements of crops (Wang et al., 2019, Zhu et al.,
    2022). For optimal nutrient and water management, abundant factors regarding soil,
    climate, plant characteristics, and field management need to be considered. Simulation
    models and model-based decision support systems (DSSs) are powerful tools that
    can process diverse and large amounts of data to provide fertilization and irrigation
    recommendations for vegetable cultivation. To date, a number of model-based DSSs
    have been developed for vegetable production in different areas of the world.
    For irrigation management, CROPWAT and AQUACROP from FAO, IRRINET and GSHEN in
    Europe, and some DSSs provided by private advisory companies for local use in
    the USA have been reported (Cahn and Johnson, 2017). For fertilization, PLANET
    and CAL-FERT software (Incrocci et al., 2013) have been adopted to guide N application
    in different countries. In recent years, fertigation technology has been increasingly
    used for vegetable cultivation, and a number of models considering both N and
    water management have been developed, among which VegSyst-DSS (Gallardo et al.,
    2011, Gallardo et al., 2016) and GeCoN (Elia and Conversa, 2015) are good examples.
    Although many simulation models and DSSs have been developed, most of them have
    only been successfully applied in limited countries, states, regions or even smaller
    districts (Gallardo et al., 2020). To date, Europe and the USA have taken the
    leading position in research on nutrient and irrigation models and DSSs, and fertilization
    and irrigation management and decision systems developed in China and other developing
    countries are rare. Liang et al. (2020) developed a scientific water and N management
    tool, WHCNS_Veg, for intensive greenhouse vegetable production systems in China.
    However, the performance of this model in Middle-South China is not as good as
    in North China, where the model was calibrated and validated (unpublished data).
    In addition to the differences in climate, soil characteristics and growth methods,
    the diverse species of vegetables is another factor restricting the use of models
    in other regions. For example, pakchoi (Brassica campestris L. ssp. chinensis
    (L.) Makino. var. communis Tsen et Lee) is an important leaf vegetable in China.
    According to Miao and Wang (2021), the current growth area of pakchoi in China
    is approximately 0.8 million ha. The excessive application of N and water is common
    during pakchoi production and has resulted in serious soil degradation and environmental
    pollution (Zhou et al., 2010). Thus, it is urgent to design DSSs for nutrient
    and irrigation water management for pakchoi production in China. However, pakchoi
    is not commonly consumed in European and American countries. As a result, most
    models and DSSs developed by Western countries do not include pakchoi in their
    crop lists. EU-Rotate_N was developed with European Union funding as a tool for
    analyzing the effects of fertilization and irrigation practices on the N uptake
    of plants, soil N and water dynamics and N losses to the environment (Rahn et
    al., 2010). This comprehensive model considers root growth and distribution and
    N mineralization from various sources and requires more inputs and parameters
    than other models. As a result, the EU-Rotate_N model is considered to be too
    complex for practical crop management (Gallardo et al., 2020). On the one hand,
    the model provides more opportunities to incorporate new crops, fertilizers and
    field practices and more parameters for calibration. Therefore, this model shows
    greater adaptability than other models during the application. To date, the EU-Rotate_N
    model has been successfully applied to simulate N uptake, N losses and crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc) in different vegetable fields in China, Germany and other areas (Nendel,
    2009, Rahn et al., 2010, Guo et al., 2010, Sun et al., 2012, Suárez-Rey et al.,
    2019). In greenhouse fields growing cucumbers in northern China, the EU-Rotate_N
    model predicted nitrate leaching losses and N mineralization accurately under
    different fertilizer and water levels (Guo et al., 2010, Sun et al., 2012). In
    this study, a DSS application (APP) for aiding N fertilization and irrigation
    management of vegetable crops in a Middle-South China greenhouse was developed
    based on the EU-Rotate_N model. We made three improvements to the original model:
    1) A water level component was added to the model to consider the shallow groundwater
    level in southern China; 2) Pakchoi was added to the crop list, and its crop parameters
    were also determined according to the species characteristics and similar vegetable
    crops from the original model; 3) A fertilization and irrigation recommendation
    function was provided to recommend fertilizer dosage and water volume on a daily
    basis. The improved model was encapsulated with a graphical user interface and
    deployed on the server side. Planters can access this APP through mobile devices
    in the field. We hope the model and APP developed in this study will expand the
    application of EU-Rotate_N in China and other developing countres. 2. Materials
    and methods 2.1. Plant materials and growth conditions The commonly cultivated
    pakchoi (Brassica campestris ssp. Chinese) cultivar in China, “Shuzhouqing”, was
    used in this study (Fig. 1). The experiments were conducted in the vegetable base
    of Yangzhou University (32.29◦ N, 119.48◦ E), which is located in the Hanjiang
    District, Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province, China. This area is classified as having
    a typical subtropical humid monsoon climate. At the experimental site, the annual
    atmospheric nitrogen subsidence was approximately 22.7 kg/ha (Hua et al., 2022).
    The soil properties and meteorological data (https://www.tianqi.com/qiwen/yangzhou/)
    in 2018, 2021 and 2022 in the test plastic tunnels are listed in Table A.1 and

    2.2. Experimental design Three crops of pakchoi were included for model calibration
    and validation. According to the practice of local farmers, in the spring crop
    (cold season), two-leaf stage seedlings were transplanted with a spacing between
    plants of 20 cm. In the summer and autumn seasons (warm seasons), the seeds were
    directly sown, and the seeding rate was 17.6 kg/ha. The sowing, sampling and harvesting
    dates are shown in Fig. 2(a). The experiment was arranged in a typical plastic
    tunnel for vegetable production. The tunnel was oriented southnorth with a size
    of 50 m × 6 m. Six levels of N dosage, 0 kg/ha, 80 kg/ha, 160 kg/ha, 240 kg/ha,
    320 kg/ha and 400 kg/ha of N fertilizer, were set as N0, N1, N2, N3, N4 and N5,
    respectively. N, phosphorus and potassium fertilizers were provided as urea, calcium
    superphosphate and potassium sulfate, respectively. Calcium superphosphate (350 kg/ha)
    and potassium sulfate (400 kg/ha) were applied before planting or sowing. Due
    to the difference in the growth period, the total urea was distributed into three
    applications in the spring and only one application in the summer and autumn seasons
    respectively. Micro-sprinkle-irrigation systems were equipped for fertigation
    as shown in Fig. 1. The detailed date and dosage of N and water application are
    shown in Table A.3. The area of each plot (Fig. 2b) was 12.5 m2 (2.5 m × 5 m).
    Therefore, a completely randomized trial was performed with three repetitions.
    The arrangement of a total of 15 plots is shown in Fig. 2(c). The plots were separated
    by 50 cm deep plastic plates to prevent lateral movement of water and nutrients.

    sampling method. 2.3. Field sampling and laboratory analysis Weather data were
    observed by an automatic weather station (NHQXZ601, Wuhan Zhongke Nenghui Technology
    Development Co., Ltd., China) installed in the experimental tunnel. The station
    included a pyranometer (NHFS15B) for recording solar radiation and a ventilated
    aspirated psychcrometer (NH121WS-R) for measuring relative humidity and air temperature.
    The rainfall was negligible inside the tunnel. A water level sensor (YKKT-1E,
    Xian Xingyi Yibiao Technology CO., LTD, China) was also installed in the tunnel
    to monitor the groundwater level during the experiment. Soil samples from five
    sites (as shown in Fig. 2c) of each plot were mixed for the assay. Soil analysis
    was conducted following documented methods (Lu et al., 2000). Soil available nitrogen
    (SAN) was extracted with KCl and determined colorimetrically. The soil water content
    (SWC) was recorded with soil moisture sensors (MPM6861, MicroSensor, China), For
    each plot, one sensor was used to measure the soil water content at 5 different
    sites, and then the average value was calculated. (Fig. 2c). Before each measurement,
    all soil sensors were calibrated with soil moisture measurements (oven drying
    methods). Three soil layers, 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm and 20–30 cm, were sampled for
    SAN and soil water content assays. Water drainage was not observed in the field
    during the experiment. The fresh weight of the aboveground parts at the harvest
    stage was recorded as the yield (converted into kg/ha). The dry matter weight
    was determined by oven-drying representative samples at 72 °C until constant weight.
    Data of SAN, SWC, yield and dry matter weight were from three replications. Student’s
    t test was used for statistical comparison of yields between measured and simulated
    yields. Values of P < 0.05 (*) were considered significant differences. 2.4. Model
    inputs and calibration The EU-Rotate_N model has been described in detail by Rahn
    et al. (2010). The input data of this model (version 1.8) include the experimental
    site (latitude, altitude, atmospheric N deposition), simulated date, meteorological
    data, soil properties, initial conditions of soil water content and soil nitrogen,
    fertilization and irrigation practice, crop species and growth details. In this
    research, pakchoi is added to the crop table, and the crop parameters of the new
    vegetable are derived from a similar crop, spinach, in the original crop table.
    The treatment representative of local practices (N5 treatment) of the first crop
    was used for calibration. The parameters in the crop table for pakchoi are adjusted
    for SAN, SWC and yield using the ‘trial and error’ method (Boote, 1999, Wang and
    Huang, 2008, Ma et al., 2012), partially according to the empirical observation
    in the field. 2.5. Calculation of SWC with the improved groundwater level model
    Adopting a soil water balance function on daily basis and the normalized diffusion
    approach for capillary flow (Ritchie, 1998), the original EU-Rotate_N model accounts
    for the water content of 200 cm depth by 40 soil layers. However, due to the depth
    of groundwater in our research area is shallow, the soil saturated zone is usually
    within 1 m from the surface (Xie and Yang, 2013, Wang et al., 2014). Therefore,
    an improved groundwater level module is introduced to obtain the actual SWC for
    more accurate analysis of soil water and N movement (Wang et al., 2019). For the
    soil layer below the top boundary of the saturated zone, the SWC is calculated
    by the saturated water content, which can be determined by the soil texture. Meanwhile,
    for the soil layers within the unsaturated zone, it can be calculated mainly by
    the amount of irrigation, crop consumption and drainage following the original
    EU-Rotate_N model. With a groundwater monitor, the top boundary of the saturated
    zone can be obtained on a daily basis and then used to calculate the soil layer.
    By adjusting the soil layer where the saturated zone is located, the SWC can be
    modeled in the shallow groundwater area. The calculation of the soil water content
    is as follows：. First, we calculate the soil layer where the saturated zone is
    located according to the daily measured groundwater level (Eq. (1)). Then the
    soil water below this layer is assumed to be saturated and the soil water above
    it is estimated by the original EU-Rotate_N model with the meteorological data,
    irrigation data and fertilization data as input (Eq. (2)). According to the water
    balance function, the daily change in soil water can be calculated using Eq. (3).
    Water infiltration and redistribution in soil can be estimated by EU-Rotate_N
    model and the soil water change in the 1–18 soil layers (0–90 cm) can be calculated
    (Ritchie, 1998). Thereafter, the daily soil water content of different soil layers
    can be obtained. (1) (2) (3) SW_change = Irri +Dayrain- Runoff - ET- Leach Where
    h means the height of the groundwater level and the layer refers to the corresponding
    soil layer calculated in increments of 5 cm. L is the function of water content
    in soil layer L simulated by the improved model. SAT denotes the soil water content
    at saturation. M, W, and F represent the weather data, irrigation data and fertilization
    data required for the EU-Rotate_N model to simulate soil water and N content.
    SW_change refers to the daily change in soil water. Irri, Dayrain, Runoff, ET
    and Leach represent daily irrigation, rainfall, runoff, evapotranspiration, and
    leach, respectively. It is worthy noted that the SAN calculation is closely related
    to the SWC in EU-Rotate _N. Therefore, the simulated values of SAN were also altered
    after the improved groundwater level module was added. 2.6. Prediction methods
    for irrigation and fertilization The EU-Rotate_N model can simulate the water
    and fertilizer transport in the soil by taking inputs of known weather data and
    then predict in irrigation and fertilization requirement. However, when it is
    used in practice, it cannot predict the time and amount of irrigation and fertilization
    because the future weather and measurement of irrigation and fertilization are
    changing dynamically. Therefore, in this research, prediction methods are proposed.
    We use known past meteorological data and short-term forecast weather data to
    estimate the average SWC and SAN based on EU-Rotate_N model and accordingly predict
    the required amount of water and fertilizer. Because the greenhouse vegetables
    have shallow roots, we selected 6 soil layers (0–30 cm) to calculate the average
    values. Referring to the EU-Rotate_N simulation values of the historical soil
    water and nitrogen content in the optimal water and N treatment (highest water
    use efficiency and NUE), the threshold values were determined by the method of
    grid search. Furthermore, the dosages of fertilizer and irrigation are calculated
    by the thresholds. The prediction method is as follows: 2.6.1. Calculation of
    average SWC and SAN of 0–30 cm soil Assuming that the soil water content and N
    content simulated by the EU-Rotate_N model are SW and SN, the average SWC and
    SAN of 0–30 cm on the ith day after planting are calculated as follows: (4) (5)
    where n is the number of soil layers and here n = 6 for 0–30 cm. Li is the function
    of water content in soil layer L on day i. Where k and t represent the times of
    irrigation and fertilization respectively. When i = 0, W1 represents the irrigation
    amount on the planting day, while the fertilization amount on the planting day
    is set to 0, indicating no initial fertilizer on the day and whether fertilization
    is necessary or not will be determined after estimating the soil fertility by
    the prediction model. Similarly, is the function of N content in soil layer L
    on day i. According to the daily N content estimated by the EU-Rotate_N model,
    the NO3 content is far greater than NH₄+ content in the soil, so the soil NO₃¯
    content is used for calculation of N content in this research. 2.6.2. Determination
    of threshold values for SWC and SAN The thresholds are values of the SWC and SAN
    when irrigation and fertilization is required. According to the threshold value,
    it is possible to determine time and dosage of fertilizer and water with the prediction
    model. Soil water content at field capacity (FC) is used as the starting point
    for grid searching the threshold value of soil water (SW). Due to SW<FC, the threshold
    search can be conducted to obtain a suitable percentage ratio of FC. Through investigating
    the actual optimal water and fertilizer treatment when yield is the highest, the
    upper and lower thresholds are determined to be 95%*FC and 70% * FC. On the other
    hand, referring to China''s soil nutrient grading standards, the enrichment level
    of alkaline-N content is below 150 mg/kg (Tang et al., 2023). Therefore, we assume
    150 mg/kg as the highest content of soil N(SN) and search for the threshold value
    below it. It can be seen that there is no significant yield reduction when SN
    is 135 mg/kg. Hence, 135 mg/kg is determined as the lowest threshold for SAN content.
    2.6.3. Predict the time and amount of irrigation and fertilization based on threshold
    values Set the soil moisture threshold as SWc and the soil moisture of day i as
    SWi. When SWi < SWc, it indicates that the soil is short of water and needs irrigation
    on day i. Similarly set the soil N threshold as SNc and the soil N content of
    day i as SNi. When SNi <SNc, there are two situations. One is SNi SNi-1, which
    indicates the soil N content gradually decreases so fertilization is required
    on day i. The other is SNi >SNi-1,which suggest that the N content on day i increases
    compared to the previous day. Although the N content is lower than the threshold
    value, it is still in an increasing (perhaps due to the mineralization of applied
    organic fertilizer and soil organic matter.), so fertilization is not required
    in this situation on day i. The irrigation amount (Eq. (6)) and fertilization
    dosage (Eq. (7)) on the ith day after planting can be expressed as follows: (6)
    ， Where Smax is an adjustable coefficient which is taken as 95% in this research,
    indicating that the irrigation amount needs to reach 95% of FC. (7) Where, indicates
    that the soil N content is no longer increasing. SNmax is the upper threshold
    of SAN which can be taken as 150 mg/kg here. 2.7. Model performance criteria The
    data mentioned above were input into the original and improved EU-Rotate_N model,
    and we compared the output value with the data measured in the field experiment
    to verify the model performance. Four statistical indices, root mean square error
    (RMSE), Nash–Sutcliffe modeling efficiency (NSE), agreement index (d) and relative
    error (RE), were used to estimate the model performance: (8) (9) (10) (11) where
    n is the number of samples, Pi and Oi are the predicted and observed values, respectively,
    and O is the mean of the observed data (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970, Willmott, 1981).
    The closer the value of RMSE is to 0 or NSE and d are to 1, the more accurate
    the model is. The specific criteria were as follows (Van Liew and Garbrecht, 2003,
    Stockle et al., 2004): (12) Very good:d ≥ 0·9 and RE ≤ 0·10 (13) Good:d ≥ 0·9
    and 0·15≥ RE > 0·10 (14) Acceptable:d ≥ 0·9 and 0·20 ≥ RE > 0·15 (15) Marginal:d
    ≥ 0·9 and 0·25 ≥ RE > 0·20 (16) Good:NSE ≥0·75 (17) Satisfactory:0·75>NSE≥0·36
    (18) Unsatisfactory:NSE<0·36 2.8. APP development The APP was developed using
    the Java programming language and the IntelliJ IDEA integrated development environment.
    MySQL was used as the database. Since the EU model is complex and does not have
    a graphical user interface (GUI) with the PC-based version, it is inconvenient
    for users to operate by the command line from the field. Therefore, the original
    EU model was improved to fit the application environments and then recompiled
    and encapsulated with Spring and Mybatis Framework to satisfy users with a friendly
    graphical interface. The system development was carried out according to the standards
    of software engineering and was deployed on a cloud server for all users to access.
    Technicians and system administrators can access the system from the PC client
    to adjust the parameters of the soil types, crop types and fertilizer types, etc.
    Vegetable growers can input and obtain cultivation information by logging into
    the cloud website from the mobile terminal. Meanwhile, a mobile phone APP (EU
    APP) was developed to provide more convenient guidance for fertilization and irrigation
    for farmers. The architecture of the system is shown in Fig. 3. Download : Download

    of the decision support system for water and fertilizer management based on the
    improved EU system. 2.9. APP evaluation To evaluate the performance of the APP,
    a comparison experiment was conducted between fertilization and irrigation management
    according to APP instructions and local farmers’ practices in 2021 and 2022. The
    experiment was carried out in 50 m × 6 m plastic tunnels, and the area of each
    plot was 2.5 m × 5 m. A randomized block trial was designed with three replicates.
    Same micro-sprinkle-fertigation systems were used for both treatments. The amount
    of N fertilizer and water applied and the yield of pakchoi in the two treatments
    were recorded. 3. Results 3.1. Data on groundwater level and meteorology To analyze
    the effect of groundwater level under the plastic tunnels, a water level sensor
    was installed for continuous monitoring (Fig. A.5). As shown in Fig. 4, the groundwater
    during the experiment was kept at a considerably high level varying from 0.19
    to 0.72 m, indicating that the effect of groundwater on the migration of N and
    water in the 0–30 cm soil layer should be considered (Zhang et al., 2019a, Zhang
    et al., 2019b). The meteorological data for ETc calculation and model running
    were recorded in the plastic tunnel and are shown in Fig. A.2. Download : Download

    level during the experiment. The planting periods and sampling dates of the three
    crops are displayed in Fig. 2(a). 3.2. Model calibration The calibration process
    was in the order: soil water, soil nutrients and plant growth. The base temperature,
    and the length of different growth stages were observed empirically in the field.
    The parameters after calibration are listed in Table A.4. Compared with the original
    (spinach) and modified (pakchoi) parameters (Table A4), we found that pakchoi
    has higher base temperature and K_mid but lower PNINF, B0, K_ini and K_end, which
    is generally match the difference of N absorption, leaf development process and
    requirement temperature between two vegetables, indicating that we can adjust
    crop parameters according to the biological characteristics of new crops or cultivars.
    3.3. Simulation of soil and nitrate contents of different soil layers The comparison
    between the simulated and measured SWC of three soil layers (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm,
    20–30 cm) in six N treatments of three crops is shown in Fig. 5. The water content
    of the three soil layers in the spring, summer and autumn crops ranged from 0.182
    to 0.459 cm3 cm−3, 0.272–0.529 cm3 cm−3 and 0.292–0.503 cm3 cm−3, respectively.
    We found that the order of the fluctuation ranges of SWC of the three soil layers
    was 0–10 cm> 10–20 cm> 20–30 cm. In addition, the peak values of the simulated
    SWC of the 0–10 cm soil layers appeared four, five and seven times in the spring,
    summer and autumn growth seasons, respectively, which were consistent with the
    irrigation times of the three crops. These results indicated that the SWC of the
    0–10 cm soil layer is more susceptible to irrigation. Similar fluctuation patterns
    of SWCs were observed among six different N treatments and three crops. Download

    Comparison of the simulated and measured water contents of different soil layers
    of greenhouse pakchoi. The first soil layer is 0–10 cm, and values are presented
    in the first column. The second soil layer is 10–20 cm, and values are presented
    in the second column. The third soil layer is 20–30 cm, and values are presented
    in the third column. Values of six treatments are displayed in six rows. The planting
    periods and sampling dates of the three crops are displayed in Fig. 2(a). Compared
    with the SWC values simulated by the original model, the measured SWC values were
    higher in the 10–30 cm soil layer at some stages, and the SWC values simulated
    by the improved model were closer to the recorded data in the field (Fig. 5).
    The statistical evaluation indices of SWC are presented in Table 1. For the SWC
    in the three soil layers of the six treatments, the RMSE values of the improved
    model ranged from 0.026 to 0.044 and were closer to 0 than the RMSE values of
    the original model; the NSE and d values of the improved model ranged from 0.376
    to 0.806 and 0.895–0.964, respectively, and were closer to 1 than those of the
    original model (Table 1). Most of the RE values of the improved model are equal
    to or less than 0.1 and less than the RE values of the original model. Therefore,
    the RMSE, NSE, d and RE values also demonstrated that the improved model notably
    increased the performance in simulating the SWC dynamics in the pakchoi field
    under plastic tunnels (Table 1). Table 1. Model evaluation index of the soil water

    0.91 0.24 0.07 To compare the measured and simulated SAN in soil, we analyzed
    the SAN in the three soil layers of three crops (Fig. 6). As shown in Fig. 6,
    the measured SAN ranged from 44.768 kg/ha to 317.52 kg/ha. In the first crop,
    the 0–10 cm SAN increased (except in the N0 treatment), while in the second and
    third crops, the 0–10 cm SAN decreased during plant growth. These results agreed
    with the fertilization management of the three crops. Similar to SWC, the fluctuation
    of SAN in the 0–10 cm layer was more dramatic than that in the deeper layers.
    Plant absorption, evapotranspiration and mineralization may all contribute to
    this fluctuations. In different soil layers, the peak values of SAN in the deeper
    soil layer appeared later than in the shallower soil layer. The N dynamics in
    the soil of the six N treatments were similar. In general, the simulated SANs
    of the improved model were higher than those of the original model in the 0–10 cm
    soil layer, while in the 10–20 cm and 20–30 cm soil layers, a contrary tendency
    was observed. The results suggested that groundwater had a profound influence
    on N movement. In addition, a better consistency between the simulated and measured
    values was observed from the improved model than from the original EU-Rotate_N
    model. Download : Download high-res image (689KB) Download : Download full-size

    different soil layers of greenhouse pakchoi. The first soil layer is 0–10 cm,
    and values are presented in the first column. The second soil layer is 10–20 cm,
    and values are presented in the second column. The third soil layer is 20–30 cm,
    and values are presented in the third column. Values of six treatments are displayed
    in six rows. The planting periods and sampling dates of the three crops are displayed
    in Fig. 2(a). To further validate the performance of the improved model, RMSE,
    NSE, d and RE were also calculated. In general, the RMSE of the improved model
    was smaller than that of the original model, while the NSE and d values of the
    improved model were closer to 1 (Table 2). Most of the RE values are between 0.13
    and 0.19 of the improved model and they are all less than the values of the original
    model. These results indicated that the improved model performed better in the
    simulation of SAN and was more applicable than the original model under high groundwater
    conditions. Table 2. Model evaluation index of soil nitrate content in greenhouse

    were observed between three crops, while differences are not significant between

    Simulation of dry matter weight and yield of greenhouse pakchoi The dry matter
    weights of the three crops under different N treatments were measured, and the
    linear regression relationship between the measured and simulated values is shown
    in Fig. 7. The results between the improved and original models were similar;
    thus, only the results of the improved model are shown. The correlation coefficients
    of the three crops was more than 0.85, and all correlation coefficients were significant
    at P < 0.05. (Fig. 7), however, the slopes of all treatment were significantly
    more than 1. These results suggested that both models overestimated the dry matter
    weight of all N treatments and that the high groundwater table may have no significant
    effect on the dry matter weight accumulation of the pakchoi. Download : Download

    of simulated and measured dry matter weight of pakchoi. The values of R2 indicate
    statistical significance at the P < 0.05 level for the dry matter of the three
    crops. We also compared the measured and simulated yield values of pakchoi. Similar
    to the dry matter weight, no significant difference in simulated values between
    the improved and original models was found, indicating that the added algorithm
    associated with groundwater has little effect on yield prediction. The simulated
    yield from the improved model was slightly greater than the measured yield (approximately
    8%, Fig. 8). In the six N treatments, the yields of N4 and N5 were higher than
    those of the other treatments, and no significant difference in the measured yield
    between N4 and N5 was observed, indicating that N4 was the optimal N fertilizer
    dosage under these conditions. To validate the improved model for pakchoi yield
    simulation, we calculated three statistical methods (RMSE, NSE, d and RE values).
    The RMSE values of three crops were 2.598, 4.086 and 3.223 t/ha, respectively;
    the NSE values were 0.413, 0.975, and 0.967, respectively; the d values were 0.881,
    0.994 and 0.992, respectively; and the RE values were 0.090,0.076 and 0.071, respectively.
    As the NSE, d and RE values fit the criteria (NSE＞0.36, d＞0.7, RE<0.1) well (Nash
    and Sutcliffe, 1970, Willmott, 1981; Stockle et al., 2004), the improved EU-Rotate_N
    model could predict the pakchoi yield well in the high groundwater table area

    side of the EU application runs on a cloud server (http://124.223.11.102:8086/).
    The system supports three types of roles: administrators, technician users and
    vegetable growers. The administrator is responsible for adding and updating system
    functions, and the technician users usually set and adjust planting and soil parameters
    at the beginning of the cropping season by actual measurement (Fig. 9a). Growers
    usually set cultivation parameters for the crops and obtain fertilization and
    irrigation instructions by running the model regularly (Fig. 9b). The server side
    provides detailed parameters for the users, some of which may be too professional
    for farmers to be considered in the process of planting. Therefore, a simplified
    mobile app is preferred by farmers. Download : Download high-res image (227KB)

    (b) Crop parameters set by vegetable growers. The mobile side of the EU APP makes
    it easy for farmers to query irrigation and fertilization instructions at any
    time and any place. Farmers should record the amount, date and type of irrigation
    and fertilization in the system after each crop management (Fig. 10a). The APP
    will provide decisions about whether fertilization or irrigation is required at
    the time when a user queries. In the case of water shortages or fertilizer shortages,
    it can provide an early warning (Fig. 10b). For example, after irrigation on April
    15th, 2022, the system suggested that irrigation was not needed until April 19th,
    and the amount was 163 m3/ha. If there is no irrigation on that day, the demand
    for water will increase daily. Similarly, the fertilization reminder showed that
    the fertilizer shortage that appeared on April 16th was approximately 80.25 kg/ha,
    and it fluctuated slightly under the influence of residual fertilizer. Download

    3.6. APP evaluation As shown in Table 5, compared to the local farmer practice,
    the amount of both fertilization and irrigation according to APP instruction were
    significantly reduced. However, the yield difference between the two management
    practices was not obvious. The results indicated that the APP developed in this
    study is an effective tool to improve fertilizer and water use efficiency in greenhouse
    pakchoi production. In addition, we found that the main consumption of irrigated
    water of farmer practice is the first watering (240 m3/ha of farmer practice and
    approximately 80 m3/ha of APP instruction). Traditionally, it is believed that
    sufficient watering is necessary for seedling survival at planting. Our results
    suggested that the amount of planting watering in farming practices could be reduced
    without any yield loss. Table 5. Comparison of fertilization and irrigation amount

    The parameters of a certain vegetable in the crop table of the EU-Rotate_N mode
    are quite complex, usually including the N-related parameters N_fix, PNINF, B0,
    RLUX, etc., the root-related parameters az and ax, the water-related parameters
    K_ini, K_mid, K_end, L_ini, L_dev, L_mid, L_lat, etc., and the yield-related parameters
    r0, r1, r2, r3, etc. (Rahn et al., 2010). Theoretically, all parameters should
    be determined through field experiments, which are expensive and time-consuming.
    In this study, pakchoi is a typical oriental vegetable and is not included in
    the crop table of EU-Rotate_N. We selected spinach, which we think its growth
    is similar to pakchoi, as a starting point for model calibration. After the crop
    parameters were adjusted using the ‘trial and error’ methods (Boote, 1999, Wang
    and Huang, 2008, Ma et al., 2012) according to the measured data of the field
    experiment, the model can simulate the soil N and water dynamics perfectly. These
    results provided the possibility of rapid application of EU-Rotate_N to new vegetables
    that are lacking in the original crop table. On the other hand, we found that
    the pakchoi dry matter weight and yield was overestimated with the model, indicating
    that some parameters need to be further optimized. In addition, some parameters,
    such as L_ini, L_dev, L_mid, and L_lat, should be adjusted in the three crops
    according to the actual growth period. In the future, parameters related to dry
    matter and yield and in other tables associated with fertilizer and mineralization
    should also be calibrated to further improve the performance of the model. To
    date, most models for vegetable fertilization and irrigation management have been
    developed in arid or semiarid regions (Guo et al., 2010, Rahn et al., 2010, Soto
    et al., 2014). However, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are
    rich in precipitation (1000–1400 mm annually) and have a high groundwater table
    (http://www.cma.gov.cn/, Wang et al., 2019). Furthermore, due to global warming
    and the consequent rise in sea level, areas with high groundwater levels have
    gradually expanded around the world (IPCC, 2013). The contribution of groundwater
    toward crop evapotranspiration has been reported by several groups (Han et al.,
    2015, Liu and Kang, 2006, Ramos et al., 2017, Wu et al., 2015). Satchithanantham
    et al. (2014) found that under certain conditions, up to 92% of potato water consumption
    was provided by capillary rise from shallow groundwater. Our previous works also
    showed that the water and fertilizer dynamics in soil in Jiangsu Province (with
    a high groundwater table) are remarkably distinct from those in northern China,
    which has a low groundwater level (Wang et al., 2019, Zhang et al., 2019a, Zhang
    et al., 2019b). However, unfortunately, no model has been reported to accurately
    simulate the soil water and fertilizer dynamics in areas with high groundwater
    levels. In this study, a water level component which differentiate the soil into
    saturated and unsaturated layers was added to the model, and the results suggested
    that this algorithm significantly improved the performance of the model and further
    confirmed the influence of the high groundwater table on the soil N and water
    dynamics. The parameters in the algorithm can be modified or removed conveniently
    according to the actual groundwater table in certain regions. Fertigation has
    become a common method to provide nutrients and water to greenhouse vegetables
    in China and other countries around the world (Pérez-Castro et al., 2017, Lv et
    al., 2019). The EU-Rotate_N model simulates the N and water demand separately
    and was not designed for fertigation systems. However, in the experiment for APP
    validation in this study, fertigation technology was applied. The input option
    “N concentration in irrigation water” of the model gave us an opportunity to integrate
    N fertilization and irrigation together. The results revealed that the model performance
    was within the acceptable level when we considered the N application in the “N
    concentration in irrigation water”, which makes the model also applicable for
    fertigation systems. The goal of the APP is to integrate various data into a simple
    and convenient system for farmers to use on farmland. It supports multiple users
    to manage their crops and fields simultaneously and continuously from one crop
    season to another, which is different from most current APPs and DSSs in use (Abhaya
    et al., 2022; Carmen et al., 2022). The server side of the system allows for big
    data processing and storage. Therefore, the system has potential capabilities
    of data statistics and analysis when the farming data are accumulated to a sufficient
    extent. The mobile side function will provide great flexibility in use with the
    development of robot operating systems and embedded systems. In the future, the
    mobile side of the system can not only be installed in a handheld tablet or a
    smartphone but can also be integrated into specific agricultural machinery for
    automatic fertilization and irrigation (Jin et al., 2019, Christyan et al., 2022,
    Wang et al., 2022). As the first version of the APP, there are additional functions
    that could be improved afterward. For example, the query function of historical
    cultivation events could be added into the APP for reference and comparison in
    future practice. Furthermore, the marketable weight of the crops and other valuable
    functions of the EU model could be incorporated into the APP to expand the services
    for farmers. The EU-Rotate_N model was considered too comprehensive to be developed
    as an easy-to-use DSS to guide fertilization and irrigation practices for vegetable
    farmers (Gallardo et al., 2020). In the APP developed in this study, the meteorological
    data were obtained from the local weather station, the soil properties were provided
    by the local soil and fertilizer department, and only several input data, including
    crop type and the fertilization and irrigation practices conducted by farmers
    themselves, were needed. In addition, the EU-Rotate_N model produces abundant
    output data, and only the information of N and water balance was extracted to
    form the daily recommendation of fertilization and irrigation for vegetable farmers.
    Thus, the developed APP in this study takes advantage of the wide adaptability
    and high flexibility of the model and overcomes its weaknesses, such as being
    complex and unfriendly to end users. The good performance of the EU-Rotate_N model
    has been verified in a wide range of regions, different types of greenhouses and
    open fields, and different types of vegetables (Guo et al., 2010, Rahn et al.,
    2010, Soto et al., 2014). Therefore, we hope the APP developed here could also
    be applied successfully in a broader area and more vegetables. 5. Conclusion In
    this study, several modification was carried out for the first time to improve
    the performance of EU-Rotate_N model for vegetable production in Jiangsu province,
    China. The addition of the water level component which differentiate the soil
    into saturated and unsaturated layers enhanced the simulation accuracy of SWC
    and SAN in the 30 cm soil layer, indicating the significant influence of groundwater
    on the soil water and nutrient movement. In addition, The pakchoi experiment suggest
    that new vegetables could be added into the crop list of EU-Rotate_N by adjusting
    parameters with ‘trial and error’ methods after considering its biological characteristics.
    Furthermore, also after a series of adjustment, reasonable upper and lower thresholds
    of SWC and SAN could be setup to make the recommendations of fertilization and
    irrigation. The performance of improved model and the APP developed was verified
    in typical plastic vegetable tunnels in Jiangsu province and the results suggest
    that simulation models for vegetable fertilization and irrigation management established
    by developed countries could be modified by several steps to expand its application
    area. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no

    puts forward a practical risk assessment framework for agricultural Surface Water
    Distribution Systems (SWDS) operation under drought conditions. It accounts for
    situations when the diverted flow from the diversion dam fails to cover the total
    water rights within the districts. The risk probability is based on drought analysis
    and the Stream Drought Index (SDI) classification using the DrinC calculator.
    The risk consequence is determined based on SWDS operational performance appraisal,
    which includes hydraulic simulation by HEC-RAS, temporal analysis of adequacy,
    efficiency, and equity indices, spatial assessment in GIS, and combining performance
    evaluation indices using the Simple Weighted Sum (SAW) method. SWDS risk assessment
    is conducted considering the probability and consequences of drought hazard on
    the monthly and annual time scales. The obtained results show the monthly and
    yearly risks vary between (73.7, 76.1) % and (46.3, 63.9) % under the extreme-critical
    condition; (46.0, 53.2) % and (38.1, 51.1) % under the critical condition; (24.4,

    Issues Article 12 June 2017 1 Introduction The unreliable performance of traditional
    off-farm agricultural water operating systems (i.e., surface water conveyance
    & distribution structures operated by the dam owners) during water shortage periods
    is causing dissatisfaction among farmers and additional expenses for tube-well
    drilling licenses and pump station operation and maintenance in the irrigation
    districts. Studies reveal that water supply in Iranian irrigation districts exceeds
    agricultural demand by 67% to 200%. Also, the number of issued drilling licenses
    to farmers has risen by 45% to 213% (Avargani et al. 2022). Therefore, it is crucial
    to modernize hydraulic infrastructures and identify factors that impact modernize
    these hydraulic infrastructures, including recognizing water sources, assessing
    performance during shortages, and estimating hazards (Tsihrintzis 2017). Accordingly,
    two approaches for studying SWDS performances: pro-active orientation (risk assessment/management)
    (Bozorgi et al. 2021) and sustainability appraisal orientation (environment-food-energy-water
    nexus) (Bayat et al. 2022). This study offers a risk assessment framework for
    SWDS failure during droughts. SWDS''s global projects face issues with unreliable
    operations, causing social conflicts and environmental degradation due to water
    right violations and groundwater overexploitation. For instance, Over 50% of irrigation
    water was lost in a Mediterranean community due to improper operation. (Serra
    et al. 2016); Poor performance and damaged structures caused unfair water distribution
    in Ethiopia (Dejen et al. 2015); and an appraisal project carried out by USBR
    the showed that the average amount of water losses within AWDS were about 35%
    (Barkhordari et al. 2020). SWDS water losses are significant, and diverted water
    often fails to reach intended agricultural land. Water scarcity is a natural risk
    that reduces SWDS efficiency and requires investigation using risk assessment
    methods (Zhong et al. 2020). Bozorgi et al. (2021) developed a new risk assessment
    model to identify and evaluate threats to agricultural water supply systems using
    a hybrid Bayesian network. This approach has been commonly used in managing water
    resources for irrigation and agriculture water supply systems. Babaei et al. (2018)
    used the fuzzy fault tree analysis technique for risk assessment of undesirability
    of agricultural water supply & delivery in an irrigation district. Likewise, a
    risk management framework for SWDSs in irrigation districts was developed using
    a fuzzy hierarchical method to investigate failure and prioritize modernization
    alternatives based on SDGs criteria (Orojloo et al. 2018). However, there is a
    need for more comprehensive evaluations of water systems during shortages. Specifically,
    there is a lack of research on drought risk analysis and the impact of drought-induced
    scenarios on SWDS performance. This paper proposes a framework to measure the
    consequences of drought on SWDS performance. In terms of practicality, the paper
    provides guidance for irrigation districts on how to manage operations during
    water scarcity. The purpose of this study is to propose a practical approach for
    assessing the risks associated with SWDS operations in different drought inflow
    scenarios. To accomplish this, there are four subsidiary objectives: i) develop
    a hydraulic simulation model for SWDS to allocate surface water fairly among;
    ii) analyze drought risk probability using SDI index and DrinC calculator by Tigkas
    et al. (2015). Irrigation districts rely on surface water from dams and are affected
    by stream flow droughts. The SDI is a commonly used drought index for studying
    rivers. Hydrological droughts can threaten crops in these districts, which the
    SDI can help detect (David and Davidová, 2017); iii) spatiotemporal assessment
    of surface water distribution; iv) analyzing discrepancies between historical
    water-rights and the supplied water. The proposed practical approach can be applied
    by agro-tech enterprises, dam owners, insurance companies, and utilities to improve
    the off-farm surface water planning. It is worth noting that the proposed approach
    was performed and investigated in Roodasht Irrigation District located in Zayandeh-Rud
    River Basin, Iran. 2 Materials and Methods 2.1 Research Methodology The research
    methodology, Fig. 1 included different steps conducted in SWDS operation’s risk
    assessment under drought conditions on an annual and monthly basis, as explained
    below: Fig. 1 Schematic view of the steps conducted in methodology of this study
    Full size image Step 1: A field survey was conducted to collect data, measure,
    observe, interview, and brainstorm. The objectives were to obtain flow rate measurements,
    gather hydraulic information, and acquire operational data. Field observation
    verified the data, and the hydraulic simulation model was calibrated. Step 2:
    Drought analysis and SDI classification using DrinC software. To calculate monthly
    and yearly SDI, the DrinC software created by Tigkas et al. (2015) was utilized.
    DrinC calculates SDI using the Hargreaves equation and weather data. The index
    ranges from -4 to 4, reflecting drought to wet conditions. Step 3: Drought probability
    determination based on the calculated SDI classification. Step 4: Simulate water
    flow in open canals to determine discharge at off-take structures for different
    operational scenarios. Step 5: Evaluated water distribution and performance monthly
    and annually. Used the results to create an integrated consequence index and presented
    it to stakeholders for feedback. Helped understand the current operational performance.
    Step 6: Drought consequences determination by combining performance evaluation
    indices using SAW method. Step 7: SWDS risk assessment considering the probability
    and consequences of drought hazard in monthly and annual time-scale. 2.2 Draught
    Risk Probability The probability of drought in the study area was calculated using
    the SDI method. This method analyzes river flow and drought extent to predict
    onset and duration. Historical flow data from 1990 to 2021 at the Chom-Bridge
    station were evaluated using DrinC software and the Gamma distribution was determined
    as the best fit. The calculation method of the flow drought index is summarized
    in Eqs. (1)–(3), and a description of SDI scores and detailed of the drought classification
    are well explained in $${V}_{i,k}= \\textstyle \\sum _{j\\mathop{=}1}^{k}\\;{Q}_{i,j}
    \\;\\;\\;i\\mathop{=}\\mathrm{1,2},3,\\dots \\;\\;j\\mathop{=}\\mathrm{1,2},3,\\dots
    ,12 \\;\\;k\\mathop{=}\\mathrm{1,2},3,\\dots$$ (1) $${y}_{i,k}\\mathop{=}\\mathrm{ln}\\left({V}_{i,k}\\right)
    \\;\\;i\\mathop{=}\\mathrm{1,2},3,\\dots \\;\\;k=\\mathrm{1,2},3,\\dots$$ (2)
    $${SDI}_{i,k}\\mathop{=}\\frac{{y}_{i,k}\\mathop{-}{\\overline{y} }_{k} }{{S}_{y,k}}\\;\\;
    i=\\mathrm{1,2},3,\\dots \\;\\;k\\mathop{=}\\mathrm{1,2},3,\\dots$$ (3) where
    \\({Q}_{i,j}\\) and \\({V}_{i,k}\\) represents the measured discharge and accumulative
    discharge, and i, j, k are months, water-year, and the number of months, respectively.
    Also, \\({\\overline{y} }_{k}\\) and \\({s}_{y,k}\\) are the average and standard
    deviation, respectively. The probability of the drought occurrence (P) was calculated
    based on Eq. (4), in which the SDI score’s upper (max) and lower limit (min) vary
    in the range of (-4,4). $$P\\mathop{=}1\\mathop{-} \\frac{SDI\\mathop{-}min}{max\\mathop{-}min}.$$
    (4) 2.3 Draught Risk Consequence 2.3.1 Determination of the SWDS’s Operational
    Performance Assessment To investigate drought risks in an irrigation district,
    performance evaluation indices were used to measure water distribution efficiency
    (called “O_Sc” in this article). These indices were calculated at different time
    scales and operating conditions using a hydraulic simulation model. The variables
    of these indices (Eqs. (5)–(7)) were specified using the hydraulic simulation
    model which are the delivery discharge hydrograph to each individual off-take.
    The surface water adequacy index (Eq. (5)) shows the ability of the SWDS to meet
    the water-rights at the off-takes, the efficiency index (Eq. (6)) represents the
    system’s ability to prevent any extra-water delivery at each off-take, and the
    equity index (Eq. (7)) evaluates the system capability in equitable water distribution
    through the entire off-takes located at each individual open canal $$Adequacy\\mathop{=}\\frac{1}{T}\\sum\\limits_T\\left[\\frac{1}{R}\\sum\\limits_R\\left({P}_{A}\\right)\\right]
    \\;\\;\\;\\;{P}_{A}\\mathop{=}\\frac{{Q}_{D}}{{Q}_{R}} \\;\\;\\;if\\;\\;\\; {Q}_{D}\\le
    {Q}_{R }\\;\\;\\;otherwise\\;\\;\\; {P}_{A}\\mathop{=}1$$ (5) $$Efficieny\\mathop{=}\\frac{1}{T}\\sum\\limits_{T}\\left[\\frac{1}{R}\\sum\\limits_{R}\\left({P}_{B}\\right)\\right]\\;\\;\\;
    {P}_{B}\\mathop{=}\\frac{{Q}_{R}}{{Q}_{D}}\\;\\;\\; if\\;\\;\\; {Q}_{R}\\le {Q}_{D}\\;\\;\\;
    otherwise\\;\\;\\; {P}_{B}\\mathop{=}1$$ (6) $$Equity\\mathop{=}\\frac{1}{T}\\sum\\limits_{T}C{V}_{R}\\left(\\frac{{Q}_{D}}{{Q}_{R}}\\right)$$
    (7) where \\({Q}_{r}\\) indicate the off-take’s water-right, and \\({Q}_{D}\\)
    is representative of the off-take’s delivered discharge, \\(\\frac{1}{T}\\Sigma\\)
    & \\(\\frac{1}{R}\\Sigma\\) are the period and number of off-takes in each open
    canal, and \\(C{V}_{R}\\) is the coefficient of variation. 2.3.2 The Simple Additive
    Weighting (SAW) SAW method (Eq. (8)) is a popular technique used in multi-criteria
    decision-making for to combine different criteria and create a single overall
    measure for evaluating and ranking alternatives. This method is particularly useful
    when you have multiple criteria that need to be considered simultaneously in a
    decision-making process (Orojloo et al. 2018) $${I}_{i}\\mathop{=}\\sum\\limits_{j\\mathop{=}1}^{n}{W}_{j}\\;
    {\\mathrm{r}}_{ij}$$ (8) where \\({I}_{i}\\) is the risk’s consequences, \\({W}_{j}\\)
    is assigned weights, and \\({\\mathrm{r}}_{ij}\\) normalized criteria using the
    min–max technique. In this study, two indices of adequacy and efficiency got a
    negative score, and the equity index got a positive score based on the intrinsic
    concepts of these indicators. Equations (9) and (10) define the positive and negative
    scores, respectively, as below: $${r}_{ij}\\mathop{=}\\frac{{X}_{ij}}{Max\\; {X}_{ij}}$$
    (9) $${r}_{ij}\\mathop{=}\\frac{Min\\; {X}_{ij}}{ {X}_{ij}}$$ (10) where \\({r}_{ij}\\)
    is the normalized criterion, \\({X}_{ij}\\) is the indices values, \\(Max \\;{X}_{ij}\\)
    & \\(Min \\;{X}_{ij}\\) represent the max & min indices. 2.3.3 HEC-RAS Hydraulic
    Simulation Model HEC-RAS performs one-dimensional hydraulic simulations along
    rivers and irrigation canal systems. The water surface profiles are achieved by
    solving the energy equation (Eq. (11)) from one section to the next using an iterative
    algorithm according to the standard step method (Barkhordari et al. 2020): $${z}_{1}\\mathop{+}{y}_{1}\\mathop{+}\\frac{{\\alpha
    }_{1}{v}_{1}^{2}}{{2}{g}}\\mathop{=}{z}_{2}\\mathop{+}{y}_{2}\\mathop{+}\\frac{{\\alpha
    }_{2}{v}_{2}^{2}}{{2}{g}}\\mathop{+}{h}_{e}$$ (11) where z1 and z2 are the levels
    of the main canal bed, y1 and y2 are the water depth in cross-sections, v1 and
    v2 are the mean velocity, α1, and α2 are the velocity coefficients, g is the gravity
    acceleration, and he is the energy loss. Energy loss (Eq. (12)) can be obtained
    by the summation of losses due to friction and the loss caused by opening and
    narrowing: $${h}_{e}\\mathop{=}L{\\overline{S} }_{f}\\mathop{+}C\\left|\\frac{{\\alpha
    }_{2}{v}_{2}^{2}}{{2}{g}}\\mathop{-}\\frac{{\\alpha }_{1}{v}_{1}^{2}}{{2}{g}}\\right|$$
    (12) where \\({\\overline{S} }_{f}\\) is the slope of the energy line between
    two successive sections (Eq. (13)), C is the drop coefficient for opening and
    narrowing, and L is the weighted mean of the length of canal reach. The slope
    of the energy line at each point is obtained using the Manning formula: $${S}_{f}\\mathop{=}{\\left(\\frac{Q}{k}\\right)}^{2}$$
    (13) where k is the section’s transmission coefficient (Eq. (14)) calculated using:
    $$k\\mathop{=}\\frac{1.486}{n} {AR}^\\frac{2}{3}$$ (14) where n is Manning’s roughness
    coefficient, A is the section area, and R is the hydraulic radius. The HEC-RAS
    model inputs for this study included plan and profiles of the SWDS canal networks,
    structural data for conveyance, water-level control, and off-take structures,
    Manning coefficients, hydraulic coefficients, and boundary specifications for
    unsteady-state hydraulic simulation. This included inflow and structural boundaries
    and additional boundary conditions for time-varying flow simulation. The Root
    Mean Square Error (RMSE) (Eq. (15)) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) (Eq. (16)) were
    used to compare the simulated and measured values in the n calibration and validation
    stage: $$RMSE\\mathop{=}\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum\\limits_{i=1}^{n}{\\left({X}_{i}\\mathop{-}{Y}_{i}\\right)}^{2}}{n}}$$
    (15) $$MAE\\mathop{=}\\frac{1}{n}\\sum\\limits_{i\\mathop{=}1}^{n}\\left|{Y}_{i}\\mathop{-}{X}_{i}\\right|$$
    (16) where \\({Y}_{i}\\) and \\({X}_{i}\\) are simulated and observed values,
    respectively, the water distribution and delivery (at the location of each off-take
    structure) were evaluated using the water delivery index’s adequacy. Finally,
    the risk is calculated by multiplying the probability (P) and consequences (C)
    as shown in the (Eq. (17)): $$Risk\\mathop{=}P\\times C$$ (17) 2.4 Roodasht Irrigation
    District Roodasht Irrigation District is in the southeast part of Esfahan in Iran.
    It covers 31,000 ha, has an elevation of 1,510 m, an annual precipitation of 120
    mm, and evapotranspiration of 1600 mm. Primary water supply comes from surface
    water and groundwater. Table 1 provides details on the main canal, and Fig. 2
    shows the district''s location. Table 1 Average monthly climatic information during
    the study and Roodasht main canal reaches physical properties Full size table
    Fig. 2 Schematic view of the open canal networks responsible for surface water
    conveyance and distribution in the Roodasht Irrigation District, Esfahan, Iran
    Full size image The main irrigation canal in the area is 42.17 km long and supplied
    by the Zayandeh-Rud River, with a maximum capacity of 9 cms. It distributes surface
    water to 13 main Irrigated Units (IUs) through 14 duckbill weirs and 26 Nyrpic
    Module off-takes. This study found that 80MCM of groundwater was used in the 2020–2021
    operating year, compared to lower amounts in previous years. Groundwater use has
    caused a drop in the aquifer''s water level and an aquifer storage deficit. Aerial
    photos show no change in green areas during cultivation season. Insufficient surface
    water resources may be causing farmers to turn to groundwater exploitation. This
    district in central Iran is vulnerable due to frequent water shortages causing
    inflow fluctuations, conflicts over water rights violations, and groundwater deterioration
    from overexploitation. The O_Scs considered as initial conditions for hydraulic
    simulation are as follows. It should be noted that, in addition to the normal
    scenario, the other scenarios presented are dominant patterns extracted from historical
    data of the district’s operation between 1990–2021, where the canal inflow (at
    the diversion dam) occurred under unusual and unforeseen conditions. Normal O_Sc
    The flow deviation at the deviation dam covers the entire agricultural water-rights
    (historical probability of occurrence (HPO): 8.91%). Mild fluctuation O_Sc The
    inflow hydrograph at the head-source is oscillatory and variable compared to the
    total demand; discharge variation was (-20,0)% of the total inflow (HPO: 12.18%).
    Moderate fluctuation O_Sc The inflow hydrograph is oscillatory and variable compared
    to the total demand; discharge variation was (-40,-20)% of the total inflow (HPO:
    17.51%). Severe fluctuation O_Sc The inflow hydrograph is oscillatory and variable
    compared to the total demand; discharge variation was in a range of (-60,-40)%
    of the total inflow (HPO: 15.61%). 3 Results and Discussion In this section, the
    results of the drought analysis will be shared, including the probability of risk.
    Additionally, the hydraulic flow simulation results will be presented, which evaluate
    the SWDS''s performance through indicators such as adequacy, efficiency, and equity.
    These results will form the foundation for determining the consequences of the
    risk analysis. Lastly, monthly and annual risk analyses will be provided. 3.1
    Drought Hazard Risk Probability Based on historical base flow data at the hydrometry
    station, the probability of drought occurrence was determined through calculation
    using SDI index values. This process was explained in Section 2.2. In Fig. 3 and
    Table 2, the findings of the drought analysis are displayed. The SDI index was
    calculated on a monthly and annual basis and classified into seven categories
    according to the classification suggested by Hong et al. (2015). Based on the
    SDI index, June 2008–2009 had the lowest value with a magnitude of -2.42, classified
    as \"Extreme Drought (ED).\" On the other hand, February 2000–2001 had the highest
    SDI value of 2.74, classified as \"Extremely Wet.\" The probability of drought
    classes varies from 0.63 to 0.80 on a monthly scale, corresponding to an average
    inflow variation of 0.87 to 1.73 cms at the diversion dam. In yearly intervals,
    the probability varies from 0.64 to 0.82 for drought classes, corresponding to
    an average inflow variation of 1.09 to 1.48 cms.To sum up this section, investigated
    the probability of drought hazards using SDI classification and determined the
    average range of inflow variations for each class as given in Table 2. The classification
    of inflow was used to select the appropriate inflow hydrograph for the unsteady-state
    hydraulic simulation. Seven drought classes were obtained, but they were reorganized
    into four categories to comply with operational regulations in the study area.

    The drought analysis results were used practically to classify inflow in this
    irrigation district. This classification helps interpret the severity of drought
    for the operation and maintenance craw, which then reschedules water delivery
    planning and adjusts hydraulic structures manually based on the level of drought
    hazard. 3.2 Drought Hazard Risk Consequence Section 3.2.1 presents the results
    of the hydraulic simulation and evaluates the performance of the surface water
    distribution over time and space. In addition, Subsection 3.2.2 explains the implications
    of the drought results. 3.2.1 Hydraulic Simulation and SWDS Operational Spatio-temporal
    Assessment The MAE and RMSE indices were employed for the calibration/validation
    of the developed HEC-RAS hydraulic simulation model. These indicators values for
    calibration and validation were respectively obtained as 0.0091 and 0.0122 (m3/s)
    for MAE and 0.0086 and 0.0072 (m3/s) for RMSE for the steady-state model. Similarly,
    for the unstead-state model the indices values for calibration and validation
    were respectively obtained as 0.0110 and 0.0207 (m3/s) for MAE and 0.0113 and
    0.0129 (m3/s) for RMSE. After comparing the calibration and validation results
    with other studies, it has been confirmed that they are reasonable. The RMSE and
    MAE indicators calculated in (Dejen et al. 2015; Kaghazchi et al. 2022) varied
    in the range of (0.035–0.037) and (0.020–0.022) (m3/s), respectively. After calibration
    and validation of the hydraulic model, different O_Sc was assigned as the initial
    conditions for unsteady flow simulation. These operational scenarios, explained
    earlier in Subsection 2.4, included Normal O_Sc (HPO: 8.91%), Mild fluctuation
    O_Sc (HPO: 12.18%), Moderate fluctuation O_Sc (HPO: 17.51%), and Severe fluctuation
    O_Sc (HPO:15.61%). The inflow range, diverted from the diversion dam, varied from
    a minimum of 0.5 to a maximum of 4.5 cms, as explained earlier and given in Table
    2. Calculating the average discharge delivered to the 26 off-takes in SWDS was
    performed on an hourly, daily, and weekly time scales during simulation periods
    (142 to 184 days) ranging from 1990 to 2021, depending on the cultivating season.
    Based on the simulation results, it was found that there were more under-deliveries
    in off-takes that had higher capacity. Specifically, off-takes #4 and #5 in the
    2nd and 3rd reaches, off-takes #8 and #9 in the 4th and 5th reaches, off-take
    #12 in the 6th reach, off-takes #19 and #20 in the 10th reach, and off-take #21
    in the 11th reach experienced the most under-deliveries. Manual-based operating
    systems have led to over-delivery in upstream canal reaches and under-delivery
    in downstream off-takes. The simulated hydrographs show poor performance by SWDS,
    with significant discrepancies between delivered off-take discharge and water
    rights. Unsteady flow modeling provides clear insight, while systematic evaluation
    is done with indices (Eqs. (5)–(7)). The SWDS performance evaluation analyzed
    operational performance (Fig. 4a–b) and spatial distribution using GIS, in Fig.
    5a–c. Efficiency was measured through water loss due to over-delivery, with monthly
    and yearly indices ranging from 0.962 to 1.00. Overall, SWDS''s efficiency is
    considered \"good,\" delivering less than 10% excess water to stakeholders. Fig.
    4 SWDS operational performance evaluation based on the average values of the adequacy,
    efficiency, and equity a for monthly time intervals, and b for the yearly time
    interval from 1990 to 2021 Full size image Fig. 5 Spatial distribution of the
    average surface water distribution adequacy under operational scenarios of a normal
    operation in wet (inflow variation ( 4.62 to 3.90 cms), b normal operation in
    mild wet (inflow variation ( 2.05 to 3.90 cms), c mild-moderate drought conditions
    (inflow variation (1.1 to 2.05 cms), d severe drought conditions (inflow < 1.0
    cms) Full size image The SWDS''s ability to distribute water among stakeholders
    is measured by the adequacy index, which was found to be in the \"average and
    poor\" performance category with a monthly range of 0.060–0.886. This index has
    been consistently poor annually, falling within the range of 0.192–0.599. This
    leads to unreliable water supply and farmers resorting to digging tube wells.
    The number of deep and semi-deep wells has increased from 2014 to 2022 in the
    irrigation district. The equity index measures how fairly water distibutes within
    an irrigation canal upstream to downstream. This index falls within the range
    of 0.227 to 0.724 for monthly intervals, and 0.353 to 0.627 for annual intervals.
    The water distribution system is performing poorly, resulting in unequal distribution
    of water to farmers. A spatial analysis was conducted, and the results are shown
    in Fig. 5a–c. This study has identified helpful spatial maps for managers to compare
    surface water distribution with groundwater extraction from scattered wells in
    the district. This information can assist managers in controlling groundwater
    extraction and mapping drought risks. 3.2.2 Drought Risk Consequence’s on SWDS
    Operation The SAW method calculated the drought risk''s consequence index. It
    was weighted based on a variety of perspectives from professors, researchers,
    activists, legal reps, and operation crews. Assuming that the adequacy index represents
    the technical criteria \\({(W}_{{P}_{a}})\\), equity index represents the social
    criteria \\({(W}_{{P}_{e}})\\), and the efficiency index represents the environmental
    criteria \\({(W}_{{P}_{ef}})\\), the interviews conducted with all of these target
    groups, and a summary of the practical interpretation of the conducted weighting
    scenarios (WSC) are explained below: Farmers Representative (WSC#1): They believed
    all three criteria are equally important in SWDS operational evaluation and then
    have a common weight of \\({W}_{{P}_{a}}={W}_{{P}_{e}}={W}_{{P}_{e}f}=0.33\\).
    Operational Craws (WSC#2): They believed the technical criterion holds the primary
    ranking with \\({W}_{{P}_{a}}=0.5\\) 0, followed by the social and environmental
    criteria with \\({W}_{{P}_{e}}=0.33\\) and \\({W}_{{P}_{e}f}=0.17\\). Technical
    criteria affects water sales and revenue, while improving social index reduces
    complaints and costs for the operations team. Regional Water Board (WSC#3): It
    is worth noting that the weighting approach of regional/provincial managers concluded
    that the social (\\({W}_{{P}_{e}}=0.50\\)), environmental (\\({W}_{{P}_{e}f}=0.33\\)),
    and technical (\\({W}_{{P}_{a}}=0.17\\)) criteria have been placed in the first
    to last positions. Environmental activists (WSC#4): Naturally, as expected from
    environmental activist’s standpoints, the environmental criteria hold the highest
    importance (\\({W}_{{P}_{e}f}=0.61; {W}_{{P}_{a}}=11;{W}_{{P}_{e}}=0.28\\)), representing
    the surplus water delivered at the off-take structures. Over-delivery has caused
    waterlogged areas, drainage and soil salinity issues, and violation of environmental
    water rights. Researchers (WSC#5): They believed the technical criterion holds
    the primary ranking with \\({{W}_{{P}_{a}}=61; W}_{{P}_{e}f}=0.11;{W}_{{P}_{e}}=0.28\\).
    Figure 6 clearly illustrates the range of variations (max, min & standard deviation)
    of the integrated consequence index, categorized by different weighting scenarios
    in monthly time intervals. Drought poses the greatest environmental damage (Fig.
    6e), followed by social perspective (Fig. 6c) in second, economic and farmer’s
    point of view (Fig. 6a) in third, technical priorities (Fig. 6b) in fourth, and
    a purely theoretical and design-oriented single-objective water distribution approach
    (Fig. 6d), which typically dominates academic environments, in the fifth position.

    3.3 Risk Assessment Results Figures 7 and 8 provide the drought hazard risk assessment
    results. A summary of the obtained results is listed below: Fig. 7 The results
    of the monthly risk assessment of drought are categorized by different weighting
    scenarios (a)–(e) Full size image Fig. 8 Summary of the risk assessment results
    included average risk, consequence & probability in A monthly & B yearly time
    intervals in four SWDS inflow categories and for individual weighting scenarios
    (a)–(e) Full size image Figure 7a–e shows the variation of the monthly risk for
    WSC #1- WSC #5, where the calculated risk variation range is (0.083, 0.764), (0.053,
    0.769), (0.088, 0.765), (0.0415 to 0.773), and (0.116 to 0.750). Using WSCs classification
    is crucial for high-level officials in government to interpret results. The study
    shows that current surface water distribution systems are exhibiting unsustainable
    behavior, with performance levels nearing failure even in moderate drought conditions.
    This is justified by the SWDS operational appraisal benchmark. Figure 8A–B show
    monthly and yearly risk assessment results in four inflow variation ranges of < 1.5,
    (1.5,2.5), (2.5, 3.5), (3.5–4.5) cms representative of the four operational conditions
    of extreme-critical, critical, semi-critical, and normal following the irrigation
    districts’ standard operating procedure. Middle managers and frontline supervisors
    should use the system''s inflow classification to interpret results for optimal
    hydraulic adjustments and effective water supply planning. The results show in
    Fig. 8 show that the monthly and yearly risks vary in (73.7,76.1)% & (46.3,63.9)%
    under the extreme-critical condition; (46.0,53.2)% & (38.1,51.1)% under the critical
    condition; (24.4,35.1)% & (18.7,27.5)% under the semi-critical condition; and
    (16.6,25.5)% & (10.7,16.6)% under the normal condition. The SWDS needs to be maintained
    for optimal performance in wet conditions, but it is at risk of failure in drought
    scenarios. This study used a sustainable livelihoods framework to evaluate the
    impact of drought on irrigated apple production in South Africa''s Western Cape.
    It compared its methodology and results to similar studies, including one by Theron
    et al. (2023). SDI and SWDS indexes were used to assess natural and physical capital,
    respectively. The approach was approved and based on Theron et al. (2023) methodology.
    Tsai et al. (2023) created a risk-based irrigation decision-making system to address
    prolonged drought impacts on the Shihmen Reservoir Irrigation District in Taiwan.
    By predicting water shortages based on demand and proposing recovery plans, the
    study highlights the importance of prompt action during drought periods. This
    approach could be integrated with similar systems for a comprehensive risk assessment.
    Studies have assessed risks of poor irrigation water distribution caused by inadequate
    operation and maintenance. A few studies have been conducted to assess the risks
    associated with poor irrigation water distribution caused by inadequate operation
    and maintenance activities by utilizing fuzzy fault tree analysis (Babaei et al.
    2018), fuzzy hierarchical framework (Orojloo et al. 2018), and multi-hazard risk
    assessment model based on hybrid Bayesian network Bozorgi et al. (2021). These
    study aims to clarify the risks associated with these systems when multiple hazards
    threaten various components simultaneously. The present study aims to build on
    previous research that emphasizes the importance of employing a proactive management
    approach to agricultural water management. However, this study proposes a practical
    risk assessment that specifically focuses on the hazards of drought and SWDS.
    4 Conclusions A new risk assessment approach has been introduced for evaluating
    irrigation districts'' manual operating systems in surface water distribution.
    It helps identify the most suitable mitigation measures, ensuring safe, efficient,
    and sustainable water distribution activities. The investigation''s findings can
    help dam owners and water supervisors with water management, emergency response,
    and recovery plans for optimal allocation. The results can determine if the system
    can meet water demands with surface and groundwater resources. The methodology
    provides reliable information for decision-makers on improving agricultural water
    infrastructure. The proposed methodology improves routine inspections for groundwater
    withdrawal by analyzing the effects of the Surface Water Distribution System.
    The present study''s assessment confirmed the unreliable performance of the investigated
    surface water distribution system and validated farmers'' preference for using
    groundwater to meet their irrigation water demands. This study suggests an approach
    to investigate potential failure modes in hydraulic systems, which can aid in
    identifying vulnerable sections that may need replacing or decommissioning during
    long-term planning. Based on research, it is highly recommended to upgrade the
    underperforming and ineffective manual operating systems in the agriculture sector
    with modern automatic control systems to address the urgent need for change. Failure
    to do so may result in uncontrolled groundwater overexploitation and environmental
    water-rights violations in developing countries. However, considering various
    aspects of the SDGs criteria when making decisions regarding SWDS modernization
    and revitalization is crucial. This may include incorporating environmental, technical,
    social, and economic criteria, or a combination of them. Therefore, it is essential
    to prioritize the modernization and revitalization of SWDS to ensure sustainable
    and responsible water management practices. Availability of Data and Materials

    and validation (2011–2018). Finally, the performance of the developed algorithms
    was validated using different visual (scatterplot and boxplot) and quantitative
    (percentage of BIAS, root mean square error, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, and mean
    absolute error) metrics. The results revealed that minimum relative humidity had
    the greatest effect on rainfall prediction. The most effective input scenario
    featured all the input variables except for wind speed. Our findings indicated
    that the DA-SMO ensemble algorithm outperformed other algorithms.'

    variables, different input scenarios were formed. Then, the dataset was separated
    into three subsets: development (1988–2008), calibration (2009–2010), and validation
    (2011–2018). Finally, the performance of the developed algorithms was validated
    using different visual (scatterplot and boxplot) and quantitative (percentage
    of BIAS, root mean square error, Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency, and mean absolute
    error) metrics. The results revealed that minimum relative humidity had the greatest
    effect on rainfall prediction. The most effective input scenario featured all
    the input variables except for wind speed. Our findings indicated that the DA-SMO
    ensemble algorithm outperformed other algorithms. Similar content being viewed

    2020 Introduction Accurate rainfall prediction leads to not only better prevention
    of disasters in the event of flood, but also proper management of water, agricultural
    and aquatic ecosystems, and drought. While low rainfall results in drought, heavy
    rainfall increases the probability of landslides, floods, and other natural disasters.
    It is expected that the recent rise in the concentration of atmospheric carbon
    dioxide and the consequent increase in the global temperature will have a substantial
    impact on the rainfall pattern on local, regional, and global scales (Wang et
    al. 2013; Adefisan 2018; Zhu et al. 2022a,b). Since rainfall patterns are highly
    chaotic, the level of uncertainty in its prediction increases. Therefore, early
    warning systems should enjoy greater accuracy so that risks to life and property
    can be reduced, if not averted. Rainfall occurrences mainly depend on several
    meteorological variables including evaporation, maximum relative humidity, minimum
    relative humidity, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, sunshine hours, and
    wind speed (Zhao et al. 2021a,b). Near real-time rainfall prediction is generally
    done through physical/numerical models, which are developed based on dynamical
    equations. These models facilitate acquiring extensive information about time
    and space (Toth et al. 2000; Liu et al. 2022a, b). Nevertheless, requiring a significant
    amount of data with high resolution for physical/numerical modeling and their
    time-consuming implementation are the major drawbacks of the mentioned models.
    To overcome these obstacles, attempts have been made to develop statistical formulae
    in conjunction with statistical models for a more efficient rainfall prediction
    based on historical data. The autoregressive time-series prediction methods like
    autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and multiple linear regression
    (MLR), which have been applied to many different fields of study (Delleur and
    Kavvas 1978; Yevjevich 1987; Zhang et al. 2019a, b, 2022; Osouli et al. 2022).
    However, these models are not robust or flexible enough to predict complicated
    and chaotic phenomena like rainfall. So far, different types of machine learning
    (ML) models have drawn the attention of many researchers around the world. These
    models enjoy the following advantages: nonlinear structure, ability to model nonlinear
    phenomena, requiring small input datasets, user-friendliness, and ability to find
    a relationship between input and output variables to predict the target variable
    (Elbaz et al. 2019, 2020; Khosravi et al. 2021, 2022a,b; Liu et al. 2020). Artificial
    neural networks (ANN) are derived from the pioneering ML models whose applicability
    to rainfall forecasting is not much prevalent (e.g., Luk et al. 2000; Aksoy and
    Dahamsheh 2009; Samantaray et al. 2020, among others), although they have been
    found relevant to fields of geoscience (Ghumman et al. 2011; Oyebode and Stretch,
    2019; Kadam et al. 2019). Generally, ANN model has low generalization power and
    low convergence speed (Aksoy and Dahamsheh 2009; Wang et al. 2021; Quan et al.
    2022). To overcome these shortcomings, ANN have been integrated with fuzzy logic
    to develop neuro-fuzzy interface systems (ANFISs). Although ANFIS benefits from
    both ANN and fuzzy logic and has higher performance and generalization power,
    determining the weights of membership functions is still a challenging task in
    these cases. Other alternatives such as support vector machine (SVM) (Nhu et al.
    2019), gene expression programming (GEP) (Sheikh Khozani et al. 2017), and extreme
    learning machine (ELM) (Atiquzzaman and Kandasamy 2018; Zhao et al. 2021a, b,
    c; Wang et al. 2022) have also been applied in recent years. Recently, to enhance
    the prediction accuracy of the models through data pre- or post-processing approaches,
    ML ensemble algorithms have been developed by integrating two or more types of
    models (e.g., Zhang et al. 2019a, b; Xie et al. 2021a, b) to increase the modeling
    performance, thus benefiting from multiple advantages of two model types at the
    same time. An ensemble predictive model was developed by Sivapragasam et al. (2001)
    for one-day-ahead forecasting using SVM and singular spectrum analysis models.
    They employed singular spectrum analysis in order to disintegrate rainfall data
    for training SVM through a supervised approach. The authors argued that the ensemble
    algorithm of the singular spectrum analysis-SVM model could outperform nonlinear
    prediction methods. Similarly, Chau and Wu (2010) revealed the higher predictive
    power of the singular spectrum analysis-SVM than the traditional ANN model. Wu
    et al. (2010) reported that particle swarm optimization (PSO) as a metaheuristic
    algorithm could enhance the performance of the standalone SVM model. While most
    of the neuron-based algorithms suffer from inadequate accuracy in determining
    the weights of membership functions, metaheuristic algorithms are able to determine
    accurate weights automatically. Kisi and Shiri (2011) examined the efficiency
    of the ensemble-based wavelet-GEP algorithm in predicting daily rainfall and compared
    it with a hybrid wavelet-neuro-fuzzy method in terms of predictive power. The
    performance of the wavelet-GEP was reported better than that of the neuro-fuzzy
    method. Yaseen et al. (2019) used a hybrid ANFIS model with three metaheuristic
    algorithms, namely PSO, genetic algorithm (GA), and differential evolution (DE),
    for monthly rainfall prediction. Finally, the performance of the hybrid ANFIS
    model was compared with that of the standalone ANFIS model. The results revealed
    that all the hybrid models outperformed the standalone model. All in all, these
    studies have illustrated the necessity of using hybrid models for precise forecasting
    of long-term rainfall. However, despite their complicated structures, these models
    are of higher accuracy than standalone models in most cases. Accordingly, there
    is an ongoing effort to increase their modeling accuracy and reduce their complexity.
    Ridwan et al. (2021) compared Bayesian linear regression (BLR), boosted decision
    tree regression (BDTR), decision forest regression (DFR), and neural network regression
    (NNR) in terms of rainfall prediction accuracy in Malaysia. They found that monthly
    dataset facilitated higher prediction accuracy than daily and weekly datasets
    and revealed that BDTR model had favorable performance in most cases. In recent
    years, advanced ML models in combination with sequential minimal optimization
    (SMO) have successfully been applied for regression and classification purposes
    in different fields of science. For example, Hashmi et al. (2015) compared model
    tree with SMO in terms of predicting the minimum surface roughness value and indicated
    the high predictive power of both algorithms. Gao et al. (2019) successfully employed
    SMO algorithm for designing energy-efficient residential buildings. In this paper,
    standalone SMO algorithms as well as three new hybrid models developed through
    effective integration of additive regression (AR), Dagging (DA), and random committee
    (RC) algorithms (i.e., AR-SMO, DA-SMO, and RC-SMO) are presented for rainfall
    prediction. As stated in the literature review, although there are many applicable
    models for rainfall prediction, most of them are classified as traditional with
    high uncertainty in performance. In the present study, authors tried to boost
    the accuracy of new ML models through hybridization and apply them to rainfall
    prediction. In addition, they intend to explore what types of input variable among
    hydrometeorological data are effective in rainfall prediction and what input scenario
    has the highest flexibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time
    that these types of hybrid algorithms have been applied to hydrology, especially
    for rainfall prediction. Other new aspects of the current study are: (a) investigating
    the effectiveness of each input variable (about 7 input variables) in the result,
    and (b) finding an appropriate input scenario. Case study Kermanshah synoptic
    station with an elevation of 1318 m at latitude of 34° 21'' N and a longitude
    of 47° 9'' E in Kermanshah province, west of Iran (Fig. 1), was considered as
    our case study. The mean annual rainfall of 450 mm was recorded by this station
    located in a mountainous area, and the corresponding long-term hydrometeorological
    information was achieved. The wind that blows from the west and carries humidity
    from the Mediterranean and Atlantic Oceans is the main source of rainfalls and
    snow-falls during spring and winter, respectively, while the wind blowing in the
    summer is hot. Fig. 1 The location of the Kermanshah synoptic station Full size
    image Methodology The methodological framework of the current study is presented
    in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 A basic flow chart of the current study Full size image Dataset
    collection Thirty-year monthly data from January 1988 to December 2018 including
    evaporation (Eva), maximum relative humidity (MARH), minimum relative humidity
    (MIRH), maximum temperature (MAT), minimum temperature (MIT), sunshine hours (SSH),
    wind speed (WS), and rainfall were recorded from Kermanshah synoptic station by
    Kermanshah Regional Water Authority. Rainfall was determined as the target variable,
    while the remaining variables were incorporated into the model for estimating
    the rainfall. The whole data were divided into three groups: 70% of the data from
    January 1988 to December 2008 used for model building; 15% from January 2009 to
    December 2010 for model calibration; and the remaining 15% from January 2011 to
    December 2018 for model validation. Statistical analysis of the development, calibration,
    and validation datasets is given in Table 1. Table 1 Descriptive statistics for
    training, calibration, and validation Full size table Input scenarios R-value
    between the input variables and rainfall (as output) was calculated to construct
    different input scenarios for variables and investigate their effectiveness in
    rainfall modeling. The r-value pie-chart between input and output variables is
    shown in Fig. 3. The r-value shows that all input variables, except WS, contribute
    to high rainfall prediction power. Fig. 3 Importance of input variables in terms
    of Pearson correlation coefficient Full size image Seven different input scenarios
    were built based on the r-value. First, the variable with the highest r-value
    (i.e., MIRH) was considered as a single input scenario. Then, the potential variable
    with the next highest correlation value was added to the first input for building
    the input combination number 2. Each variable was added in a stepwise approach
    to the previous scenario and this approach continued until the variable with the
    lowest r-value (i.e., WS) was added. To achieve the most effective input scenario,
    all the input scenarios were fed as input into the rainfall model. Then, the results
    were compared and the scenario with the highest r-value was determined as the
    optimum input scenario (Table 2). Table 2 Input variable scenarios Full size table
    Optimum weights Obtaining the optimum weight of each parameter in the model is
    a crucial phase in the modeling process, which can significantly enhance the predictive
    power of a model. This step was taken in the Waikato Environment for Knowledge
    Analysis (WEKA 3.9) software using the trial-and-error method. First, default
    values were considered, and then, the models were developed. Next, based on the
    achieved results, higher and lower values were applied until the optimal value
    was determined for the model. The lowest RMSE value was considered as a criterion
    in this step to determine the optimum values for the models. Description of the
    models Sequential minimal optimization (SMO) regression algorithm SMO algorithm
    is one of the well-known function algorithms that was first invented by Platt
    (1988) at Microsoft Research Center. This iterative algorithm is developed for
    solving optimization problems, e.g., in quadratic programming, which is a popular
    weakness of the SVM algorithm. Generally, the need for quadratic programming arises
    during the training of the SVM algorithm, and SMO algorithm is an alternative
    to QP methods, which are sophisticated and need expensive third-party QP solvers.
    SMO, on the other hand, can divide such problems into smaller parts, called sub-problems.
    The main advantage of these sub-problems is that they can be analytically solved.
    Of note, the SMO algorithm implements SVM for regression problems. Hence, the
    parameters can be learned using various algorithms. The algorithm is selected
    by setting the reg-optimizer as the most popular algorithm. Consider a binary
    classification with a dataset (x1, y1), …, (xn, yn), where xi is an input vector
    and yi ∈ {− 1, + 1} is a binary label corresponding to it. A soft-margin SVM is
    trained by solving QP, which is explained in a dual form as follows: $${\\text{Max}}\\sum\\limits_{i
    = 1}^{n} {\\alpha_{{\\text{i}}} } - 0.5\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} {\\sum\\limits_{j
    = 1}^{n} {y_{{\\text{i}}} y_{{\\text{i}}} K(x_{{\\text{i}}} ,x_{{\\text{j}}} )\\alpha_{{\\text{i}}}
    \\alpha_{{\\text{i}}} } } ,$$ (1) subject to: $$0 \\le \\alpha_{{\\text{i}}} \\le
    C, for\\quad i = 1,2,...,n,$$ (2) $$\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{n} {y_{{\\text{i}}}
    \\alpha_{{\\text{i}}} = 0},$$ (3) where C is an SVM hyperparameter and K(xi, xj)
    is the kernel function, both supplied by the user; and the variables \\(\\alpha_{{\\text{i}}}\\)
    are Lagrange multipliers. Random committee (RC) An ensemble-based model developed
    by combining more than two artificial intelligence techniques is called Committee
    Machines (CMs). CMs enjoy flexibility in modeling and know-how in resolving the
    deficiencies currently witnessed in the respective standalone model (Ghiasi-Freez
    et al. 2012; Chen et al. 2022; Yin et al. 2022a, b). The RC model is a kind of
    CM learning technique applied for addressing classification and regression issues
    and is considered to be an effective ensemble model (Niranjan et al. 2017). The
    RC model is able to develop hybridized randomizable base regressors or classifiers,
    each functioning based on the same data. However, a specific random seed is utilized
    and the final model response is obtained by averaging the estimations made by
    each standalone model (Witten and Frank 2005). Disjoint aggregating (Dagging)
    Developed by Ting and Witten (1997), the disjoint aggregating (Dagging) approach
    works on a proportionate stratified sampling scheme, dividing a dataset into a
    series of stratified folds in such a way that one individual learner manages a
    specific fold (Chen et al. 2020). Dagging is considered a robust tool for improving
    the accuracy of the weak single models in which a series of weak regressors are
    coupled using the voting rule for calculating the output of the model (Pham et
    al. 2020). The Dagging model can be established as follows: (i) The training dataset
    is split into a suite of \"L\" subsets; (ii) everyone should have \"K\" samples,
    and each sample belongs to only one subset; (iii) a regression model is developed
    for each subset, and in total, \"L\" regression models are obtained; and (iv)
    based on the comparison of the results from each regression model, the model with
    enough votes is selected for the Dagging algorithm (Chen and Li 2020). Additive
    regression (AR) AR model was introduced by Stone (1985). From a mathematical point
    of view, \"Y\" and explanatory \"xi\" variables should be linked through a suite
    of nonparametric regression functions \"fi\", which are in turn defined to be
    a regression function of the independent variables \"xi\". Consequently, each
    independent variable \"xi\" contributes to the final model in the form of (fi
    (xi)) compared to the linear form (λi xi) used in the MLR model (Xu et al. 2017).
    The AR is a general (potentially nonlinear) regression model that includes linear
    regression as a special case. Suppose that variable \\(Y_{{\\text{i}}} \\left(
    {i = 1, 2, \\ldots ,n} \\right)\\) is a function of unrestricted functions \\(f_{{\\text{j}}}
    \\left( {j = 1, 2, \\ldots ,p} \\right),\\) which are determined by the input
    variables \\(X_{{{\\text{i}}1}} , X_{{{\\text{i}}2}} \\ldots ,X_{ip}\\), respectively.
    The AR model is evaluated based on the following equation (Xu and Lin 2017; Tian
    et al. 2021a, b): $$Y_{i} = \\mathop \\sum \\limits_{j = 1}^{p} f_{j} \\left(
    {X_{ij} } \\right) + \\mu_{i} , \\;\\mu_{i} \\sim iid\\left( {0,\\sigma^{2} }
    \\right),$$ (4) where\\(f_{{\\text{j}}} \\left( {X_{{{\\text{ij}}}} } \\right)\\)
    is a nonparametric function fit to the data. The random error term \\(\\left(
    {\\mu_{{\\text{i}}} } \\right)\\) has zero mean and variance of \\(\\sigma^{2}\\).
    More AR details can be found in the study of Cui et al. (2010). Evaluation and
    comparison of the models RMSE, percentage of bias (PBIAS), Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency
    (NSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) are computed as follows (Legates et al. 1999;
    Moriasi et al. 2007a, b): $${\\text{RMSE}} = \\sqrt {\\frac{1}{N}\\mathop \\sum
    \\limits_{i = 1}^{i = N} (Q^{{{\\text{Pre}}}} } - Q^{{{\\text{Obs}}}} )^{2},$$
    (5) $${\\text{MAE}} = \\frac{1}{N}\\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{N} {\\left| {Q^{{{\\text{Pre}}}}
    - Q^{{{\\text{Obs}}}} } \\right|} ,$$ (6) $${\\text{NSE}} = 1 - \\frac{{\\sum\\nolimits_{{i
    = 1}}^{N} {(Q^{{{\\text{Pre}}}} - Q^{{{\\text{Obs}}}} )^{2} } }}{{\\sum\\nolimits_{{i
    = 1}}^{N} {(Q^{{{\\text{Obs}}}} - \\overline{{Mean\\;Q^{{{\\text{Obs}}}} }} )^{2}
    } }},$$ (7) $${\\text{PBIAS}} = \\left[ {\\frac{{\\mathop \\sum \\nolimits_{I
    = 1}^{N} \\left( {Q^{{{\\text{Pre}}}} - Q^{{{\\text{Obs}}}} } \\right)}}{{\\mathop
    \\sum \\nolimits_{i = 1}^{N} Q^{{{\\text{Pre}}}} }}} \\right]*100,$$ (8) where
    \\(Q^{{{\\text{Obs}}}}\\) is the observed rainfall, \\(Q^{{{\\text{Pre}}}}\\)is
    the predicted rainfall, \\(\\overline{{Mean Q^{{{\\text{Obs}}}} }}\\) is the mean
    of measured rainfall values, and N is the number of data samples (the number of
    test datasets). The lower the RMSE and MAE values, the higher the model performance.
    NSE ranges between \\(- \\infty\\) and 1, and the model with NSE = 1 is ideal.
    NSE is classified as unsatisfactory, acceptable, satisfactory, good, and very
    good performance for NSE ≤ 0.4, 0.40 < NSE ≤ 0.50, 0.50 < NSE ≤ 0.65, 0.65 < NSE ≤ 0.75,
    and 0.75 < NSE ≤ 1.00, respectively (Moriasi et al. 2007a, b). PBIAS can be used
    for model performance classification similar to NSE, and it shows the overall
    model underestimation or overestimation. Negative PBAISA indicates the model overestimation,
    while positive PBIAS represents underestimation (Legates and Mccabe 1999). Results
    Most effective input scenario Based on the results provided in Fig. 4, the input
    scenario (6) composed of the variables MIRH, MARH, MAT, MIT, SSH, and Eva had
    the highest r-values at both training and validation phases and showcased the
    most effective variables in rainfall prediction. Hence, the developed models were
    tested using the input scenario (6), the performance of which is discussed in
    the following section. Fig. 4 Determination of the most effective input scenario:
    (a) development phase, and (b) validation phase Full size image Model evaluation
    After calibrating and validating the developed models, the performance of the
    models was evaluated using the test data. The observed versus estimated rainfall
    values by different models are visualized as time-varying and scatter plots in
    Fig. 5. It was observed that the standalone models predicted rainfall with an
    R2 of 0.568 and were less accurate than other models. In contrast, the estimated
    rainfall values obtained by all the developed ensemble models (DA-, RC-, and AR-based
    models) were much closer to the measured values with R2 of 0.739, 0.735, and 0.738.
    It was demonstrated that the DA algorithm was much more robust and had higher
    predictive power than RC and AR models. Fig. 5 Line-graphs and scatter plots for
    predicted vs. measured rainfall values during the validation phase Full size image
    It is observed that the DA-SMO and AR-SMO are able to predict the median rainfall
    (Q50) much closer to the measured rainfall values (Fig. 6). The first quartile
    (Q25) of all the developed models, except for the standalone SMO model, is close
    to the measured Q25 of the rainfall values, while the estimated values of the
    third quartile (Q75) for all the developed models are higher than the measured
    Q75 of rainfall values. The SMO is inaccurate in estimating the minimum and maximum
    rates of rainfall. However, the ensemble DA-SMO is the most accurate model in
    estimating minimum and maximum rainfall rates, indicating the predictive power
    of the ensemble models. Fig. 6 Box plot of the measured and predicted rainfall
    values Full size image In terms of the error metrics (Table 3) (i.e., RMSE and
    MAE), the SMO model had the lowest predictive power (RMSE = 22.61 mm, MAE = 13.98
    mm). All the ensemble models decreased the error occurring in the standalone models.
    It was observed that DA-, AR-, and RC-based SMO models decreased RMSE (MAE) of
    the standalone SMO by 21.1% (12.6%), 20.7% (11.8%), and 21.7% (13.0%), respectively.
    In terms of the NSE metric and based on the findings of Moriasi et al. (2007a,
    b), SMO with the NSE of 0.57 has a satisfactory performance (0.5 < NSE ≤ 0.65),
    while three ensemble-based models have a good performance (0.65 < NSE ≤ 0.75).
    The PBIAS indicator shows that all the models are classified as having good performance
    (10% < PBIAS ≤ 15%) based on the findings of Moriasi et al. (2007a, b). Moreover,
    the PBIAS values for all the developed models are negative, indicating the overestimation
    of rainfall values. Table 3 Performance evaluation of the models based on quantitative
    metrics Full size table Discussion Choosing the best input variables is a difficult
    task in estimating rainfall. A number of studies rely on nonlinear methods such
    as gamma test in order to determine appropriate predictors in rainfall estimation
    (Ahmadi et al. 2015). However, the results of the present study indicate that
    employing a linear methodology by incorporating the correlation coefficient can
    also be a promising means to choose the input variables. It should be noted that
    while only a single combination for input is selected automatically in a nonlinear
    method, we constructed and examined different combinations for input variables
    in this article. This matter helped identify the input combination with the highest
    effectiveness and, at the same time, determine the impact of each input variable
    on the final results. The findings of the present paper are supported by Khosravi
    et al. (2020a), who found the linear Pearson correlation coefficient effective
    in finding the best input variables for prediction models. Due to the diversity
    in structure and complexity of the algorithms, DM models in various forms produce
    different results when employed for rainfall estimation. According to the findings
    of the present paper, the developed hybrid models, which are of nonlinear pattern
    in nature, had higher accuracy in modeling rainfall events than ML models in the
    standalone mode. In addition, the hybrid algorithms were more flexible than the
    latter. These findings support some research studies conducted previously, in
    which hybrid models were employed in order to simulate nonlinear hydrological
    processes, proving the superiority of hybrid models as they decreased both bias
    and variance (Hong et al. 2018; Jiang et al. 2021; Zuo et al. 2020; Ebrahimi et
    al. 2022). Another notable merit of hybrid models is that they can tackle the
    problem of over-fitting in regression modeling (Chen et al. 2020). For instance,
    among such studies, Bui et al. (2020) concluded that hybrid models functioning
    based on bagging (BA) (e.g., BA-random forest (RF), BA-M5P, BA-random tree (RT),
    and BA-reduced error pruning tree (REPT)) would enhance the capability of individual
    models for predicting the indices of water quality. In addition, the study conducted
    by Khosravi et al. (2020b) found the BA-based models superior to the individual
    M5P, RF, and REPT when adopted for bedload transport rate modeling. In the field
    of landslide susceptibility mapping, Nguyen et al. (2019) observed that hybrid
    models performing on the basis of BA and DA would achieve better results than
    the alternating decision trees. Furthermore, the findings of Chen et al. (2020)
    indicated that hybrid J48 Decision Trees established based on BA and DA outperformed
    the standalone J48 model for the mapping of groundwater spring potential. All
    in all, BA- and DA-based hybrid models have proven viably satisfactory and reliable
    for prediction purposes. The results of the present paper further prove the robustness
    of some other hybrid models that are introduced as promising algorithms for modeling
    with prediction purposes. As mentioned earlier, the main reasons behind the lower
    prediction performance of ML models with regard to natural phenomena like flood,
    drought, etc., lie in high non-linearity, stochastic process, and complexity of
    the occurrence of precipitation (e.g., Sánchez-Monedero et al. 2014; Hashim et
    al. 2016). As a result, natural phenomena prediction, particularly rainfall forecasting,
    continues to be subject to uncertainty. Furthermore, relevant studies have considered
    the strong correlation between rainfall and cloud information. For this purpose,
    total perceptible water, equivalent potential temperature, humidity, wind speed,
    wind direction, convective available potential energy, and convective inhibition
    have been introduced as a reliable combination for input. It can be concluded
    that some missing data of the mentioned parameters are the major reason for uncertainty
    with regard to the results of the present research. It is suggested that future
    studies apply the proposed hybrid models to other hydrological fields such as
    water quality. Moreover, AR, DA, and RC algorithms can be utilized as ensemble
    learners in order to develop hybrid models using other ML techniques, e.g., decision
    trees and rule-based, lazy-based, and neuron-based algorithms, in different fields
    of geoscience. Conclusion Rainfall is one of the main components of hydrologic
    cycle that has a significant impact on the infiltration process, flood occurrences,
    soil erosion rate, water resources management, and irrigation system. Therefore,
    rainfall prediction is one of the hot topics today in the fields of hydrology
    and water resources management. Given that rainfall is highly stochastic and chaotic
    in behavior, it is not an easy task to predict it. The current study proposed
    standalone SMO models and three new ensemble-based algorithms of DA-SMO, AR-SMO,
    and RC-SMO for rainfall prediction in Kermanshah synoptic station, Iran. Moreover,
    different input scenarios were investigated to explore the effectiveness of different
    input combinations in the result. The main achievements drawn from the findings
    of this study can be summarized as follows: 1. Minimum relative humidity had the
    highest effect on rainfall prediction, followed by maximum temperature, relative
    humidity, minimum temperature, sunshine hours, evaporation, and wind speed. 2.
    Wind speed attenuated the predictive power of a model; in the present study, an
    input scenario featuring all input variables, except wind speed, was identified
    as the most effective scenario in rainfall estimation. 3. DA, AR, and RC algorithms
    enhanced the performance of the standalone SMO algorithm by about 12.8, 20.7%,
    and 21.7%, respectively, based on the RMSE metric. 4. While the standalone SMO
    algorithm had a satisfactory performance, ensemble models were of good performance
    in terms of NSE metric. 5. DA-SMO ensemble model outperformed other models, followed
    by RC-SMO, AR-SMO and standalone SMO models. 6. All of the developed models in
    the current study tended to overestimate the rainfall amount. 7. Hybrid algorithms
    were more accurate than the standalone model in capturing extreme values. The
    different machine learning algorithms explored in the current study are applicable
    to mountainous areas in Iran and may potentially yield accurate rainfall predictions
    for other mountainous regions in the world. Availability of data and materials

  description: Across the world, achieving sustainable water resource development
    and managing limited natural resources like water have proven to be significant
    issues, and India is no exception to the same. At present, irrigation consumes
    about 80 percent of the total available water in India and is predicted to remain
    the dominant water user. India is already a country with water stress and is on
    its way to becoming a country with water scarcity. Rising agricultural productivity,
    expanding urbanisation, growing industrialisation, and accelerating industry create
    competing demands for water. Most irrigation system issues in India are attributable
    to poor management of the built infrastructure. The present study aims to rank
    the irrigation canals based on their efficiencies and inefficiencies to improve
    the overall performance of WUAs in Jharkhand. The ranking is done for nine irrigation
    canals based on financial inputs like investments in training and development
    of WUAs, maintenance and repairs of canals, and outputs like users’ charges collection
    and yield in crop production. The Comprehensive Efficiency score analysis suggests
    that while there is room for improvement in the performance, the Water Users’
    Associations have generally been successful in improving the technical efficiency
    of the irrigation system. The findings can be used for further investigation to
    identify best practises and areas for improvement.

    Across the world, achieving sustainable water resource development and managing
    limited natural resources like water have proven to be significant issues, and
    India is no exception to the same. At present, irrigation consumes about 80 percent
    of the total available water in India and is predicted to remain the dominant
    water user. India is already a country with water stress and is on its way to
    becoming a country with water scarcity. Rising agricultural productivity, expanding
    urbanisation, growing industrialisation, and accelerating industry create competing
    demands for water. Most irrigation system issues in India are attributable to
    poor management of the built infrastructure. The present study aims to rank the
    irrigation canals based on their efficiencies and inefficiencies to improve the
    overall performance of WUAs in Jharkhand. The ranking is done for nine irrigation
    canals based on financial inputs like investments in training and development
    of WUAs, maintenance and repairs of canals, and outputs like users’ charges collection
    and yield in crop production. The Comprehensive Efficiency score analysis suggests
    that while there is room for improvement in the performance, the Water Users’
    Associations have generally been successful in improving the technical efficiency
    of the irrigation system. The findings can be used for further investigation to
    identify best practises and areas for improvement. Keywords: water users’ association;

    comprehensive efficiency score 1. Introduction At present, irrigation consumes
    about 84 percent of the total available water in India and is predicted to remain
    the dominant water user. India is already a country with water stress and is on
    its way to becoming one with water scarcity. Even though the nation’s finite water
    supplies are under increasing pressure, water use does not reflect the shortage.
    India uses 2–4 times as much water to grow one unit of crucial food crops as other
    major agricultural nations like China, Brazil, and the United States [1]. Whether
    farming is efficient or inefficient depends on the availability of water through
    irrigation or rainfall. Such difficulties would necessitate effective water management
    of the available surface and groundwater resources and their maximum exploitation
    [2]. In India, achieving sustainable development and effectively managing this
    limited resource have proven difficult. Rising agricultural productivity, expanding
    urbanisation, growing industrialisation, and accelerating industry create competing
    demands for water. Most irrigation system issues in India are attributable to
    poor management of the built infrastructure, including ineffective monitoring
    of the water flow in the irrigation system, timeliness of the water flow in the
    irrigation system, inefficiencies, poor coordination with the irrigation department
    in preparing water demands and collecting water charges, poor repair of the irrigation
    system, and the inability to resolve conflicts between members and WUAs. In addition
    to managing, allocating, and distributing water, the government entities, which
    may go by the names of irrigation departments, municipal bodies, water boards,
    etc., also set and collect fees, have a role in crop patterns, and carry out operations
    and maintenance tasks. Under the restructured “Command Area Development & Water
    Management” (CADWM) Programme, more emphasis is given to the participatory approach.
    A further requirement for accepting the completion of the CADWM is the transfer
    of management and control of the irrigation system to the WUA. Numerous researchers
    in India have tried to assess various aspects of the effectiveness of WUAs. Based
    on such studies, it is challenging to draw broad conclusions regarding the effects
    of WUAs because of various variables, including their location and the degree
    of user interaction. Large-scale public irrigation systems require complex processes
    that are highly context-specific for cooperative action to be successful. In addition

    A further requirement for accepting the completion of the CADWM is the transfer
    of management and control of the irrigation system to the WUA [3]. Numerous researchers
    in India have tried to assess various aspects of the effectiveness of WUAs. Based
    on such studies, it is challenging to draw broad conclusions regarding the effects
    of WUAs because of various variables, including their location and the degree
    of user interaction. Large-scale public irrigation systems require complex processes
    that are highly context-specific for cooperative action to be successful. The
    objective of the present study is to provide a methodology to effortlessly rank
    the WUAs, treating them as DMUs (Decision-Making Units), for further investigation
    into their efficiencies and inefficiencies to improve their overall performance.
    The current study was carried out in two stages. In the first stage, the performance
    of a selected nine canals is analysed using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methods
    such as VRS input and output-oriented and a non-oriented slack-based method (SBM).
    The second stage is focused on ranking canals using Shannon’s Entropy method blended
    with adopted DEA methods. The canals are grouped as efficient and inefficient
    by segregating and ranking the DMUs by obtaining Comprehensive Efficiency Scores
    (CES) for all the canals for all years. It recommends a precise procedure to decide
    which of the blended methods to use to rank canals. The ranks obtained by CES
    values using VRSIP can be considered for further investigation of canals. Description
    of the Study Area The study has been carried out in Jharkhand State, which has
    made a policy decision to transfer the whole irrigation system management to the
    users (farmers) group since 2014. The state has also enacted rules under the Jharkhand
    Participatory Irrigation Management Rules to provide legal recognition to the
    Water Users’ Association (2014). Since the performance of WUAs functioning at
    different locations using different water sources is expected to be different
    because of heterogeneity in physical and other characteristics, a major canal
    irrigation project in Jharkhand State was selected based on the available data
    and consultation with the irrigation bureaucrats. The Kanchi Irrigation Scheme
    is a very important project of Jharkhand state that provides irrigation to 23
    villages in the Sonahatu and Ichagarh blocks of Seraikela district, 44 villages
    in the Tamar block of Ranchi district, and 14 villages in the Arki blocks of Khunti
    district. In this project, the intended irrigation potential is 17,800 hectares,
    the CCA is 21,235 hectares, and the GCA is 34,210 hectares. The Government of
    India’s Second Five-Year Plan (1956–1961) included the design for the Kanchi Irrigation
    Scheme. The building project began in 1958 and was finished in 1966. The Kanchi
    irrigation scheme’s main construction site is in the village of Churki in the
    Khunti district, which is located at a latitude of 25°07′30″ S and a longitude
    of 85°09′30″ E. The main canal of the Kanchi Irrigation Scheme is 18.29 kilometres
    long. Tamar branch canal, with a total length of 13.27 km and a discharge capacity
    of slightly under 150 cusecs, exits from its right bank at 18.23 km. Under the
    auspices of CADWM, this branch canal has undergone rehabilitation work, including
    pavement. The Adradih Branch Canal’s bank has been damaged, and the structures
    are in poor condition. There is only partial irrigation because the water output
    from this canal is substantially lower than the canal’s overall capacity. Methodological
    studies on the topic and case studies conducted in various nations were used to
    construct the theoretical foundation for evaluating the performance of the WUAs
    under the Kanchi Canal irrigation project. In addition, records from the Water
    Resources Department, Ranchi Division, and WUAs were consulted for information
    about the Kanchi Irrigation Scheme, and field surveys were conducted with WUA
    members about the functioning of WUAs. Altogether, a sample of 09 WUAs concerning
    09 canals as DMUs were selected, and four years of field-level data were collected
    on various costs and outputs covered in the field study as Table 1: Table 1. Inputs
    and outputs for the study. The names of the DMUs are Amlesha, Babaikund, Kokadih,
    Hesadih, Konkadih, Jargodih, Hartaldih, Chitri, and Tiruldih (Appendix A). Section
    2 details the literature review, followed by Section 3, which describes the methodology
    and models used. Section 4 brings forth the analysis, and Section 5 details the
    research conclusions. 2. Literature Review A large and growing body of literature
    has investigated irrigation, agricultural projects, and the Water Users’ Associations’
    efficiency using various DEA and other combination methods. Therefore, this section
    brings forth some of these studies. The DEA and MCDM combination methods were
    deployed to test various irrigation projects in Sri Ramsagar, Andhra Pradesh,
    India [4]. The results from DEA analysis were compared with results obtained from
    various MCDM methods like PROMETHEE and EXPROM. Interestingly, all the results
    obtained were found to be similar. The same authors, Raju and Kumar, deployed
    a fuzzy DEA model to evaluate the performance of the sixteen irrigation systems
    of the Mahi Bajaj Sagar project [5]. A substantial difference between ranking
    patterns and efficiency values was noticed before and after the cross-efficiency
    matrix analysis. The impact of irrigation type and other related variables on
    the efficiency of irrigation water in western Kansas was investigated [6]. A weak
    relationship was found between the level of excess irrigation water and the type
    of irrigation system. A similar investigation was done on small irrigation projects
    in the North Province of South Africa [7]. The results prove that crop choice,
    landownership, land size, irrigation type, and irrigation method deployed demonstrated
    a significant impact on water efficiency. Thereby, the DEA, in combination with
    other methods, has found its use in various studies [8,9,10,11,12,13,14]. The
    efficiency of WUAs was explored in Tunisia using DEA models in [15]. The study
    measured WUA efficiency and engineering and management sub-vector efficiencies
    using modified DEA models. An efficiency of more than 18% was achieved through
    WUA operations. However, based on scale efficiency, WUAs were not found to be
    efficient. Likewise, a study in Tunisia was done using inverse DEA models, and
    results show that farmers who were found to be more technically efficient had
    higher irrigation water demand functions [16]. Such farmers were found to be able
    to afford water prices but adjust to a limited extent for changes in demand. DEA
    was also deployed to measure the irrigation efficiencies of WUAs in the Samrat
    Ashok Sagar project in India [17]. From the findings of the research, the WUAs
    were found to be below 70% efficiency and to be affected by independent variables.
    The WUAs were also evaluated in Calabria, Italy, by deploying DEA models [18].
    From the analysis, the cost recovery of WUAs was found to be low, excess water
    was delivered, and the water service was underutilised. Studies related to water
    and agricultural efficiencies found more in China. DEA techniques based on input–output
    technical efficiency and sub-vector efficiencies for irrigation were analysed
    for water use [19]. By using inputs more efficiently, the wheat farmers could
    increase their production by approximately 38%. The determinants of water efficiency
    were explored for China in the Guanzhong Plan using stochastic frontier analysis
    [20]. Management reforms, water prices, farm level, and disclosure were found
    to be important factors affecting water use efficiency. A case study on the Heihe
    river basin in China was studied to understand the impact of water-use efficiency
    on the water consumption of agricultural production [21]. The results also indicate
    that economic growth, agricultural investment, and agricultural plants’ structural
    adjustment significantly influence agricultural water use efficiency. Based on
    the stochastic frontier analysis model, by taking data from 31 provinces in China,
    agricultural water use efficiency was examined [22]. The efficiency of water use
    was found to be influenced by the proportion of high school education and rural
    household income. Apart from the two, the storage capacity of reservoirs, the
    number of water-saving machines, the sown area of crops, and the number of motors
    also influenced the efficiency. DEA analysis was also deployed to find the relative
    water use efficiency of the 31 provinces of China in green-blue water and blue-only
    conditions [23]. The pure technical efficiency and the technical efficiency of
    green-blue conditions were found to be relatively high. However, the potential
    for blue-water efficiency was found to be high. In a similar region, the projection
    pursuit model is deployed, and thereby overall efficiency is determined for all
    31 provinces in China [24]. Provinces with high, medium, and low efficiency were
    identified, but in some provinces, the environmental quality of the water was
    reduced due to various factors. Research Gap There is a need to understand economic,
    social, and environmental perspectives towards sustainable water management in
    irrigation [25]. Thereby, there is a need to understand various issues in irrigation
    management systems and the contributions of WUAs. The water investments by the
    government need to understand the objectives of land area irrigated and irrigation
    modernisation [13]. The study attempts to evaluate the investments and user charges
    collected by WUAs in Jharkhand state. 3. Methodology The term “technical efficiency”
    first appeared in economic literature in the early 1950s when ref. [26] described
    it as an input–output vector that is technically efficient if and only if increasing
    any output or decreasing any input is possible only by increasing any other input
    or decreasing any other output. This definition is regarded as a Pareto–Koopmans
    condition of technical efficiency in economics. By creating a linear programming
    (LP) model utilising real input–output data from a sample of businesses, ref.
    [27] expanded on Koopmans’ work and made a ground-breaking contribution. The application
    of [27]’s linear programming methods eventually influenced [28] to develop DEA.
    Because DEA makes fewer assumptions about the nature of technology and mathematical
    programming techniques that can be used to obtain pointwise estimates of the production
    function, it is preferable to its archrival SFA (Suitability, Feasibility, and
    Acceptability) in the current context. DEA’s inherent advantages include its ability
    to easily handle multiple inputs and outputs. This is a significant benefit given
    the typical lack of such information. Third, unlike SFA, which attempts to correlate
    a DMU’s performance with statistical averages, DEA determines the inefficiency
    of a specific DMU by comparing it with comparable DMUs that are considered to
    be efficient. Additionally, this method aids in evaluating the causes of inefficiency,
    such as inefficiency brought on by scale or size (scale inefficiency) and/or management
    methods (pure technical inefficiency). 3.1. Selection of the Model Efficiency
    is determined by either modifying inputs or outputs in the fundamental CCR [28]
    model based on constant returns to scale (CRS) and the BCC (Banker, Charnes, and
    Cooper 1984) model based on Variable Returns to Scale (VRS) models, i.e., either
    the input-oriented model (IP) or output-oriented model (OP). An input-orientation
    model creates the intended result with the fewest possible inputs. On the other
    hand, the output orientation paradigm maximises outputs while maintaining a constant
    quantity of input. The BCC model [29] and the radial CCR model also have this
    flaw: they fail to account for efficiencies’ slacks. Therefore, to compensate
    for this flaw, efficiency scores might occasionally be calculated using the “slack-based
    model” (SBM) proposed by [30]. A non-oriented SBM model is used when inputs and
    outputs can be altered simultaneously, meaning the DMU can decrease inputs while
    increasing outputs. To maximise efficiency, managers can use this approach to
    work on both inputs and outcomes. The SBM model was used [31] to examine the effectiveness
    of public hospitals in Uttarakhand, India. The output-oriented paradigm and other
    input-oriented models have been used in several investigations. In most cases,
    choosing the orientation (input or output) for evaluating efficiency is challenging,
    so reducing input levels or raising output levels is not admirable. Therefore,
    in the literature, ref. [32] employed the orientation-independent CCR model, the
    orientation-dependent BCC model, as well as the non-oriented and non-radial SBM-DEA
    model. Moreover, the authors studied the efficiency scores of the hotels and restaurants
    in India using combined Data Envelopment Analysis and Shannon’s Entropy. In the
    present study, we followed similar lines of [32] procedure to evaluate the efficiencies
    and performance of the selected nine canals. 3.2. DEA with Shannon’s Entropy The
    number of DMUs may be divided into two disjoint groups, efficient and inefficient,
    using DEA methods such as CCR, BCC, SBM, etc. However, it is time-consuming to
    rank all of the DMUs or determine which is the most effective among the effective
    DMUs. There are several approaches available in the literature to rate the DMUs,
    including super efficiency [33], cross-efficiency [34], minimum and maximum efficiency
    scores [35], maximal balance index [36], etc. When ranking the DMUs with the techniques,
    a specific model is considered along with the provided dataset. The process of
    choosing the study’s variables can be difficult at times. In these circumstances,
    it was advised to test every DEA model available [37,38,39,40]. Then, using Shannon’s
    Entropy, a total score is produced based on the combined data. Shannon’s Entropy
    combined with DEA is also used in engineering fields such as the composition of
    drug gel [41] and choosing experimental parameters [42]. In this work, we used
    the [30] methodology to rank the DMUs using comprehensive efficiency scores (CES).
    The chosen strategy is demonstrated below. Steps for Combined Shannon’s Entropy
    and DEA: Step 1: Select datasets. Step 2: Create every feasible pairing of the
    initial dataset’s input and output subgroups is 𝑳=( 𝟐 𝒎 −𝟏)( 𝟐 𝒔 −𝟏) . Step 3:
    Determine the relative efficiency scores of each DMU by evaluating the efficiency
    scores using DEA models (VRS-IP, VRS-OP, and SBM non-oriented). As 𝑬 𝒋𝒍 Variable
    Returns to Scale (VRS) models, i.e., either the input-oriented model (IP) or output-oriented
    model (OP) slack-based method (SBM). Step 4: Using the matrix ( 𝑬 𝒋𝒍 ) 𝒏𝑿𝑳 , determine
    the set 𝒆 𝒋𝒍 = 𝑬 𝒋𝒍 ∑ 𝒏 𝒋=𝟏 𝑬 𝒋𝒍 . Step 5: Determine the level of diversification
    set 𝒅 𝒍 =𝟏− 𝒇 𝒍  𝒘𝒉𝒆𝒓𝒆  𝒇 𝒍 = −𝟏 ln(𝒏) ∑ 𝒏 𝒋=𝟏 𝒆 𝒋𝒍 ln( 𝒆 𝒋𝒍 ). Step 6: Determine
    the CES as 𝜃 𝑗 = ∑ 𝑙=1 𝐿 𝑤 𝑙  𝐸 𝑗𝑙 , where 𝑤 𝑙 = 𝑑 𝑙 ∑ 𝐿 𝑙=1 𝑑 𝑙 , such that ∑
    𝐿 𝑙=1 𝑤 𝑙 =1 . Utilising the mathematical software (Version 22) MATLAB, the findings
    of the DEA with Shannon’s Entropy model are provided. 4. Results and Discussion
    The current study was carried out in two stages. Commissioned in the 1960s, the
    Kanchi River Canal Project, which gets its waters from the Kanchi River, is spread
    over 150 kilometres and is a source of irrigation for 17,800 hectares of land
    cultivated by over 50,000 farmers in five blocks in Khunti, Ranchi, and Seraikela-Kharsawan
    districts of the state. The canal starts in Ranchi district, flows through Khunti,
    and ends in Seraikela Kharsawan. But neglect and the fact that large tracts of
    the canal continue to be kuccha (non-lined and uncemented) have led to the water
    drying up in large tracts, complain the farmers. The farmers said that they have
    agitated several times to draw attention to the disuse of the Kanchi canal. The
    Irrigation Department of the Government of Jharkhand acknowledged that farmers
    were suffering due to a lack of repairs. The work at a cost of INR 12 lakhs had
    been taken up, and the irrigation department had sent a detailed project report
    to the state government about the repairs needed at an expected cost of INR 65
    lakhs. In view of the importance of the project and the ongoing and proposed repair
    and rehabilitation work, the study was undertaken for the reference period of
    2018 to 2021. In the first stage, the performance of a selected nine canals in
    India is analysed using DEA methods such as VRS input and output-oriented and
    a non-oriented slack-based method (SBM). The second stage is focused on ranking
    canals using Shannon’s Entropy method blended with adopted DEA methods. Results
    are shown in Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4 and Figure 1 of the selected nine canal
    datasets for the years 2018–2021. Table 2 shows the efficiencies of all canals
    from 2018 to 2021 using VRSIP, VRSOP, and SBM. It is evident from Table 2 that
    the number of efficient canals and the DMUs are the same under the adopted methods
    in the respective years. Canal 7 is not efficient in all years, and Canal 5 is
    efficient in 3 years. There is no canal efficiency in all four years. Five canals
    have shown efficiency in 2018, four in 2021, three in 2019, and only two in 2020.
    Neglected during the COVID pandemic as a result of group activities and meetings
    of WUAs and also the adverse functioning of the government offices due to restrictions
    and lockdown led to the water drying up in large tracts. This, in turn, has affected
    the trend in efficiency of DMUs during the period with the worst performance in
    the year 2020. It is undecidable to group canals as efficient or inefficient,
    as the number of efficient canals is not the same in all years. A new methodology
    is needed to segregate and rank canals. The adopted methods are blended with Shannon’s
    Entropy to obtain comprehensive efficiency scores, or CES. Table 3 shows the captivating
    CES of all canals for all the years. Primarily, Canal 7 has obtained the lowest
    CES among all canals in all years under the respective adopted methods. It is
    noticeable that every canal has a non-repeated CES in its respective years. It
    enables us to rank canals effortlessly, as shown in Table 4. From Table 4, it
    is observed that canals are ranked in sporadic order from year to year. The adopted
    blended method is merely beneficial for ranking canals effortlessly. Figure 1.
    Location of Kanchi Irrigation Project. Table 2. Efficiencies of canals from 2018
    to 2021 using VRSIP, VRSOP, and SBM. Table 3. Comprehensive efficiency scores
    of all canals from 2018 to 2021. Table 4. Ranks of all canals using VRSIP, VRSOP,
    and SBM CES. Nevertheless, it is difficult to make a decision on the ranks obtained
    by the blended methods. Therefore, it recommends a precise procedure to decide
    which of the blended methods to use to rank canals. A typical linear fit procedure
    and coefficient of determination value benefit in deciding on the ranks obtained
    by adopted methods. The linear fit between ranks obtained by CES values evaluated
    using adopted methods and coefficient of determination values is illustrated in
    Figure 2a–d. Figure 2a,c shows that the coefficient of determination value is
    very low between the ranks obtained by the CES values of VRSOP and SBM. The coefficient
    of determination value between ranks obtained by CES values of VRSIP and VRSOP
    is medium in Figure 2a–c. It is evident from Figure 2a–d that there is a strong
    relationship between ranks obtained by CES values of VRSIP and SBM methods. From
    all the figures, it can be noted that medium and strong relationships can be considered
    one of the adopted methods to decide the ranks of canals. Ranks obtained by CES
    values using VRSIP are mostly in medium and strong relation to ranks obtained
    using CES values of VRSOP and SBM methods, respectively. It emphasises that ranks
    obtained by CES values using VRSIP can be considered for further investigation
    of canals. Figure 2. Linear fit and Coefficient of determination values between
    ranks obtained by CES values evaluated using adopted methods from 2018 to 2021.

    at 95% confidence level (significance level of 0.05), and the Significance F results
    are mentioned below in Table 5 for your reference. Table 5. Statistical significance
    of the results. 5. Conclusions DEA is a technique that evaluates the relative
    efficiency of multiple DMUs in achieving a specific set of outputs from a given
    set of inputs. The DEA methods used in the study include VRSIP, VRSOP, and SBM.
    VRSIP is an input-oriented method that compares the actual input–output ratios
    of a DMU with the optimal input–output ratios of other DMUs in the same dataset.
    VRSOP is an output-oriented method that evaluates technical efficiency from an
    output perspective. At the same time, SBM is a method that focuses on the degree
    of slack or unused resources associated with each DMU. Based on the analysis using
    different types of Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methods, the technical efficiency
    of different Decision-Making Units (DMUs) over a four-year period was observed
    in the study. The efficiency scores obtained from VRSOP were generally higher
    than those obtained from VRSIP, and the efficiency scores obtained from SBM were
    generally lower than those obtained from both VRSIP and VRSOP. Ranks obtained
    by CES values using VRSIP are mostly in medium and strong relation to ranks obtained
    using CES values of VRSOP and SBM methods, respectively. It emphasises that ranks
    obtained by CES values using VRSIP can be considered for further investigation
    of canals. The efficiency scores of nine DMUs (Decision-Making Units) for four
    consecutive years, 2018–2021, using the VRSIP (Variable Returns to Scale—Input-oriented)
    approach in Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) were obtained. The scores range from
    0 to 1, with higher scores indicating higher efficiency. The efficiency of DMUs
    varied from year to year. Canal 5 was identified as the most efficient DMU overall,
    with comprehensive efficiency scores of 0.9667, 0.9604, 0.7245, and 0.9325 for
    the years 2018, 2019, 2020, and 2021, respectively. Canal 5 was the most consistently
    efficient DMU, with efficiencies of 1 in most years. Canal 7 was the least efficient
    DMU, with efficiencies ranging from 0.7346 to 0.879 over the four-year period.
    Comprehensive efficiency scores (CES) provide an overall picture of the efficiency
    of DMUs over the four-year period, considering all inputs and outputs. In the
    context of irrigation system management, DEA can be used to evaluate the technical
    efficiency of different DMUs. By identifying the most efficient DMUs and highlighting
    areas where others fall short, DEA can provide insights into ways to improve irrigation
    system management policies and practises. The Jharkhand State has implemented
    a policy of transferring the management of irrigation systems to farmer groups
    since 2014, when the Jharkhand Participatory Irrigation Management Rules were
    implemented. The policy and the rules involve the management of irrigation water
    supply and related infrastructure to ensure that water is distributed equitably
    and efficiently to farmers. The policies also involve measures to promote the
    use of modern irrigation technologies and farming practises that conserve water.
    Nine Water Users’ Associations (WUAs) were selected from Kanchi canal command
    areas based on available data and discussions with irrigation department officials.
    Data for the study was collected from two sources: the sample farmers and the
    records of the nine selected Water Users’ Associations (WUAs) in the study area.
    A total of 99 farmers were randomly selected for the study. The sample farmers
    were chosen randomly from lists provided by each WUA and represented a range of
    farm sizes, including small, medium, and large. According to the Input cost study,
    the formation and registration fees for the WUAs in Jharkhand were jointly paid
    by both the WUA members and the MoWR of the Jharkhand government, indicating a
    shared interest in establishing and recognising the WUAs as part of the government’s
    policy to transfer irrigation system management to farmer groups. WUAs collect
    fees from their members to finance the operations and maintenance of the irrigation
    system, and the cost of holding regular meetings includes various expenses such
    as venue rental, transportation, refreshments, and materials. The study’s findings
    show that in the case of Canal 5 (Konkadih distributory), the WUAs were able to
    leverage the government’s investment in meetings and training through a comparatively
    higher collection of user charges from their members. This was evident in the
    members participation in the meetings. The investment by the government in O&M
    costs was also leveraged to increase the contribution and value of such works
    undertaken by WUA. With better availability of water, the cropped area increased,
    and crop diversification happened. Whereas the area under food grain cultivation
    increased, the area under non-food grain crops also increased due to their higher
    profitability. The accountability for irrigation water use has increased with
    the introduction of WUAs, resulting in a rise in the irrigated area. The increase
    in the irrigated area was around 35% in the summer, while in the kharif and rabi
    seasons, it was around 23% and 16%, respectively. Field observation of Canal 7
    (Hartaldih) revealed that the canal is providing only partial irrigation as it
    is damaged and in a poor state of maintenance. Overall, the analysis of technical
    efficiency using DEA methods provides insights into the performance of WUAs in
    Jharkhand. The findings can be used to identify best practises and areas for improvement
    and inform the development of policies and strategies to support the sustainable
    management of irrigation systems. Author Contributions Conceptualization, J.N.;

  description: The accurate prediction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from paddy
    fields is critical for developing mitigation strategies to reduce emissions, while
    realizing the large-scale prediction of GHG emissions from paddy fields remains
    to be a challenge. Here, we established machine learning models to predict the
    GHG emissions from Chinese paddy systems using a dataset including 782 CH4 and
    679 N2O emission observations based on 118 published studies across China. Our
    results identified XGBoost was the most suitable model with the outstanding efficiency
    and accuracy for predicting both CH4 (R2 = 0.754, RMSE = 0.485 kg ha−1) and N2O
    emissions (R2 = 0.762, RMSE = 0.423 kg ha−1) from rice fields in China. We found
    mineral and organic fertilizer rate, irrigation mode, straw returned proportion
    and tillage depth were key factors in regulating GHG emissions. Specifically,
    CH4 emissions trended to increase first and then decrease with increasing mineral
    nitrogen fertilizer rate, with the inflection point delayed under the application
    of organic fertilizer. On the other hand, N2O emissions continued to increase
    until the N fertilizer rate reached approximately 150 kg ha−1. The use of organic
    fertilizer, tillage, straw return in half and full quantity increased global warming
    potential (GWP) by 80.3 %, 33.8 %, 25.2 % and 111.6 %, respectively. Frequent
    drainage (FD) was identified as the most promising water management mode, with
    a higher potential for GHG emission mitigation of 39.5 % compared to continuous
    flooding, followed by mid-season drainage at 18.4 %. We found the combination
    of a mineral nitrogen fertilizer rate of 128 kg ha−1, FD water management, without
    straw, tillage, and organic fertilizer could achieve the most effective GHG emission
    mitigation, with a GWP of 3.13 Mg CO2 equivalent ha−1. Our findings provided a
    new insight for predicting GHG emissions from rice fields on a large scale, and
    offered guidance for mitigating GHG emissions from rice production in China.

    With the acceleration of global climate change, the mitigation of greenhouse gas
    (GHG) emissions has emerged as a serious international environmental issue. Agriculture
    ecosystems are responsible for approximately 50 % and 60 % of the total global
    CH4 and N2O emissions, respectively (Wu et al., 2017). As the second-largest rice
    cultivation country in the world, China accounts for 19 % of global paddy production
    area (Zhang et al., 2011), while rice cropping systems are major sources of CH4
    emissions. It was estimated that 6–10 Tg CH4 and 32–51 Gg N2O-N emissions were
    produced from Chinese rice fields each year (Wu et al., 2018, Li et al., 2021).
    Therefore, rice fields have great potential for mitigating GHG emissions, underscoring
    the importance of identifying the key factors that regulate CH4 and N2O emissions
    and optimizing agricultural management practices (AMPs) in rice production to
    achieve substantial reductions in GHG emissions from paddy soil. In recent years,
    many studies have focused on the impact of fertilization, straw, irrigation mode
    and other field management practices on GHG emissions from paddy soil and have
    made recommendations for future rice cultivation. For example, since the application
    of nitrogen fertilizer significantly stimulates both CH4 and N2O emissions, some
    have proposed the optimal nitrogen fertilizer application rate at 225 kg N ha−1
    to achieve the balance of yield and GHG emissions (Zhong et al., 2016). In addition,
    some water-saving irrigation modes, such as alternate wetting and drying (AWD),
    intermittent flooding (IF), and mid-season drainage (MD, i.e., flooding-drainage-reflooding),
    have been advocated to reduce CH4 emissions and water consumption in paddy fields
    (Islam et al., 2020, Liao et al., 2020). However, the decision-making for the
    optimal management practices in different paddy fields remains to be a challenge,
    since the results of case studies are not necessarily suitable for other paddy
    fields considering the differences in soil and climate, and their conduction were
    time-consuming and labor-intensive (Liang et al., 2022). In order to predict the
    agricultural GHG emissions more effectively, some process-based agricultural ecosystem
    models, such as the Root Zone Water Quality Model2 (RZWQM2) and Denitrification-Decomposition
    model (DNDC) were developed to simulate crop cultivation, trace GHG emissions,
    and evaluate the effect of various AMPs on GHG emissions (Fumoto et al., 2008,
    Chun et al., 2015, Zhao et al., 2020). However, the utilization of these models
    requires professional knowledge and sufficient experience in the crop growth process
    and agro-environment for users, as the calibration and validation of these models
    are very complex (Hamrani et al., 2020). Furthermore, these models have limited
    generalization, as they are only applicable to the specified sites or regions,
    making their application at a large scale is challenging (Cao et al., 2021). To
    overcome these limitations, new robust methods are necessary to predict GHG emissions
    accurately and enable their migration applications to the large-scale scenarios
    with differences in climate, soil, and AMPs. Numerous previous studies have demonstrated
    that machine learning (ML) algorithm have a strong capacity to capture complex
    nonlinear associations between input parameters and target variables without explicitly
    programming functional relations, which makes it a great alternative to agro-ecosystem
    models (Cao et al., 2021, Alabdrabalnabi et al., 2022). Recently, some classical
    ML algorithms have been employed to study agricultural GHG emissions. For example,
    Maier et al. (2022) adopted the random forest (RF) model to gap-fill N2O and CH4
    fluxes and identified the most important drivers for GHG emissions in maize and
    pea cropping systems. Jiang et al. (2023) compared the performance of three ML
    models, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), RF, gradient boosting regression (GBR) and their
    stacking ensemble model for predicting GHG emissions from paddy fields. With advancement
    of ML, neural network models (NNM), an important class of ML algorithms, have
    garnered extensive attention due to the strong self-learning ability (Pu et al.,
    2019). Hamrani et al. (2020) employed several classical ML models and NNM to predict
    GHG emissions from agricultural soils, such as RF, long short-term memory network
    (LSTM), and convolutional neural network (CNN). However, these studies on the
    application of ML models to predict agriculture GHG emissions were mainly aimed
    at one-site field, and the factors involved were less comprehensive, which limited
    their generalization to the large scale. Being data-driven approach, the quality
    and quantity of data are critical for ML models, and the accuracy and generalization
    ability of these models would be influenced by the size of the dataset (Faber
    et al., 2016, Zhang and Ling, 2018, Gebru et al., 2021). Therefore, the availability
    of a comprehensive dataset is vital for the development of ML models in realizing
    the large-scale prediction of GHG emissions from paddy fields. To address these
    challenges, we proposed a novel approach to predict GHG emissions from paddy fields
    using robust ML models trained on an unprecedentedly comprehensive dataset. The
    trained models would enable the identification of the critical factors that impact
    CH4 and N2O emissions and exploration of the interactions among these factors.
    The objectives of this study were to: (a) construct a large-scale dataset that
    incorporates as many factors as possible related to GHG emissions from paddy fields;
    (b) compare the performance of different types of ML models, including classical
    ML and neural network models, to identify the best model for predicting CH4 and
    N2O emissions; (c) investigate how CH4 and N2O emissions were affected by various
    agricultural managements; and (d) provide guidelines for future rice production
    to mitigate GHG emissions. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Data collection The dataset
    of GHG emissions from rice fields in China was generated from peer-reviewed journal
    articles, identified through keyword searches of the Web of Science and the China
    Knowledge Resource Integrated Database. The search term used were “China and rice
    and N2O” and “China and rice and CH4”. To ensure the reliability and relevance
    of the data, the following criteria were applied: (1) the experiments must have
    been conducted under field conditions, (2) the cropping system must be either
    single or double rice-cropping system, (3) CH4 or N2O cumulative emissions during
    the growing season should be available either directly or through calculation,
    (4) the time and location of the field experiment must be clearly specified. Based
    on these criteria, 874 observations from 118 studies published before June 2022
    were included in the dataset, coving 19 provinces in China. The distribution of
    experimental sites is depicted in Fig. 1, with double rice experimental sites
    concentrated in the South and single rice cropping sites mainly found in the East,
    Central and Northeast, consistent with the distribution of China’s rice cropping
    regions (Chen et al., 2020). Download : Download high-res image (495KB) Download

    version 4.06 from https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/cru_ts_4.06/cruts.2205201912.v4.06/tmp/.
    To improve the accuracy of GHG emissions predictions, we collected comprehensive
    information on various factors that may influence emissions for each selected
    publication, including meteorology, soil properties, rice type, the type of cropping
    system, the duration of rice growth period, planting pattern and AMPs (e.g., tillage
    mode; fertilization management; irrigation mode; residue management). Climate
    data for each site was obtained from the nearest weather station, including the
    annual average atmospheric pressure (PRS), air temperature (TEM), 0 cm ground
    temperature (GST), relative humidity (RHU), window speed (WIN), sunshine duration
    (SSD) and accumulative precipitation (PRE), available from the National Meteorological
    Information Center (http://data.cma.cn/). As detailed soil characteristics were
    not available for all paddy fields, we utilized the Harmonized World Soil Database
    v1.2 (HWSD) to fill in the gaps. This global soil dataset has a resolution of
    1 km and includes information on soil texture, pH, soil organic matter (SOM) content,
    and total nitrogen (TN). In order to select the key features in the dataset (Li
    et al., 2022), enhance the visibility, and improve the interpretability of results,
    we classified the dataset according to the feature types for the convenience of
    the following analysis. Specifically, rice variety was classified into two groups:
    indica (n = 483 in CH4 and 411 in N2O) and japonica rice (n = 144 in CH4 and 112
    in N2O). The type of cropping system was divided into single (n = 264 in CH4 and
    253 in N2O) and double rice (n = 532 in CH4 and 441 in N2O). Planting pattern
    was classified as transplanting (n = 758 in CH4 and 648 in N2O) and direct seeding
    (n = 34 in CH4 and 32 in N2O). Fertilization frequency was divided into low (times
    2, n = 296 in CH4 and 268 in N2O) and high frequency (times 3, n = 469 in CH4
    and 411 in N2O). Rice growth period was classified as short (days 100, n = 481
    in CH4 and 406 in N2O) and long period (days 100, n = 316 in CH4 and 289 in N2O).
    Nitrogen fertilizer application rate was grouped as low (rate 100 kg N ha−1, n
    = 32 in CH4 and 27 in N2O), medium (100 kg N ha−1 rate 180 kg N ha−1, n = 114
    in CH4 and 125 in N2O) and high level (rate 180 kg N ha−1, n = 67 in CH4 and 59
    in N2O). Tillage mode was classified as no-tillage (n = 52 in CH4 and 50 in N2O)
    and tillage (n = 419 in CH4 and 364 in N2O), while nitrogen fertilizer type was
    divided into only inorganic (n = 599 in CH4 and 579 in N2O) or complemented with
    organic fertilizer (n = 79 in CH4 and 65 in N2O). Residue management was classified
    as straw removal (n = 186 in CH4 and 174 in N2O) and returning (n = 111 in CH4
    and 92 in N2O), and irrigation mode was grouped into continuous flooding (CF,
    n = 124 in CH4 and 120 in N2O), MD (n = 239 in CH4 and 182 in N2O), AWD or IF
    (n = 57 in CH4 and 63 in N2O) and flooding-drainage-intermittent flooding (MD
    + IF, n = 296 in CH4 and 253 in N2O). 2.2. Data analysis We used the natural log
    of the response ratio ( ) to quantify the impact of different AMPs on GHG emissions
    (Hedges et al., 1999): (1) where and are the mean GHG emissions of each observation
    under the treatment and control, respectively. In the analysis of the effect of
    agronomic practices, without distinguishing the tillage depth and residue proportion,
    the experiments with either tillage or residue returning were considered as treatments,
    while no-tillage or residue removal were considered as controls. In irrigation
    modes, we regarded CF as the control group, while other modes such as MD, AWD
    or IF, MD + IF were considered as the treatment groups. Regarding the N fertilizer
    type, experiments in which the applied N was sorely from inorganic fertilizer
    were considered as controls, while those containing organic fertilizer were considered
    as treatments. Specifically, the total applied N in the treatment group was equal
    to the control group to reflect the effect of N fertilizer type. In terms of the
    N fertilizer application rate, the N fertilizer application rate of zero was considered
    as the control group. The weighting factor (w) of each effect size measured as
    the inverse of the sampling variance (v) was calculated as follows: (2) where
    and are the number of replications of the treatment and control; and are the standard
    deviation under the treatment and control, respectively. To present the results
    more clearly, the weighted effect size was transformed into percentage of change,
    which was calculated and plotted in the R studio (Yang et al., 2022). And the
    effect of the factor corresponding to the treatment was assessed by the 95 % confidence
    interval (CI). If the 95 % CI did not overlap zero, the effect was considered
    significant. (3) However, due to data limitations, certain parameters can only
    be compared to a certain extent. To analyze the data for CH4 and N2O emissions
    in different climates, soil properties, rice varieties, cropping systems, planting
    patterns, fertilization frequency and rice growth periods, boxplot distributions
    were constructed. This approach allows for the calculation of the range and central
    tendencies of the data distribution by determining the minimum, median and interquartile
    range (IQR, the difference between the 25th and 75th interval). Moreover, the
    IQR value reflects the impact of relevant factors on gas emissions to some extent,
    as a smaller IQR means a greater effect (Prananto et al., 2020). Additionally,
    a t test was conducted to further determine the difference between the treatment
    and control groups, with significance set at p 0.05. 2.3. Machine learning models
    With the purpose of identifying the most accurate models for predicting CH4 and
    N2O emissions, various ML algorithms were employed, which can be categorized into
    two types, classical ML models (CM) and NNM. Specifically, CM included support
    vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost),
    while NNM included backpropagation neural network (BPNN) and one-dimension convolutional
    neural network (1D-CNN). These five models have a good coverage on commonly used
    ML regression models, among these, SVR is a classical supervised learning technique
    that can fit complex non-linear relationships in a shorter amount of time and
    computation space compared to other models (Qadri et al., 2020). RF is an ensemble
    of uncorrelated forests of trees that can maintain good performance when handling
    the large datasets with numerous predictors (Speiser et al., 2019, Srivastava
    et al., 2021). Based on the gradient descent and boosting architecture, XGBoost
    can achieve superior performance by continually updating the prediction model
    during training. Furthermore, the addition of an overfitting regulation function
    effectively reduces the risk of overfitting in the XGBoost model (Kim et al.,
    2021, Yoo et al., 2023). As ensemble decision tree (DT) algorithm, RF and XGBoost
    model can quantify and sequence the feature importance (Ma et al., 2018), which
    is crucial for our research purposes. Unlike CM, NNM (BPNN and 1D-CNN) based on
    layer structures have a strong ability to learn and store complex mapping relations
    of input–output. This is because the weights and thresholds in the network are
    constantly updated to produce predictive results that are sufficiently close to
    the true values (Hu et al., 2019, Pu et al., 2019). 2.3.1. Data preprocessing
    In this study, a total of 782 CH4 and 679 N2O emission observations were used
    for modeling. For the samples with missing AMPs information, we filled in the
    missing values according to local traditional practices (Xu et al., 2010, Zhang
    et al., 2011, Paudel et al., 2022). Additionally, some parameters, such as irrigation
    mode, rice variety, the type of cropping systems, were classified-type and non-numeric,
    so one-hot encoding was used to convert them into a format that the computer can
    recognize. This encoding can also eliminate the influence of difference in digitized
    value on model performance (Yu et al., 2020). The irrigation mode was divided
    into three categories according to drainage frequency, including CF, MD and frequent
    drainage (FD). Specifically, FD included AWD, IF, and MD + IF. Besides, the final
    drainage before harvest was not considered. For dataset, those redundant features
    with no significant effect on GHG emissions can be eliminated based on the statistical
    analysis results. This approach aimed to enhance model learning efficiency and
    simplify learning outcomes, as demonstrated by Cai et al. (2018). To avoid overfitting
    and enhance model reliability, the dataset was randomly spilt into training set
    and testing set in the ratio of 7:3 (Zheng et al., 2021). 2.3.2. Model execution
    and hyperparameters determination Hyperparameters tuning is an essential part
    of modeling, as it directly affects the performance of the model (Yang and Shami,
    2020). However, each algorithm has its own specific hyperparameters, and the optimization
    process is different among them (Hamrani et al., 2020). To select the best-performing
    hyperparameter combinations, grid search was applied in CM and random search was
    applied in NNM, as their hyperparameter configuration spaces differ. The initialized
    searching space was set manually based on commonly used parameters in previous
    literatures (Hamrani et al., 2020, Che et al., 2022). Additionally, 10-fold cross-validation
    was utilized in tuning process to ensure the optimum hyperparameters were tested
    on the entirety of the training set, making the model’s generalization more reliable
    (Phillip et al., 2022). To prevent overfitting, the early-stopping strategy was
    integrated into the NNM training process to halt training when performance started
    to become non-improving or erratic (Nevavuori et al., 2019, Vilares Ferro et al.,
    2022). 2.3.3. Model evaluation To compare the performances for predicting GHG
    emissions among different models, the accuracy of each model was qualified by
    five commonly used regression evaluation indices, namely coefficient of determination
    (R2), adjust R2 ( ), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE),
    which were computed by the following formulas (Eq (4)-Eq (7)): (4) (5) (6) (7)
    where and denote the value of gas observation and prediction respectively, n indicates
    the number of observations in testing set, k is the number of factors as model
    input and is the mean of . was used as the score to determine the optimal hyperparameters
    combination in cross validation. Compared with , takes the number of input features
    into account, making up the deficiency of . Moreover, the discrepancy between
    and indicates whether some trivial features were contained in the model, leading
    to a more objective evaluation of the model''s fitting performance (Lashari et
    al., 2021). 2.4. Recommendation for mitigation emission strategies To aid in the
    development of mitigation emission strategies for paddy systems, several scenarios
    were created to investigate the effect of input feature variation on the prediction
    results of CH4 and N2O emissions. Based on actual practices in rice fields, five
    controllable input features were selected, including mineral fertilizer rate,
    organic fertilizer rate, straw returned proportion, irrigation mode, and tillage
    depth. Specifically, mineral fertilizer rate varied from 0 to 250 kg N ha−1, which
    covered 95 % of the variation range of mineral fertilizer rate in the dataset.
    For other features, different levels were selected based on the mean of the dataset
    or common field management practices, such as organic fertilizer rate (0 and 60
    kg ha−1), straw returned proportion (0, 0.5 and 1), tillage depth (0 and 20 cm),
    and irrigation mode (CF, MD and FD). Using the selected best model (with the highest
    ), the average prediction of CH4 or N2O emissions across the dataset was recorded
    for each management practice combination. To comprehensively evaluate the greenhouse
    effect introduced by the GHG emissions, the global warming potential (GWP) was
    calculated, following guidelines from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change
    (IPCC, 2021). (8) 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Model input features selection
    3.1.1. Meteorological factors To identify meteorological factors that significantly
    affect GHG emissions, the statistical distributions of CH4 and N2O emissions were
    plotted in Fig. 2a, b for seven meteorological factors. The results indicated
    that atmospheric pressure was a key factor regulating CH4 emission. The 25th percentile,
    median and 75th percentile of CH4 emissions under low pressure (L_PRS) were significantly
    (p 0.0001) greater that those under high pressure (H_PRS), indicating that rising
    atmospheric pressure could suppress CH4 emissions, while falling pressure could
    promote its emissions, due to the effect of barometric pumping phenomenon (Xu
    et al., 2014). However, there was no significant difference in PRS (p = 0.6341)
    for N2O emissions. In addition, the temperature of the rice field also strongly
    affected the emission of these two GHG, especially N2O, which is mainly due to
    the harsh requirements of nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria on temperature
    when carrying out related activities (Castaldi, 2000). Download : Download high-res

    of CH4 and N2O emissions from different meteorological conditions (a)-(b), soil
    conditions (c)-(d), growth period durations, rice types and planting patterns
    (e)-(f). Air humidity and precipitation can directly affect soil moisture, which
    is closely related to GHG emissions (Liao et al., 2020). The results showed N2O
    emissions under low precipitation (L_PRE) were significantly (p = 0.0109) stimulated
    due to increased soil aeration and nitrification (Hou et al., 2012). However,
    the median and 75th percentile of CH4 emissions under high relative humidity (H_RHU)
    and high precipitation (H_PRE) were lower than those under low relative humidity
    (L_RHU) and low precipitation (L_PRE), respectively. This contradicts the findings
    from some studies that high soil moisture contributes to create an anaerobic condition
    for the CH4 production from methanogenic bacteria (Zhang et al., 2012, Liao et
    al., 2020). The reasons for this phenomenon may come from two aspects. Firstly,
    the rice fields are often inundated, and the impact of precipitation and humidity
    on the soil is weakened. Secondly, the region with low precipitation and humidity
    has a greater probability of planting single-cropping rice, which emits higher
    CH4 than early or late rice (Fig. 2e). Moreover, wind speed and solar radiation
    were also important factors affecting water temperature in rice fields, and thus
    influencing GHG emissions (Kuwagata et al., 2008). Significant differences were
    observed in N2O emissions under different levels of SSD (p 0.0001) and WIN (p
    = 0.0355), while only under different WIN (p = 0.0164) for CH4 emissions, indicating
    that field conditions with greater solar radiation and wind speed would increase
    GHG emissions. 3.1.2. Soil properties In addition to soil temperature and water
    content, soil texture also plays a crucial role in regulating CH4 and N2O fluxes
    by controlling their diffusive transport in the soil (Kolb, 2009). As expected,
    significant differences were observed in silt (p = 0.0019) and clay (p < 0.0001)
    content for CH4 emissions (Fig. 2c), and in clay content (p = 0.0001) for N2O
    emissions (Fig. 2d). Furthermore, the results showed that CH4 emissions from acid
    soil were significantly (p = 0.0005) lower than those from alkaline soil. This
    could be due to the fact that neutral or slightly alkaline conditions can promote
    the activity of methanogens (Le Mer and Roger, 2001). Similar results were observed
    in N2O emissions. Moreover, the SOM (p 0.0001) and TN (p = 0.0238) content of
    soil also had significant effects on CH4 emissions, as SOM and TN provide substrates
    and nutrition for methanogens (Humphreys et al., 2019). Note: H_PRS and L_PRS
    indicated high ( 100 KPa) and low ( 100 KPa) pressure. H_TEM and L_TEM indicated
    high ( 17 °C) and low ( 17 °C) temperature. H_GST and L_GST indicated high ( 19
    °C) and low ( 19 °C) 0 cm ground temperature. H_RHU and L_RHU indicated high (
    75 %) and low ( 75 %) relative humidity. H_WIN and L_WIN indicated high ( 2 m
    s−1) and low ( 2 m s−1) wind speed. H_SSD and L_SSD indicated high ( 5 h) and
    low ( 5 h) sunshine duration. H_PRE and L_PRE indicated high ( 136 cm) and low
    ( 136 cm) precipitation. H_Silt and L_Silt indicated high ( 41 %) and low ( 41
    %) soil silt content. H_Clay and L_Clay indicated high ( 21 %) and low ( 21 %)
    soil clay content. H_SOM and L_SOM indicated high ( 31 g kg−1) and low ( 31 g
    kg−1) soil organic matter. H_TN and L_TN indicated high ( 2 g kg−1) and low (
    2 g kg−1) total nitrogen. H_PH and L_PH indicated high ( 7) and low ( 7) pH. 3.1.3.
    Agricultural management practices (AMPs) To investigate the impact of various
    AMPs on GHG emissions, we generated the statistical distributions of CH4 and N2O
    emissions under different AMPs in the form of boxplots (Fig. 2e–f) and orchard
    plot (Nakagawa et al., 2021) (Fig. 3). The results indicated that the cropping
    system type had a significant effect on CH4 emissions (p = 0.0014). Furthermore,
    planting pattern (p 0.0001), rice growth period (p 0.0001), and cropping system
    type (p 0.0001) significantly affected N2O emissions. Download : Download high-res

    agricultural management practices on CH4 and N2O emissions. The orchard plots
    showed mean estimate, confidence interval (bold line), prediction interval (fine
    line), individual effect sizes and their precision (inverse variance). As depicted
    in Fig. 3a, tillage, straw return, and organic fertilizer application increased
    CH4 emissions by 21.4 %, 76.1 % and 51.6 %, respectively, compared to no tillage,
    no straw, and no organic fertilizer. These practices improved soil fertility and
    provided dissolved organic C for microbial methanogens, thus prompting CH4 production
    (Feng et al., 2013). However, straw return and organic fertilizer significantly
    reduced N2O emissions by 33.7 % and 71.5 %, respectively, as the addition of organic
    fertilizer can inhibit the activity of denitrifying enzymes and reduce the nitrification
    potential, and thereafter mitigating N2O emissions (Zhang et al., 2022). Nevertheless,
    the effect of straw return on N2O emissions is still a subject of debate, as some
    studies have found that straw incorporation stimulated N2O emissions (Kim et al.,
    2014, Wang et al., 2016). This discrepancy among studies may be due to differences
    in residue retention mode, residue type, and soil properties, which require further
    investigation (Aulakh et al., 1991, Xia et al., 2014). In addition, the application
    of mineral N fertilizer significantly increased CH4 and N2O emissions, which were
    related to the level of N fertilizer (p 0.0001 for CH4; p = 0.0083 for N2O). At
    low and medium N application rates, CH4 emissions were increased by 14.1 % and
    18.0 % respectively, while the positive effect of high N fertilizer (14.9 %) on
    CH4 emissions was similar to that of the low N fertilizer level. Consequently,
    the increasing trend of CH4 emissions was not sustained continuously with increasing
    N fertilizer. Similarly, Yao et al. (2012) conducted a 3-year field study and
    found that methanotrophic bacteria had a higher nitrogen requirement than methanogens,
    implying that excessive nitrogen input could stimulate methane oxidation and reduce
    CH4 emissions. This pattern has also been observed in numerous previous studies
    (Kim et al., 2016, Kim et al., 2022). However, for N2O, the positive effect of
    N fertilizer was enhanced with increasing N fertilizer application rate, which
    was 40.9 %, 109.2 %, 113.5 % in low, medium and high N fertilizer level, respectively.
    Therefore, determining the optimal mineral N fertilizer rate is critical to minimize
    GWP of rice systems. In comparison to CF, drainage practices exhibited a significant
    reduction in CH4 emissions and an increase in N2O emissions. Among the irrigation
    modes investigated, both MD + IF (−59.9 %) and AWD or IF mode (−67 %) had a stronger
    mitigation effect on CH4 emissions compared to only conducting MD. These findings
    suggested a decreasing trend in CH4 emissions with increasing drainage frequency.
    The adoption of AWD and IF implies frequent drying-wetting alternations during
    the growing period, which affects soil carbon recycling processes (Zhang et al.,
    2012, Liao et al., 2020). These results were consistent with the meta-analysis
    by Wu et al. (2022), which found that frequent drainage disrupted the anaerobic
    environment necessary for CH4 production by methanogens. However, drainage-induced
    changes in soil moisture and redox potential can stimulate N2O emissions (Zhou
    et al., 2020). Due to data limitations, only MD + IF mode and AWD or IF mode were
    investigated for N2O emissions, and no significant difference (p = 0.2032) was
    observed between the two drainage modes. Based on the statistical analysis of
    all factors, we created four versions of the dataset. The first two, and were
    based on 20 and 18 selected features, respectively, for CH4 and N2O emissions
    prediction. The remaining two, and , were constructed using 28 original features
    for CH4 and N2O emissions, respectively. The specific features included in each
    dataset are shown in Table S1. 3.2. Prediction performance of ML models To investigate
    whether selected features can be used to predict CH4 and N2O emissions more accurately,
    four versions of dataset, , , , , were involved in each model training and testing
    respectively. 3.2.1. CH4 emissions Based on the trained models and testing set,
    the performance indices were calculated and presented in Table 1. Comprehensively
    considering the four performance indicators (R2, , MAE, and RMSE), for as dataset,
    XGBoost showed higher accuracy in predicting CH4 emissions among these five models,
    with R2 = 0.754 and  = 0.720, and lower MAE and RMSE than other models. When was
    used as the dataset, RF performed best with R2 = 0.749 and  = 0.719, although
    its MAE (0.334 kg ha−1) was slightly worse than that of XGBoost (0.304 kg ha−1).
    Notably, for almost all models, the R2 values based on dataset were greater than
    those based on . This was related to the definition of R2, which could not decrease
    even if some irrelevant variables were added to the model (Heinzl and Mittlböck,
    2002). Therefore, the indicator was introduced to solve the problem. However,
    a similar pattern was observed that based on was also greater than that based
    on , indicating that the removed features had little impact on CH4 emissions without
    statistical significance. Specially for RF, the indicator of dataset (0.719) exceeded
    that based on dataset (0.704), confirming that RF possesses the strong ability
    to extract characteristics by its ensemble property, even with less features (Zheng
    et al., 2021). Table 1. The performance of five ML models in CH4 emissions prediction.

    between 0 and 400 kg CH4 ha−1 were found around the diagonal, while few points
    with measured values exceeding 1000 kg CH4 ha−1 deviated from the diagonal. This
    deviation may be attributed to the fact that most of the CH4 emissions observed
    in the dataset fall within the range of 0 to 400 kg CH4 ha−1, accounting for 84.1
    %. Therefore, the models performed poorly when predicting those outliers, highlighting
    the weakness of ML models in handling outliers. It is noteworthy that the linear
    fit in the XGBoost model was remarkably closer to the diagonal than that in other
    models, indicating that XGBoost demonstrated superior performance in addressing
    complex nonlinear problems. Download : Download high-res image (523KB) Download

    emissions measured by XGBoost model (f). The line and shaded areas represent the
    linear fit with the 95 % confidence interval. Generally, the best model for CH4
    emissions prediction is -based XGBoost. However, considering that it is difficult
    to obtain such a comprehensive dataset as under most conditions, the performance
    of -based RF is also acceptable, which led to similar results with the best model
    by fewer features. 3.2.2. N2O emissions Based on the results presented in Table
    2, it can be observed that XGBoost outperformed other ML models in the prediction
    of N2O emissions for dataset, with an R2 value of 0.762 and an value of 0.722.
    On the other hand, for dataset, RF achieved more accurate predictive results with
    R2 = 0.746 and  = 0.719. However, SVR performed poorly in both (R2 = 0.694 and  =
    0.645) and (R2 = 0.686 and  = 0.655) datasets, mainly due to its over sensitivity
    to the regularization of model parameters (Shataee et al., 2012). It is worth
    noting that most models showed better performance based on dataset for N2O emissions.
    In the case of NNM, the performance of CNN and BPNN based on were significantly
    poorer than those based on , since information extraction from input features
    is an essential part for NNM, which was determined by its layer structure (Pu
    et al., 2019, Shahhosseini et al., 2021). Therefore, reducing the number of input
    parameters could significantly limit the performance of NNM. As shown in Fig.
    5a and c, the predicted N2O emissions were often underestimated in SVR and BPNN
    when the measured values exceeded 3 kg ha−1, and thus these points deviated from
    the diagonal. However, the performance of simulating outliers was greatly improved
    in XGBoost model, and the linear fit from dataset and were both closer to the
    diagonal (Fig. 5e). Regardless of the dataset type, XGBoost based on was selected
    as the best model to predict N2O emissions from paddy fields due to its excellent
    accuracy and explainability. Considering the data limitation, the -based RF is
    also a satisfying alternative, slightly inferior to the best model. Table 2. The

    the 95 % confidence interval. 3.2.3. Model comparison for predicting GHG emissions
    From a perspective of prediction accuracy, the results of this study suggested
    that DT models, specially XGBoost, could effectively predict GHG emissions from
    rice fields. Moreover, DT models exhibited significant advantages over NNM models,
    which is in line with many previous studies (Sanderson et al., 2020, Ahn et al.,
    2021). The transparent structure and timeliness of DT model are recognized as
    key advantages over NNM, as it does not require the optimization of network geometry
    and related parameters (Gharaei-Manesh et al., 2016). More importantly, XGBoost
    has been shown to be scalable and effective for prediction with tabular data,
    as demonstrated by its superiority in various scenarios (Chen and Guestrin, 2016,
    Kawano et al., 2022). However, the unsatisfactory performance of NNM could be
    attributed to the insufficient amount of dataset, since NNM is known for its strong
    fitting ability when processing massive high-dimensional data (Pu et al., 2019).
    In terms of computation time, a similar trend was observed in predicting CH4 and
    N2O emissions. The computational time cost of NNM is the largest, followed by
    DT (RF and XGBoost), while SVR was the most computationally efficient model, due
    to its simpler model structure. Compared to RF, the time and memory consumption
    were reduced largely in XGBoost model by its paralleling and distributed computation
    method (Chen and Guestrin, 2016, Pu et al., 2019). Accordingly, XGBoost was found
    to be particularly suitable for predicting CH4 and N2O emissions from paddy fields,
    due to its high efficiency and precision. 3.3. Feature importance analysis To
    identify the key factors influencing CH4 and N2O emissions from rice fields, we
    qualified and ranked the importance of each input feature using the XGBoost model
    (Fig. 4f, Fig. 5f). Our findings provide insights into all common factors associated
    with GHG emissions from rice fields that have not been investigated in previous
    studies. Our results revealed that irrigation mode was the most highly important
    factor for CH4 emissions, consistent with previous studies demonstrating that
    drainage can efficiently suppress CH4 emissions by elevating soil redox potential
    and reducing water filled pore space (Wu et al., 2022). Additionally, planting
    pattern was identified as the most important driver for N2O emissions, possibly
    due to direct-seeding promoting N2O emissions by reducing water input compared
    to transplanting, as N2O emissions are closely tied to soil water status (Liu
    et al., 2013, Xu et al., 2022). However, the effect of planting pattern may be
    overstated due to data imbalance, with direct-seeding accounting for only a small
    fraction of the dataset in (3.8 %) and (4.1 %), hence not included in the investigation
    of mitigation strategies. Surprisingly, organic fertilizer was not ranked as a
    top factor for both CH4 and N2O emissions. Reviewing the dataset, we found that
    non-zero organic fertilizer only accounted for about 10 % in both and . Moreover,
    as a continuous variable, the distribution of non-zero organic fertilizer rate
    was sporadic, leading to inadequate training in the XGBoost model. Mineral nitrogen
    rate, tillage depth and straw returned proportion also played a critical role
    in regulating GHG emissions, consistent with the feature selection process. However,
    the general effects of these AMPs on GWP of paddy fields are complex and still
    unclear, underscoring the necessity to analyze the interactions of AMPs to develop
    mitigation strategies to reduce GHG emissions and minimize GWP of rice production
    systems. 3.4. Mitigation strategies for greenhouse gas emissions To explore effective
    mitigation strategies for reducing emissions from rice systems, the response of
    our best model to different combinations of fertilization, irrigation mode, straw
    management, and tillage mode was presented in Fig. 6. Our results indicated that
    with the increasing rates of mineral nitrogen fertilizer, the predicted CH4 emissions
    showed a trend an initial increase followed by a decrease, and the inflection
    point was delayed under the addition of organic fertilizer. This delay is due
    to the stimulation of CH4 emissions resulting from the provision of C substrates
    for the growth of methanogenic bacteria, as reported by previous studies (Feng
    et al., 2013). Furthermore, organic fertilizer has been shown to have a greater
    stimulatory effect on CH4 emissions compared to mineral fertilizer, mainly due
    to the differences in the readily decomposable carbon (Yu et al., 2003, Zhang
    et al., 2020). Nevertheless, N2O emissions continued to increase until the rate
    of N fertilizer reached approximately 150 kg ha−1. Due to data limitations, our
    model was less sensitive to variation of organic fertilizer, particularly in terms
    of N2O emissions, resulting in some lines that appear to coincide in Fig. 6b,
    6e and 6 h. Download : Download high-res image (702KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. The effects of different agricultural management practices on CH4
    emissions, N2O emissions and global warming potential were predicted by the XGBoost
    model. The water management of graph (a-c), (d-f), and (g-i) are continuous flooding,
    mid-season drainage, and frequent drainage, respectively. Y0, Y1, R0, R1, R2,
    T0, T1 represent non-organic fertilizer, the organic fertilizer of 60 kg N ha−1,
    straw removal, straw returned in half quantity, straw returned in full quantity,
    no-tillage and conventional tillage (20 cm), respectively. Under the conditions
    of CF, MD and FD, the return of half quantity of straw resulted in increase in
    CH4 emissions by 16.5 %, 24.0 % and 45.2 %, respectively, while the return of
    full quantity of straw increased CH4 emissions by 81.2 %, 135.7 % and 147.3 %,
    respectively. These results confirmed that the increase in the quantity of straw
    would enhance its stimulatory effect on CH4 emissions, in accordance with previous
    findings of Shen et al., 2014, Naser et al., 2007. Moreover, it is worth noting
    that the effect of straw under MD or FD was more pronounced than CF, mainly due
    to the water-saving irrigation under MD or FD, which created more aerobic conditions
    that facilitated the oxygen-consuming decomposition of straw (Zeng et al., 2022).
    Besides, no-tillage reduced CH4 emissions from the rice fields under CF, MD and
    FD by 19.4 %, 26.9 % and 33.0 %, respectively, and its mitigation effect remained
    significant under straw addition. For N2O emissions, under the conditions of CF,
    MD and FD, the return of straw in half quantity reduced N2O emissions by 20.0
    %, 16.7 % and 17.2 %, respectively, while the return of straw in full quantity
    reduced N2O emissions by 19.8 %, 16.5 % and 17.0 %. Unlike CH4 emissions, the
    quantity of straw had no significant impact on its mitigation effect on N2O emissions,
    suggesting that CH4 emissions are more sensitive to the application of straw.
    Additionally, no-tillage increased N2O emissions by 8.6 %, 6.9 % and 5.6 % under
    CF, MD and FD, respectively, due to the lower O2 concentration in the no-tillage
    soil that stimulated N2O production from denitrification (Mei et al., 2018). Compared
    to CF, the two water-saving modes, MD and FD, reduced CH4 emissions by 20.0 %
    and 21.8 %, respectively, but increased N2O emissions by 42.9 % and 44.9 %. Overall,
    our results indicated an apparent trade-off relation between CH4 and N2O emissions,
    and the predicted trends of both CH4 and N2O emissions with variations in field
    management practices were consistent with most previous studies based on field
    experiments or agroecosystem models. Therefore, we conclude that the predictions
    of our best model were reasonable and comparable to agroecosystem models based
    on associated biogeochemical processes (Zhao et al., 2020). In terms of GWP (Fig.
    6c, f, and i), FD was found to be the best irrigation mode for rice field, with
    a high mitigation potential of 39.5 % compared to CF, followed by MD at 18.4 %.
    This was mainly due to the frequent aerobic conditions in FD soil, which effectively
    inhibited CH4 emissions, thereby offsetting the stimulation effect produced by
    increased N2O emissions (Liao et al., 2020). Conversely, the application of organic
    fertilizer, tillage, half and full straw returning increased GWP by an average
    of 80.3 %, 33.8 %, 25.2 % and 111.6 %, respectively, under different mineral nitrogen
    levels and irrigation modes. Generally, the scenario “Y0R0T0″ with a mineral N
    rate of 128 kg ha−1 and FD water regime had the most potential for mitigation,
    with a GWP of 3.13 Mg CO2 equivalent ha−1. It is noteworthy that the variation
    trend of GWP under each scenario was similar to that of CH4 emissions, as N2O
    emissions were several orders of magnitude lower than CH4 in rice fields. Therefore,
    mitigating CH4 emissions could be more effective in reducing the GWP of total
    GHG emissions in paddy fields. 4. Conclusions In this study, we presented a comprehensive
    dataset on CH4 and N2O emissions from paddy fields across China, including soil,
    meteorology, cropping system type, and field management details. We compared the
    performance of different machine learning (ML) algorithms and found that XGBoost
    outperforms other algorithms in predicting CH4 (R2 = 0.754, RMSE = 0.485 kg ha−1)
    and N2O emissions (R2 = 0.762, RMSE = 0.423 kg ha−1) from rice fields in China,
    with highest efficiency and accuracy. Although some input factors had negligible
    impact on GHG emissions, the results indicated the model trained on the original
    dataset, and , produced better results for most algorithms. However, due to data
    limitations, the performance of -based RF (R2 = 0.749, RMSE = 0.490 kg ha−1) and
    -based RF (R2 = 0.746, RMSE = 0.438 kg ha−1) was also satisfactory. Based on the
    best model XGBoost, mineral and organic fertilizer rate, irrigation mode, straw
    returned proportion and tillage depth were identified as important factors regulating
    GHG emissions. Specifically, FD was found to be the better irrigation mode for
    rice fields, with a higher mitigation potential for GHG emissions (39.5 % on GWP)
    compared to CF, followed by MD at 18.4 %. However, the application of organic
    fertilizer, tillage, straw returned in half and full quantity could increase GWP
    by 80.3 %, 33.8 %, 25.2 % and 111.6 %, respectively. The combination of a mineral
    nitrogen fertilizer rate of 128 kg ha−1, FD water management, without straw, tillage,
    and organic fertilizer could achieve the most mitigation effect, with a GWP of
    3.13 Mg CO2 equivalent ha−1. Moreover, our model exhibited an obvious trade-off
    relationship between CH4 and N2O emissions, and the predicted trends of both emissions
    were in good accordance with mechanisms of GHG emission in rice fields, indicating
    our model is a promising alternative to agricultural ecosystem models. CRediT

    methodology is widely practiced world over for computation of runoff generated
    from rainfall in a watershed. It was originally developed for the purpose of conservation
    of soil from the effect of runoff, which is a major factor governing the soil
    erosion and its transport, in small agricultural watersheds. Since inception in
    1956, its application has been extended to a number of areas such as infiltration,
    flood, drainage, and water availability, sediment yield, water quality and climate
    change studies. In an attempt to suggest an improved version, the effect of rainfall
    intensity (i.e., the ratio of rainfall to rain duration) and antecedent moisture,
    greatly affecting the runoff quantity but originally ignored, has been studied
    by postulating different variations of the method. The effect of rainfall intensity
    is considered by Models M1 and M2, an explicit form. Model M3 incorporates both
    initial soil moisture and rainfall intensity, and its explicit form (with constant
    model parameter λ = 0.2) is M4. A comparative performance evaluation on a very
    large dataset containing 48,386 rainfall–runoff events of 140 USA watersheds using
    several indicators leads to the proposition of Model M3 and its further sensitivity
    analysis describes the model to be the most sensitive to the amount of input rainfall.
    The study not only supports the incorporation of storm intensity and initial soil
    moisture in the model formulation but also proposes an alternative version for

    Soil Moisture Estimation for Runoff Prediction Article 02 March 2017 Introduction
    There exists a plethora of methods/models in the literature for quantification
    of rainfall generated runoff and the Soil Conservation Service Curve Number (SCS-CN)
    methodology is the model most widely practiced around the globe. This method was
    pioneered by Soil Conservation Service, United States Department of Agriculture
    (SCS, USDA) in 1954 for handling the problems of flooding mainly in agriculture
    watersheds and their soil conservation. Since inception, the model application
    has been extended to a variety of research areas such as infiltration (Ponce and
    Hawkins 1996), drainage (Varshney and Gupta 1972), water availability (Olivera
    et al. 2006), sediment yield (Tyagi et al. 2008), and water quality (Mishra and
    Singh 2003), climate change (Verma et al 2017a, b) studies, and CNs estimation
    for paddy field management (Im et al. 2007; Choi et al. 2019). Fundamentally,
    the method is a simple, flexible, lump model that requires minimum input parameters
    and is applicable for ungauged watersheds (Ponce and Hawkins 1996; Stewart et
    al. 2012; Verma et al. 2018; Caletka et al. 2020). The studies related to sediment
    yield and water availability are advantageous in adopting proper soil conservation
    measures and improved water use efficiency, respectively. For poor, fair and good
    hydrologic conditions of a watershed, NEH 4 table describes curve numbers for
    various land use and soil combinations. Application of these NEH-4 CN values to
    other parts of the world showed insignificant results which provoked researchers
    to develop local CNs using rainfall–runoff data of the watershed. Several management
    activities such as contour bunding, afforestation, deforestation, irrigation and
    drainage take place in the watershed which affect the CNs as well as the hydrological
    response. Few researchers successfully quantified this effect and suggested the
    range of CNs. Based on rainfall–runoff observations for paddy fields drained by
    a weir, Im et al. (2007) suggested CNs of 67, 82 and 91 for antecedent moisture
    conditions (AMC) I, II and III, respectively. Jung et al. (2012) highlighted that
    paddy fields equipped with surface drainage pipes (orifice-type outlet) had greater
    runoff potential as compared to the conventional weirs. They also provided guidelines
    for assessing CNs for rice paddy field. Choi et al. (2019) compared the CNs estimated
    from two rice paddy fields with different management practices and found that
    a carefully managed paddy field created lesser runoff and, subsequently, had smaller
    CNs compared to the other field that was relatively poorly maintained. Like any
    other simple method, the SCS-CN method also has several limitations (Ponce and
    Hawkins 1996). As a result, many advanced modifications in understanding of concepts
    and mathematical structures of the SCS-CN methods have been reported in the literature
    during last 70 years, by incorporating various factors/dependent parameters, viz.
    varying \\(\\lambda\\) values, initial abstraction (Ia), potential retention (S),
    infiltration rate, rainfall intensity/duration, antecedent soil moisture (M),
    soil moisture accounting (SMA) procedure and so on. Verma et al. (2017a, b) provided
    further updates on the development of enhanced versions of the SCS-CN models along
    with their advantages and disadvantages. Later, Shi et al. (2017), Verma et al.
    (2017a) and Verma et al. (2020, 2021) proposed SMA-based procedures. Overall,
    these discussions indicate the method to have gained wide acceptance around the
    world for addressing various hydrologic issues and challenges since its inception
    in 1956 (Ogden et al. 2017). Many researchers mentioned that appropriate information
    about soil moisture and consequently retention capacity is critical for the process
    of rainfall–runoff, which could greatly influence runoff estimations (Singh 2013;
    Verma et al. 2018). In this context, Reshmidevi et al. (2007) suggested a new
    SCS-CN-based model for improved soil moisture and consequently runoff. Similarly,
    Jain et al. (2006) and Babu and Mishra (2012) modified SCS-CN retention parameter
    for improved runoff estimation. These modifications however did not provide adequately
    the variation in retention capacity with time and thus left space for further
    improvement. Thus, this paper attempts to (i) formulate an improved version of
    the SCS-CN model by incorporating rainfall intensity and soil moisture, (ii) examine
    the performance of the improved models over the existing models using a large
    dataset of 140 watersheds of USA, and (iii) carry out sensitivity analysis of
    the best performing proposed model. Materials and method Original SCS-CN method
    A general form of the SCS-CN method is mathematically expressed as Eqs. (1) and
    (2): $$Q = \\left\\{ \\begin{gathered} \\frac{{\\left( {P - Ia} \\right)^{2} }}{P
    - Ia + S},{\\text{for}}\\;P > Ia \\hfill \\\\ 0,{\\text{for}}\\;P \\le Ia \\hfill
    \\\\ \\end{gathered} \\right.$$ (1) $$Ia = \\lambda S$$ (2) where Q is direct
    runoff depth, P is total rainfall depth for event, Ia is preliminary abstraction,
    S is potential maximum retention (mm), and λ is the initial abstraction coefficient
    (dimensionless). Equation (2) defines the preliminary abstraction, which includes
    canopy interception, initial infiltration, and storage in surface depressions.
    Originally, the value of λ was assumed as 0.2. However, its value varies from
    0 and 0.05 due to different regional, geological, and climatic conditions (Ponce
    and Hawkins 1996; Hawkins, 2009; Verma et al. 2017a). The interrelationship of
    S and CN is expressed as follows: $$S = \\left( {\\frac{25400}{{CN}} - 254} \\right)$$
    (3) where S and CN both represent the retention of a watershed and depend on its
    characteristics. The only difference between S and CN is that the former is a
    dimensional quantity, whereas the latter is non-dimensional quality. CN = 100
    represents a condition of zero potential maximum retention (S = 0), that is, an
    impermeable watershed. Conversely, CN = 0 represents a theoretical upper bound
    to potential maximum retention (S = ∞), which is an infinitely abstracting watershed.
    The original model (variable λ) and its explicit form λ = 0.2) are referred as
    model M1 and M2, respectively, in the forthcoming text. Proposed modifications
    The proposed modification includes temporal decay of retention (S) that represents
    storage or retention capability of soil profile at a location, which is the maximum
    difference of effective rainfall minus runoff (P-Ia-Q). Earlier, Jain et al. (2006)
    considered S as potential maximum retention (S0), for S being a subset of S0.
    S has otherwise been assumed as a constant for a storm in the original SCS-CN
    methodology, in contrast to that it varies from storm to storm within a watershed
    in reality. To overcome this specific issue, Babu and Mishra (2012) introduced
    a parameter S0 and assumed it as a sum of S and M for a watershed. Mathematically,
    it can be represented as follows: $$S_{0} = \\, S \\, + \\, M$$ (4) where S0 is
    a constant quantity for a watershed irrespective of storms, whereas S is a quantity
    varying from storm to storm and varying inversely with M. For derivation of the
    proposed model, the first-order linear hypothesis for the variation of S with
    time can be mathematically written as follows (Mishra and Singh 2003): $$\\frac{dS}{{dt}}
    = - \\alpha S$$ (5) After solving, $$S = S_{0} e^{ - \\alpha t}$$ (6) Equation
    (6) represents the exponential decay of S with srm duration. Horton (1938) also
    highlighted that when rainfall intensity increased, infiltration rate would decrease
    with time or rain duration accordingly. The infiltration decay factor ‘α’ however
    depends on the magnitude of rainfall intensity and watershed characteristic that
    affect S or CN. However, in reality, the infiltration and retention curves coincide
    when runoff approaches a constant rate (Varshney 1977). Therefore, an increase
    in duration or intensity will have similar effect on S. Thus, Eq. (6) can be re-written
    as follows: $$S = S_{0} e^{{ - \\alpha \\left( \\frac{P}{T} \\right)}}$$ (7) With
    accounting the effect of M, Eq. (7) can be modified as follows: $$S = \\left(
    {S_{0} - M} \\right)e^{{ - \\alpha \\left( \\frac{P}{T} \\right)}}$$ (8) Jain
    et al. (2006) pointed out that M can be expressed mathematically as a linear function
    of 5-day antecedent rainfall, P5, as follows: $$M = \\beta P_{5}$$ (9) With the
    new formulation of S, e.g., Equation (8), which overcomes the weakness of sudden
    jumps between different AMC levels in the original SCS-CN methodology, Eq. (1)
    can be written in the form: $$Q = \\left\\{ \\begin{gathered} \\frac{{\\left(
    {\\left( {P - \\lambda \\left( {S_{0} - \\beta P_{5} } \\right)e^{{\\left( { -
    \\alpha \\left( \\frac{P}{T} \\right)} \\right)}} } \\right)} \\right)^{2} }}{{P
    + \\left( {1 - \\lambda } \\right)\\left( {S_{0} - \\beta P_{5} } \\right)e^{{\\left(
    { - \\alpha \\left( \\frac{P}{T} \\right)} \\right)}} }} \\hfill \\\\ 0,{\\text{
    for }}P\\left( {\\frac{T}{{T_{m} }}} \\right)^{r} \\le \\lambda \\left( {S_{0}
    - \\beta P_{5} } \\right)e^{{\\left( { - \\alpha \\left( \\frac{P}{T} \\right)}
    \\right)}} \\hfill \\\\ \\end{gathered} \\right.,{\\text{for }}P\\left( {\\frac{T}{{T_{m}
    }}} \\right)^{r} > \\lambda \\left( {S_{0} - \\beta P_{5} } \\right)e^{{\\left(
    { - \\alpha \\left( \\frac{P}{T} \\right)} \\right)}}$$ (10) Substituting the
    assumption (λ = 0.2) into Eq. (10) gives the following relationship: $$Q = \\left\\{
    \\begin{gathered} \\frac{{\\left( {\\left( {P - 0.2\\left( {S_{0} - \\beta P_{5}
    } \\right)e^{{\\left( { - \\alpha \\left( \\frac{P}{T} \\right)} \\right)}} }
    \\right)} \\right)^{2} }}{{P + 0.8\\left( {S_{0} - \\beta P_{5} } \\right)e^{{\\left(
    { - \\alpha \\left( \\frac{P}{T} \\right)} \\right)}} }} \\hfill \\\\ 0,{\\text{
    for }}P\\left( {\\frac{T}{{T_{m} }}} \\right)^{r} \\le 0.2\\left( {S_{0} - \\beta
    P_{5} } \\right)e^{{\\left( { - \\alpha \\left( \\frac{P}{T} \\right)} \\right)}}
    \\hfill \\\\ \\end{gathered} \\right.,{\\text{for }}P\\left( {\\frac{T}{{T_{m}
    }}} \\right)^{r} > 0.2\\left( {S_{0} - \\beta P_{5} } \\right)e^{{\\left( { -
    \\alpha \\left( \\frac{P}{T} \\right)} \\right)}}$$ (11) The proposed models (Eqs.
    (10) and (11)) are referred as M3, and M4 model, respectively, in the forthcoming
    texts. Sensitivity analysis Sensitivity analysis is often employed to explore
    the model performance with respect to one or more parameters which might be highly
    sensitive, low sensitive or insensitive to changes in parameter values. Insensitive
    parameters may be kept at a fixed value while optimizing the (effective) number
    of parameters. Sensitivity analysis helps rank parameters affecting the output
    due to change in input (Saltelli et al., 2000). In this study, it is carried out
    following Chen (1982). Model performance evaluation criteria Model performance
    is generally evaluated using more than one performance indicators (Sahu et al.,
    2010; Ajmal et al., 2015; 2016; Verma et al. 2020; 2021). Therefore, in the present
    study, five widely popular goodness of fit indicators: (i) root-mean-square error
    (RMSE) (Deshmukh et al., 2013), (ii) Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE %) (Gupta
    et al., 1999; Nash and Sutcliffe,1970), (iii) coefficient of determination (R2),
    (iv) RMSE-observations standard deviation ratio (RSR) and (v) mean absolute error
    (MAE) have been used to evaluate both the existing M1 and M2 models and the proposed
    M3 and M4 models. A good agreement indicates a superior model performance, and
    vice versa. Mathematical formulae of these indicators are as follows: $${\\text{RSME}}
    = \\sqrt {\\frac{{1}}{{\\text{N}}}\\sum_{{{\\text{i}} = {1}}}^{{\\text{N}}} {\\left(
    {{\\text{Q}}_{{{\\text{Obs}}}} - {\\text{Q}}_{{{\\text{Comp}}}} } \\right)_{{\\text{i}}}^{{2}}
    } }$$ (12) $${\\text{NSE}} = \\left[ {{1} - \\frac{{\\sum_{{{\\text{i}} = {1}}}^{{\\text{N}}}
    {\\left( {{\\text{Q}}_{{{\\text{Obs}}}} - {\\text{Q}}_{{{\\text{Comp}}}} } \\right)_{{\\text{i}}}^{{2}}
    } }}{{\\sum_{{{\\text{i}} = {1}}}^{{\\text{N}}} {\\left( {{\\text{Q}}_{{{\\text{Obs}}}}
    - {\\overline{\\text{Q}}}_{{{\\text{Obs}}}} } \\right)_{{\\text{i}}}^{{2}} } }}}
    \\right]*100$$ (13) $${\\text{RSR}} = \\frac{{\\sqrt {\\sum_{{{\\text{i}} = {1}}}^{{\\text{N}}}
    {\\left( {{\\text{Q}}_{{{\\text{obs}}}} - {\\text{Q}}_{{{\\text{comp}}}} } \\right)_{{\\text{i}}}^{{2}}
    } } }}{{\\sqrt {\\sum_{{{\\text{i}} = {1}}}^{{\\text{N}}} {\\left( {{\\text{Q}}_{{{\\text{obs}}}}
    - {\\overline{\\text{Q}}}_{{{\\text{obs}}}} } \\right)_{{\\text{i}}}^{{2}} } }
    }}$$ (14) $${\\text{MAE}} = \\frac{{\\sum_{i = 1}^{N} {\\left| {\\left( {Q_{{{\\text{obs}}}}
    - Q_{{{\\text{comp}}}} } \\right)_{i} } \\right|} }}{N}$$ (15) $$R^{2} = \\frac{{\\left[
    {\\sum_{i = 1}^{N} {\\left( {Q_{{{\\text{obs}}}} - \\overline{Q}_{{{\\text{obs}}}}
    } \\right)\\left( {Q_{{{\\text{Comp}}}} - \\overline{Q}_{{{\\text{Comp}}}} } \\right)}
    } \\right]^{2} }}{{\\sum_{i = 1}^{N} {\\left( {Q_{{{\\text{obs}}}} - \\overline{Q}_{{{\\text{obs}}}}
    } \\right)_{i}^{2} } \\sum_{i = 1}^{N} {\\left( {Q_{{{\\text{Comp}}}} - \\overline{Q}_{{{\\text{Comp}}}}
    } \\right)_{i}^{2} } }}$$ (16) where QObs = observed storm runoff, QComp = computed
    runoff, \\(\\overline{{\\text{Q}}}_{{{\\text{Obs}}}}\\) = mean of observed runoff,
    \\(\\overline{{\\text{Q}}}_{{{\\text{Comp}}}}\\) = mean of computed runoff, N = total
    number of rainfall–runoff events in a watershed, and i = an integer varying from
    1 to N. A model can be ranked superior if it shows higher NSE (%) or R2 values,
    and vice versa, whereas lower RMSE or RSR value indicates better performance,
    and vice versa. R2 varies between 0 (complete disagreement between predicted and
    observed values) and 1 (perfect agreement). Values of R2 between 0.5 and 1 are
    generally viewed as acceptable levels of model performance, whereas a value R2 > 0.7
    indicates good model performance (Diaz-Ramirez et al., 2011). A value of 0 for
    RMSE, RSR and MAE indicates optimum and increasing values of these indices indicate
    poorer performance. Secondly, to assess the predictive capability of all models
    (M1-M4), the evaluation can be classified as very good, good, satisfactory and
    unsatisfactory (Table 1). Table 1 Model evaluation performance criteria for different
    performance indicators, RMSE, NSE (%) and R2 Full size table Application Catchment
    selection and hydro-meteorological data collection A large dataset of 140 USA
    watersheds having rainfall and runoff observations derived from the U.S. Department
    of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS) Water Database has been
    used in the present study. The dataset is also available at http://www.ars.usda.gov/arsdb.html
    as well as at http://hydrolab.arsusda.gov/arswater.html. The size of selected
    watersheds varies from 0.1.to 33,055.4 ha, which is either cultivated, mixed or
    pasture land uses. Most of the watersheds except Idaho are located in the middle
    and eastern USA (Fig. 1). Total 48,386 storm events (varying from 19 to 136) were
    used for model performance in this study. Fig. 1 Location of USDA-ARS experimental
    watersheds Full size image Results and discussion Performance evaluation The proposed
    models M3 and M4 consist of a nonlinear relationship for S that incorporates initial
    soil moisture and storm intensity and is crucial for accurate estimation of direct
    runoff using the SCS-CN method. Five performance statistics, viz. RMSE, NSE (%),
    RSR, MAE, and R2 are employed and their values resulting from M1, M2, M3 and M4
    model applications to the data of 140 USDA-ARS watersheds are summarized in Appendix
    I. Figure 2a depicts the overall performance of M1, M2, M3, and M4 models based
    on RMSE. As seen, the RMSE values for M3 in almost all watersheds are low with
    mean 5.28 mm compared to the mean values of 5.49 mm, 5.73 mm, 5.50 mm for M1,
    M2 and M4 models, respectively. Figure 2b shows the proposed model (M3) to have
    the lowest median (4.09 mm) and inter-quartile range (3.03 mm–6.70 mm) of RMSE.
    Based on RMSE, the models can be ranked from the best to the worst as: M3 > M1 > M4 > M2.
    In case of M2 and M4 model formulations, parameter λ is fixed at 0.2. M4 however
    performs better than M2, largely due to the former actually considering nonlinear
    variation of S0 and storm intensity and thus having improved runoff prediction
    capability. Fig 2 a-b RMSE of all the models under study Full size image For further
    analysis, Fig. 3a compares all the four models using RSR values. As seen, the
    proposed M3 model has lowest RSR for all watersheds. Figure 3b shows the overall
    RSR of all watersheds under study. It can be seen that this model has the lowest
    RSR value of mean (0.58), median (0.56) and inter-quartile range (0.47–0.65).
    A visual comparison also supports the predictive proficiency of this model. Compared
    to the M4 model, M1 model has either underestimated or overestimated the runoff.
    Fig 3 a-b RSR of all the models under study Full size image Similar to the above,
    the variation of MAE values is shown Fig. 4a and it indicates M3 model to have
    the lowest mean (= 3.18) for all watersheds. The superiority of M3 model is evident
    from the fact that it has incorporated initial soil moisture, e.g., nonlinear
    variation of S0, and storm rainfall intensity. It can be further supported from
    Fig. 4b showing the overall MAE of all watersheds and the proposed model (M3)
    to have the lowest MAE values of median (= 2.28) and inter-quartile range (1.38–3.22).
    Fig 4 a-b MAE of all the models under study Full size image From Fig. 5a showing
    that NSE (%), similar to the above, indicates that the proposed M3 model is the
    best model (highest mean NSE (%) = 63.34) and has a significant improvement over
    M1 model. It can be largely attributed to the inclusion of storm intensity (Rallison
    and Miller (1981), Sahu et al. (2012); Shi et al. (2017)) in model formulation.
    Similar inference can also be drawn from Fig. 5b showing the overall NSE (%) of
    all watersheds under study based on the median (= 68.60) and inter-quartile range
    (57.66 – 77.7) of NSE (%). Fig. 5 a-b NSE (%) of all the models under study Full
    size image As an example (largely due to paucity of space reasons), Fig. 6a, b
    show the scatter plots for only two watersheds (WS-71005) and (WS-31001), respectively.
    As seen, model M3 shows the highest R2 (0.877 for WS-71005 and 0.839 for WS-31001)
    of all other models. Figure 7a, b, c, d compares the observed runoff with the
    predicted by all four models for only watershed ID 62,003, and M3 is seen to have
    performed the best of all. Similar results were obtained for all other watersheds.
    Fig. 6 a-b Scatter plots of computed vs observed runoff for two watersheds (WS-71005)
    and (WS-31001) Full size image Fig. 7 a-d Scatter plots of computed vs observed
    runoff for two watersheds (WS-62003) Full size image Appendix-I shows the NSE%
    and R2 values for all watersheds and all models. Following the NSE%-based performance
    suggested by Moriasi et al. (2015), Table 2 shows the number of watersheds on
    which the performance of all the models M1 through M4 is Very Good, Good, Acceptable
    or Satisfactory. It can be easily inferred from Table 2 that the model M3 performed
    the best of all and it was followed by model M4. The performance of Model M1 was
    however the poorest of all. It follows that the incorporation of rainfall intensity
    (i.e., storm rainfall/rain duration) in the proposed models (M3 and M4) improves
    runoff prediction in a watershed. Since S is varied with moisture, the proposed
    model M3 also avoids sudden jumps in parameter CN, a major concern of SCS-CN literature
    (Sahu et al. 2012). More importantly, the proposed model is suitable not only
    for all types of watersheds of varying landuse/land cover and soil combinations
    but may also be useful in improving the water use efficiency via irrigation scheduling
    utilizing the information of soil moisture. Table 2 Number of watersheds falling

    of proposed (M3) model Sensitivity analysis of the best performing M3 model (Eq.
    10) is further carried out to estimate the effect of different variables on the
    predicted runoff. The equation of runoff coefficient (C = Q/P) can be obtained
    as follows: $$C = \\frac{{\\left( {1 - \\frac{{\\lambda \\left( {S_{0} - \\beta
    P_{5} } \\right)e^{{\\frac{ - \\alpha P}{T}}} }}{P}} \\right)^{2} }}{{\\left(
    {1 + \\frac{{\\left( {1 - \\lambda } \\right)\\left( {S_{0} - \\beta P_{5} } \\right)e^{{\\frac{
    - \\alpha P}{T}}} }}{P}} \\right)}}$$ (17) Figure 8a, b, c, d, e, f shows the
    sensitivity of runoff coefficient to rainfall (P), potential retention (S), initial
    abstraction ratio (λ), storm duration (T) and the coefficients (α and β). In these
    figures, the partial differentiation of C w.r.t P, i.e. (∂C/C)/(∂P/P) defines
    the relative variation in C with partial variation in P. In the same way, the
    partial differentiation of C w.r.t S, λ, T, α and β is shown as (∂C/C)/(∂S/S),
    (∂C/C)/(∂λ/λ), (∂C/C)/(∂T/T), (∂C/C)/(∂α/α) and (∂C/C)/(∂β/β), respectively. For
    different values of CN (40, 60 and 80), λ (0.05, 0.2 and 0.3), T (1, 3 and 5),
    α (0.02, 0.06 and 0.1) and β (0.02, 0.06 and 0.1), the variation of (∂C/C)/(∂P/P),
    (∂C/C)/(∂S/S), (∂C/C)/(∂λ/λ), (∂C/C)/(∂T/T), (∂C/C)/(∂α/α) and (∂C/C)/(∂β/β) is
    shown below Figs. 8a and 8b. Fig. 8 a Sensitivity of C to P b-f: Sensitivity of
    C to S, C to λ, C to T, C to α and C to β Full size image Sensitivity to P When
    Eq. (17) is partially differentiated w.r.t P, We get, $$\\frac{dC}{{dP}} = - \\frac{\\begin{gathered}

    \\right)\\left( {P - \\lambda \\left( {S_{0} - \\beta P_{5} } \\right)e^{{\\frac{
    - \\alpha P}{T}}} } \\right)^{2} }}$$ (19) The effect of storm rainfall P on the
    ratio of relative variation in C to that in P, i.e. (δC/C)/(δP/P) is shown in
    Fig. 8a. Physically, for a given amount of C, this ratio designates the variation
    (increase or decrease) in C with increase or decrease in P. The figure depicts
    that the ratio reduces exponentially with the rise of P and further reduces gradually
    with the rise in rainfall amount. Since the rate of increase in C with incremental
    variation in P decreases as P increases, δC/δP will positively decrease with P.
    Thus, it is easy to conclude that at a given percent change in P (= δP/P), the
    impact of P-variation on (δC/C)/(δP/P) will be the same as on δC/δP. The variation
    seems less for different values of β. Sensitivity to other parameters (S, λ, T,
    α and β) Similar to the above, the relative change in C to that in S, λ, T, α
    and β is given by: $$\\frac{{{\\raise0.7ex\\hbox{${dC}$} \\!\\mathord{\\left/

    (24) The effect of storm rainfall P on the ratio of relative variation in C to
    that in S, λ, T, α and β, i.e. (δC/C)/(δS/S), (δC/C)/(δλ/λ), (δC/C)/(δT/T) (δC/C)/(δα/α)
    (δC/C)/(δβ/β) is shown in Figs. 8b, c, d, e and f, respectively. Physically, for
    a given amount of C, these ratios designate the variation (increase or decrease)
    in C with increase or decrease in S, λ, T, α and β, respectively. These figures
    depict that the ratios (δC/C)/(δS/S), (δC/C)/(δλ/λ) and (δC/C)/(δT/T) are negative
    at any P value and the absolute value of the ratio decreases exponentially with
    increase in P. For very high rainfall when the soil is either saturated or nearly
    saturated, the variation reduces. Sensitivity of C to S, λ and T is low at higher
    P for all values of CN, λ, T, α and β. The sensitivity of C to S, C to λ and C
    to T remains unchanged for different values of β, T and β, respectively. The ratios
    (δC/C)/(δα/α) and (δC/C)/(δβ/β) are positive at any P value, and its value decreases
    exponentially with increase in rainfall (P). When the soil is near saturation
    or fully saturated under very high rainfall condition, the variation reduces.
    It is also found that sensitivity of C to α and β decreases with increase in P
    for all values of CN, λ, T and β. Conclusions In this paper, by incorporating
    initial soil moisture and storm intensity, an improved version of the SCS-CN-inspired
    model is proposed and tested for its suitability using a large dataset of 140
    USDA-ARS watersheds using performance criteria, viz. R2, NSE, RMSE, RSR and MAE.
    The proposed model M3 performed significantly better than the original model (M1)
    with higher values of R2, NSE (%), lower values of RMSE, RSR and MAE. Between
    the explicit forms of the original model (M2) and the proposed model (M4) with
    fixed value (= 0.2) of λ, M4 performed better than M2. It validated the incorporation
    of initial soil moisture and rainfall intensity in formulation of M4 model. The
    best performing model M3 was further subjected to a sensitivity analysis, which
    described the resulting runoff to be the most heavily dependent on input rainfall
    (P), whereas the retention decay parameter β affected the least. Overall, the
    best performing proposed model may prove to be a step forward in its applications
    to all types of watersheds with varying landuse/land cover and soil combinations
    and improving the water use efficiency by way of irrigation scheduling. Data availability

  description: 【Objective】Land consolidation is to improve the efficiency and productivity
    of segmented lands. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate its ecological gains
    at country scale in northern China Plain using the water footprint concept.【Method】The
    evaluation is based on the GROPWAT model. It calculates the blue, green and gray
    water footprint before and after land consolidation. The ecological performance
    of the land consolidation is evaluated using four specific remediation projects
    as the criteria layers, and 11 indicators. The method is applied to the 16 villages
    and towns in Jing County, Hebei province.【Result】Implementing the land consolidation
    increases the blue, green and gray water footprints in all villages and towns,
    especially the blue and gray water footprints which increase more significantly.
    The overall ecological performance of the 16 villages and towns in the county
    is good, with eight of them achieving good grade or above, and 13 reaching medium
    grade or above. The main obstacles hindering the improvement of ecological performance
    in the county are how to increas new irrigated land rate, hardening rate of new
    roads, drainage and irrigation intensity, turning rain-fed land to irrigated land,
    and biological diversity and abundance. The main obstacles are hydraulic land
    levelling, followed by road and ecological factors.【Conclusion】Overall, implementing
    the land consolidation can improve ecological benefits to Jing County, but it
    has a negative impact on water resources. The ecological performance evaluation
    model proposed in this paper is potential for evaluating land consolidation in
    other regions in northern China.

  description: South African agriculture accounts for 62% of the national water demand.
    Almost 45% of the water is wasted. Therefore, irrigation systems need to improve
    their water-use efficiency (WUE). However, the WUE of smallholder irrigation schemes
    in the country, including Agri-Parks, is not precisely known. A study was performed
    at four Agri-Parks (Rooiwal, Soshanguve, Tarlton, and Westonaria) in Gauteng province
    to assess the condition and performance of the irrigation systems, as part of
    a project that aimed to develop a WUE model for smallholder irrigation systems.
    The Agri-Parks were equipped with efficient irrigation systems in forms of drip
    and microjets. The assessments were performed at the system component level in
    February–March 2021. A Condition Assessment Model (CAM), developed by ARC-NRE/AE,
    was used for the condition assessment. Enumerators observed the system components
    visually and assigned conditions, which they uploaded into the model to generate
    condition indices (CIs). Water conveyance efficiency (CE) and distribution uniformity
    (DU) were assessed on delivery and infield systems, respectively. The CI values
    ranged 4–6, implying significant deterioration had occurred. The CE was 61–78%,
    while the DU was 60–95%. The infield system CI correlated positively with the
    DU, suggesting the CI could predict the DU in drip systems, which was encouraging
    for the proposed WUE model. However, further research covering a longer period
    and more Agri-Parks is recommended.

    is a limited resource in many countries where agriculture is the cornerstone for
    food security, economic development, and poverty reduction. In general, agriculture
    is the biggest user of water worldwide accounting for 70–90% of water utilization
    [1,2]. Most of the agricultural water use is for irrigation because its contribution
    to food security is very significant [3,4]. While only 20% of the global agricultural
    land is irrigated, about 39% of the food supply across the world is produced under
    irrigation. Irrigation also improves the efficiency of production inputs, such
    as fertilizers, improved seeds, and agrichemicals [5]. However, water losses in
    agriculture, in particular irrigation schemes, are generally high [6]. In South
    Africa, where agriculture accounts for 62% of the national demand [7], the water
    losses from agriculture are estimated at about 45% of the water supplied [8].
    Irrigation schemes are reported to account for about 27% of the water losses,
    with about 12% of the losses occurring in conveyance networks [8]. However, the
    challenge of water scarcity in South Africa goes beyond the losses in agriculture
    and the inefficiency of irrigation systems. In a review of challenges and opportunities
    for water conservation in South African irrigated agriculture, ref. [9] cited
    the impact of climate change as the major driver of water scarcity. South African
    irrigation schemes are under pressure to improve their water-use efficiency [10].
    Efficient use of irrigation water is crucial for regions where water resources
    are diminishing [11]. Efficient water-dispensing irrigation systems and good water
    management are important for high water-use efficiency (WUE) in irrigation schemes.
    All types of irrigation systems can potentially be managed to achieve high WUE,
    but pressurised piped systems offer better prospects than surface flood irrigation
    methods. The main advantage of the piped systems is their adaptability to almost
    all crop types, variable topographic conditions, and soil types. However, the
    pressurized systems are more costly to install and manage than the flood irrigation
    methods. Modern low-pressure-requiring systems, such as drip, microjet, and micro-sprayer,
    systems are more efficient than traditional systems, such as impact sprinklers
    and pivots, in terms of water application [12]. For instance, the drip system,
    which applies water slowly but steadily at frequent rates, can save large amounts
    of water because evaporative losses are very low as the water is applied close
    to plants. A properly designed, installed, and managed drip system can achieve
    high water application efficiency in the range of 90–95% [10,11] compared against
    other systems, such sprinkler systems, whose efficiency is around 70% [13]. High
    water-application efficiency results in water savings [14] and improves water
    productivity [15]. Another important aspect of drip irrigation is its ability
    to combine water and chemical applications, which saves time and labour, and improves
    the uniformity of chemical applications. The drip system is also compatible with
    almost all crop types due to its flexibility on row spacing. However, the adoption
    rate of the drip irrigation system is generally low [16] due to several challenges
    that include a high capital cost to install the system and the proneness of the
    emitter to clogging by accumulated salts and suspended materials in the water,
    which expose farmers to frequent cleaning and replacement schedules. Farmers also
    perceive irrigation to be synonymous with the wetting of the soil surface, which
    a drip system does not do appreciably. The application efficiency of irrigation
    systems is evaluated during design and operation of the systems [17]. System performance
    changes over time due to deterioration of equipment. Hence, it is important to
    assess performance [18,19] to understand current levels and factors of influence
    [6,20], which is crucial when trying to solve problems of irrigation development
    and management [1]. Nevertheless, system performance also varies across farms
    due to differences in management choices and practices. Smallholder irrigators
    generally lack the means and incentives to know the amount of water they use,
    their water application rates, and the responses of their crops to different water
    management practices [10]. In addition, they also lack information on the condition
    and water delivery performance of their irrigation infrastructure. A study was
    carried out at selected Agri-Parks in Gauteng Province, South Africa. The aim
    was to evaluate the correlation between condition of irrigation infrastructure
    and its performance in terms of water delivery. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1.
    Study Sites The study was performed at four selected Agri-Parks in Gauteng province
    of South Africa, namely Rooiwal, Soshanguve, Tarlton, and Westonaria (Figure 1).
    An Agri-Park is a market-driven integration of agricultural activities to form
    a networked innovation system of agro-production, processing, logistics, marketing,
    training, and extension services. Agri-Parks contribute immensely to food security,
    economic development, and poverty reduction, especially among women and youth.
    There are 44 Agri-Parks dotted across South Africa, some of which have collapsed
    [21]. The four selected Agri-Parks in Gauteng province were active at the time
    of the study and were easy to access. Figure 1. Map of Gauteng province showing
    locations of Soshanguve, Rooiwal, Tarlton, and Westonaria relative to the cities
    of Pretoria and Johannesburg. Insert is a map of South Africa showing the location
    of Gateng Province. According to the Weather Atlas (www.weather-atlas.com, accessed
    on 16 November 2022), the climatic characteristics for the four study sites differed
    significantly. The average precipitation for Soshanguve and Rooiwal, which are
    in the northern zone of Gauteng, are 583 and 516 mm year−1, respectively. The
    average precipitation for Westonaria is 541 mm year−1. Tarlton is the driest site
    with average precipitation of 441 mm year−1. Long-term average temperature also
    varies greatly with Soshanguve and Rooiwal averaging 18.5 and 18.8 °C, respectively.
    The respective average temperatures for Tarlton and Westonaria are 23.8 and 15.9
    °C, respectively. Soil properties also show great variability with Rooiwal and
    Tarlton exhibiting loamy soils, while Soshanguve has gravelly soil and Westonaria
    sandy soil. The drip irrigation system was the irrigation technology used at the
    selected sites. It is the most efficient irrigation water application system with
    a capacity to deliver water and chemicals precisely and uniformly at a higher
    frequency of application than other systems [5]. It offers many advantages over
    other irrigation methods, such as reduced hazard of runoff and erosion on steep
    slopes; leaching of excessive salts and phytotoxins from the root zone; adaptability
    to remote areas without pressurized water systems; conservation of water where
    it is costly or scarce; and promotion of deep root growth and better plant development
    [22]. Conventional methods of irrigation have not been efficient in the use of
    water, thus, resulting in excessive wastage of water and creation of environmental
    problems, such as waterlogging and salinity [4]. Tomato and green pepper were
    the dominant crops at the selected Agri-Parks. However, coriander was also an
    important crop at Rooiwal. 2.2. Experimental Layout Agri-Parks consist of several
    irrigation blocks that share water from boreholes at the sites. A typical irrigation
    block layout consists of a borehole, mainline pipe, storage tank or nest of storage
    tanks, booster pump, and several greenhouse/shade net tunnels serviced by a sub
    mainline from the booster pump (Figure 2). The tunnels constitute the irrigation
    units where water is applied through the drip systems. One irrigation unit at
    each of the selected sites was randomly chosen for the current study. Figure 2
    show a schematic layout of an irrigation block as used in the study. Figure 2.
    Schematic layout of an irrigation block at each Agri-Park. Dots on the drip lines
    are the emitter positions along the lateral lines. 2.3. Data Collection Data collection
    was performed during the period February to March 2021. The irrigation block selected
    at each site was divided into five components to facilitate data collection and
    analysis, namely Pump–Tank, Tank–Booster pump, Booster pump–Filter unit, Filter
    unit–Manifold, and Infield system. Analysis was performed at the level of these
    components because remedial actions (maintenance, repair, and/or replacement)
    were targeted at the level of system components. Nevertheless, each component
    had its own subcomponents. 2.3.1. Condition Assessment Data on the condition of
    the irrigation infrastructure at the selected Agri-Parks were captured and processed
    using a Condition Assessment Model developed by ARC-NRE/AE (funded by the Gauteng
    Department of Agriculture, Rural Development and Environment). Data collection
    involved visual observations and scoring of the visual indicators. The data collection
    was performed by ARC-NRE/AE engineers. Data collection involved scoring of visual
    observations of the subcomponents; however, the analysis outcomes generated automatically
    by the model were at the component level. The model was developed following an
    Analytical Hierarchical Approach, where irrigators, irrigation equipment suppliers,
    and experts from the irrigation field were interviewed to help with weighting
    of factors and subfactors that affect the condition of the irrigation infrastructure.
    Therefore, the resultant condition index for each component factored in the relative
    contribution of each subfactor and factor to the condition of a subcomponent.
    The resultant condition indices for the components were interpreted following
    Table 1, which was adopted from [23]. Table 1. Condition scores used to rate the
    irrigation infrastructure at the Agri-Parks, Gauteng province (adopted from [23]).
    2.3.2. Performance Assessment Conveyance efficiency Performance assessment was
    also for both the off-field and infield components. When water passes through
    the system, every component of the system causes a head loss, which in turn influences
    efficiency of delivery. In addition, water loss through leakages also affects
    water delivery efficiency. The off-field components were assessed for water delivery.
    Therefore, water flow (Q, m3/s) in pipes constituting the delivery systems between
    main pumps at boreholes and manifolds at edges of the irrigated lands was measured
    using an ultrasonic flow transducer (FLEXIM GmbH, Berlin, Germany). The measurements
    were performed during normal irrigation operating periods when water was running
    in the pipes. The transducer was calibrated for pipe size, material, fluid type,
    and temperature before measurements could be performed. Flow measurement was performed
    at the inlet (inflow) and outlet (outflow) of each component, and the difference
    between the inflow and outflow constituted a water loss. Conveyance efficiency
    (CEi) was the preferred flow performance index and was computed using the equation:
    𝐶𝐸 𝑖 =100 𝑄 𝑖𝑛 − 𝑄 𝑜𝑢𝑡 𝑄 𝑖𝑛 (1) where 𝐶𝐸 𝑖 = conveyance efficiency (%) for the
    ith component; 𝑄 𝑖𝑛 and 𝑄 𝑜𝑢𝑡 = inflow and outflow rates (m3/s), respectively.
    The overall conveyance efficiency (CE) at each Agri-Park was computed as the product
    of the conveyance efficiencies for the system components. Distribution uniformity
    In addition to head losses, energy loss in the water flowing through pipes also
    influences the variation of discharge, for example, from the first to the last
    emitter of a system [3]. Head loss was not investigated in the current study.
    Drip emitter discharge (qe, L h−1) was measured at five positions on each of three
    selected drip lines (Figure 2). The qe values were subsequently used to compute
    the Distribution Uniformities (DUs, %) for each system using the following equation:

    in terms of discharge rate, and 𝑞 𝑒             = average emitter
    discharge rate for all the measured values. 2.4. Statistical Analyses Simple statistics
    were used to analyse and compare the condition and performance of the system components
    at the selected Agri-Parks. Significancy of differences were tested using the
    t-test at p < 0.05. 3. Results 3.1. State of Infrastructural Condition Table 2
    shows the condition indices (CIs) for different irrigation system components as
    generated using the Condition Assessment Model. The CI values varied greatly among
    the components at a selected Agri-Park and across the Agri-Parks. The CI values
    at Rooiwal, varied from 4.71 for the Tank–Booster pump to 5.99 for the Pump–Tank.
    Therefore, the irrigation infrastructural condition at this Agri-Park was interpreted
    to be in moderately good condition. The Booster pump–Filter unit at Soshanguve
    was in the worst condition (CI = 2.73), while the Pump–Tank was in the best condition
    (6.29). The other components at this Agri-Park were in moderately good condition
    with CI values varying from 4.10 (Booster pump–Filter unit) to 5.48 (Filter unit–Manifold).
    Similar to the situation at Soshanguve, the Pump–Tank component at Tarlton was
    also in the best condition (6.25) amongst all the system components at this Agri-Park.
    The other components were in moderately good condition (4.90–5.65). Amongst the
    four Agri-Parks assessed, Westonaria had the worst Pump–Tank (5.61) and Booster
    pump–Filter unit (2.12) conditions. Overall, the Pump–Tank was in the best condition
    (5.61–6.29) at all Agri-Parks. The infield systems exhibited surprisingly similar
    conditions with CI values varying marginally between 5.00 and 5.05. Nevertheless,
    the infield CIs decreased in the order Rooiwal > Tarlton > Westonaria > Soshanguve.
    Table 2. Condition indices (CIs) for irrigation infrastructure components at the
    Agri-Parks, Gauteng province (February–March 2021). 3.2. Water Conveyance Efficiency
    Water conveyance efficiency (CE) varied greatly across the Agri-Parks with CE
    values hovering between 81 and 99% (Table 3). Rooiwal had CE values varying between
    92 and 97% for the Filter unit–Manifold and Main pump–Tank, respectively. Soshanguve
    values ranged from 81% for the Filter unit–Manifold to 99% for the Tank–Booster
    pump. Tarlton Agri-Park exhibited the lowest CE value of 83% for the Main pump–Tank
    and the highest value of 94% for the Booster pump–Filter unit. The Booster pump–Filter
    unit performed the poorest at Westonaria with a CE value of 73%. However, its
    Tank–Booster pump component performed impressively at 98% CE. Overall, the performance
    of the Agri-Parks in terms of water conveyance efficiency declined in the order
    Rooiwal > Soshanguve > Tarlton > Westonaria (Table 3). Table 3. Conveyance efficiency

    (February–March 2021). 3.3. Emitter Discharges Emitter discharge (qe) varied greatly
    across the Agri-Parks with Soshanguve showing much lower values in comparison
    to the others (Figure 3). Performance in terms of the overall average qe decreased
    in the order Tarlton > Westonaria > Rooiwal > Soshanguve with respective qe values
    of 1.42 ± 0.02, 1.12 ± 0.07, 1.10 ± 0.01 and 0.51 ± 0.01 L h−1. Therefore, the
    average qe for Tarlton was the most significant, while that for Soshanguve was
    the least significant. There was no significant difference in the average qe between
    Rooiwal and Westonaria. Figure 3. Mean emitter discharges for the different areas
    of drip lines at (A) Rooiwal, (B) Soshanguve, (C) Tarlton, and (D) Westonaria.
    Bars accompanied by similar letter in each subfigure were not significantly different
    at p < 0.05. The qe also varied along the drip lines at each Agri-Park; however,
    the differences were not always significant. The trend of qe along the drip lines
    varied from one Agri-Park to the other. Rooiwal exhibited a general increase in
    qe along the drip lines culminating in the highest qe at L3/4 (1.15 ± 0.03 L h−1)
    and L (1.15 ± 0.01 L h−1), which were not significantly different (Figure 3A).
    The lowest qe occurred at L0 (1.06 ± 0.04 L h−1); however, it was not significantly
    different from L1/4 (1.08 ± 0.00 L h−1) and L1/2 (1.08 ± 0.01 L h−1). Soshanguve
    showed a general decrease in qe from the inlet to the middle of the drip lines
    followed by an increase in the downstream direction (Figure 3B). However, the
    differences of qe were not significant with values varying from 0.43 ± 0.11 L
    h−1for L1/2 to 0.59 ± 0.11 L h−1 for L0. In contrast, Tarlton’s qe increased from
    L0 to L1/4 and then decreased to L1/2 followed by an increase (Figure 3C). The
    highest qe (1.59 ± 0.12 L h−1) occurred at L1/4 and the lowest at L1/2 (1.27 ±
    0.07 L h−1), which were significantly different. The qe for the other measurement
    positions on the drip lines were not significantly different. Westonaria exhibited
    a general decrease in qe in the downstream direction (Figure 3D); however, there
    was no significant differences among the qe. Therefore, the highest qe (1.40 ±
    0.31 L h−1) occurred at L0 and the lowest at L (0.83 ± 0.34 L h−1). 3.4. Distribution
    Uniformity The computed distribution uniformities (DUs) also showed big variations
    among the Agri-Parks (Figure 4). Nevertheless, all the DUs were greater than 50%.
    The Agri-Park-level DU performance decreased in the order Rooiwal > Tarlton >
    Westonaria > Soshanguve with DU values of 95, 86, 67, and 60%, respectively. Nevertheless,
    these values were generally lower than expected for pressure-compensated drip
    irrigation systems. Comparing these values with the standard DU for drip irrigation
    of 85% [24], indicates that only Rooiwal and Tarlton were performing at the acceptable
    level, while Westonaria and Soshanguve performed poorly. Noteworthy is that the
    value of 86% for Tarlton can be a cause for concern as it is just above the acceptable
    limit. Figure 4. Comparison of distribution uniformities for four Agri-parks in
    Gauteng province, namely Rooiwal, Soshanguve, Tarlton, and Westonaria. 4. Discussion
    Evaluating the condition of irrigation infrastructure is essential because the
    condition reflects on the level of management and maintenance on the systems.
    Moreover, the condition often correlates with the performance of the systems.
    Irrigation system performance is generally evaluated using several parameters
    and/or indicators at a time [5,17,24,25] because none of the performance parameters
    are individually conclusive. The authors [5] used distribution uniformity (DU),
    coefficient of uniformity (CU), emission uniformity (EU), application efficiency
    (AE), and potential application efficiency of the lower quarter. The authors [24]
    used CU, delivery performance ratio, irrigation productivity, labour requirement,
    and water quality. The authors [25] used CU, EU, and DU. The authors of [17] used
    a mix of indicators from [5,24]. The choice of parameters depends on whether the
    assessment is focusing on technical or physical characteristics of the system,
    aim of assessment, components to be assessed, taste and experience of the evaluator(s),
    and many other considerations. Despite no access to baseline data for all the
    four study sites, the condition assessment results suggest the systems had deteriorated
    significantly [23]. The condition indices (CIs) varied from 2.12 to 6.29 (Table
    2). According to [23], the CIs of <3 for the Booster pump–Manifold at Soshanguve
    and Westonaria (Table 1) implied a need for immediate replacement because the
    components had deteriorated beyond meaningful repair. Most of the irrigation system
    components at the Agri-Parks had CIs between 4 and 6, which implied their use
    could only be allowed for the next 3–5 years with a reassessment to be performed
    within the same period. In addition, there is need for the Agri-Parks to plan
    for repairing the components in 5–10 years’ time from the date of the current
    assessment. The components with CIs > 6, such as the Main pump–Tank components
    at Soshanguve and Tarlton, were in good condition at the time of the current assessment
    with clear signs of recent repair works. The recommendations on continued use
    with contingent plans for repairs are only valid in the absence of a sudden and
    drastic deterioration during the intervening period. For instance, thefts and
    vandalism of the system components can invalidate the recommendations. It is,
    therefore, important to note that the recommendations presented [23] depend on
    component material responses to the vagaries of the natural operating environments.
    It was surprising to observe that some components performed well despite their
    very poor condition as depicted by their CI values, and some performed not so
    well despite their good condition (compare Table 2 and Table 3). For example,
    the Booster pump–Filter units at Soshanguve and Westonaria performed well with
    conveyance efficiencies (CEs) of 99 and 73%, respectively, despite the very low
    respective CIs of 2.73 and 2.12. This was indicative of the fact that sometimes
    patchwork repairs can be effective, especially in the smallholder systems where
    resources are limited. Rubber and plastic were evidently used to reduce water
    leaks from broken subcomponents at the Agri-Parks. However, the success of patchworks
    cannot be guaranteed as evidenced by the poor performance of the Booster pump–Filter
    unit at Westonaria. In contrast, the good condition of the Pump–Tank components
    at Soshanguve and Tarlton did not result in impressive water CEs, where the respective
    values were 86 and 83%. Nevertheless, Soshanguve still performed better in terms
    of water conveyance than Tarlton despite the poorer condition, which brings to
    fore the impact of good management skills and experience. Soshanguve is managed
    by an individual farmer who has hired a skilled labour force to operate the system
    daily, while the co-operative of more than five individuals at Tarlton is less-skilled.
    Drip irrigation is one of the most efficient irrigation systems when it is managed
    and maintained properly [26]. The distribution uniformity results show pristine
    performance at Rooiwal, acceptable performance at Tarlton, and below-acceptable
    standard at Westonaria and Soshanguve (Figure 4). The results of the study show
    a close link between the infield infrastructural conditions and distribution uniformity,
    with both parameters decreasing in the order Rooiwal > Tarlton > Westonaria >
    Soshanguve. This close relationship suggests that the condition indices could
    be used as predictors of distribution uniformities in drip irrigation systems
    at the Agri-Parks. However, there was no clear relationship between the condition
    indices, on one hand, and conveyance efficiency and emitter discharge, on the
    other. These Agri-Parks were characterised by rampant water leaks at pipe joints,
    broken drip lines, suspended drip lines resulting in water drops migrating down
    the line before they coalesce and fall to the ground, and poor sealing at end
    of the drip lines. The current study did not have access to the design documents
    for the Agri-Parks, which hampered the interpretation of the results because there
    was no background information to compare against the study observations. The other
    limitation is that nonphysical parameters that may have a significant influence
    on the performance of the Agri-Parks (such as the type of land tenure in place
    and quality of training imparted on the farmers) were not considered. There was
    also a lack of variety in the study as all the studied Agri-Parks exhibited a
    close similarity in terms of the irrigation infrastructure and layout. Therefore,
    there was no opportunity to test the Condition Assessment Model on different setups.
    It is on the bases of these limitations that a longer-term study covering more
    and diverse smallholder irrigation systems is recommended. Testing the Condition
    Assessment Model on a wider scale would help in improving its robustness and predictive
    capacity. The other recommendation is for proper training of the extension officials
    responsible for Agri-Parks and similar enterprisers and the farmers’ irrigation
    scheduling under drip systems for better benefits. There is also a need for clear
    guidelines on cleaning and maintenance of the drip systems and to ensure that
    the systems are operated within the design limits. Broken drip lines causing leakages
    need to be replaced immediately. 5. Conclusions The main conclusion from the study
    is that the condition of the infield drip irrigation infrastructure has a positive
    correlation with its distribution uniformity. Therefore, it is possible to use
    the Condition Assessment Model (developed by ARC-NRE/AE)-generated condition indices
    to predict the distribution uniformity of a drip irrigation system. This sets
    a firm foundation for developing a simple model/tool for motoring and evaluating
    smallholder drip irrigation systems. The tool can be used by extension advisors
    and local decision makers to guide necessary corrective strategies in the smallholder
    irrigation sector. It is also clear from the study results that patchwork repairs
    affected the possible relationships between condition indices and conveyance efficiency
    of the pipe networks at the Agri-Parks. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: Due to the recent advances in the domain of smart agriculture as a
    result of integrating traditional agriculture and the latest information technologies
    including the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, and artificial intelligence
    (AI), there is an urgent need to address the information security-related issues
    and challenges in this field. In this article, we propose the integration of lightweight
    cryptography techniques into the IoT ecosystem for smart agriculture to meet the
    requirements of resource-constrained IoT devices. Moreover, we investigate the
    adoption of a lightweight encryption protocol, namely, the Expeditious Cipher
    (X-cipher), to create a secure channel between the sensing layer and the broker
    in the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol as well as a secure channel
    between the broker and its subscribers. Our case study focuses on smart irrigation
    systems, and the MQTT protocol is deployed as the application messaging protocol
    in these systems. Smart irrigation strives to decrease the misuse of natural resources
    by enhancing the efficiency of agricultural irrigation. This secure channel is
    utilized to eliminate the main security threat in precision agriculture by protecting
    sensors’ published data from eavesdropping and theft, as well as from unauthorized
    changes to sensitive data that can negatively impact crops’ development. In addition,
    the secure channel protects the irrigation decisions made by the data analytics
    (DA) entity regarding the irrigation time and the quantity of water that is returned
    to actuators from any alteration. Performance evaluation of our chosen lightweight
    encryption protocol revealed an improvement in terms of power consumption, execution
    time, and required memory usage when compared with the Advanced Encryption Standard
    (AES). Moreover, the selected lightweight encryption protocol outperforms the
    PRESENT lightweight encryption protocol in terms of throughput and memory usage.

    An increasing number of research studies on smart agriculture has been motivated
    by several challenges. First, the explosive growth of the world population [1].
    According to the United Nations (UN) Food and Agriculture Organization, an increase
    of up to 70% more food will be required in 2050. Second, the declining agricultural
    lands and exhaustion of finite natural resources such as fresh water and arable
    land. In addition, the decreasing number of agricultural laborers in the majority
    of countries. As a consequence of this agricultural workforce decline, there is
    an urgent need for the adoption of IoT solutions in agriculture practices to reduce
    the need for manual labor. IoT solutions support farmers to tighten the supply-demand
    gap. Precision agriculture integrates wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with traditional
    agriculture to improve crop yields. This is carried out by using a large number
    of low-power multi-function wireless communication sensors to remotely monitor
    the farmland to collect environmental data, crop growth data, and livestock health
    data to guarantee a reduction in the possible threats to the production process
    and help farmers make better decisions. Recently, there is a shift from the usage
    of WSNs for smart agriculture to the IoT as the main enabling technology for smart
    agriculture. The IoT combines several technologies such as radio frequency identification,
    wireless sensor networks, middleware systems, end-user applications, and cloud
    computing. In [2,3], the authors presented an IoT ecosystem architecture for smart
    agriculture that is made up of four main components, namely: IoT devices, communication
    technology, internet, and data storage and processing. First, the IoT devices
    are responsible for monitoring the farming environment and collecting environmental
    data, crop growth data, and livestock health data. Second, the role of communication
    technology is to establish robust, reliable, and secure communication between
    the cloud and the farms. Wireless communication standards are categorized based
    on the coverage range into short-range and long-range standards. The short-range
    standards include Bluetooth, near-field communication (NFC)-enabled devices, ZigBee,
    Z-Wave, and passive and active radio frequency identification (RFID) systems.
    The long-range communication standards are defined as low-power wide-area networks
    (LPWA). Examples of long-range communication standards include LoRa, Sigfox, and
    NB-IoT. The LPWA technologies provide a wide area of coverage to low-power devices
    [4]. LPWA technologies outperform conventional cellular and short-range wireless
    technologies for different emerging smart city and machine-to-machine applications
    such as metering, logistics, industrial monitoring, and agriculture. However,
    LPWA technologies realize long-range ranging from a few to tens of kilometers
    and low-power operations at the expense of a low data rate. The primary aim of
    LPWA technologies is to achieve a 10-year battery life. LPWA technologies are
    suitable for delay-tolerant applications, as they achieve throughput in orders
    of ten kilobits per second and high latency in orders of seconds or minutes. Long
    range is achieved due to the use of the sub-1GHz band, and the deployment of narrow-band
    and spread spectrum techniques are the modulation techniques adopted by different
    LPWA technologies. In [4], the authors compared the technical specifications of
    various LPWA technologies and standards. The choice of communication technology
    depended on the application of the IoT device and the type of topology. Third,
    the internet is the core network layer enabling the availability of data collected
    by IoT devices anywhere and anytime. Routing Protocol for Low Power and Lossy
    Networks (RPL) [5] has been standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force
    (IETF) as a routing protocol for resource-constrained nodes in IoT. RPL builds
    a robust topology over lossy links. A destination-oriented directed acyclic graph
    (DODAG) is the core of RPL, which represents a routing diagram of nodes. In [6],
    the authors proposed an enhanced routing protocol based on RPL called E-RPL that
    decreases the number of control messages. Moreover, they proposed a flexible multi-constrained
    objective function (OF) that integrates several metrics such as energy, delay,
    and bandwidth to define the end-to-end path between the sink and a given node.
    The simulation results of their proposal revealed a remarkable improvement in
    terms of end-to-end delay, energy consumption, and routing overhead. Finally,
    different platforms have been developed to provide data analytics, data management,
    and data storage of the big data collected from sensors. Data analytics (DA) has
    a primary role in improving the efficiency of smart agriculture systems and in
    increasing productivity. DA is classified into five classes based on the requirements
    of IoT applications: real-time analytics, memory-level analytics, offline analytics,
    business intelligence-level analytics, and massive analytics. In [7], the authors
    presented big IoT data analytic types, methods, and technologies for big data
    mining. DA can help in insurance, prediction, storage management, decision-making,
    farm management, and precision farming. In irrigation systems, the automated decision
    made by DA controls the water supply timing and quantity. The main objective of
    big data analytics is to analyze collected information to predict and identify
    recent trends, find hidden information, and finally, make decisions. Prediction,
    classification, clustering, and association rules are the main big data analytics
    methods. Furthermore, smart irrigation is a precision agriculture application
    [8] that aims to control water consumption in the agriculture sector as a scarce
    resource in many countries by deploying IoT technology to remotely gather information
    from sensors implanted in agriculture terrains to monitor soil different parameters
    in all stages. Based on the collected information, a decision is made on when
    to irrigate and the water quantity and quality required. Table 1 reviews the recent
    research on IoT-based precision irrigation systems, highlighting the communication
    protocol, data analytics, and security techniques deployed in these systems. As
    can be noticed, recent research ignores security techniques and concentrates on
    the usage of machine learning and artificial intelligence approaches, such as
    fuzzy logic, artificial neural networks (ANNs), and regression models, to optimize
    IoT-based irrigation systems employing different environmental parameters and
    weather conditions to schedule the irrigation timing and the quantity of water
    used for irrigation. However, any alteration in the information coming from sensors
    and decisions passed to actuators can lead to crop damage, which is considered
    to be a crucial threat to the national security of any country. As such, a secure
    channel must be developed between the sensing layer and the decision-making entity
    to secure information flowing from the sensors to the decision-maker entity and
    to secure the decision returned to the actuators that control the irrigation system.
    Because precision agriculture is highly dependent on data and information from
    the monitored system, any alteration in such data during runtime can lead to expensive
    unmanageable decisions and actions from farmers. Therefore, there is a need to
    adopt the security mechanisms required to guarantee basic security functions:
    authenticity, reliability, integrity, and availability. Moreover, these security
    mechanisms must be lightweight to meet the requirements of constrained devices
    used in IoT. Table 1. Literature review of recently proposed IoT-based precision
    irrigation systems. In [1], the authors reviewed the previous work conducted on
    smart agriculture and highlights different aspects of applying IoT solutions in
    smart agriculture. Moreover, the article reviews smart agriculture’s related security
    issues and compares security issues in the industry (urban) and agriculture (rural).
    In [16], the authors presented a classification of security threats in smart agriculture
    and precision agriculture environments. The authors classified security threats
    into six possible attacks: attacks on hardware (side channel attack and radio
    frequency (RF) jamming), attacks on the network equipment (denial of service (DoS),
    MITM (man in the middle), botnets, cloud computing attacks), attacks on data (data
    leakage, ransomware, cloud data leakage, false data injection, misconfiguration),
    attacks on applications (software update attacks, malware injection, buffer overflow,
    indirect attacks (SQL injection)), attacks on support chain (third-party attacks,
    data fabrication), and misuse attacks (cyber-terrorism, invalidation, and compliance).
    Another classification of security threats is underlined in [17]. The authors
    classified the security requirements in smart agriculture into six challenges,
    namely: integrity, availability, authentication, confidentiality, privacy, and
    Non-repudiation, and highlighted the possible attacks under each challenge. Moreover,
    a review of existing solutions to IoT security problems is emphasized. In [8],
    the authors added data freshness, authorization, and self-healing to the security
    requirements of smart agriculture. In [18], the authors reviewed IoT communication
    technologies security aspects for smart agriculture. In [19], the authors reviewed
    all categories of security attacks and the application of WSNs in IoT along with
    an evaluation of the countermeasures adopted against each type of attack. Moreover,
    smart irrigation systems developed based on IoT technology consist of constrained
    nodes in terms of power, memory, and processing resources. As a result, conventional
    security protocols can not be supported in such systems [20,21]. Transport layer
    security (TLS) adds overhead in terms of memory and energy on constrained nodes.
    As a result of the dependence on constrained nodes in IoT-based irrigation systems,
    a lightweight security protocol must be deployed. Lightweight cryptography techniques
    balance throughput against power drain, memory usage, and gate equivalent and
    have lower performance when compared to cryptography standards (such as AES and
    SHA-256) [22]. Characteristics of lightweight cryptography are highlighted in
    ISO/IEC 29192 and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27. Lightweight properties are evaluated based
    on chip size and energy consumption and small code and/or RAM size in case of
    software implementation [21]. In [21], the authors discussed privacy in IoT in
    the context of developing solutions and frameworks that address profiling and
    tracking, localization, and tracking challenges and underlined state-of-the-art
    lightweight cryptographic framework for IoT. In [23], the authors proposed a set
    of lightweight security protocols for encryption, authentication, and key management
    for IoT. The authors compared their proposed protocols with IPsec in terms of
    security and computational efficiency. They succeeded in achieving a decreased
    level of resource consumption with an increased level of security. In [24], the
    authors implemented AES and PRESENT ciphers on a smartphone and provided a performance
    evaluation comparison between the two algorithms. AES is the symmetric block cipher
    defined by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) as the standard
    for bulk data encryption, whereas PRESENT is a symmetric ultra-lightweight block
    cipher that was standardized by ISO/IEC. On the other hand, the Message Queue
    Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol has been widely deployed as an application
    layer messaging and information exchange protocol in machine-to-machine (M2M)
    communication [25]. This is due to its ability to function with resource-constrained
    devices that utilize low bandwidth and unreliable links. MQTT is considered a
    lightweight, energy-efficient, and bandwidth-efficient communication protocol.
    MQTT utilizes the publish/subscribe architecture model to provide transition flexibility
    and simplicity of implementation. MQTT’s main components are the publishers (lightweight
    sensors), the subscribers (applications interested in sensor data), and the brokers
    (connect publishers and subscribers and classify sensor data into topics) as illustrated
    in Figure 1. The data generated by a publisher are dispatched to multiple subscribers
    through an MQTT broker. MQTT was proposed in 1999 by Andy Stanford-Clark of IBM
    and Arlen Nipper of Arcom and is currently an OASIS (Organization for the Advancement
    of Structured Information Standards) standard; it also has a standard defined
    in ISO/IEC 20922: 2016. Figure 1. MQTT architecture. Motivated by the increasing
    importance of smart irrigation systems in conserving water as a scarce natural
    resource, the role of precision agriculture in agriculture development, and the
    urgent need to apply information security techniques in the IoT part of the smart
    agriculture ecosystem, our aim in this research is to integrate a lightweight
    cryptography layer into the IoT ecosystem for smart agriculture and to investigate
    the deployment of a lightweight encryption protocol (the Expeditious Cipher) to
    create a secure channel between the sensing layer and the broker of MQTT protocol
    as well as between the broker and its subscribers in smart irrigation systems.
    This secure channel protects the sensors’ published sensitive data from eavesdropping
    and theft and preserves the integrity of data, in addition to protection of the
    decision that is made by the DA entity and returned to actuators. It should be
    noted that the security in IoT-based systems lies in IoT local systems consisting
    of devices constrained in energy and computing power. The following points summarize
    the main contributions of this article. The main contribution of this article
    is the integration of a lightweight cryptography layer to the IoT ecosystem for
    smart agriculture that meets the requirements of constrained devices used in smart
    agriculture in general and specifically, in our proposed IoT-based irrigation
    system. The article investigates the deployment of a lightweight encryption protocol
    (Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher)) to create a secure channel between the sensing
    layer and the broker in the MQTT protocol as well as a secure channel between
    the broker and its subscribers in smart irrigation systems (our case study). The
    proposed model is evaluated through simulation to validate the lightweight property
    of the chosen encryption protocol in terms of power consumption, execution time,
    and memory usage. Moreover, a performance comparison is carried out between the
    Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher), AES, and PRESENT cipher (lightweight standard protocol)
    in terms of power consumption, execution time, memory usage, and average throughput.
    The security requirements of IoT-based agriculture systems and the potential attacks
    against them are discussed. A state-of-the-art lightweight security architectures
    proposed for securing MQTT protocol is reviewed after highlighting the concept
    of lightweight cryptography. The remainder of the article is organized as follows:
    Section 2 presents our proposed secure smart irrigation system after briefly reviewing
    the state-of-the-art proposed lightweight security architectures for securing
    MQTT protocol. Section 3 highlights and discusses the performance evaluation results
    of our selected lightweight encryption algorithm versus AES, in addition to a
    performance comparison between X-cipher and the PRESENT cipher. Section 4 summarizes
    the findings of the article and highlights our suggestions for future work. 2.
    Materials and Methods In this section, the proposed secure IoT-based irrigation
    system architecture is outlined. First, a brief review of the proposed lightweight
    security techniques for securing the MQTT protocol is given. Then, the proposed
    model architecture and hardware components are explained in detail. In addition,
    the applicability of the selected lightweight protocol (X-Cipher) on NodeMCU is
    verified. 2.1. MQTT Security Challenges and Solutions MQTT runs over TCP with
    few security techniques such as simple authorization policies and basic authentication
    techniques. TLS/SSL with session key management has been suggested for securing
    MQTT; however, proposed security techniques for MQTT should be lightweight for
    deployment in IoT environments. TLS/SSL has been proven to have performance issues
    in terms of processing time, memory required, and energy consumption, in addition
    to the various possible attacks such as Heartbleed, CRIME, BEAST, and RC4. Furthermore,
    TLS does not provide fine-grained access control [26]. Moreover, MQTT suffers
    from several security shortcomings, mainly from a lack of confidentiality, integrity,
    availability (DOS attack), mutual authentication, access control, control message
    security, and end-to-end security. In [27], the authors reviewed the symmetric,
    asymmetric, and hybrid lightweight schemes proposed in the literature for guaranteeing
    the confidentiality of transmitted data using MQTT. Moreover, the authors’ review
    suggested security techniques for guaranteeing access control in MQTT. According
    to [28], the security threats against MQTT are mainly replay attacks and man-in-the-middle
    attacks (MITM). Value-to-keyed-hash message authentication code (Value-to-HMAC)
    has been deployed to achieve information confidentiality. In [26], the authors
    designed a security architecture for MQTT-SN to achieve end-to-end security in
    addition to fine-grained access control. Moreover, they introduced a certificate
    subject to create a secure direct channel between a publisher and a set of subscribers.
    In addition, they designed security schemes to integrate mutual authentication
    and control message security functions into the standard MQTT-SN control messages,
    without relying on the TLS. In [20], the authors proposed ChaCha20-Poly1305 Authenticated
    Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) as a solution to secure resource-constrained
    node communication over MQTT/MQTT-SN. RFC 6574 [29] describes constrained nodes
    as they are bandwidth constrained, energy constrained, and memory constrained.
    Performance evaluation of the proposed scheme revealed a low memory requirement
    and low processing time. In [30], the authors presented a lightweight authentication
    and encryption mechanism based on ECDHE-PSK (Elliptic Curve Diffie–Hellman Ephemeral)-(Pre-Shared
    Key) for IoT-constrained devices. The proposed security mechanism outperforms
    the ECDHE-ECDSA in all performance evaluation tests. 2.2. Proposed IoT System
    Architecture The main objective of our proposed system is the addition of a lightweight
    cryptography layer to the agriculture IoT ecosystem, as shown in Figure 2. The
    function of this layer is to create a secure communication channel between the
    sensing/actuator layer (IoT nodes) and the subscriber layer, thus protecting sensors’
    published data from eavesdropping and theft, as well as from unauthorized changes
    to sensitive data that can negatively impact crop development. In addition, the
    secure channel protects the irrigation decision made by the data analytics (DA)
    entity regarding the irrigation time and the quantity of water that is returned
    to actuators from any alteration while meeting the requirements of IoT-constrained
    devices in terms of memory usage and power consumption by ensuring the application
    of lightweight cryptography techniques. Figure 2. Traditional Agri-IoT ecosystem
    versus proposed Agri-IoT ecosystem. Figure 3 depicts the architecture of our proposed
    secure IoT-based smart irrigation system. Figure 3a illustrates the general system
    architecture and Figure 3b shows the hardware components of the proposed system.
    The proposed architecture consists of five layers: the sensing/actuator layer,
    the lightweight cryptography layer, the communication layer, the network layer,
    and the application layer. Figure 3. The proposed model. (a) proposed model architecture.
    (b) proposed model hardware. 2.2.1. The Sensing Layer The sensing layer is made
    up of multiple low-power sensors that are spread on agricultural land to continuously
    collect soil temperature and humidity. The DHT11 sensors are used to measure the
    temperature value in degrees Celsius and the humidity value in percentage. The
    DHT-11 sensor has three pins: two of which are for power and one is for output
    data transmission. The three pins are used to connect the DHT11 sensor to the
    NodeMCU ESP8266 board. The DHT-11 library must be added to the Arduino IDE software
    before uploading to the NodeMCU ESP8266 board the code written to read the humidity
    and temperature value from the DHT11 sensor. Together, the DHT-11 sensor and the
    NodeMCU form the IoT node. The NodeMCU runs the MQTT client code and publishes
    the sensed soil parameters (the temperature and humidity readings) to the MQTT
    broker after encrypting the message using the Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher). The
    MQTT broker runs on Raspberry Pi, which is a low-power single-board computer.
    NodeMCU ESP8266 has a built-in WiFi module that is used as the communication protocol
    between NodeMCU and the Raspberry Pi. The MQTT protocol is chosen due to its short
    message transmission capability and low-bandwidth requirement, which makes it
    more convenient for machine-to-machine (M2M) communication. Moreover, the Raspberry
    Pi was selected as a processing layer because of its low cost and common use in
    IoT applications. Mosquitto is an open-source lightweight MQTT broker and is selected
    as it is suitable for Raspberry Pi. The Mosquitto broker decrypts the message
    and adds the information in the message to the related topic. Then, information
    is encrypted again before being published (broadcast) to all subscribers. The
    ThingSpeak cloud platform is used among subscribers that execute cloud analysis
    for making irrigation decisions regarding the time of irrigation and the quantity
    of water. Then the irrigation decision is published to the broker to be decrypted
    and then encrypted again before being published to the actuator. The nodeMCU at
    the actuator layer decrypts the message and then passes the control signal to
    the attached pump to activate the irrigation. 2.2.2. Lightweight Cryptography
    Layer In this layer, a lightweight protocol must be deployed, because the proposed
    IoT-based irrigation system is made up of constrained devices in terms of memory
    and energy. Characteristics of lightweight cryptography were highlighted in ISO/IEC
    29192 and ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27. Lightweight properties are evaluated based on chip
    size and energy consumption, and small code and/or RAM size in case of software
    implementation [21]. So, the Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher) was selected [31].
    The X-cipher was proposed in 2011 and is considered a lightweight high-throughput
    encryption protocol. The cipher sub-keys are generated using the well-studied
    SHA-512 and Whirlpool 512 hash functions. The two hash functions are cascaded
    in a pseudo-random manner that depends on the user key to enhance the cipher security.
    The cipher utilizes a variable-size user key. The encryption rate can attain 512
    bits per cycle in the case of hardware implementation with parallelization encryption
    paths. Eight rounds are recommended for the proper operation of the Expeditious
    Cipher (X-cipher). The circuitry of the encryptor and decryptor are identical,
    as such, a high code density and small implementation area are achieved, as required
    by lightweight cryptography. An additional important feature of the X-cipher is
    the separation of key scheduling process from the encryption process, which allows
    the change of cipher design, key, and block size by simply changing the hash function.
    The Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher) complete encryption algorithm is presented in
    [31]. NodeMCU has a cryptography module called crypto that contains various functions
    for working with cryptographic algorithms. The AES 128-bit is supported in ECB
    and CBC modes, in addition to several hash functions, namely, MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256,
    SHA-384, and SHA-512. The MQTT module implemented in C language is available on
    the NodeMCU ESP8266 board to run the MQTT client to publish the temperature and
    humidity readings to the MQTT broker running on Raspberry Pi. So, because the
    proposed Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher) depends on the SHA-512 hash function that
    is already implemented in the crypto module and the modulo 2 addition between
    the hashed key and the plain text, the selected lightweight algorithm can be compiled
    easily on the NodeMCU board. Table 2 compares the operational features of AES
    (traditional encryption protocol), PRESENT (lightweight standard protocol), X-cipher
    (selected lightweight protocol), and the lightweight encryption protocol proposed
    recently in the literature. Table 2. Comparison between X-cipher, AES, PRESENT,
    and lightweight encryption. 2.2.3. Communication Layer The communication between
    NodeMCU ESP8266 and the Raspberry Pi is achieved using WiFi, as the NodeMCU has
    a built-in WiFi module. On the other hand, the communication between the Raspberry
    Pi and the internet can be carried out using LoRaWAN technology taking into consideration
    the low data rate characteristic of LPWA technologies discussed in Section 1 or
    through the GSM module. 3. Results In this section, we validate through simulation
    that the chosen lightweight cipher satisfies the requirements of constrained devices
    in IoT-based smart irrigation systems in terms of power consumption and memory
    usage. Moreover, we compare the chosen lightweight cipher with PRESENT, a standard
    lightweight protocol, and AES, a standard encryption protocol. 3.1. Simulation
    Scenario Table 3 presents the simulation packages used in the performance evaluation
    of the X-cipher. A Windows 10 virtual machine runs the Raspberry Pi emulator that
    was selected. An Ubuntu 20.1 virtual machine is used for the subscriber. The DHT-11
    sensors are connected directly to the Raspberry Pi Emulator. Figure 4 illustrates
    selected parts of the Python code used to obtain humidity and temperature reading
    from DHTT-11 sensors. The Adafruit_DHT Python library is available for reading
    the DHT series of humidity and temperature sensors on a Raspberry Pi. First, the
    sensor type and the pin that the DHT-11 is connected through to Raspberry Pi must
    be specified. Then, the function Adafruit_DHT.read_retry is used to read from
    the specified pin. As can be noticed, the humidity and temperature readings are
    encrypted using the lightweight class function encrypt, which is our class implementation
    for the X-cipher protocol. Moreover, Figure 5 depicts a selected part of the MQTT
    client code for the Raspberry Pi emulator. The paho.mqtt.client Python library
    is deployed to provide a client class with support for MQTT protocol, and it also
    provides some helper functions that facilitate publishing messages to an MQTT
    server. Figure 6 highlights selected parts of the python code used to calculate
    memory usage. Calculations of memory usage rely on the process.memory_info and
    choosing the “rss” option returns the actual physical memory the process is using.
    Figure 7 illustrated selected parts of the Python code used to calculate power
    consumption. The pyRAPL Python library is utilized to measure the energy footprint
    of a host machine along with the execution of a piece of Python code. Three performance
    metrics were used to evaluate and compare the Expeditious Cipher (X-cipher) and
    the AES cipher [32]: power consumption, execution time, and memory usage for a
    file of 10,000 message comma separated of total size 20 MB. Figure 4. The Raspberry
    Pi emulator code for obtaining humidity and temperature readings from sensors.
    Figure 5. MQTT client code for the Raspberry Pi emulator. Figure 6. Memory usage
    calculation function. Figure 7. Power consumption calculation function. Table
    3. Software versions deployed in performance evaluation. Figure 8 compares the
    two algorithms’ power consumption during the encryption and decryption process.
    As shown in the graph, X-cipher requires less power consumption than AES throughout
    the whole encryption and decryption process. This makes X-cipher more convenient
    for IoT devices with limited energy resources. This is due to the dependency of
    X-cipher on just the XOR function between the generated hashed sub-key and the
    plain text, whereas AES depends on substitution–permutation operations. Moreover,
    the number of rounds in X-cipher is just eight, whereas the number of rounds is
    ten in the case of AES. Figure 8. Power Consumption during encryption and decryption
    processes for AES and X-cipher. Figure 9 compares the memory usage during the
    encryption and decryption process for the two algorithms. As shown in the graph,
    X-cipher requires less memory than AES throughout the whole encryption and decryption
    process. X-cipher has average memory usages of 20.04 MB and 22.38 MB during the
    encryption and decryption processes, respectively, in contrast to AES, which has
    average memory usages of 24.56 MB and 36.2 MB during the encryption and decryption
    processes, respectively. The higher memory usage in the case of AES is due to
    the substitution–permutation principle employed in AES. This implies that X-cipher
    is more suitable for IoT devices with constrained memory capacity. Figure 9. Average
    Memory usage for AES and X-cipher. Figure 9 presents the average memory usage
    for both algorithms for the encryption and decryption of 20 MB messages. Figure
    10 illustrates the average execution time for AES and X-cipher. As shown in both
    figures, the selected lightweight algorithm (X-cipher) outperforms AES in terms
    of average memory usage and average execution time. Figure 10. Average Execution
    time for AES and X-cipher. 3.2. Comparison with Related Work In this section,
    we compare the performance of the X-cipher versus the PRESENT ultra-lightweight
    cipher [33] presented in the literature for the same size of data of 20 MB. Our
    selected algorithm X-cipher outperforms the PRESENT algorithm in terms of throughput
    and memory usage as shown in Table 4 and Table 5. This is because PRESENT deploys
    the substitution permutation network principle although it has a reduced substitution
    box and due to the higher number of rounds, which is 31 rounds. Table 4. Throughput
    results comparison between X-cipher and PRESENT. Table 5. Memory usage results
    in comparison between X-cipher and PRESENT. 4. Conclusions Smart irrigation systems
    integrate IoT technology with smart agriculture to conserve water consumption
    during the irrigation of agricultural land. This research focuses on the evaluation
    of the adoption of a lightweight security protocol to secure communication in
    smart irrigation systems. The adopted encryption algorithm (Expeditious Cipher)
    creates a secure channel between publishers and the broker of the MQTT protocol
    as well as between the broker and its subscribers. MQTT was chosen as the IoT
    application protocol for messaging in our proposed irrigation system, as it is
    a bandwidth- and energy-efficient protocol. The evaluated lightweight protocol
    reduces resource consumption in terms of memory usage and power consumption as
    well as minimizes the execution time, which makes it suitable for IoT-based resource-constrained
    systems. There is a trade-off between the security level and the memory and energy-processing
    resources required. AES achieves a higher security level at the cost of more memory
    usage and energy consumption, which causes performance degradation in constrained
    devices, opposite to lightweight cipher, which achieves an adequate level of security
    with low memory usage and reduced energy consumption. Comparing our selected X-cipher
    protocol with the PRESENT cipher reveals a lower memory usage and higher throughput
    in favor of the X-cipher. In the future, we will investigate the integration of
    our proposed system with software-defined networking (SDN) technology to implement
    the security models at the controller to offload publishers and brokers from the
    additional processing required by security algorithms. Moreover, we will develop
    a deep-learning model to predict the irrigation time and the required amount of
    water required for irrigation. Author Contributions Conceptualization, C.F. and

  description: Low efficiency of irrigation is a major problem with surface irrigation
    methods, mainly due to poor management and improper design. The objective of this
    study was to evaluate and improve the performance of different surge and alternate
    furrow irrigation methods. A field experiment was conducted during the grain maize
    growing season in the Jayedar Plain of Poldokhtar City (southwest of Iran) in
    the years 2020 and 2021. Five different furrow irrigation methods including conventional
    furrow irrigation (CFI), surge irrigation with on/off cycle ratios of 1 and 0.5
    (SFI1–1 and SFI1–2, respectively), fixed alternate irrigation (FFI) and variable
    alternate irrigation (AFI) were investigated. A total of 15 irrigation evaluations
    were performed at the initial, middle, and end of the growing season by measuring
    inflow rate, cutoff time, outflow rate, infiltration and advance time. The length
    and spacing of experimental furrows were 120 and 0.75 m, respectively, and the
    inflow rate of furrows and the flow cutoff times at the initial (3rd irrigation),
    middle (6th irrigation), and end (9th irrigation) of the season were 0.28 L/s
    and 240 min, 0.42 L/s and 360 min, 0.35 L/s and 300 min, respectively. The WinSRFR
    3.1 software was calibrated and applied using field data based on the zero-inertia
    model. The results of the furrow irrigation sensitivity analysis with WinSRFR
    3.1 software demonstrated that furrow irrigation in the studied area was most
    sensitive to the inflow rate, cutoff time and infiltration parameters, respectively.
    There were high correlations between the measured and simulated values of runoff,
    infiltration and advance time (coefficient of determination of 1.0, 0.94, and
    0.97, respectively). The relative error values in estimating runoff, infiltration
    and advance time were 5.60 %, 5.09 %, and 2.14 %, respectively. Mean performance
    indices of different furrow irrigation methods under field experiments showed
    that the highest values of Application Efficiency (78.7 %), Potential Application
    Efficiency of the minimum (69.5 %), and Potential Application Efficiency of low-quarter
    (74.1 %) were observed under the AFI method. By optimizing the inflow rate and
    flow cutoff time, application efficiencies of 66.6–80.7 % were obtained for different
    irrigation methods. The results of this study show that AFI is a more suitable
    method for maize irrigation in the study area.

    software 1. Introduction Surface irrigation is the oldest and the most common
    irrigation method. Pressurized irrigation systems usually have high irrigation
    efficiency, but due to rising energy and equipment costs, many researchers carry
    out significant research to increase efficiency of surface irrigation systems
    and propose this method as a proper alternative to pressurized irrigation methods.
    Proper design and management of surface irrigation will improve irrigation performance
    indices, and increase water productivity and reduce agrochemical pollution (Ebrahimian
    and Playán, 2014, Lalehzari et al., 2015, Mazarei et al., 2020). In Iran, 37.8
    % of the total studies of irrigation systems are related to furrow irrigation
    and its application efficiency and uniformity are reported as 49 % and 76 %, respectively
    (Abbasi and Sohrab, 2011). One of the ways to improve the performance of furrow
    irrigation is to complement field experiments with simulation models. The major
    benefits of mathematical simulation models for surface irrigation include high
    speed, low cost, investigation of various combinations of design parameters without
    the need for extensive and high-cost field experiments, and a rapid review of
    new surface irrigation schemes in a wide range (Bassett, 1972, Smith et al., 2018,
    Abbasi et al., 2003). Ebrahimian and Liaghat (2011) investigated the performance
    of three mathematical models, hydrodynamics, zero-inertia, and kinematic wave
    for furrow and border irrigation methods. Based on the results, a non-significant
    difference was found between hydrodynamic and zero-inertia models in estimating
    advance and recession times, infiltration, and runoff for both furrow and border
    irrigation methods. Gillies and Smith (2015) developed the SISCO software to evaluate
    and improve surface irrigation performance. They reported the suitability of the
    software to evaluate furrow and border irrigation performance in Australia. Sayari
    et al. (2017) evaluated the furrow irrigation system with different inflow rates
    using the WinSRFR software (Bautista et al., 2009). They found that the kinematic
    wave model was less accurate than the zero-inertia model. The lowest error in
    estimating advance time was 1.2 % (constant inflow rate) and the highest error
    was 11.2 % (incremental inflow rate). The highest water application efficiency
    and the lowest amount of runoff (72 % and 28 %, respectively) corresponded to
    the cut-back inflow regime. Mazarei et al. (2020) applied the WinSRFR software
    to optimize furrow irrigation performance in sugarcane farms (southwestern Iran)
    under different inflow rates and geometric parameters. They suggested a flow rate
    of 3 L/s and a cut-off time of 379.5 min to achieve the highest irrigation performance
    in their conditions. Ismail et al. (2021) evaluated and optimized the performance
    of furrow irrigation systems in Egypt using the WinSRFR software. They concluded
    that increasing the furrow length reduced irrigation performance, and the optimal
    combination of inflow rate and cut-off time resulted in increased Application
    Efficiency and reduced deep percolation losses. Yadeta et al. (2022) assessed
    the furrow irrigation performance using the WinSRFR software in Ethiopia. The
    results indicated that changing decision variables (inflow rate and cut-off time)
    significantly improved performance indices, such as application efficiency and
    deep percolation, but the uniformity of distribution remained unchanged. The performance
    calculated by the software was better than the performance determined in the irrigation
    evaluation. Wu et al. (2017) investigated the accuracy of the SIRMOD model in
    the simulation of alternate furrow irrigation (AFI) and conventional furrow irrigation
    (CFI) and stated that the simulations were done with very good accuracy in both
    cases. Ahmadabadi et al. (2020) investigated various scenarios using the SIRMOD
    model to improve furrow irrigation application efficiency in sugar beet fields
    located in the Moghan plain of Ardabil province, Iran. The results demonstrated
    that using different scenarios could significantly reduce water losses in the
    field. Ebrahimian et al. (2020) used various methods to estimate infiltration
    parameters of furrow irrigation. The results demonstrated that the Elliott and
    Walker method was the most accurate among the various two-point methods. The multi-level
    calibration method was the most accurate method for estimating the infiltration
    coefficients compared to other computer-based models. Their sensitivity analysis
    demonstrated that changes of errors in estimating infiltration parameters were
    a function of soil texture, furrow length, inflow, and field slope. Chen et al.
    (2012) reported that proper flow rate could improve application efficiency of
    furrow irrigation system in North China Plain by 27 %. Anwar et al. (2016), Akbar
    et al. (2016) and Nie et al. (2019) also demonstrated that a proper combination
    of inflow and cutoff time increased application efficiency to the 75–90 % range.
    By the hydraulic analysis of surface irrigation, WinSRFR software is able to determine
    the optimal performance and select a solution that is more compatible with implementation
    constraints (Bautista et al., 2009). To evaluate the performance of the surface
    irrigation simulation models and obtain reliable results, the field parameters
    of the model need to be measured with an acceptable level of accuracy. The simulation
    accuracy of the model depends on the input factors, especially the inflow rate,
    the infiltration equation coefficients, and the Manning''s roughness coefficient
    (Ebrahimian and Liaghat, 2011). For the proper design of a surface irrigation
    systems, many variables need to be considered. Operations irrigation variables
    are limited to cut-off time and inflow rate. In this situation, iso-performance
    curves are considered a suitable tool to improve the performance of the system
    (Bautista et al., 2019). Due to the need to improve furrow irrigation performance
    in the Jayder Plain of southwest of Iran, this study was conducted during the
    grain maize growing season using five different furrow irrigation methods (including
    one conventional, two alternate and two surge methods) with the following goals:
    1) Perform a sensitivity analysis of furrow irrigation for key input parameters
    with WinSRFR software. 2) Parameterize the WinSRFR software to improve different
    furrow irrigation methods (conventional, surge and alternate). 3) Compare the
    performance of different furrow irrigation methods. 4) Determine the optimized
    inflow rate and cutoff time parameters based on the performance indicators of
    the irrigation system. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Research area Field experiments
    were conducted in the Jayder plain of Poldakhtar city, located in the southwest

    the cylinder method. Soil moisture at field capacity (FC) and permanent wilting
    point (PWP) was determined in the pressure heads of 33 and 1500 kPa, respectively,
    using a pressure plate apparatus and a pressure membrane, respectively. The results
    of the soil physicochemical analyses are presented in Table (1). Table 1. Soil

    extract Furrows at 0.75 m spacing and a length of 120 m were made after plowing,
    disc, fertilizing, and re-disc operations. The experimental field was then prepared
    under grain maize cultivation (Single Cross 704) with an furrow irrigation system.
    The crop was sown in the third week of March 2021 and harvested in mid-July 2021.
    The longitudinal and cross slopes of the field were determined at 0.0085 and 0.0022 m/m,
    respectively, by a using survey equipment. Five furrow irrigation methods including
    conventional furrow irrigation (CFI), surge furrow irrigation with on/off cycle
    ratios of 1 and 0.5 (SFI1-1 and SFI1–2, respectively), and fixed and variable
    alternate furrow irrigation (FFI and AFI, respectively) were investigated. In
    total, 20 furrows were established (Fig. 2). The lateral furrows of each treatment
    acted as buffer furrows (to eliminate lateral flow error of measuring from the
    lateral furrows), and the required parameters were measured in the middle furrow.
    A schematic map of the experimental furrows is displayed in Fig. (2). Due to changes
    in soil infiltration characteristics during the growing season, a total of three
    evaluations were carried out at the beginning (third irrigation), middle (sixth
    irrigation), and end (ninth irrigation) of the season. In each irrigation evaluation,
    inflow rate and cutoff time, runoff, infiltration and advance time were recorded.
    The maximum non-erosive inflow rate (0.7 L/s) of the experimental furrows was
    determined using the Bohr (1976) equation. In all irrigation methods, inflow rates
    and cutoff times were 0.28 L/s and 240 min, 0.42 L/s and 360 min, and 0.35 L/s
    and 300 min in the third, sixth, and ninth irrigations, respectively. The inflow
    and outflow rates of the furrows were measured using WSC flumes. Advance time
    was measured and recorded at nailed points at 10 m spacing along the experimental
    furrows. The geometric dimensions of the experimental furrows are presented in
    Table (2). Download : Download high-res image (377KB) Download : Download full-size

    during the growth period were calculated by Eq. (1) (Allen et al., 1998): (1)
    where ETc is crop evapotranspiration (mm/day), KC is the crop coefficient and
    KP denotes the pan coefficient, and EPan indicates the evaporation rate from Class
    A pan in mm/day. The pan evaporation data were obtained from the Poldakhtar synoptic
    meteorological station near the study area. It should be noted that no effective
    precipitation occurred during the plant growth period. The KP was considered 0.7
    on average. The growth period of the crop was 141 days, and the initial, developmental,
    mid and final stages lasted 27, 27, 51, and 36 days, respectively. The KC values
    in four stages were on average 0.55, 0.94, 1.15, and 0.6, respectively. It should
    be noted that it is quite easy for the local farmers to use the pan evaporation
    for the estimation of reference evapotranspiration (ETo) due to the metrological
    data scarcity. 2.4. Infiltration equation The Kostiakov-Lewis infiltration equation
    is largely used in the design and evaluation of surface irrigation systems (Hanson
    et al., 1993): (2) Z=kta+fot where Z is the cumulative infiltration depth (mm),
    denotes the basic infiltration (mm/ hr), t represents time (hr), k (mm/hra) and
    a (-) are the empirical parameters of the equation. In different irrigation methods,
    the inflow-outflow method was used to determine the basic infiltration rate (Walker
    and Skogerboe, 1987). The two-point method was also used to determine the coefficients
    a and k (Walker and Skogerboe, 1987). In surge irrigation, two types of infiltration
    equations are considered, one for the dry- state (the first surge irrigation of
    the furrows) and the other for the wet- state of the furrows (the second, third
    or more irrigation). The coefficients of the Kostiakov-Lewis infiltration equation
    of surge irrigation were calculated based on the Walker- Humpherys method (Walker
    and Humpherys, 1983) for furrows in the wet state (3, 6 and 9 irrigations events).
    Given that irrigation is applied continuously after the end of the advance phase
    in surge irrigation, the storage, depletion and recession times are determined
    based on the continuous flow parameters, and the flow cutoff time is also calculated
    after completing the storage period (Walker and Skogerboe, 1987). 2.5. Manning''s
    roughness coefficient Manning''s equation was used to estimate the roughness coefficient
    assuming uniform flow and reaching the depth of flow to the normal depth. The
    assumption of uniform flow is proposed for relatively high slopes, and this method
    will not be effective on slopes less than 0.001 (Elliott and Walker, 1982, Kamali
    et al., 2018). (3) where n is Manning''s roughness coefficient, A is the area
    of cross section (m2), P is the wetted perimeter (m), S is the longitudinal slope
    of the water surface (m/m), and Q is the inflow rate (m3/S). The flow cross-sectional
    area and wetted perimeter of the experimental furrows were measured using a cross-sectional
    measuring device (Walker and Skogerboe, 1987) at three points (the beginning,
    middle and end) of the furrows. Then, the Manning''s equation was used to estimate
    the mean value of n when infiltration rate reached steady state condition. 2.6.
    WinSRFR software WinSRFR software is based on the numerical solution of the Saint-Venant
    equations. This software assumes inflow characteristics as a variable relative
    to the space from the beginning of the farm or relative to the time from the beginning
    of irrigation; it performs calculations with zero-inertia and kinematic wave models
    with the numerical solution method (Strelkoff et al., 1998). The implementation
    of WinSRFR software has four parts: event analysis, performance analysis, physical
    design, and simulation. In event analysis, the model evaluates field data and
    then uses the Miriam-Keller, field infiltration data, and Elliott and Walker two-point
    methods to estimate the infiltration parameters. The performance analysis part
    consists of testing various applied scenarios of the system. These tests suggest
    different combinations of inflow rate and cutoff time for a system with specific
    dimensions, slopes, and soil characteristics to evaluate the performance of the
    irrigation system. The various performance parameters analyzed by the model such
    as the uniformity of distribution, water application efficiency, deep percolation
    and runoff, minimum infiltrated depth and total applied water depth. In the design
    part, the physical dimensions of the field (length and width) are determined using
    field data to achieve acceptable performance. In the simulation part, the model
    simulates the data given in the event analysis, physical design, and performance
    to run the simulation scenarios alternatively (Strelkoff et al., 1996, Bautista
    et al., 2012). In the present study, the zero-inertia model was used in the WinSRFR3.1
    software. The main inputs of the software include the length and slope of the
    field, the geometric characteristics of the furrow cross-section, the inflow rate,
    and infiltration and Manning''s roughness coefficients. 2.6.1. Calibration of
    the WinSRFR software To calibrate the software, the required data such as furrow
    geometry, Manning''s roughness coefficient, inflow and outflow hydrograph and
    advance time were input data to the software. To evaluate the WinSRFR software,
    the simulated values of runoff, infiltration, and advance time were compared with
    the measured values. The volume of infiltrated water was calculated using the
    volumes of inflow and outflow from the field (runoff). The calibration of the
    software under the field conditions was done using different evaluation criteria
    including relative error (RE), root mean square error (RMSE) and the coefficient
    of determination (R2) (4) (5) (6) (7) ̅ where XP is the simulated value, Xm is
    the measured value, X̅m is the average measured value N is the number of measurements,
    and λ is the slope of the fitting line equation. If λ is less than 1, the software
    underestimated, and if λ is greater than 1, the software overestimated. The λ
    value close to 1 and an RE value close to zero indicate a good estimate by the
    software. 2.6.2. Sensitivity analysis of furrow irrigation with WinSRFR software
    The sensitivity of the furrow irrigation to WinSRFR software input parameters,
    including cutoff time, the Kostiakov-Lewis infiltration equation coefficients,
    Manning''s roughness coefficient, slope, and inflow rate, was analyzed in this
    study. The effects of the abovementioned input parameters were investigated on
    the output parameters including water application efficiency, runoff, deep percolation,
    distribution uniformity, irrigation adequacy, and advance time. The sensitivity
    of a specific input parameter was analyzed based on changing the value of that
    parameter (while keeping other input parameters constant) and investigating the
    change in the output parameters. In the sensitivity analysis of each input parameter,
    the value of that parameter change was considered equal to ± 50 % and ± 25 %,
    followed by running the model. The model outputs in the initial state without
    changing the values of each parameter were assumed to be the base output. The
    sensitivity of each input parameter was expressed using the equation proposed
    by Liu et al. (2007): (8) ̅ ̅ where SC is the sensitivity coefficient of a specific
    input parameter on a specific output parameter, △O is a given output parameter
    change before and after the change, ̅ is the arithmetic mean of the output parameter,
    △I is the difference of the input parameter before and after the change, and Ī
    is the arithmetic mean of the input parameter. SC values of 0, 0–0.3, 0.3–1.5,
    and > 1.5 indicate insensitivity, low sensitivity, medium sensitivity, and high
    sensitivity, respectively. 2.6.3. Irrigation performance indicators The performance
    evaluation of different furrow irrigation methods was done using the different
    performance indicators, including Application Efficiency (AE), Runoff (RO), deep
    percolation (DP), minimum uniformity distribution (DUmin), low-quarter distribution
    uniformity ( ), Minimum irrigation adequacy (ADmin), low-quarter irrigation adequacy
    (ADlq), minimum potential application efficiency (PAEmin), and low-quarter minimum
    potential application efficiency (PAElq) (Bautista et al., 2009). The iso-performance
    curves of the WinSRFR software were used to optimize inflow rate (q) and cutoff
    time ( ) (Bautista and Schlegel, 2019). The iso-performance curves created by
    the software operation analysis are water application efficiency (AE), minimum
    distribution uniformity (DUmin), runoff (RO), applied depth (Dapp), and deep percolation
    (DP). In general, a combination of q and is optimal when it maximizes the application
    efficiency and distribution uniformity. In this situation, an option is to assume
    the maximization conditions of the total application efficiency and distribution
    uniformity as the “optimal” design on the Dreq = Dmin line. Another option is
    to consider a minimum value for distribution uniformity, and this assumption will
    extract a combination of q and that will maximize the application efficiency.
    In this research, the iso-performance curves of application efficiency and distribution
    uniformity were investigated by considering the DUmin of field trials and the
    minimum infiltration depth as the required depth (Dmin = Dreq). 3. Results and
    discussion 3.1. Parameters of the infiltration equation Table 3 presents the values
    of the Kostiakov-Lewis infiltration equation coefficients and the Manning''s roughness
    coefficient for all irrigation methods at different times of the growing season.
    In the third, sixth and ninth irrigations, the basic infiltration value in Surge
    and alternate methods is higher than the conventional method. Also, by increasing
    the value of the parameter k, the value of the parameter a decreased. In different
    irrigation methods, the same trend was observed for the values of the parameter
    a in all experiments during the growing season, and the maximum and minimum values
    did not differ substantially. The trend of changes in the parameter k was different
    in all irrigation methods during the season, and the maximum and minimum values
    also had large difference. The range of the parameters a, k and f0 are 0.231–0.487,
    2.648–11.925 mm and 3.33–7.69 mm hr−1, respectively, showing that k had greater
    changes than the other parameters. Table 3. Coefficients of the Kostiakov-Lewis

    roughness coefficient As reported by Fu et al. (2019), the Kostiakov-Lewis infiltration
    equation can accurately determine the cumulative infiltration under different
    conditions, however, it is difficult to calculate its coefficients due to changes
    in boundary conditions (Dialameh et al., 2017). In the current research, changes
    in the inflow discharge influenced the coefficients of the Kostiakov-Lewis infiltration
    equation and the infiltration rate increased by increasing inflow discharge. The
    effect of inflow rate on infiltration was also reported be several researchers
    (Rodríguez, 2003, Playán et al., 2004, Ebrahimian et al., 2020, Ebrahimian and
    Playán, 2014). 3.2. Manning''s roughness coefficient An increase in inflow rate
    increases the water advance speed in the furrow and reduces the water advance
    time and Manning''s roughness coefficient (n). mean values of Manning''s roughness
    coefficient were 0.038, 0.024, and 0.029 in the third, sixth, and ninth irrigation
    events, respectively. For each irrigation event, the lowest value of Manning''s
    roughness coefficient belongs to the alternate and surge irrigation methods. Increasing
    the inflow rate from 0.28 (the third irrigation) to 0.35 (the ninth irrigation)
    and 0.42 L/s (the sixth irrigation) reduced Manning''s roughness coefficient (n)
    by 20 % and 33.4 %, respectively. The higher the discharge, the higher the flow
    depth, and the lower the value of Manning n. Similar results were reported by
    Xu et al. (2019). According to the studies of Mailapali et al. (2008) and Kamali
    et al. (2018), the Manning''s roughness coefficient in bare and vegetated furrows
    has an inverse relationship with inflow discharge. On the other side, the Manning
    equation (Eq. 3) demonstrates that there is an inverse relationship between the
    inflow rate and the Manning''s roughness coefficient, which is consistent with
    the results of the present study. However, the effect of successive irrigation
    on the smoothness of the furrow soil surface is another reason of decreasing the
    value of the Manning n during the growing season. The number of successive irrigations
    typically reduces the value of the Manning n. 3.3. Parameterization of the model
    for irrigation events The observed and estimated values of runoff, infiltration,
    and advance time are presented in Table 4. The software simulated runoff, infiltration,
    and advance time with a high correlation (R2 of 1, 0.9445, and 0.9708, respectively)
    (Fig. 3). The RE values were 5.60 %, 5.09 %, and 2.14 % in estimating runoff,
    infiltration, and advance time, respectively (Table 5). Previous studies (Bautista
    et al., 2012, Gillies et al., 2010, Anwar et al., 2016) indicated that the WinSRFR
    software could predict the advance time and runoff of furrow irrigation systems
    with acceptable accuracy, which is consistent with the results of this research.
    In our particular experiments, the software overestimates the runoff (λ = 1.056)
    and the advance time (λ = 1.0214), but it underestimates infiltration (λ = 0.9491).
    The value of λ close to 1 and RE close to zero indicate a good performance of
    the software. The highest accuracy in estimating runoff belong to the AFI, SFI1–1,
    SFI1–2, FFI, and CFI methods, respectively (Table 5). The highest accuracies in
    infiltration estimation are related to the AFI, FFI, SFI1–2, SFI1–1 and CFI methods,
    respectively (Table 5). Therefore, the best and poorest estimates of runoff and
    infiltration are related to the AFI and CFI methods, respectively. The highest
    model accuracy in estimating advance time was obtained for SFI1–1, SFI1–2, CFI,
    FFI, and AFI methods irrigation, respectively (Table 5). Hence, SFI1–1 and AFI
    methods represent the best and weakest model estimates for the advance time. The
    mean value of RMSE in estimating advance time was 4.6, 4.6, 4.7, 6.3, and 5.8 min
    for the CFI, SFI1–1, SFI1–2, FFI, and AFI methods, respectively (Table 6). Accordingly,
    the software simulated the advance times of the surge irrigation methods with
    higher accuracy than those of the alternate methods. Chen et al. (2012), Sayari
    et al. (2017) and Xu et al. (2019) also reported that the WinSRFR software had
    good accuracy and small error in simulating advance times. Table 4. Measured and

    software The results of the sensitivity analysis are presented in Table (7). The
    highest sensitivity effects on the application efficiency (AE) belong to inflow
    rate (0.98) and the cutoff time (0.61). The lowest effect on AE was obtained for
    the furrow slope with a sensitivity coefficient of 0.001. The Manning''s roughness
    coefficient had no effect on AE. The results showed that among the parameters
    of the Kostiakov-Lewis infiltration equation, the highest sensitivity is related
    to the final infiltration rate. The highest effect of the final infiltration rate
    is on the deep percolation and minimum irrigation adequacy with a sensitivity
    coefficient of 0.67. Based on the sensitivity analysis of the Manning''s roughness
    coefficient, this coefficient has a negligible effect on the other output parameters,
    except for the advance time. The results of the sensitivity analysis in this study
    are consistent with previous similar studies- (Zerihun et al., 1996, Ebrahimian
    et al., 2020). Table 7. Sensitivity coefficient of some input parameters of the

    Table 8 presents the furrow irrigation performance indicators. The average performance
    indices of the five furrow irrigation methods were compared between three irrigation
    events. The results revealed that the minimum and maximum values of and were obtained
    in CFI (62.0 %, 60.3 %, and 61.9 %, respectively) and AFI (78.7 %, 69.5 %, and
    74.1 %, respectively), respectively. The average values of runoff and deep percolation
    losses were 35.7 % and 2.3 % in CFI, respectively. These values were 19.5 % and
    1.8 % in AFI, respectively. The lowest and highest values of belonged to AFI (92.5
    %) and CFI (96.9 %), respectively. In the AFI method, the high AE and the low
    difference between and are due to the proper management and the appropriate use
    of the irrigation system. The high difference (35.0 %) of these two parameters
    in CFI indicates poor irrigation management and caused large water losses in the
    field. In addition to AE and DU, irrigation adequacy is also important in the
    design and assessment of irrigation systems. Table 8. Performance evaluation indicators

    The values of AE, RO, DP, were 64.9 %, 33.7 %, 1.4 %, 61.8 %, and 63.6 % for SFI1–1
    and 64.2 %, 34.2 %, 1.6 %, 61.1 %, and 62.7 % for SFI1–2, respectively. After
    the AFI method, SFI1–1 and SFI1–2 had better performance. The values of were 97.8
    %, 94.6 % and 94.9 % in the CFI, SFI1-1, and SFI1–2 methods, respectively, indicating
    that deficit irrigation did not occur in these irrigation methods because of the
    high consumed water (more than the requirement level). In the FFI and AFI methods,
    however, the mean values of were 92.3 % and 86.6 %, respectively, suggesting the
    occurrence of deficit irrigation in the alternate methods. Under water shortage
    conditions, deficit irrigation increases both the area under cultivation and water
    productivity, leading to water savings. The highest (98.6 %) and the least (92.7
    %) values were observed in the CFI and AFI methods. Some studies (Smith et al.,
    2005, Lalehzari et al., 2015, Kifle et al., 2017, Salahou et al., 2018, Nie et
    al., 2019) reported that increasing the flow cutoff time increased irrigation
    losses, particularly runoff, and reduced AE by exceeding the required irrigation
    depth. In this study, AE showed a descending trend in the third, ninth, and sixth
    assessment times in the different irrigation methods due to increasing the inflow
    rate and cutoff times. Rising trends were also observed in distribution uniformity
    and irrigation adequacy. The present study revealed that AFI and CFI were the
    best and worst furrow irrigation methods, respectively. The low values of the
    performance indices, particularly AE, in the CFI method were caused by the difference
    between the values of and , suggesting poor irrigation management. Thus, proper
    measures such as proper determination of irrigation depth and, inflow rate, cutoff
    time, furrow length time based on the field specifications as well as training
    farmers and irrigators are among the strategies for improving the AE level. Consequently,
    performance evaluation of irrigation systems, awareness of the status quo, and
    providing applicable solutions in the field will help provide more uniform and
    effective use of water in the field. 3.6. Analysis of furrow irrigation performance
    To increase AE and DU and reduce DP and runoff losses, furrow irrigation performance
    indicators (AE and DU) under the experimental field conditions were compared with
    the values optimized with the iso-performance curves of the WinSRFR software (Table
    9). AE values under the field conditions were between 62.0 % (CFI) and 78.7 %
    (AFI). Assuming the minimum uniformity of distribution in the current conditions
    (field experiments) is maintained between 86.5 % (AFI) and 94.5 % (CFI) and by
    combining the contour map of application efficiency and distribution uniformity,
    the optimal application efficiency of different irrigation treatments was varied
    between 66.6 % (CFI) and 80.7 % (AFI). AE could not be increased more than this
    value (80.7 %) regarding the field properties such as furrow geometry and soil
    characteristics. The greatest improvement in application efficiency was observed
    in CFI, SFI1–1 and SFI1–2 by 8.2 %, 8.1 % and 8 % respectively. Table 9. Comparison

    = minimum uniformity distribution In the current research, the iso-performance
    curves of the irrigation system were employed as a new and effective management
    tool to improve the irrigation system performance. In studies on optimizing inflow
    rate and cutoff time (Khatri et al., 2007; Morris et al., 2015; Anwar et al.,
    2016; Akbar et al., 2016; Nie et al., 2019), it was concluded that the management
    of inflow rate and cutoff time could improve furrow irrigation performance, which
    is in agreement with our results. 4. Conclusion The present study examined and
    analyzed sensitivity of furrow irrigation to WinSRFR software input parameters
    and performance of different furrow irrigation methods. We also evaluated the
    parametrization of the WinSRFR software to improve the performance of different
    furrow irrigation systems in the southwest Iran. Sensitivity analysis revealed
    that furrow irrigation was the most sensitive to inflow rate, cutoff time, and
    the Kostiakov-Lewis infiltration equation parameters. To achieve reliable results,
    therefore, these parameters should be measured with acceptable accuracy. The highest
    effect of Manning''s roughness coefficient was obtained on the flow advance time.
    By conducting the field experiments and software parameterization, software could
    simulate runoff, infiltration, and advance time with good accuracy at relative
    errors of 5.60 %, 5.09 %, and 2.14 %, respectively. In estimating runoff and infiltration,
    the best and poorest performance of the software were observed for the AFI and
    CFI methods, respectively. The software estimated the advance time with the highest
    and lowest accuracies in the SFI1–1 and AFI methods, respectively. The performance
    of different surge and alternate furrow irrigation methods is evaluated using
    the WinSRFR software. According to the results, the best and poorest performance
    corresponded to the variable alternate irrigation and conventional furrow irrigation
    methods, respectively, hence AFI is recommended in the studied area. After the
    AFI method, the SFI1–1 and SFI1–2 methods had better performance than the CFI
    and FFI methods. Changing the inflow rate from 0.35 to 0.34 L/s and the cutoff
    time from 300 to 304 min increased the application efficiency from 62.0 % to 66.6
    % in CFI. Also, changing the inflow rate from 0.35 to 0.34 L/s and the cutoff
    time from 300 to 320 min in SFI1–1 increased the application efficiency from 64.9
    % to 69.7 %. Thus, furrow irrigation performance was improved by managing the
    cutoff time and the inflow rate. In this study, WinSRFR software was well established
    and parameterized which led to sufficient agreement between the field observations
    and the model outputs for furrow irrigation. This software improved the performance
    of the different furrow irrigation methods (conventional, surge and alternate)
    in the study area. Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that

    Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is crucial for improving crop water-use
    efficiency and facilitating precision irrigation. The Penman–Monteith (P-M) model
    is a widely used approach for ET calculation, with canopy resistance (rc) acting
    as a critical determinant of accuracy that is greatly affected by meteorological,
    crop, and soil factors. This study focused on the calibration of two rc models:
    Jarvis (JA) and coupled resistance (CO), utilizing ant colony optimization (ACO)
    and the least square method (LSM). Data from an eddy covariance system and a meteorological
    station in the Huailai summer maize field (115°47’E, 40°20’N) for the year 2013
    were employed for model parameterization. Performance evaluation of these models
    was conducted using ET measurements obtained through the eddy covariance system
    in 2014. Path analysis was conducted to elucidate the impact of net radiation
    (Rn), temperature (T), vapor pressure deficit (VPD), soil water content (θ) and
    leaf area index (LAI) on rc. Results revealed a decrease in rc during growing
    season, with influencing factors ordered as Rn, LAI, VPD, T, and θ. The CO model
    optimized by ACO exhibited superior accuracy, with R2 of 0.89. Integration of
    the ACO-optimized the CO model into P-M model for ET estimation also demonstrated
    the highest accuracy with R2 of 0.72. JA model optimized by ACO provided satisfactory
    results in both parameters calibration and ET estimation. Therefore, the ACO-optimized
    CO model was recommended as the optimal approach for rc calculation of summer
    maize in semi-arid area. Additionally, the JA model optimized by ACO was proposed
    as a credible alternative to the CO model. These findings contribute to the refinement
    of ET estimation methodologies, offering valuable insights for precision agricultural

    (ET) refers to soil evaporation and plant transpiration and is an essential parameter
    for water-carbon exchange of the soil–plant–atmosphere continuum (Li et al. 2016).
    In agricultural production, ET directly affects the crop water demand. Therefore,
    the accurate estimation of ET can provide a scientific basis for crop water-deficit
    study and irrigation scheme optimization (Liu et al. 2020; Nyolei et al. 2021;
    Yan et al. 2018). Many approaches have been developed to measure and estimate
    ET based on observations, theoretical and numerical analysis (Bao et al. 2022;
    Srivastava et al. 2018). Compared to measurement methods, estimation models have
    become a mainstream approach for determining ET due to their cost-effectiveness
    (Chen et al. 2022; Wu et al. 2022). ET can be measured by means of Bowen ratio
    energy balance (BREB) systems (Inman-Bamber and McGlinchey 2003; Yan et al. 2019;
    Zhang et al. 2008), micro-Bowen ratio (MBR) systems (Holland et al. 2013), weighing
    lysimeters (Liu et al. 2002; Moorhead et al. 2017; Yang et al. 2000), eddy covariance
    systems(Anapalli et al. 2021; Cabral et al. 2012; Rana et al. 2021; Wilson et
    al. 2001) and surface renewal systems (Bastidas-Obando et al. 2017) or other systems.
    Mechanistic approaches can obtain accurate results, but the measuring process
    is sometimes costly and time-consuming. Although these methods are inappropriate
    for routine measurements, they are used to evaluate indirect ET estimates. Therefore,
    numerous models have been developed for estimating ET based on local meteorological
    data, such as (1) the single-layered Penman–Monteith (P-M) model, which was proposed
    based on the theory of energy conservation and air diffusion and considered plant
    canopy and soil as a “big leaf” (Li et al. 2013; Monteith 1965); (2) the dual-layered
    Shuttleworth–Wallace (S‒W) model, which divided ET into soil evaporation and crop
    transpiration and performed well in arid and semi-arid regions where soil evaporation
    cannot be ignored (Iritz et al. 1999; Li et al. 2015; Ortega-Farias et al. 2010;
    Shuttleworth and Gurney 1990; Shuttleworth and Wallace 1985; Zhou et al. 2006);
    and (3) the multiple-layered Clumping (C) model, in which soil evaporation was
    subdivided into bare soil evaporation and soil evaporation under vegetation cover
    (Brenner and Incoll 1997; Ortega-Farias et al. 2010). In terms of model structure,
    the multiple-layered models are more detailed and refined and can simulate the
    process of evapotranspiration more objectively. However, a larger number of parameters
    in multiple-layered models has made the fitting process of parameters more prone
    to over-fitting. The difficulty of obtaining parameters with appreciable accuracy
    limits the application of multiple-layered models. Additionally, the calculation
    of multiple-layered models is more complicated. A large amount of data is required
    to be input, which may accumulate measurement errors and thus reduce the calculation
    accuracy. Therefore, multiple-layered models may not be as practical and accurate
    as single-layered models. Among single-layered models, the P-M model is the most
    widely used. It schematizes the vegetation as a single “big leaf” at a certain
    height within the vegetation (Li et al. 2016; Zheng et al. 2021). The physical
    basis makes it able to reflect the evapotranspiration process and the affecting
    factors. The P-M model is considered one of the most reliable models to evaluate
    ET and has been applied in many studies (Allen et al. 1998; Lhomme et al. 1998;
    Villalobos et al. 2013). In the P-M model, canopy resistance (rc) is the critical
    factor significantly influencing the model accuracy. The rc describes the resistance
    of water vapour through leaf stomata and soil, which is greatly influenced by
    numerous environmental factors, such as solar radiation, relative humidity, and
    air temperature, and physiological factors, such as leaf area index. The relationship
    between rc and each factor is usually non-linear and complex. Thus, there is no
    fixed rc value for the same crop at different growth stages or under various weather
    conditions. Since the value of rc is difficult to measure physically, to provide
    a reliable rc value for ET estimation, many models have been developed to calculate
    rc. Jarvis (1976) proposed the Jarvis (JA) model to calculate rc, which involved
    many environmental variables (e.g., net radiation, air temperature, vapour pressure
    deficit, and soil moisture content) as independent stress functions. The P-M model
    combined with the JA model has been widely used in different vegetation covers
    and has ultimately provided accurate results to estimate ET (Ali et al. 2016;
    Gentine et al. 2007; Harris et al. 2004; Hoshika et al. 2017; Medlyn et al. 2012;
    Yu et al. 2004; Zhang et al. 2016). In addition, the forms of stress functions
    in the JA model vary. Thus, better JA model performance can be obtained if different
    stress functions are chosen and well-calibrated based on crop features and environmental
    conditions (Chen et al. 2020). Researchers have developed many ways to improve
    the accuracy of the JA model. Li et al. (2016) applied a segmented JA model by
    multiplying the effective leaf area index at different growth stages, which effectively
    improved the accuracy of ET estimation by the P-M model over the whole growing
    season of summer maize in semi-arid regions. Zhou et al. (2019) considered the
    impact of nitrogen fertilization on canopy resistance and developed the N-Jarvis
    model, which was highly applicable under different soil water and mineral nitrogen
    conditions. On the basis of the JA model and soil resistance model, Li et al.
    (2013) developed a coupled resistance (CO) model to improve the accuracy of the
    P-M model under sparse vegetation. In the CO model, the canopy resistance was
    considered as the mean resistance overcome by water vapour when passing through
    the canopy and soil, which was built based on the resistance law of fluid transmission.
    The CO model performed well in the case of sparse vegetation cover. Li et al.
    (2015) compared eleven canopy resistance models (e.g., CO model, JA, Katerji and
    Perrier, and so on) in estimating summer maize and vineyard evapotranspiration
    over the entire growing season in arid regions, reporting that the CO model combined
    with the P-M model performed the best during either partial or dense canopy stages
    and was recommended to estimate crop ET in arid regions. However, six parameters
    in the CO model need to be calibrated before application, which may cause error
    in practice. Thus, precise parameter calibration is crucial for the CO model as
    well as the JA model. Summer maize is one of the major crops in northern China
    (Wu et al. 2022), and it can grow in different climatic zones and under various
    soil conditions but is sensitive to water stress (Panda et al. 2004; Srivastava
    et al. 2018). Compared to southern China, northern China often experiences more
    severe water shortages. Water shortages will seriously affect crop yield and quality
    if appropriate water-use guidelines are not applied (Chen et al. 2022; Jiang et
    al. 2016; Wang et al. 2018; Wei et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2022; Zhang et al. 2011;
    Zhao et al. 2010). Therefore, it is necessary to study the water requirements
    of summer maize. There have been numerous studies about the water requirements
    and ET of maize. DeJonge et al. (2012) modified the CERES-Maize model to improve
    ET simulation under limited irrigation management while maintaining the accuracy
    of other important model output responses. Kimball et al. (2019) conducted an
    8-year-long experiment to observe the daily ET of maize and compared the efficiency
    of 29 models in predicting ET. Shankar et al. (2012) modified crop coefficients
    of maize and Indian mustard to calculate daily ET and improve irrigation schedules.
    Most studies have focused on estimating daily ET and comparing and improving different
    ET models. However, studies on improving the accuracy of ET models by modifying
    rc in the P-M model are still scarce. Therefore, the present study chose the Huailai
    summer maize experimental station in northern China as the study area. We analyzed
    the variation of canopy resistance (rc) measured by the EC system and meteorological,
    crop, and soil factors and how different factors impacted rc during the maize
    growing seasons in 2013 and 2014. The objectives of the study were as follows:
    determine the parameters in the JA and CO models by utilizing ant colony optimization
    (ACO) and the least square method (LSM) based on the flux and meteorological data,
    and 2) combine the calibrated rc models with the P-M model to estimate ET, and
    validate the accuracy of ET using ETEC measured by the eddy covariance system
    (EC) as a benchmark to select the best rc model for summer maize ET calculation.
    The results could provide a theoretical and practical basis for the in-depth understanding
    of the crop ET process and improving irrigation water-use efficiency for summer
    maize in semi-arid regions. Materials and methods Site description The Huailai
    Remote Sensing Experimental Station of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, along
    with its summer maize field, is located in Huailai County, Hebei Province, China
    (115°47ʹE, 40°20ʹN, altitude 480 m), as illustrated in Fig. 1a. The station is
    in the temperate continental climatic zone, where the annual average temperature
    is 10.1℃, the maximum temperature in summer is 39℃, the minimum temperature in
    winter is lower than − 20℃, the average yearly precipitation is 370 mm, and the
    annual average wind speed is 3.4 m s−1. The soils of the experimental site are
    dominated by sandy clay loam, and the main properties of the soils are listed
    below: Bulk weight (1600 kg m−3), Porosity (0.404), Saturated soil water potential
    (0.135 m) and Saturated soil hydraulic conductivity (384.5 mm d−1). Summer maize
    (Zea mays L. cultivar Zhengdan 958) is sown in early May and harvested in mid
    to late September. In 2013, for example, maize was planted on May 10 and harvested
    on September 15. Since the precipitation during the growing season cannot meet
    the need of summer maize ET (Yang et al. 2015), so accurate calculation of summer
    maize ET has guiding significance for precision irrigation management. Fig. 1

    land cover in Hebei Province, and b the observation points of soil moisture in
    EC source areas Full size image Data collection The meteorological and EC data
    in 2013 and 2014 was provided by the National Tibetan Plateau Scientific Data
    Center (http://data.tpdc.ac.cn/zh-hans/), including net radiation (Rn), soil heat
    flux (G), sensible heat flux (H), latent heat flux (LE), wind speed (W), precipitation
    (P), soil moisture content (θ), air humidity (RH) and air temperature (T). The
    experimental area has a range of approximately 2 km × 1 km, which can be divided
    into irrigated and nonirrigated farmland, and the irrigated area accounts for
    more than half of the proportion (Guo et al. 2020). The surface flux of irrigated
    summer maize was measured by the EC system on a 10‐m tower (Gill & Li 7500, Li
    Cor., USA). The EC system was installed at a height of 5 m in the maize field
    (Table 1), and the 90% contribution source areas of EC were irrigated farmland,
    as illustrated in Fig. 1b. Original data were collected at 10 Hz and processed
    by EddyPro software (Table 1). The main processing steps included eliminating
    outliners, delaying time correction, coordination rotation, sonic virtual temperature
    correction, frequency response correction, and density fluctuation correction
    (WPL correction), among other steps. Flux data were output every 30 min after
    quality control, which followed the steps: (1) exclude data collected when equipment
    malfunctioned, (2) exclude data within 1 h before and after precipitation, (3)
    exclude raw data with > 10% missing values over 30 min at 10 Hz, and (4) exclude
    data collected at night when friction velocity was smaller than 0.1 m s−1. During
    the growing season, missing data sometimes occur due to poor weather conditions,
    equipment maintenance, or malfunction. Mean diurnal variations (MDVs) were applied
    to fill gaps (Falge et al. 2001). Table 1 Measured parameter and corresponding
    measurement instruments in the automatic weather stations Full size table The
    soil heat flux plates were buried at depths of 0.06 m, where one was buried in
    a maize field (G1) and the other two were buried in the soil surface (G2 and G3).
    The surface soil heat flux (G0) was calculated using the “PlateCal” approach based
    on the combination of weighted vegetation fraction, soil temperature, and moisture
    measured above the heat plates, which were reported in detail in Guo et al. (2020)
    In EC systems, it is necessary to eliminate the influence of energy imbalance.
    According to the first law of thermodynamics, the surface energy balance equation
    is as follows: $${R}_{n}-G=LE+H,$$ (1) where Rn is the net radiation, W m−2; G
    is the soil heat flux, W m−2; LE is the latent heat flux, W m−2; and H is the
    sensible heat flux, W m−2. When the left and right sides of Eq. (1) are equal,
    surface energy balance is attained; conversely, balance is not attained. In the
    study, although the energy closure between the daily scale (LE + H) and (Rn-G)
    in 2013 was 0.82, and in 2014 was 0.81, the water vapor and heat fluxes were underestimated
    (Fig. 2). The energy forced closure method is considered as a reliable method
    to improve the quality of flux data in EC system (Chávez et al. 2009; Twine et
    al. 2000), so the sensible and latent heat fluxes were corrected for closure on
    a daily basis using the Bowen ratio closure method as follows. Fig. 2 Energy balance
    closure in eddy covariance measurement at the Huailai experimental site during
    the growing season of the year 2013 and 2014 Full size image The Bowen energy
    balance ratio is usually applied to balance the equation (Bowen 1926; Chávez et
    al. 2009; Wilson et al. 2001): $$D={R}_{n}-G-LE-H$$ (2) $$\\beta =H/LE$$ (3) $$\\Delta
    LE=D/(1+\\beta )$$ (4) $$\\Delta H=D-\\Delta LE,$$ (5) where D is the imbalance
    difference, W m−2; β is the Bowen ratio; and ΔLE and ΔH are the correction values
    of LE and H, respectively, W m−2. Revision of LE and H can be obtained when ΔLE
    and ΔH are added. An automatic weather station was also installed on the 10-m
    tower to measure temperature (T), relative humidity (RH), wind speed (W) and direction,
    and precipitation (P), among other parameters. The measured parameters and their
    corresponding measurement instruments in the automatic weather station are presented
    in Table 1. The meteorological data from the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center
    (http://data.tpdc.ac.cn) were collected at a frequency of 30 s and output every
    10 min (Liu and Xu, 2013; Liu and Xu, 2014). The average value of daily meteorological
    data during the growing season of summer maize was applied to the subsequent calculations.
    In addition, LAI was observed by manual measurement in the early stage of maize
    growth, and in the later stage LAI was observed by LAI2000 (Yang et al. 2015).
    The diurnal variation of LAI during the growing season is shown in Fig. 3. Fig.

    remote sensing experimental station during 2013–2014 Full size image Models Penman–Monteith
    model The Penman–Monteith (P-M) model was applied to estimate the ET of summer
    maize based on meteorological data and crop physiological factors (Monteith 1965),
    as follows: $$\\lambda ET=\\frac{\\Delta \\left({R}_{n}-G\\right)+\\left(\\rho
    {{\\text{C}}}_{p}VPD/{r}_{a}\\right)}{\\Delta +\\gamma \\left(1+\\frac{{r}_{c}}{{r}_{a}}\\right)},$$
    (6) where λ is the latent heat vaporization, MJ kg−1; ET is the evapotranspiration
    of summer maize, mm d−1; Δ is the slope of the saturation pressure versus temperature
    function, kPa °C−1; Rn is the net radiation, W m−2; G is the soil heat flux, W
    m−2; ρ is the air mass density, kg m−3; Cp is the air specific heat at the constant
    air pressure, J kg−1 °C−1; VPD is the saturated water vapour pressure deficit,
    kPa; γ is the hygrometer constant, kPa °C−1; ra is the aerodynamic resistance,
    s m−1; rc is the canopy resistance, s m−1. The ra can be calculated as follows
    (Thom 1972): $${r}_{a}=\\frac{{\\text{ln}}\\left(\\frac{{z}_{m}-d}{{z}_{om}}\\right){\\text{ln}}\\left(\\frac{{z}_{h}-d}{{z}_{oh}}\\right)}{{K}^{2}{u}_{z}}$$
    (7) $$d=\\frac{2}{3}{h}_{c}$$ (8) $${z}_{om}=0.123{h}_{c}$$ (9) $${z}_{oh}=0.1{z}_{om},$$
    (10) where zm is the height to measure wind speed, m; zh is the height to measure
    humidity, m; d is the zero-plane displacement height, m; hc is the mean crop height,
    m; zom is the roughness length governing momentum transfer, m; zoh is the roughness
    length governing water vapour and heat flux transfer, m; K is the von Karman constant,
    0.41; and uz is the wind speed at reference height, m s−1. Canopy resistance obtained
    by the rearranged Penman–Monteith model Based on the rearranged P-M model, the
    rc calculated by meteorological data and ET collected by automatic weather stations
    and EC systems was named \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\). The present study obtained \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\)
    in 2013 by the rearranged P-M model, which was considered the measured canopy
    resistance to optimize parameters in the JA and CO models. Data from 2014 were
    used for validation. The rearranged P-M model can be expressed as follows: $${r}_{c}^{PM}=\\frac{\\Delta
    \\left({R}_{n}-G\\right)+\\rho {C}_{p}VPD/{r}_{a}-(\\Delta +\\gamma )\\lambda
    E{T}_{EC}}{\\gamma \\lambda E{T}_{EC}/{r}_{a}},$$ (11) where \\(\\lambda E{T}_{EC}\\)
    is the latent heat flux measured by the EC system, W m−2. The definitions of the
    other variables are the same as those in Eq. (1). Jarvis model The Jarvis (JA)
    model, which takes the influence of radiation, humidity, temperature and soil
    water content on rc into consideration, is stated as follows: $${r}_{c}^{JA}=\\frac{{r}_{cmin}}{LAI{f}_{1}{f}_{2}{f}_{3}{f}_{4}},$$
    (12) where \\({r}_{c}^{JA}\\) is the canopy resistance calculated by the JA model,
    s m−1; \\({r}_{cmin}\\) is the minimum stomatal resistance observed in optimal
    condition, i.e., none of the controlling variables are limiting,, s m−1; LAI is
    the leaf area index, m2 m−2; and f1, f2, f3 and f4 are the stress functions related
    to net radiation (Rn), soil water content (θ), saturated water vapour pressure
    (VPD) and temperature (T), respectively. The stress function f1 related to Rn
    can be expressed as (Li et al. 2015): $${f}_{1}=\\frac{{R}_{n}\\left(1000+{a}_{1}\\right)}{1000\\left({R}_{n}+{a}_{1}\\right)},$$
    (13) where a1 is an empirical parameter that can be obtained by the least square
    method (LSM) and ant colony optimization (ACO). In the present study, the original
    value of a1 is 100 (Lhomme et al. 1998). The stress function f2 is related to
    VPD, which reflects the impact of humidity on rc. The equation of f2 is as follows
    (Li et al. 2015): $${f}_{2}=1-{a}_{2}VPD,$$ (14) where a2 is an empirical parameter
    and can be parameterized by the LSM and ACO. In the present study, the original
    value of a2 was − 0.12 (Jarvis 1976). f3 is the function related to temperature
    (Ortega–Farias et al. 2010): $${f}_{3}=1-{a}_{3}(T-25{)}^{2},$$ (15) where a3
    is an empirical parameter, the original value is 0.0016 (Lhomme et al. 1998).
    In f3, 25 ℃ is the optimal temperature for maize growth (Li et al. 2016). The
    stress function f4 is related to soil water content and is expressed as follows
    (Li et al. 2015): $${f}_{4}=\\frac{\\theta -{\\theta }_{W}}{{\\theta }_{F}-{\\theta
    }_{W}},$$ (16) where θF is the field water capacity (32.6%), and θW is the wilting
    soil water content (11.8%). Coupled resistance model The coupled resistance (CO)
    model considers the resistance from the canopy and soil simultaneously. The value
    of rc calculated by the CO model is the mean value of resistance overcome by water
    vapour when passing through the canopy and soil. The CO model is built on the
    basis of the resistance law of fluid transmission and is expressed as follows
    (Li et al. 2013, 2015): $${r}_{c}^{CO}=\\frac{1}{\\left({b}_{1}LAI+{b}_{2}\\right)\\frac{1}{{r}_{c}^{JA}}+{b}_{3}\\frac{1}{{r}_{c}^{S}}}$$
    (17) $${r}_{c}^{S}=\\frac{1}{{b}_{4}+{\\text{exp}}\\left({b}_{5}+{b}_{6}{f}_{4}\\right)},$$
    (18) where \\({r}_{c}^{CO}\\) is the canopy resistance calculated by the CO model,
    s m−1; \\({r}_{c}^{S}\\) is the soil resistance, s m−1; and b1, b2, b3, b4, b5
    and b6 are the empirical parameters. Data analysis The present study used Microsoft
    Excel 2016 to calculate rc and ET. SPSS Statistics was used to conduct path analysis
    between rc and affecting factors. MATLAB 2019b was used to calibrate the JA and
    CO models and evaluate the statistical performance of the calibrated models. Path
    analysis Path analysis is an extension of regression analysis and is often used
    in multi-variable models. It estimates the magnitude and strength of effects within
    a hypothesized causal system to fit the data. Path analysis can not only show
    the relationship between independent variables and dependent variables but can
    also explicitly show the interaction between independent variables and how they
    affect dependent variables by affecting each other (Kempf–Leonard 2004). To determine
    the extent of the influence of different affecting factors (net radiation Rn,
    temperature T, vapour pressure deficit VPD, soil water content θ and leaf area
    index LAI) on rc and their interrelationships, the present study conducted a path
    analysis based on the collected data. Least square method The least square method
    (LSM) is an approach to performance curve fitting that has been widely used for
    processing large volumes of data and error analysis. The goal of LSM is to model
    a fitting function φ(x) that has the minimal value of the quadratic sum of deviations:
    $$\\sum_{i=1}^{n} {\\delta }_{i}^{2}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} {\\left[\\varphi \\left({x}_{i}\\right)-{y}_{i}\\right]}^{2}=min,$$
    (19) where φ(x) is the fitting function and δ is the difference between the function
    value (φ(xi)) and the original data (yi). Ant colony optimization Ant colony optimization
    (ACO) simulates the process in which ant species communicate by pheromone trail
    laying when searching for food. The pheromone left by an ant attracts other ants
    to perform the following behaviour, which induces positive feedback whereby more
    ants follow trails with higher pheromone concentrations. This way, the ant colony
    can select the shortest path to the food source. The main steps for solving optimization
    problems by ACO are as follows (Blum 2005): 1) Select S as the number of ants.
    2) The upper limit and lower limit of each parameter are estimated based on meteorological
    data. Every parameter value range is divided into m sections, which make a matrix.
    The initial concentration of pheromone in the matrix is a constant. 3) Ants are
    randomly placed in the matrix. A pheromone is deposited on the path while each
    ant moves on the path at random and forms a trail. Ants are inclined to follow
    the path with higher pheromone concentration left by the lead ant. 4) The pheromone
    concentration in the matrix keeps updating while ants are moving. A solution is
    developed when ants reach food sources. Better solutions are selected according
    to the number of trials. The more trials the solution receives, the better the
    solution is. 5) The above steps are repeated until most of the ants select the
    same solution or the program reaches the maximum number of iterations, which is
    the termination condition. Then, the optimal value of each parameter is output.
    Evaluation of model performance The performance of models and the accuracy of
    results are evaluated by determination coefficient (R2), root mean square error
    (RMSE), and fixed affinity index (dr): $${R}^{2}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} {\\left({E}_{Oi}-{E}_{mi}\\right)}^{2}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}
    {\\left({E}_{Oi}-{\\overline{E} }_{O}\\right)}^{2}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} {\\left({E}_{mi}-{\\overline{E}
    }_{O}\\right)}^{2}}$$ (20) $$RMSE=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^{n} {\\left({E}_{mi}-{E}_{Oi}\\right)}^{2}}$$
    (21) $$d_{r} = 1 - \\frac{{\\sum_{i = 1}^{n} \\left| {E_{Oi} - E_{mi} } \\right|}}{{\\sum_{i
    = 1}^{n} (\\left| {E_{Oi} - \\overline{E}_{O} } \\right| + \\left| {E_{mi} - \\overline{E}_{O}
    } \\right|)}},$$ (22) where Emi is the value of ET or rc calculated by calibrated
    models; EOi is the ET measured by the EC system or \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\); \\({\\overline{E}
    }_{O}\\) is the mean value of measured values; and n is the sample size. The larger
    R2 is, the smaller RMSE is, and the closer dr is to 1, the better the model is
    (Willmott et al. 2012). Results and discussion Variations of meteorological data
    The variations of net radiation (Rn), wind speed (W), temperature (T), vapour
    pressure deficit (VPD), precipitation (P), and soil water content (θ) during the
    growing seasons in 2013 and 2014 are shown in Fig. 4. Generally, Rn showed a parabolic
    trend. It increased in May, then reached a maximum and remained at a high level
    in June and July and started decreasing in August [Fig. 4a]. The maximum and minimum
    Rn in 2013 were 245.1 W m−2 and 23.1 W m−2, respectively, with an average of 144.6
    W m−2 during the growing season. The maximum and minimum Rn in 2014 were 218.9
    W m−2 and 25.0 W m−2, respectively, with an average of 139.0 W m−2 during the
    growing season. As shown in Fig. 4b, the values of W were relatively high in May
    and then showed a decreasing trend. The maxima in 2013 and 2014 were 5.28 m s−1
    and 5.97 m s−1, respectively, which were recorded on 19 May 2013 and 25 May 2014.
    W had larger fluctuations in 2014. In Fig. 4c, T generally increased before July
    and peaked in July or August. The maximum T values in 2013 and 2014 were 27.36℃
    and 28.9℃, respectively. In late August, T decreased at a faster rate than when
    it increased before July. Basically, the variation in T in the growing season
    was between 15 and 30°C and changed in a parabolic pattern, which indicated that
    the variations in T and Rn were highly connected. Figure 4d shows the decreasing
    trend of VPD during the growing season. The maximum and minimum values in 2013
    were 2.31 kPa and 0.29 kPa, respectively. In 2014, VPD fluctuated more significantly
    than in 2013, with maximum and minimum values of 3.30 kPa and 0.15 kPa, respectively.
    The value of VPD was relatively higher under a drier climate. In late May 2014,
    the increase in VPD may be attributed to higher T and W, which made the air drier
    than in 2013. Fig. 4 Variation in a net radiation (Rn), b wind speed (W), c temperature
    (T), d vapour pressure deficit (VPD), e precipitation (P) and soil water content
    (θ) during the growing seasons in 2013 and 2014 Full size image The variations
    of P and θ are depicted in Figs. 4e–f. P was distributed unevenly overtime during
    the growing season. Relatively heavy daily precipitation occurred mainly in late
    June and late July. In 2013, P peaked on July 15, with a value of 34.8 mm. The
    maximum P in 2014 occurred on August 28, with a value of 24.6 mm. The total P
    during the growing seasons in 2013 and 2014 was 374.5 mm and 293.4 mm, respectively.
    As shown in Fig. 4, the variation of θ was affected by T and P. When there was
    no precipitation, θ remained at a low level. In early June 2013 and early August
    2014, θ showed a considerable rise and remained relatively high for days after
    precipitation. This may be attributed to intense precipitation and moderate T,
    which kept the soil damp. In July, T was higher; thus, variation in θ was not
    evident. Variations of measured canopy resistance and its relationship with different
    affecting factors Figure 5 shows the variation of canopy resistance measured by
    the EC system (\\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\)) during the growing seasons in 2013 and 2014.
    \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\) reached its peak at the early growing stage, with a value close
    to 5000 s m−1, and then decreased quickly during June and was generally under
    200 s m−1 at the start of July due to the increase in Rn, T, and LAI. In late
    June, the increase in \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\) may have resulted from precipitation,
    since rainy days lowered Rn and T. After mid-July, the value of \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\)
    was at a low level without evident fluctuation, denoting that the variation in
    \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\) was not considerable at the late growing stage of summer maize.
    Fig. 5 Variations in the measured canopy resistance in 2013 and 2014 Full size
    image Canopy resistance was not a purely physiological parameter, representing
    the overall effect of the factors such as stomatal impedance of leaves at different
    levels, different parts, and aerodynamic characteristics in the canopy on the
    entire canopy evapotranspiration (Chen et al. 2022; Hoshika et al. 2017). Canopy
    resistance is mainly related to meteorological factors and their physiological
    processes (Wu et al. 2022). To further study how different factors influence \\(r_{c}^{PM}\\),
    the non-linear relationships between \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\) and different affecting
    factors (Rn, T, VPD, θ, and LAI) were presented in Fig. 6. The \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\)
    showed an increasing trend with increasing VPD and decreased with increasing Rn,
    T, θ and LAI [Figs. 6a–e]. The correlation between \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\) and VPD
    in the present study was not significant, which agreed with the conclusion of
    Li et al. (2016). Fig. 6 Relationships between the measured canopy resistance
    (r_c^PM) and different affecting factors (a net radiation Rn; b temperature T;
    c vapour pressure deficit VPD; d soil water content θ; e leaf area index LAI.)
    Full size image In Fig. 6a, the relationship between Rn and \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\)
    was basically exponential. \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\) changed greatly when the value of
    Rn was relatively small, and the variation in \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\) became small
    when Rn was over approximately 130 W m−2. From Fig. 4(a), Rn increased in May
    and remained at a high level in June and July. In the early growing stage, the
    evapotranspiration of maize mainly comes from soil evaporation. Although Rn was
    small, it still had an enormous impact on soil evaporation, which was dominant
    since the soil surface was under sparse vegetation cover. In Fig. 6b, \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\)
    decreased with increasing T at the early stage, and the rate of descent was fast
    at the beginning and then gradually slowed. When the temperature was over 25°C,
    the variation trend was steady. There was no further decline in \\({r}_{c}^{PM},\\)
    because the leaf stomata closed to prevent excessive water loss. The correlation
    between \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\) and VPD in present study [Fig. 6c] was not significant,
    which agreed with the conclusion of Li et al. (2016). Figure 6d illustrates that
    although sharing the same trend with Rn, the relationship between \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\)
    and θ was not significant since the variation in θ in the semi-arid region was
    not considerable. Figure 6e shows that \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\) dropped significantly
    when LAI started to increase. The LAI increased due to the growth of crops. The
    larger the leaf area, the more intense the crop transpiration. When LAI = 2 m2
    m−2, the maize canopy was exposed to more sunlight, the solar radiation was large
    and the temperature was high in July and August, which was conducive to crop evapotranspiration
    (Li et al. 2016; Wu et al. 2022). After LAI > 2 m3 m−3, the soil surface was under
    dense vegetation cover; thus, the effect of soil evaporation was negligible. Because
    of overlapping leaves, the value of the effective LAI did not change much. Further
    increases in LAI over 2 m3 m−3 had slight impacts on \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\) (Wu et
    al. 2022; Zheng et al. 2021). Path analysis results We applied path analysis to
    determine the extent of influence of different affecting factors (Rn, T, VPD,
    LAI) on rc and their interrelationships, and the results are shown in Table 2.
    The Pearson coefficients between rc and Rn, T, VPD, θ, and LAI were − 0.773, −
    0.510, 0.535, − 0.348, and − 0.727, respectively. All the Pearson correlations
    reached a significant level, indicating that these affecting factors were highly
    related to rc. Rn and LAI were the main factors affecting rc of summer maize in
    semi-arid were generally consistent with the conclusions of Chen et al. (2022)
    and Wu et al. (2022). Table 2 Results of path analysis between canopy resistance
    (rc) and different affecting factors different affecting factors (net radiation
    Rn, temperature T, vapor pressure deficit VPD, soil water content θ and leaf area
    index LAI) Full size table P1y (direct path coefficient between Rn and rc) was
    − 0.412, which reached a very significant statistical level. Rn was the most influential
    meteorological factor affecting rc. The study area is located in the semi-arid
    region and belongs to a temperate continental monsoon climate. Precipitation is
    mainly concentrated in the growing season, and Rn is the driving factor for ET
    (Guo et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2015). Rn had a negative effect on rc. The increase
    in Rn increased the temperature and promoted the transpiration of summer maize.
    Thus, leaf stomata opened, and stomatal resistance was reduced to ensure that
    water vapour passed through the stomata, leading to a decrease in rc. P3y (direct
    path coefficient between VPD and rc) was 0.175 and reached a significant level,
    illustrating that VPD had a positive effect on rc. Generally, VPD has a negative
    effect on rc. A higher VPD indicates drier air conditions and can promote transpiration.
    However, the experimental site is located in a semi-arid region in northern China,
    and thus the VPD value was already at a high level. Leaf stomata closed when the
    VPD was too high to prevent excessive water loss. P2y (direct path coefficient
    between T and rc) was − 0.146, and P4y (direct path coefficient between θ and
    rc) was 0.031. The effect of θ was not as significant as that of the other factors.
    This may be attributed to the fact that in the semi-arid region, the variation
    in θ was not significant enough to directly affect rc. P5y (direct path coefficient
    between LAI and rc) was − 0.363, which indicated that the more leaves grew, the
    stronger the evapotranspiration was. Among all direct path coefficients of meteorological
    factors, only VPD had a positive coefficient, which corresponded with the trend
    of each factor in Fig. 6. Based on the direct path coefficient values, the influences
    of the affecting factors followed the order Rn > LAI > VPD > T > θ, among which
    Rn, LAI, and T had significant negative effects, VPD had a positive effect, and
    the effect of θ was not significant. The values of the indirect path coefficients
    reflected the interaction between meteorological factors. The indirect path coefficients
    of Rn by T and VPD were − 0.076 and − 0.080, respectively, which indicated that
    Rn had a negative effect on rc by influencing T and VPD. The rise in Rn increased
    T and dried the air, leading to an increase in VPD. The process of evapotranspiration
    accelerated under high temperatures and dry conditions, leading to a decrease
    in rc. The increase in T also increased VPD and then decreased rc. Thus, the indirect
    path coefficient of T by VPD was − 0.01, indicating the negative effect of T on
    rc by influencing VPD. The T, VPD and θ attained relatively significant indirect
    path coefficients by affecting Rn because Rn was the most influential meteorological
    factor on rc. Rn cannot only affect rc directly but also cause a significant variance
    in rc by interacting with other meteorological factors. Calibration and validation
    of canopy resistance models Based on the meteorological and flux data from 2013,
    the parameters of the JA model and CO models were corrected by using LSM and ACO,
    respectively, and the results are shown in Table 3. The statistical performance
    indicators R2, RMSE, and dr are also presented in Table 3. Generally, the CO model
    performed better than the JA model. The CO model optimised by ACO gave the most
    accurate results, with R2 of 0.89, RMSE of 410.9 s m−1, and dr of 0.88, in which
    the calibrated values of b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, and b6 were 2.20, 0.18, 0.01, − 0.18,
    − 1.39 and − 0.45, respectively. The CO model optimized by LSM gave accurate results
    with R2 of 0.89, RMSE of 428.2 s m-1, and dr of 0.87, respectively. The JA model
    optimised by ACO also performed well, with R2 of 0.83, RMSE of 515.5 s m−1, and
    dr of 0.85, in which the calibrated values of rcmin, a1, a2, and a3 were 7.43
    s m−1, 360.80, 0.25 and − 0.003, respectively. Table 3 Results of parameter calibration
    of the Jarvis (JA) model and coupled resistance (CO) model using the least square
    method (LSM) and ant colony optimisation (ACO), respectively Full size table Figure
    7 shows the comparison of rc calculated by the optimised models and \\(r_{c}^{PM}\\)
    during the growing season in 2014. As shown in Fig. 7, the rc calculated by the
    optimised models peaked at the early growing stage and then gradually decreased
    to a low level, which was similar to the variation pattern of \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\).
    However, at the early stage, the values of rc calculated by all optimised models
    were smaller than those of \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\), especially in the JA models [Figs.
    7a, b]. The JA model only took resistance from crops into account and neglected
    the resistance overcome by water vapour passing through the soil surface. At the
    early growing stage, the crop coverage ratio was small, and resistance from soil
    accounted for a large segment (Wu et al. 2022). Thus, \\({r}_{c}^{JA}\\) was significantly
    smaller than \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\), and great error was produced when estimating
    rc at the sparse vegetation stage. CO models, which considered soil resistance,
    provided more accurate results after model optimization, so the rc calculated
    by the optimised CO model was distributed much closer to \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\) in
    Fig. 7c, d. With the growth of summer maize, the crop canopy developed gradually
    and covered the soil completely. The intensity of soil evaporation decreased significantly.
    Therefore, the resistance was mainly affected by the leaf canopy, and the resistance
    from soil had little effect on the rc estimation. Therefore, rc was very close
    to \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\) when \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\) was under 200 s m−1. The changes
    in meteorological factors also affected the optimisation results. The JA model
    produced greater error than the CO model under unstable weather conditions. For
    example, the JA model produced a larger error than the CO model during the precipitation
    period around June 21 in 2014 (Fig. 2e). Precipitation affected soil conditions
    directly. Although errors could not be eliminated completely, the CO model showed
    better conformity with \\(r_{c}^{PM}\\)(Li et al. 2013), which further improved
    the accuracy of the CO model. Fig. 7 Comparison of rc calculated by optimised
    models and r_c^PM during the growing season (a Jarvis model optimised by the least
    square method; b Jarvis model optimised by ant colony optimization; c coupled
    resistance model optimised by the least square method; d coupled resistance model
    optimised by ant colony optimization) Full size image To validate the applicability
    of corrected parameters, the P-M model combined with the calibrated JA and CO
    model were applied to estimate ET in 2014. Statistical performance between estimated
    and measured ET is presented in Table 4. From Table 4, the ET calculated by the
    CO model optimised by ACO had the most accurate result, with R2 of 0.72, RMSE
    of 1.07 mm, and dr of 0.75, which was consistent with the result of the comparison
    between rc calculated by optimised models and \\({r}_{c}^{PM}\\). The ET calculated
    by the CO model optimized by LMS had the most accurate result with R2 of 0.70,
    RMSE of 1.11 mm, and dr of 0.75. The ET calculated by the JA model optimised by
    ACO also had a better result, with R2 of 0.67, RMSE of 1.16 mm, and dr of 0.76,
    while the JA model optimised by LSM also performed well, with R2 of 0.65, RMSE
    of 1.20 mm and dr of 0.76. Therefore, the CO model optimised by ACO was highly
    recommended to estimate rc and ET. In the CO model, the surface resistance was
    treated as the mean resistance of the soil and canopy (Li et al. 2013). The division
    of surface resistance in the CO model was a reasonable hypothesis, because evapotranspiration
    consisted of soil evaporation and crop transpiration. Thus, the CO model performed
    better in the estimation of rc and ET, where the climate was dry and soil evaporation
    could not be ignored when the land was under sparse vegetation (Bao et al. 2022;
    Chen et al. 2022; Li et al. 2015). Table 4 Statistical performance of ET estimation
    by the Jarvis (JA) model and coupled resistance (CO) model using the least square
    method (LSM) and ant colony optimisation (ACO), respectively Full size table The
    JA model was characterized by a simple structure and accessible input variables
    and has achieved acceptable performance when applied to arid and semi-arid regions
    (Bao et al. 2022; Xu et al. 2018). JA model can perform well if the optimization
    method is suitable. In our study, the JA model optimised by ACO had good results
    and can be an alternative method to estimate rc and ET. It is important to note
    that whether rc or ET was estimated, the results given by ACO were more accurate
    than the results given by LSM. The accuracy of ACO may be attributed to its positive
    feedback mechanism, making it easier to find the overall optimal solution instead
    of being trapped by local optimisations (Azad et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2019). In
    contrast, LSM is more applicable to linear relationships. In the rc model and
    P-M model, rc and ET have a non-linear relationship with the affecting factors.
    Therefore, using ACO appears more reasonable than using LSM. The comparison between
    ET and ETEC is presented in Fig. 8a–c and showed that when ET was small, ETJA
    was larger than ETEC. However, in Fig. 8c, d, the differences between ETCO and
    ETEC were not significant when ET was small. A possible reason is that the CO
    model estimated resistance from soil, while the JA model did not; thus, the estimation
    of ET by the JA model was larger. Fig. 8 Comparison of daily evapotranspiration
    calculated by optimised models ET and daily evapotranspiration measured by an
    eddy covariance system ETEC (a Jarvis model optimised by the least square method;
    b Jarvis model optimised by ant colony optimisation; c coupled resistance model
    optimised by the least square method; d coupled resistance model optimised by
    ant colony optimisation; the solid line is the 1:1 line) Full size image When
    ET became larger, the estimation evenly distributed around the 1:1 line. However,
    several obvious deviations in the JA produced larger errors and higher RMSE values,
    which should be eliminated after further evaluation by applying data from more
    than 2 years or excluding data on days when the weather changed drastically. It
    should be noted that only data from 2013 were used for the determination of parameters
    in the rc models. The discrepancies between estimated rc and ET and measured rc
    and ET may result from insufficient data volume. Data with a larger time span
    are needed for better optimisation and applicability of rc models in the future.
    Conclusions Accurate estimation of maize evapotranspiration (ET) is of great significance
    for improving crop water-use efficiency and precision irrigation. The Penman–Monteith
    model (P-M) has been widely used to simulate crop ET. In the P-M model, the estimation
    accuracy of canopy resistance (rc) directly impacts ET. Based on the eddy covariance
    system and meteorological station data in Huailai Remote Sensing Experimental
    Station, this study determined the empirical parameters of canopy resistance (rc)
    in the Jarvis and CO models by adopting LSM and ACO algorithms. By taking rc reversely
    calculated by the P-M model as the standard value, rc calculated by verification
    parameters was verified. The measured ET data were used to verify the estimated
    results. The main conclusions are summarised as follows: During the growing season
    of summer maize, rc showed a decreasing trend. It peaked close to 5000 s m−1 at
    the early growing stage and decreased quickly thereafter. Path analysis was conducted
    to study how strongly rc was affected by different factors, and the influence
    of the affecting factors followed the order Rn > LAI > VPD > T > θ, among which
    Rn, LAI, and T had significant negative effects, VPD had a positive effect, and
    the effect of θ was not significant. Parameters in the JA and CO models were optimised
    by LSM and ACO based on data from 2013. Generally, the CO model performed better
    than the JA model. The CO model optimised by ACO produced the most accurate results,
    with R2 of 0.89, RMSE of 410.9 s m−1, and dr of 0.88, in which the calibrated
    values of b1, b2, b3, b4, b5, and b6 were 2.20, 0.18, 0.01, − 0.18, − 1.39 and
    − 0.45, respectively. The JA model optimised by ACO also performed well, with
    R2 of 0.83, RMSE of 515.5 s m−1, and dr of 0.85, in which the calibrated values
    of rcmin, a1, a2, and a3 were 7.43 s m−1, 360.8, 0.25 and − 0.003, respectively.
    Using ET measured by the eddy covariance system as a benchmark, ET calculated
    by the optimized rc models was validated in 2014. The CO model optimised by ACO
    produced the most accurate result, with R2 of 0.72, RMSE of 1.07 mm, and dr of
    0.75. It performed well at the early growing stage when vegetation was sparse.
    The JA model optimised by ACO provided a good result, with R2 of 0.67, RMSE of
    1.16 mm, and dr of 0.76. The CO model optimised by ACO is recommended as the best
    approach to estimate ET when data are available, and the JA model can be used
    as an alternative. Data availability This study uses publicly available dataset
    provided by the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center (http://data.tpdc.ac.cn).

    With the development of modern science and technology, the development of electrical\
    \ automation engineering has also\nbecome widespread. In the traditional sense,\
    \ the wiring of the electrical automation control system is complex, the cost\n\
    is high, the maintenance is difficult and failures may easily occur, and these\
    \ factors seriously affect the system efficiency.\nThe application of PLC technology\
    \ in the field of electrical automation greatly simplifies the installation and\
    \ operation\nprocess, and improves the work efficiency. Therefore, PLC technology\
    \ has come to play an increasingly important role in\nthe efficient and stable\
    \ operation of electrical automation engineering. This paper analyses and explores\
    \ the principle and\npractical application of PLC in the field of electrical automation\
    \ engineering, and optimises the automatic control system\nbased on PLC.\nKeywords:\

    With the development of society and economy, electrical automation has come to\
    \ be widely used in many\nindustries; from industries in which merely basic construction\
    \ activity is involved to aerospace high-tech, there\nis no shortage of electrical\
    \ automation, and it has found the most extensive application in heavy industry\
    \ and\npower generation [1]. The improvement and effective use of electrical automation\
    \ can comprehensively improve\nwork quality and work efficiency, and maximise\
    \ the economic benefits obtained by enterprises [2]. A series of\nstandards has\
    \ been formulated in China to ensure the better development of electrical automation\
    \ and to improve\nthe versatility of related equipment [3]. In the 21st century,\
    \ electrical engineering and its automation technology\nare being continuously\
    \ improved and updated, and the effective integration of computer information\
    \ technology\nand electrical automation can comprehensively improve the quality\
    \ and work efficiency of the entire electrical\nautomation system, thus facilitating\
    \ it to become one of the important guarantees for the long-term development\n\
    of the Chinese economy [4].\n†Corresponding author.\nEmail address: limq@gsau.edu.cn\n\

    \ Nonlinear Sciences 8(2023) 615–624\nIn traditional electrical control, most\
    \ components of the electrical system are controlled in the form of relay\ncontact,\
    \ but relay control has the disadvantages of slow response time, high average\
    \ repair rate, complicated\nwiring, low reliability, high power consumption and\
    \ poor flexibility [5]. Therefore, an automatic control system\nwith a wide range\
    \ of applications, powerful functions and convenient use is urgently needed. The\
    \ programmable\nlogic controller appeared in response to this requirement and\
    \ has been widely used in the field of automatic\ncontrol, which has greatly promoted\
    \ an enhancement in the levels of effectiveness and efficiency for industries\n\
    that have adopted this automation [6]. The working principle of PLC is fundamentally\
    \ the same as that of a\ncomputer, and it also realises a series of task controls\
    \ through the execution of certain user programs. In terms\nof time, the PLC controller\
    \ is different from the relay control system when performing tasks [7]. In the\
    \ work of\nPLC, the method of cyclic scanning is used. This method refers to sampling\
    \ the signals in each process during\nthe running time of the program, and then\
    \ performing operations and processing on the signals. The results are\nsent to\
    \ the relevant actuators [8]. During the operating cycle of the system, some of\
    \ the input data do not change,\nand similarly, some output data remain fixed\
    \ whereas others might or might not change. In the PLC, the cycle\nscanning method\
    \ is used to continuously sample and output the input variables and output variables,\
    \ so that the\ncorresponding execution actions can be made when the conditions\
    \ are met [9].\nElectrical automation based on PLC technology is widely used in\
    \ all walks of life. In the field of agriculture,\nthrough precise control of\
    \ the supply of water and fertiliser to crops, the waste of water resources can\
    \ be reduced\nand the level of agricultural modernisation can be improved [10],\
    \ Accordingly, several studies are available in\nthe literature describing the\
    \ impact of application of this technology in agricultural automation tasks. Leedy\
    \ et\nal. [11] designed a fertiliser distribution device for a sprinkler irrigation\
    \ system to realise the integrated irrigation\nof water and fertiliser. Colaco\
    \ and Molin [12] and Chandel et al. [13] equipped the fertiliser applicator with\
    \ a\nPDA and a vehicle-mounted computer, respectively, combined with technologies\
    \ such as sensors, cameras and\nGIS positioning, to achieve accurate measurement\
    \ and control of orchard fertilisation decision-making informa-\ntion. Sarangapani\
    \ et al. [14] used two-line decoding technology and cloud computing to realise\
    \ the intelligent\nirrigation of the water and fertiliser integrated delivery\
    \ machine. Dwinugroho et al. [15] designed and opti-\nmised the mixed fertiliser\
    \ system of the three-channel bypass fertiliser applicator, and verified the stability\
    \ of\nthe whole machine structure through simulation and experiments. Boobalan\
    \ et al. [16] combined fuzzy control\nand FPGA technology to design a greenhouse\
    \ water and fertiliser integration system for online fertiliser mixing.\nThe application\
    \ results show that the system has good control performance. Yang and Cheng [17]\
    \ developed\nan intelligent irrigation system controlled and monitored by the\
    \ Android platform. In applying this system, any\nAndroid-powered mobile phone\
    \ can be used to communicate with soil moisture and temperature sensors in real\n\
    time to realise automatic irrigation of farmland and online analysis of optimal\
    \ water volume or crop yield. Liu et\nal. [18] designed a soilless cultivation\
    \ irrigation cloud system based on EC sensors, which drives the single-chip\n\
    microcomputer to control the irrigation and fertilisation devices according to\
    \ the fertiliser parameters collected\nby the wireless sensors. Ouberri et al.\
    \ [19] designed a fuzzy controller for precision irrigation nonlinear systems,\n\
    using the T-S model to achieve continuous management of multiple input variables.\
    \ Rajkumar et al. [20] estab-\nlished an intelligent fuzzy inference model for\
    \ the randomness and nonlinearity of automatic irrigation systems,\nwhich can\
    \ effectively improve their accuracy. Yadav and Shevade [21] proposed using the\
    \ WebGIS framework\nto connect discrete agricultural systems to the Internet,\
    \ and use big data analysis, AI, drones and other tech-\nnologies to achieve sustainable\
    \ promotion of precision agriculture. Stavrakoudis et al. [22] used UAV remote\n\
    sensing technology to predict the data of rice yield and fertiliser requirement,\
    \ and established a nutrient content\ninversion model of rice growth period through\
    \ multiple linear regression method to ensure accurate diagnosis of\nrice fertiliser\
    \ application.\nIn the field of urban drainage automation, Chopade [22] studied\
    \ the adaptability of automatic control systems\nunder different environmental\
    \ conditions, and used experimental tests to obtain the results; Nie and Xu [23]\n\
    mainly designed and implemented BCI-based automatic control systems. Yang and\
    \ Fu [24] focussed on research\ninto the automatic display system of drainage\
    \ systems under certain conditions, using a mobile liquid crystal\ndisplay. After\
    \ years of development, the automation level of the current sewage treatment industry\
    \ has been\nApplication of PLC technology in electrical automation engineering\n\
    617\ngreatly improved, and the related technologies of the control system have\
    \ been gradually updated and improved\n[25]. At present, the three main control\
    \ systems in the control field are PLC programmable controller system,\nFCS fieldbus\
    \ control system and DCS distributed control system [26]. Among them, the structure\
    \ of the DCS\ncontrol system is divided into three levels, including the control\
    \ station, the operation station and the instruments\nin the process. FCS realises\
    \ the organic combination of field process equipment, PLC controller and upper\n\
    computer monitoring part through the established communication network, and thus\
    \ facilitates the automation\nof field-level industrial control. FCS system is\
    \ a relatively popular development point in the current control field,\nand it\
    \ is also a popular development direction [27]. The openness, dispersion, maintainability\
    \ and operability\nof the FCS system are relatively good, and it is also simple\
    \ and easy to implement in such a way as to achieve\ncomplete onsite control.\
    \ It is being increasingly used in current industrial production applications\
    \ [28]. As a\nresult of the effective development of the development platform\
    \ and configuration software, the PLC control\nsystem has a more friendly human–machine\
    \ interface, and at the same time, the cost is reduced; thus, by opting\nfor this\
    \ system, users can economically use a control system that offers a greater capability\
    \ for friendly (i.e.\nhassle-free) human–machine interaction. The improvement\
    \ of the communication level also makes the security\nand stability of the control\
    \ system develop by leaps and bounds. The openness characteristics of PLC systems\n\
    are also generally developed based on the customised needs of users, allowing\
    \ the integration of third-party\nsoftware and hardware to make PLC more powerful\
    \ and empowering its use in a wider range.\nBased on the findings from the literature\
    \ outlined above, it is observed that PLC technology is widely used\nin various\
    \ fields of electrical automation, which greatly improves the efficiency of the\
    \ control system and sim-\nplifies the installation, monitoring, management, maintenance\
    \ and other procedures. However, it still has some\nshortcomings, such as the\
    \ efficiency still not being very high, the response time being long and the control\
    \ ac-\ncuracy being low. Therefore, this paper studies the practical application\
    \ of PLC technology in various fields of\nelectrical automation engineering, analyses\
    \ its working principle in depth and optimises the automatic control\nsystem based\
    \ on the PLC principle.\n2 Mathematical model of PLC technology and electrical\
    \ automation\nIn the electrical automation control system, the RL network is a\
    \ common loop in the electrical system, in\nwhich the resistance R and the inductance\
    \ L are constants, the voltage U is the input quantity, the current I is the\n\
    output quantity and the differential equation expressions of the input quantity\
    \ and the output quantity are such\nas indicated in Eqs (1)–(4):\nur = Ldi\ndt\
    \ +Ri\n(1)\nT = L\nR\n(2)\nK = 1\nR\n(3)\nT di\ndt +i = Kur\n(4)\nIn addition,\
    \ the RC network structure is also a common loop of the electrical system. The\
    \ resistance R and the\ncapacitance C are both constants, the voltage Ur is the\
    \ input quantity and the voltage Uc is the output quantity.\nFurther, according\
    \ to the circuit theory, the differential equation expressions of the input and\
    \ output quantities\ncan be obtained as shown in Eqs (5) and (6):\nur = Ri+ 1\n\
    C\n\x02\nidt\n(5)\nuc = 1\nC\n\x02\nidt\n(6)\n618\nLi Applied Mathematics and\
    \ Nonlinear Sciences 8(2023) 615–624\nwhere I is the current passing through the\
    \ capacitor C and the resistor R. After the equation transformation, the\ndifferential\
    \ equation expression between the input and output quantities can be obtained\
    \ as shown in Eqs (7) and\n(8):\nRCduc\ndt +uc = ur\n(7)\nT duc\ndt +uc = ur\n\
    (8)\nAt the same time, the PLC uses the armature voltage to control the DC motor\
    \ in the system, I is the excitation\ncurrent, Ua and Ia are the armature voltage\
    \ and current, M is the load torque on the motor, and are the displace-\nment\
    \ and rotational speed of the motor, respectively. Therefore, the equation expression\
    \ of the armature circuit\ncontrolled by PLC can be obtained as shown in Eq. (9):\n\
    ua = iaRa +La\ndia\ndt +ea\n(9)\nThe back EMF is proportional to the motor speed,\
    \ as shown in Eq. (10):\nea = Ka\ndθ\ndt\n(10)\nThe electromagnetic torque M generated\
    \ by the motor is proportional to the armature current I, as shown in Eq.\n(11):\n\
    M = Cia\n(11)\nThe torque balance formula on the motor is shown in Eq. (12):\n\
    M −ML = J d2θ\ndt2 + f dθ\ndt\n(12)\nEqs (9)–(12) are the dynamic and static correlations\
    \ of the armature controlled by the PLC, which is one of\nthe mathematical models\
    \ of the electrification system. The four equations mentioned above are transformed\
    \ by\nformulas to obtain the attitude equation between the input and output of\
    \ the motor, as shown in Eq. (13):\nJRa\nd3θ\ndt3 +(fRa + fLa) d2θ\ndt2 +(fRa\
    \ +CKa) dθ\ndt = Cua −RaML −La\ndML\ndt\n(13)\nSince the inductance of the motor\
    \ has little influence on the system, Eq. (13) can be simplified to Eq. (14):\n\
    JRa\nd2θ\ndt2 +(fRa +CKa) dθ\ndt = Cua −RaML\n(14)\nAt the same time, the rotational\
    \ speed of the motor is known as the input quantity, and it can be simplified\
    \ by\nusing the following Eq. (15):\nJRa\ndθ\ndt +(fRa +CKa)ω = Cua −RaML\n(15)\n\
    At the same time, PLC is in the motor drive control, in which the servo motor\
    \ drives the screw to rotate once,\nand the volume V of the object brought out\
    \ is shown in Eq. (16):\nV = FL = t (S−b)·π ·d/cosα\n(16)\nThen, every time the\
    \ screw rotates once, the mass M of the object brought out is shown in Eq. (17):\n\
    M = V ·γ ·n\n(17)\nApplication of PLC technology in electrical automation engineering\n\
    619\nFor the power model of the PLC-controlled motor drive, the motor power balance\
    \ equation can be written as\nshown in Eq. (18):\nF = m¨v0 +Cr ˙x0 +F0\n(18)\n\
    The transmission force formula of PLC-controlled servo motor is given by Eq. (19):\n\
    F = k(v−v0)\n(19)\nAfter Laplace transformation from Eqs (18) and (19), Eqs (20)–(22)\
    \ can be obtained:\nF =\n\0mS2 +CrS\n\x01\nv0(S)+F0\n(20)\nF = k[v(S)−v0(S)]\n\
    (21)\nv0(S) =\nkv(S)−F0\nmS2 +CrS+k\n(22)\nFor the motor controlled by PLC, if\
    \ the influence of the friction resistance of the screw is not considered, the\n\
    transfer function of the power model of the mechanical transmission of the servo\
    \ system can be written as shown\nin Eq. (23):\nG(S) =\nk\nmS2 +CrS+k\n(23)\n\

    \ of PLC technology in electrical automation\n3.1\nApplication of PLC in electrical\
    \ sequence control\nIn the engineering electrical automation control system, the\
    \ advantages of PLC technology are particularly\nprominent. Electrical automation\
    \ regards PLC technology as a sequential control system in many fields, and the\n\
    test practice effect of PLC is very significant. The automatic sequence function\
    \ is a feature of PLC technology,\nwhich can reasonably and effectively arrange\
    \ the sequence of electrical automation equipment, thereby reducing\nthe repetition\
    \ rate and the processing process related to electrical automation, further improving\
    \ the processing\nefficiency of electrical automation, effectively reducing the\
    \ production cost of electrical automation, and ensur-\ning that the automation\
    \ and efficiency targets are completed on time. The automation program includes\
    \ the main\nprogram and multiple functional sub-modules, and the electrical automation\
    \ sequence control is one of them.\nThe mutual assistance between the modules\
    \ can realise remote control, and can strengthen the management and\ncontrol of\
    \ related electrical automation equipment. The application of PLC technology in\
    \ sequence control can\nbe divided into primary and secondary stations, on-site\
    \ sensing and remote control, etc.; designers need to carry\nout the relevant\
    \ electrical automation program design scientifically and reasonably, so as to\
    \ achieve effective\nmanagement of electrical automation data, thereby improving\
    \ production efficiency. Also, the remote control\nfunction can reduce the occurrence\
    \ rate of safety accidents and realise the comprehensive improvement of the\n\
    control ability of electrical automation equipment.\n3.2\nApplication of PLC in\
    \ electrical control switch\nIn the operation of the traditional electrical automation\
    \ switch system, the system consumes a certain amount\nof time and a large amount\
    \ of power when starting control, and the electrical automation system is often\
    \ short-\ncircuited. The use of PLC technology can effectively solve such problems.\
    \ The rational application of PLC\n620\nLi Applied Mathematics and Nonlinear Sciences\
    \ 8(2023) 615–624\ntechnology in the control of switching electrical automation\
    \ system can effectively promote the integration of\nelectrical operation and\
    \ information editing, thereby ensuring the safety and stability of the electrical\
    \ automation\ncontrol system. At the same time, the application of PLC technology\
    \ can effectively shorten the response time\nof the relays in the electrical automation\
    \ system during operation, can control the frequency of short-circuit\naccidents\
    \ taking place in the system, and can also improve the production efficiency,\
    \ thereby avoiding the major\npitfalls or limitations typically associated with\
    \ electrical automation systems, namely loss of equipment control\nand resulting\
    \ safety issues.\n3.3\nApplication of PLC in electrical data control\nPLC technology\
    \ can strengthen the processing of electrical automation data, and is also the\
    \ main task of\nengineering electrical automation. PLC technology may be used\
    \ to carry out simple programming, conduct pre-\nliminary screening of electrical\
    \ automation information, and then perform an overall scan of the ladder diagram\n\
    inside the electrical automation equipment to obtain electrical automation data\
    \ information. In this way, the\nelectrical automation operation steps can be\
    \ optimised, the PLC running speed can be accelerated and the elec-\ntrical automation\
    \ data information can be processed more effectively. The digital information\
    \ age has imposed\nstrict requirements on data security, and given the background\
    \ of this requirement, it is noteworthy to emphasise\nthat accelerated data processing\
    \ can effectively manage data and improve the security of electrical automation\n\
    data. Since the electrical automation data control includes two parts, namely\
    \ the control part and the controlled\nobject, the electrical automation control\
    \ program can be used to collect the electrical automation data reasonably\nand\
    \ effectively, arrange the controller to compile the program, and then use statistical\
    \ methods and digitalisation\nto efficiently process data that control electrical\
    \ automation.\n3.4\nApplication of PLC in electrical closed-loop control\nThe\
    \ sequence of processing the electrical automation output information and returning\
    \ to the original begin-\nning is called electrical automation closed-loop control.\
    \ The electrical automation closed-loop control can start\nthe system operation\
    \ under the action of the feedback mechanism, and output relevant information\
    \ smoothly;\nand at the same time, it can re-input and output basic object information,\
    \ and achieve the expected effect through\nreasonable improvement. The application\
    \ of PLC technology in closed-loop control can effectively integrate the\nrunning\
    \ time of the motor in electrical automation and make a reasonable selection of\
    \ production tools, and\nthis ideally results in improvement in production quality.\
    \ PLC technology includes closed-loop control and se-\nquence control, which can\
    \ further improve the intelligence level of the control electrical automation\
    \ system, and\neffectively enhance the structure control and electrical automation\
    \ data closed-loop management.\n3.5\nApplication of PLC in automatic machining\
    \ control\nIn order to ensure the mechanical strength, the rivet necessitates\
    \ strict requirements on the processing pres-\nsure and temperature in the process\
    \ of hot pressing and forming. If the pressure is too low, the forming effect\n\
    of the rivet will be poor, which will affect its normal use. If the temperature\
    \ is too high or too low, it will affect\nthe stability of the internal structure\
    \ of the rivet and reduce its life and mechanical strength. In order to provide\n\
    the yield of rivet processing, PLC is used to automatically control the CNC machine\
    \ tool press in the process\nof rivet processing. The effect is shown in Figure\
    \ 1 and Table 1. An analysis of Figure 1 shows that when PLC\nis used to control\
    \ the pressure of the CNC machine tool for pressing rivets, when the control time\
    \ is between\n0 s and 10 s, the pressure curve of the rivet will overshoot during\
    \ the preparation process. However, with the\nincrease of PLC automatic control\
    \ time, the curve of rivet bearing pressure begins to maintain a smooth state,\n\
    and there is almost no fluctuation. Before PLC is used, the pressure change of\
    \ rivets will have a large amplitude\nand the curve will fluctuate greatly.\n\
    Table 1 illustrates the effect of temperature changes during rivet processing\
    \ on automatic control. During the\noperation of the PLC-controlled electrical\
    \ automation system, the flow of people and the changes in indoor and\nApplication\

    \ load disturbances in the rivet processing workshop. Therefore, when\nthe thermal\
    \ load disturbance multiples of the electrical automation system are different,\
    \ the effect of PLC on\nthe automatic control of CNC machine tools is tested.\
    \ The results are shown in Table 1. On analysing Table 1,\nit is inferred that\
    \ the thermal load disturbance multiple can have a certain impact on the automatic\
    \ temperature\ncontrol of the CNC machine tool. When using PLC to control the\
    \ temperature of the electrical automation\nsystem, when the disturbance multiple\
    \ is 1.0–1.6, it has no obvious influence on the PLC automatic control, and\n\
    the automatic control of the CNC machine tool temperature response time is short.\
    \ However, with the increase\nof the thermal load disturbance multiple of the\
    \ electrical automation system, there is a deviation when the PLC\nautomatically\
    \ controls the temperature of the CNC machine tool, but the maximum deviation\
    \ value is 1.49◦C,\nand the error percentage is only about 0.001. The results\
    \ show that PLC has a better effect on temperature\ncontrol of electrical equipment,\
    \ and higher precision.\n3.6\nElectrical application of PLC based on PID algorithm\
    \ in packaging\nThe control electrical automation system designed by this PLC\
    \ adopts Siemens S7-200 series PLC external\nanalogue input module EM235 to input\
    \ the signal obtained by the weighing sensor into the PLC. This module can\nconvert\
    \ the signal obtained by the sensor into (0–32,000) between the numbers. Therefore,\
    \ the design deviation\nof the electrical automation system can be converted into\
    \ (−32 to 32), and its absolute value is changed to (0–32)\n622\nLi Applied Mathematics\
    \ and Nonlinear Sciences 8(2023) 615–624\nto simplify the programming, so that\
    \ the quantisation factor is 3/16; the PID control loop number is selected as\n\
    0, and VB100 as the starting address.\nIn order to edit the fuzzy controller,\
    \ Matlab mathematical simulation software is used to input the controller\ninto\
    \ the software, and then a two-dimensional fuzzy controller is determined with\
    \ two inputs and three outputs.\nThe parameters in the editing interface select\
    \ the FIS controller type as Mamdani, and the defuzzification method\nadopts the\
    \ centre of gravity method. The minimum method is selected for inference rules,\
    \ and the maximum\nmethod is selected for synthesis rules. Then, the membership\
    \ functions of the input and output variables are\nedited, the obtained control\
    \ rules are input into the controller, the Simulink simulation simulator provided\
    \ in\nMatlab is used to conduct electrical automation simulation experiments,\
    \ and a simulation model is established\nfor the control effect of fuzzy PID control.\n\
    After the simulation is completed, the weighing system of the electrical automatic\
    \ packaging machine is run\nand debugged. Table 2 shows the weighing data in the\
    \ experiment of weighing accuracy of 200 g with 200 g/bag\nas the experimental\
    \ basis. The distribution line of the deviation corresponding to the target quality\
    \ is shown in\nFigure 2. After the above experimental analysis, it can be known\
    \ that the accuracy of the weighing system of the\npackaging machine is within\
    \ the range of ±0.1%. The production line of the bag-feeding packaging machine\n\
    is in good operation, and the improved weighing system works stably and has good\
    \ precision, which meets the\npackaging requirements.\nTable 2 Packaging test\

    \ in electrical automation engineering\n623\n4 Conclusion\nThe application of\
    \ PLC technology can not only effectively improve various problems existing in\
    \ the tra-\nditional electrical automation control system, but also play a role\
    \ in controlling material loss and saving costs,\nwhich can also promote the production\
    \ efficiency and economic benefits derived by electrical automation en-\nterprises.\
    \ The use of internal model PID control algorithm strengthens the adaptability\
    \ of the controller to the\nchanges of the electrical automation system model,\
    \ better meets the control requirements of stability, accuracy\nand rapidity,\
    \ and realises the system heat source that would enable effective and efficient\
    \ operation correspond-\ning to the least amount of resource consumption; however,\
    \ the electrical automation system Fan PID param-\neters have not yet achieved\
    \ self-matching and self-adaptive functions. Therefore, it is necessary to continue\n\
    to carefully analyse a large amount of electrical automation data that have been\
    \ collected, establish electrical\nautomation system models under various working\
    \ conditions, and combine fuzzy control rules, compile fuzzy\nprograms and add\
    \ them to existing programs. In this way, the electrical automation system can\
    \ independently\nchoose to change the motor PID parameters according to different\
    \ working conditions, so that the entire electri-\ncal automation system can always\
    \ maintain efficient operation.\nIn order to further improve the accuracy of the\
    \ weighing system of the bag packaging machine based on\nthe electrical automation\
    \ system, this paper studies and analyses the PLC control system, combines the\
    \ fuzzy\ncontrol with the PID control and proposes the fuzzy control based on\
    \ the traditional PID. The control of the\nfuzzy PID control electrical automation\
    \ system in the packaging machine weighing system is realised through\nthe powerful\
    \ control effect and programming ability of PLC. The experimental results show\
    \ that the improved\nelectrical automation control system has good accuracy, the\
    \ system overshoot is small and the weighing accu-\nracy is controlled at about\
    \ ±0.1%, which better meets the requirements of accurate measurement of electrical\n\
    automation packaging machines.\nThe automatic control system of electrical equipment\
    \ based on PLC technology is designed. The PID con-\ntrol algorithm is used in\
    \ the system, and it is written into the PLC programmable electrical automation\
    \ system\ncontroller in a self-programming way. The electrical automation system\
    \ controller is used to realise electrical\nThe device is automatically controlled.\
    \ The simulation test results show that the PLC is less affected by the num-\n\
    ber of threads, and its operation is relatively stable. The spectrum efficiency\
    \ curve of the electrical automation\nsystem coincides with the ideal curve, and\
    \ it has better communication performance and good applicability.\nAcknowledgements.\n\

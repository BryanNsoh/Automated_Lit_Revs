    Here, we review the potential impacts of BC on soil water dynamics, elucidate

    water dynamics. Graphical Abstract Highlights Biochar generally improves soil
    water retention in coarse-textured soils. In coarse-textured soils, biochar increases
    porosity and PAW but decreases bulk density and Ksat. The effects of biochar on
    infiltration rates vary depending on soil types, as well as biochar particle size,
    production temperature, and depth of placement. Further studies on the mechanisms
    governing water retention in biochar-amended soils are warranted. Long-term studies
    encompassing various soil and biochar types are necessary. 1 Introduction The
    rise in global population, shifts in land-use patterns, and climatic unpredictabilities
    have exerted profound pressures on agriculture and water systems (Doklega et al.
    2023; FAO 2017; Mubarak et al. 2021; Vörösmarty et al. 2000). Consequently, the
    agricultural domain is progressively embracing diverse strategies, notably the
    integration of soil amendments (Lasheen et al. 2023; Saudy et al. 2021a), to augment
    irrigation water-use efficiency (El-Metwally et al. 2022; Makhlouf et al. 2022),
    soil water retention (Salem et al. 2021), and agricultural yield (Cho et al. 2023;
    Ramadan et al. 2023; Saudy et al. 2021a, 2021b). Recent research results emphasize
    biochar (BC) as a potent soil amendment, delineating its capacity for enhanced
    carbon (C) sequestration and amelioration of agricultural output by modulating
    soil physicochemical attributes (Agegnehu et al. 2017; Park et al. 2023a, b; Yun
    et al. 2022). Biochar is a carbon-enriched material produced through pyrolysis
    of biomass under anaerobic or oxygen-limited conditions (Jeong et al. 2016; Sohi
    et al. 2010). It predominantly comprises stable aromatic carbon, moderately labile
    aliphatic carbon, and mineral ash residues. Notably, BC''s longevity in soil surpasses
    that of conventional organic matter forms, attributable to its recalcitrant nature
    (Jeong et al. 2016; Joseph et al. 2021; Weber and Quicker 2018). Historically,
    BC research predominantly emphasized its role in carbon sequestration, climate
    change mitigation, and soil fertility enhancement (Saudy et al. 2021b). However,
    contemporary investigations increasingly pivot towards elucidating BC''s influence
    on soil physical and hydrological properties (Blanco-Canqui 2017; Bohara et al.
    2019; Cernansky 2015). Many studies have elucidated BC impacts on soil water dynamics,
    with outcomes contingent upon BC source materials, production conditions, and
    initial soil properties (Bohara et al. 2019; Yu et al. 2017). For instance, BCs
    from hemlock and switchblade grass increased water holding capacity (WHC) in loamy
    sands (Yu et al. 2017), while coffee husk BC increased the water use efficiency
    of corn in sandy soils (de Sousa Lima et al. 2017). In addition, corn cob BC increased
    saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) and WHC in sandy loam soil (Zhou et al.
    2018). Despite burgeoning recognition of BC''s multifaceted impacts across global
    agroecological landscapes, comprehensive reviews delineating BC''s efficacy in
    soil water management remain conspicuously scant. Existing syntheses primarily
    emphasize BC''s chemical attributes, waste utilization, and broader environmental
    implications (Gul et al. 2015; Wang and Wang 2019; Xiao et al. 2017; Yang et al.
    2020). Further, reviews in the soil water sector have predominantly focused on
    individual hydraulic parameters, such as Razzaghi et al.''s (2020) focus on soil
    water retention, indicating a notable knowledge gap in comprehensive assessments
    encompassing multiple hydraulic aspects. As such, there is a need for a comprehensive
    review of research reports with focus on BC management for modulating soil water
    availability and refining irrigation strategies within BC-applied fields. The
    review should not only emphasize current research gaps but also compellingly outline
    the path for future research directions. Indeed, enhancing water retention and
    optimizing agricultural water use are paramount for strengthening the resilience
    of agroecosystems, particularly in the face of the expanding global irrigated
    land and the challenges posed by declining water quality and availability (Nilahyane
    et al. 2023). Therefore, this review aims to (i) critically evaluate extant literature
    concerning BC application and its ramifications on soil water dynamics, (ii) identify
    prevalent challenges and critical research gaps, and (iii) highlight needs and
    opportunities for future research. Over 150 scholarly articles published between
    1990 and 2023 were reviewed and summarized. 2 Impact of feedstock and pyrolysis
    conditions on biochar characteristics and their ripple effect on soil water dynamics
    Biochar is produced via the pyrolysis of various organic feedstocks including
    wood, manure, green waste, algae, and various crop residues and byproducts like
    straw, cobs, husks, and bagasse, employing either slow or fast heating regimes
    within a temperature spectrum of 200 to 1250 °C, under limited to no oxygen conditions
    (Fig. 1; Tripathi et al. 2016). This thermochemical process entails the degradation
    of biomass, encompassing dehydration, decarboxylation, and dehydrogenation reactions,
    the specifics of which are influenced by factors such as biomass type, pyrolysis
    temperature, heating rate, and vapor residence time (Laird et al. 2009; Tripathi
    et al. 2016). Depending on the production temperature and residence time, pyrolysis
    can be categorized into slow, intermediate, and fast pyrolysis. In slow pyrolysis,
    feedstocks are pyrolyzed at temperatures ranging from 400–500 °C, employing a
    heating rate of approximately 0.1 to 1 °C per second, for a duration ranging between
    300 and 550 s (Tripathi et al. 2016). Fast pyrolysis involves heating biomass
    to a temperature range of 850–1250 °C, with a heating rate between 10 and 200
    °C per second, for a brief duration ranging from 0.5 to 10 s. Intermediate pyrolysis
    occurs within the temperature range of 500 to 650 °C, employing a heating rate
    varying from 1 to 10 °C per second, and a residence time lasting between 0.5 and
    20 s (Tripathi et al. 2016). Fig. 1 Biochar production techniques Full size image
    Yield, morphology, and structural properties of the resulting BCs are intricately
    influenced by multiple operational parameters. These include the residence time
    of feedstock, amount of vapor in the pyrolysis unit, heating rate, temperature,
    pyrolyzer bed height, pressure, carrier gas flow rate, catalyst, and feedstock
    types (Ahmad et al. 2014; Tripathi et al. 2016). Important BC physical properties
    that influence soil moisture dynamics include surface area, pore space, pore size
    distribution, particle density, surface functional groups, hydrophilicity, thermal
    properties, and mechanical strength (Blanco-Canqui 2017). Notably, BC derived
    from fast pyrolysis exhibits greater particle density, more volatiles, and less
    fixed carbon relative to its counterparts from slow pyrolysis and gasification
    processes (Brewer et al. 2011). In general, higher pyrolysis temperatures tend
    to produce BCs with higher surface area and pore space. For example, in a recent
    study, BC produced at 450 to 550 °C temperatures increased soil structure due
    to higher specific surface area and cation exchange capacity (CEC). However, temperature
    exceeding 550 °C resulted in the loss of O content and therefore enhanced BC’s
    hydrophobicity (Ghorbani et al. 2022). Similarly, surface area of BC, produced
    from sugarcane leaf biomass, increased from 8.1 m2 g−1 to 178.5 m2 g−1 as the
    pyrolysis temperature increased from 450 °C to 650 °C (Jeong et al. 2016). Surface
    area of 0.02 m2 g−1 was reported for the BC derived from stone fruit pits at 300
    °C (Hale et al. 2015), while 528 m2 g−1 (via CO2 sorptometry) was reported for
    oakwood BC pyrolyzed at 650 °C (Mukherjee et al. 2011). Intriguingly, while surface
    area typically escalates with increasing pyrolysis temperature up to a specific
    temperature limit, excessively high temperatures can induce BC with diminished
    surface area due to internal pore space deformation. For instance, Jeong et al.
    (2016) observed an increase in BC surface area when pyrolysis temperature increased
    from 450 °C to 650 °C but detected marginal decline in surface area at 750 °C.
    However, in another study, BCs produced between 650 and 850 °C were reported to
    exhibit higher surface area relative to those produced at lower pyrolysis temperatures
    (Mukherjee and Lal 2013). Biochar’s inherent pore characteristics—including total
    pore space, pore size and pore distribution —significantly influence soil water
    retention, availability, and gas fluxes. The pore structure within BC particles
    exhibits variability in internal diameters, contingent upon the specific feedstock
    and pyrolysis temperature. Typically categorized, these pores encompass macropores
    (> 50 nm), mesopores (2–50 nm), and micropores (< 2 nm). Both intrapores and interpores
    affect BC’s surface area, gas diffusivity, soil water storage, as well as the
    sorption and molecular transport mechanisms therein (Atkinson et al. 2010). The
    heating rate and pressure during the pyrolysis influence the mass transfer dynamics
    of volatile compounds, as well as the resultant BC''s surface area, pore volume,
    and pore size distribution (Tripathi et al. 2016). Typically, BCs derived from
    higher temperatures exhibit higher internal pore volume (Brewer et al. 2014; Keiluweit
    et al. 2010); however, higher temperatures can instigate the thermal cracking
    of heavy hydrocarbons, leading to alterations in macro-porosity and a potential
    decline in overall BC yield (Tripathi et al. 2016). Furthermore, pyrolysis conditions
    characterized by higher heating rate, elevated pressure and extended retention
    time can induce molecular rearrangements within the BC matrix, subsequently influencing
    the surface area and porosity (Bikbulatova et al. 2018; Gray et al. 2014). Pyrolysis
    above 400 °C could increase skeletal density and yield of aromatic and quinone
    compounds. It could also reduce O-containing and aliphatic functional groups,
    and the crystalline nature of BC (Brewer et al. 2014; Gray et al. 2014; Kameyama
    et al. 2019; Keiluweit et al. 2010). Biochars produced at lower temperatures typically
    exhibit increased ion-exchange groups. Additionally, the physicochemical attributes
    of BC can evolve over time; freshly produced BCs generally possess a reduced CEC
    relative to aged BCs (Liang et al. 2006). Cation exchange capacity of BCs can
    undergo modifications within soil environments due to carboxylation process induced
    by abiotic oxidation and the loss of hydrophobic compounds (Verheijen et al. 2010).
    CEC exerts an influence on O to C ratios, with higher CEC correlating to an elevated
    O/C ratio. This relationship is inherently associated with hydrophobicity (Batista
    et al. 2018). Overall, CEC plays a crucial role in enhancing soil structure and
    retaining soil nutrients, demonstrating importance in water-filtration applications.
    3 Biochar impacts on soil properties that influence water dynamics Biochar has
    garnered significant attention as a soil amendment to harness a wide range of
    functions and benefits including increased yield and water retention (Ahmed et
    al. 2016; Bohara et al. 2019; Igalavithana et al. 2017; Liu et al. 2017a, b; Salinas
    et al. 2018). While many studies have reported positive effects of BCs on crop
    yield (Agegnehu et al. 2017; Jeffery et al. 2011; Uzoma et al. 2011; Xiao et al.
    2016), mechanisms that govern yield benefits are not yet fully understood. Water
    holding capacity and liming effects are considered two of the mechanisms by which
    BC may boost crop yields (Jeffery et al. 2011). Several studies have documented
    the substantial influence of BC application on soil water dynamics including improvements
    in soil WHC (Blanco-Canqui 2017; Bohara et al. 2019). For instance, Zhou et al.
    (2018) observed higher WHC and an increase in PAW by 18% with 9 Mg ha−1 maize
    cob BC application compared to the control plot in a sandy loam soil. The potential
    improvement in WHC of BC-amended soils emanates from significant changes in various
    soil physicochemical properties influencing soil water dynamics such as soil bulk
    density (BD), pore volume and size, infiltration, hydraulic conductivity (K),
    water potential, water repellency, and soil thermal properties (Fig. 2) (Blanco-Canqui
    2017; Hardie et al. 2014). These properties are discussed in detail next. Fig.
    2 Factors influencing the efficacy of BC in influencing soil water dynamics (Adapted
    and modified from Blanco-Canqui 2021) Full size image 3.1 Biochar impacts on soil
    bulk density and porosity Bulk density and porosity characteristics of soil influence
    soil water dynamics. Various studies, both field and laboratory studies, have
    elucidated alterations in soil BD with BC application (Additional file 1: Table
    S1) resulting from changes in porosity and soil structure (Blanco-Canqui 2017).
    In South Korea, Park et al. (2023a, b) reported that corn waste BC significantly
    reduced soil BD and increased near-surface porosity, CEC, and soil water content
    in both dry and wet years within upland corn production. Generally, BC reduces
    soil BD (Blanco-Canqui 2017; Park et al. 2023b) with reported decreases ranging
    from 1 to 73% compared to unamended soils, contingent upon soil texture and the
    rate of BC application (Zhao et al. 2016). The decrease in BD has demonstrated
    a linear correlation with the increasing rate of BC application. Generally, positive
    effects were apparent in fields when the BC application rate was > 7.5 Mg ha−1
    (e.g., Ma et al. 2016) and in laboratories when the rate was above 0.1% w/w (~ 2.1
    Mg ha−1) (Gamage et al. 2016). In addition to the BC application rate and soil
    texture, the effects on BD vary with BC feedstock type and pyrolysis temperature.
    While Liu et al. (2016) observed reduced BD with mesquite BC (pyrolyzed at 400
    °C) at 2% application rate, Igalavithana et al. (2017) and Pratiwi and Shinogi
    (2016) observed no significant effect at this rate with rice husk BC derived from
    pyrolysis at 750 °C. Similarly, the majority of studies indicate an increase in
    total porosity of soil varying from less than 1% to 55% following the application
    of BC (Additional file 1: Table S1). It must be noted that most of those studies
    demonstrating increased porosity with BC applications were conducted in coarse-textured
    soils. Studies suggest a decrease in BD and an increase in porosity in the sand,
    loamy sand, and sandy loam soils (Abel et al. 2013; Gamage et al. 2016; Githinji
    2014; Glab et al. 2016; Novak et al. 2016; Obia et al. 2016). However, a study
    by Villagra-Mendoza and Horn (2018) reported inconsistent effects of BC on soil
    porosity in sandy and sandy loam soil with the application of mango tree BC (pyrolyzed
    at 600 °C) at 2.5 and 5% rates. They reported that wide coarse pores decreased,
    and narrow pores increased after BC applications. Biochar could reduce soil BD
    through two mechanisms: dilution effects and increased soil porosity (Blanco-Canqui
    2017; Herath et al. 2013). Biochars, possessing lower density than the soil, act
    as amendments that, upon incorporation, result in dilution and reduction of the
    ensuing BD. Moreover, BC appears to increase soil porosity through differential
    mechanisms, including the direct introduction of new pores (Atkinson et al. 2010;
    Downie et al. 2009), reduction in BD and increase in soil aggregation (Verheijen
    et al. 2010), formation of accommodating pores between BC particles and soil aggregates
    (Jones et al. 2010; Novak et al. 2012), reduction of soil packing and restructuring
    of pore distribution (Sun et al. 2018), and an increase in the population of burrowing
    invertebrates (Lehmann et al. 2011). Andrerenelli et al. (2016) reported that
    the addition of wheat bran derived pelletized BC enhanced pore space by improving
    both soil aggregation and BC’s internal pore space. However, the improvement in
    pore space from soil aggregation is likely to be a more enduring effect. Also,
    BC forms accommodation pores depending upon soil texture, size of BC particles,
    and degree of settling (Hardie et al. 2014). Green waste BC derived from pyrolysis
    at 450 °C significantly increased the meso-porosity of bauxite processing sand
    by filling large pores between sand particles with BC particles, thereby positively
    influencing available WHC and water retention at field capacity (Jones et al.
    2010). In addition, BC application may improve the population of earthworms and
    other soil biota, contributing to modifications in BC''s particle size and soil
    structure that influence porosity (Thies and Rillig 2009). A few studies also
    showed limited to adverse effects of BCs on porosity in certain soil types (Jien
    and Wang 2013; Verheijen et al. 2010; Villagra-Mendoza and Horn 2018). According
    to Jien and Wang 2013, higher rates of BC amendments can prompt macroaggregate
    formation, shifting from micro-aggregate dominance over time, resulting in decreased
    porosity. In a few cases, BC-amended soils showed no significant effect on soil
    porosity. For example, mango-wood BC from pyrolysis at 600 °C showed no significant
    impact on the total porosity of sandy soil (Villagra-Mendoza and Horn 2018). Obia
    et al. (2016), however, observed an increased proportion of pores between 10 and
    100-µm radius with smaller particle sizes of maize cob BC (≤ 0.5 mm) produced
    at 350 °C in loamy sand compared to coarse BC particles (1–5 mm). In sandy soils,
    both fine and coarse BCs decreased the proportion of pores between 10 and 100-µm
    radius. The effects of BC on soil porosity hinge on BC’s internal porosity influenced
    by production conditions such as gasification, pyrolysis temperature, and particle
    size. Higher pyrolysis temperatures and gasification conversion generally increase
    porosity, as discussed earlier, irrespective of feedstock types due to a rise
    in the production of volatiles (Verheijen et al. 2010). Bikbulatova et al. (2018)
    observed that freezable free water decreased from 58 to 21% in peanut shell BC,
    and from 64 to 34% in palm kernel shell BC pyrolyzed at 800 °C with increasing
    gasification conversion from 28 to 75% due to increased micropore volume when
    gasification conversion increased from 28 to 75%. In summary, BC applications
    generally reduce soil BD and increase porosity particularly in coarse-textured
    soils, but outcomes vary, underscoring the need for context-specific considerations
    in BC strategies. Enhanced porosity resulting from BC amendments is beneficial
    for improving water retention in soils, as will be discussed later in a different
    sub-section. This improvement is particularly vital for plants in low rainfall
    zones. The change in soil water-retention capacity has been demonstrated as a
    function of soil porosity, influenced by factors such as textures, organic matter
    content, and the specific properties of the BC utilized (Blanco-Canqui 2017; Hardie
    et al. 2014; Joseph et al. 2010; Mangrich et al. 2015. For example, dried corn
    residue BC pyrolyzed at 500 °C increased soil porosity in coarse-textured soil
    compared with fine-textured soil (Igalavithana et al. 2017). Generally, BCs contain
    high total internal porosity. Larger-sized BC particles exhibit a higher proportion
    of mesopores and macropores compared to their smaller counterparts, depending
    on the types of biomass feedstocks (Wang et al. 2019). According to Chen et al.
    (2017), smaller-sized BC particles could increase water retention due to their
    greater surface area. Conversely, larger particles (> 0.5 mm) might amplify water
    retention, particularly in drier and saturated conditions. It is noteworthy that
    small pores in BCs generally retain water for an extended duration compared to
    macropores (Blanco-Canqui 2017). Arthur and Ahmed (2017) reported 20–150% higher
    water retention with the application of rice straw—BC pyrolyzed at 550 °C in sandy
    soil due to an increased fraction of soil pores < 30 µm. Mangrich et al. (2015)
    posited that polarity and micropores constituted pivotal factors influencing the
    augmentation of soil water-holding following BC applications in their study. 3.2
    Biochar impacts on soil hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity Application of BC could
    significantly impact soil water dynamics by modifying the hydrophobic/hydrophilic
    properties of soil, based on the surface properties of BC (Kameyama et al. 2019;
    Novak et al. 2012). Soil hydrophobicity or water repellency results from non-polar
    coatings of hydrophobic organic compounds on soil and water repellent particulate
    organic matter (Doerr et al. 2000). Biochar’s water repellency is contingent on
    BC’s feedstock material, pyrolysis temperature, and the residence time of BC in
    the soil (Jeong et al. 2016; Laird et al. 2009). Biochar’s surface chemistry such
    as alkyl (C−H) functional groups can induce water repellency (Jeffery et al. 2015;
    Kinney et al. 2012). Repellency can prevent diffusion of water in soil and BC
    intrapores (Liu et al. 2017a, b) reduce infiltration of water into mineral soil
    and induce overland flow. As a result, water repellency affects crop productivity
    by influencing nutrient cycling, greenhouse gas emissions, and PAW. Laird et al.
    (2009) reviewed the effect of pyrolysis and reported hydrophobicity of fresh BC
    under low-temperature pyrolysis, which tends to develop ketones, quinones, carboxylic
    C, and aromatic compounds. The hydrophobic properties of BC are likely predominantly
    determined by the pyrolysis temperature, as it affects the quantity of surface
    carboxylic groups and surface area. While hydrophobicity occurs in BC produced
    at 300 °C, BC could lose hydrophobic property at temperatures > 500 °C due to
    the loss of hydrophobic compounds, predominantly aliphatic functional groups,
    as well as non-polar semi volatile compounds (Gray et al. 2014; Zornoza et al.
    2016). Kinney et al. (2012) reported that BCs produced from the same feedstock
    displayed hydrophobicity when pyrolyzed at 300 °C, but not when pyrolyzed at 500
    °C. Similarly, hydrophobicity decreases with decreasing particle size (Gray et
    al. 2014). Further, while freshly produced BC tends to exhibit higher hydrophobicity
    due to a lower number of polar surface functional groups, prolonged exposure to
    water and oxygen subsequent to soil application may result in a shift towards
    hydrophilic properties. This transformation occurs due to the formation of new
    carboxyl and other polar functional groups through surface oxidation (Laird et
    al. 2009). Accordingly, lower hydrophobicity for older BCs compared to fresh BCs
    has been reported in other studies due largely to an increase in O:C ratio, negative
    surface charge and CEC as the aging level intensifies (Aller et al. 2017; Mia
    et al. 2017; Ojeda et al. 2015). Biochar may lead to a decrease in repellency,
    an increase in repellency, or, in some cases, no significant effect, depending
    on soil type, BC feedstock, and pyrolysis temperature. Devereux et al. (2012)
    observed that the application of wood charcoal at a 5% rate reduced water repellency
    by five times compared to the control (classified as water repellent) in sandy
    loam soil. In contrast, Glab et al. (2016) observed a slight increase in water
    repellency. However, Villagra-Mendoza and Horn (2018) reported no clear response
    of BC on the water repellency of sandy soil, possibly due to a constrained increase
    in surface area. Glab et al. (2018) observed that amending willow BC pyrolyzed
    at 350 °C to soil supplied with organic amendments such as maize straw and sewage
    sludge reduced repellency to values below maize straw treatments (315 s). Hallin
    et al. (2015) also observed that the application of finely ground pine and spruce
    BC pyrolyzed at 700 °C at a 10% and 25% rate reduced repellency by 50% and 100%,
    respectively. This reduction could arise from water absorption into soil pores
    and a decrease in soil–water interfacial energy and an increase in the effective
    soil surface area in contact with water (Hallin et al. 2015). In summary, studies
    suggest a mixed effect of BC on water repellency. Therefore, further research
    could enhance our understanding of the mechanisms and consequences of water repellency
    in BC-amended soils. 3.3 Biochar impacts on soil hydraulic conductivity Hydraulic
    conductivity plays a pivotal role in governing infiltration, soil water retention
    in the vadose zone, and the overall dynamics of soil water recharge from rainfall
    and irrigation. Understanding of changes in K is critical for unraveling water
    flow patterns, solute and pollutant transport, and for enhancing the management
    of irrigation and drainage in BC-amended soils. The determination of K stands
    as a key input parameter in rainfall-runoff models. Several factors affect K values,
    including soil particle size distribution, intra-aggregate porosity, effective
    porosity, pore throat size, pore connectivity, pore density, surface area of grains,
    shrink-swelling, BD, degree of saturation, microbial activity, bioturbation, extrinsic
    factors such as temperature, and management practices like tillage, among others.
    By affecting many of these critical soil properties, the incorporation of BCs
    into soils has the potential to significantly alter soil K (Table 1). Table 1
    Impact of BC derived from different feedstocks and pyrolysis temperature on Ksat
    across different soils Full size table In general, the application of BCs tends
    to result in a decrease in Ksat in coarse-textured soils and an increase in fine-textured
    soils (Blanco-Canqui 2017). Reduced Ksat is likely to occur in coarse-textured
    soils when BCs fill macropore spaces between soil particles, leading to increased
    tortuosity and decreased pore diameter, particularly with BCs composed of smaller
    particles (Esmaeelnejad et al. 2017; Igalavithana et al. 2017). For example, Lim
    et al. (2016) reported a decreased Ksat in both coarse and fine sand as BC particles
    induced soil tortuosity. In certain cases, BCs may induce swelling in coarser
    soils through polar hydrogen bonding of O–H and C-O–H groups, potentially altering
    the orientation of soil particles and BD (Jacka et al. 2018). Githinji (2014)
    observed a linear decrease in Ksat with increasing application rates of peanut
    hull BC pyrolyzed at 500 °C, primarily attributed to the water repellency of organic
    matter in BC-amended soils. Also, Zhang et al. (2016) reported a gradual decline
    in Ksat in sandy soil with increasing ratios of poplar BC pyrolyzed at 550 °C,
    linked to the loss of macropores. In certain soil mixtures, Ksat decreases due
    to the internal structure and higher field capacity of BCs (Barnes et al. 2014).
    Blanco-Canqui (2017) reported a 7 to 2270% decrease in Ksat with BC applications
    to coarse-textured soils with sandy-to-sandy loam texture. Biochar applications
    may increase Ksat depending on soil type, BC rate, and BC particle size (Herath
    et al. 2013; Moutier et al. 2000; Trifunovic et al. 2018). Zhou et al. (2018)
    reported a notable 106% increase in Ksat in sandy loam soils with the application
    of maize cob BC pyrolyzed at 360 °C at 9 Mg ha−1 compared to the control. Barnes
    et al. (2014), however, observed increased Ksat in clay-rich soil but decreased
    Ksat in sandy and organic soils. Increased Ksat in fine-textured soils may occur
    due to an increase in microporosity, possibly facilitated by increased earthworm
    activities under BC application (Hardie et al. 2014). In certain cases, BC may
    initially decrease Ksat values in coarse-textured soils due to particle structure
    disruption and macropores clogging in the early stages. However, over subsequent
    wetting–drying cycles, Ksat could exhibit an increase (Villagra-Mendoza and Horn
    2018). Lim et al. (2016) found that BCs with larger particle sizes (e.g., > 1
    mm) reduced Ksat more significantly than BCs with small particles in sandy soils.
    While BCs increased Ksat in clay loam soils, higher BC rates were required for
    this effect (Lim et al. 2016). According to Blanco-Canqui (2017), a minimum BC
    rate as low as 10 Mg ha−1 is necessary to induce either an increase or decrease
    in Ksat values. A few studies have also reported limited to no effect of BCs on
    Ksat values. For example, Laird et al. (2010) observed no significant effect of
    mixed hardwood BC amendment on Ksat in fine-loamy soil, indicating that BC does
    not consistently induce changes in Ksat. In summary, BC generally results in a
    reduction in Ksat, but the effects may vary with soil types, BC feedstocks, BC
    particle size, and application rates (Table 1). It is noteworthy that BC induced
    changes in Ksat can have important implications for the irrigation management
    of agroecosystems. For example, in sandy soils, a decreased Ksat could presumably
    reduce pore water loss during droughts and alleviate soil eluviation during intense
    rainstorms (Jacka et al. 2018). Similarly, reduction in Ksat lowers soil water
    infiltration, which holds the potential to facilitate an increase in biomass production
    (Lim et al. 2016). In poorly drained soils, an increase in Ksat has positive effects
    on soil aeration. Overall, in-depth exploration of BC’s interaction with various
    soil types and its influence on Ksat is essential for improving the accuracy of
    computer models estimating soil water recharge and stormwater runoff. 3.4 Biochar
    impacts on soil infiltration Infiltration is one of the vital soil hydrological
    properties affecting soil water content, water redistribution, nutrient leaching,
    runoff, erosion, and groundwater levels (Sun et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2017a, b).
    The impact of BC on infiltration, as evidenced by multiple field and modeling
    studies, is contingent on factors including feedstock type, production temperature,
    particle size of BC, and soil type (Table 2). In a study utilizing five different
    infiltration models, the addition of mixed tree residue BC enhanced infiltration
    in loamy clay soil but decreased it in sandy soil (Wang et al. 2017a). Sun et
    al. (2018) reported a significant alteration in soil infiltration capacity with
    BC particle size, noting that sieved corn straw BC of particle size ≤ 0.25 mm,
    produced at 450 °C, improved infiltration in coastal silty loam, likely by enhancing
    pores connectivity and the density of effective pores. The application of BC to
    different soil layers (surface layer: 0–10 cm, underlying soil: 10–20 cm and plow
    layer: 0–20 cm) may yield varying effects on water infiltration and evaporation.
    Li et al. (2016) observed that applying 1% BC to the top 10 cm of soil decreased
    infiltration by 12.5% while a 4% BC application rate increased infiltration by
    10.6% compared to unamended soil. This variability could potentially be attributed
    to BC’s differential effects on soil homogeneity, structure, and water flow pathways
    at different soil layers. Table 2 Impact of BC derived from different feedstock
    and pyrolysis temperature on water infiltration for different soils and study
    types Full size table Biochar applications exhibit a dual impact on infiltration,
    with potential positive and negative outcomes dependent on BC properties and soil
    type (Table 2). Positive effects include the reduction of penetration resistance,
    surface crusting, and the enhancement of soil aggregation and macro-porosity (Bohara
    et al. 2019; Prober et al. 2014; Sandhu and Kumar 2017). For example, Bohara et
    al. (2019) reported that applying pinewood BC produced at 550 °C to a fine sandy
    loam soil at a 10% rate increased the unsaturated infiltration rate to 10.65 cm
    h−1, compared to 4.1 cm h−1 in an untreated soil, attributed to a decrease in
    BD and surface crusting. Similarly, in non-calcareous loamy sand, Abrol et al.
    (2016) observed increased infiltration rate with the application of 2% mixed woodchips
    BC produced at 620 °C as it reduced clay dispersion, surface sealing, and aggregate
    loss. Although BC addition improves water infiltration rate in the short-term,
    the increase may be transient because gradual filling of pore spaces in BC and
    their physical disintegration may lead to a reduction in infiltration rates over
    time (Novak et al. 2016). Second, BC applications could reduce infiltration by
    clogging soil voids. Wang et al. (2017a, b) reported reduced infiltration with
    tree residue BC pyrolyzed at 550 °C in aeolian sandy soils. Wei et al. (2023a,
    b) reported a decrease in infiltration rate with an increase in cotton straw BC
    amount under artificial rainfall experiments. Biochar particles are small enough
    to fill macro spaces of soil particles and alter soil hydraulic properties. They
    modify soil pore size and distribution, which has direct repercussions on percolation,
    residence time, and water flow paths (Atkinson et al. 2010). On the other hand,
    some studies reported negligible effects of BCs on infiltration. Busscher et al.
    (2010) observed no significant effect of pecan BC pyrolyzed at 700 °C on infiltration
    in a Norfolk loamy sand soil. Also, Hardie et al. (2014) observed no significant
    effect of Acacia green waste BC pyrolyzed at 550 °C on infiltration of sandy loam
    soil because of no observed change in soil porosity. Rogovska et al. (2014), however,
    observed inconsistent effects of hardwood BC produced at temperature between 500
    and 575 °C on infiltration rates of Clarion loam soil. Overall, the impact of
    BC applications on infiltration rates appears to be mixed, influenced by soil
    type, BC particle size, production temperatures, and depth of placement. Long-term
    field studies are, however, necessary to validate and refine these findings. In
    general, BC application holds the potential to improve infiltration in loamy to
    clay soils, while its effects on sandy to fine sandy loams may result in decreased
    infiltration. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for optimizing agro-ecosystem
    management, particularly with respect to the influencing factors such as irrigation
    quantity and timing. The reduction in infiltration observed in sandy and sandy
    loam soils, as facilitated by BCs, may offer benefits in minimizing leaching losses
    and maximizing nutrients bioavailability. In arid and semi-arid regions, the strategic
    utilization of BC holds promise for conserving soil water resources by enhancing
    infiltration rates. 3.5 Biochar impacts on soil thermal properties Biochars alter
    soil thermal properties, including thermal conductivity and diffusivity (Liu et
    al. 2018; Usowicz et al. 2016; Zhang et al. 2013; Zhao et al. 2016). These changes
    can impact soil evaporation losses (Bohara et al. 2019), soil WHC, and water movement.
    Generally, BCs exhibit lower thermal conductivity than soil, resulting in a reduction
    in soil thermal conductivity upon application (Zhao et al. 2016). Soil thermal
    properties are intricately linked to soil texture, BD, and soil water content
    (Liu et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2016). Zhao et al. (2016) observed strong correlations
    between soil volumetric heat capacity and soil water content (r = 0.79), soil
    thermal conductivity and soil water content (r = 0.69), and soil thermal conductivity
    and soil BD (r = 0.58). They noted a decrease in thermal conductivity with increasing
    corncob BC amendment in sandy loam soil. Bohara et al. (2019) observed lower soil
    evaporation rates under pinewood BC application compared to control plots, presumably
    due to the development of aggregates and soil pores. Also, the color of BCs, dependent
    on feedstock types and production conditions, contributed to higher thermal absorbance.
    The general tendency of BCs to reduce BD, coupled with their poor thermal diffusivity,
    leads to lower thermal conductivity in soils (Zhao et al. 2016). Zhao et al. (2016)
    reported that aromatic compounds formation, induced by BCs produced at temperatures
    below 500 °C, can lead to water repellency, potentially lowering WHC and, consequently,
    thermal conductivity. Biochar may also indirectly impact soil thermal conductivity
    and soil WHC by influencing enzymatic activity, habitat, soil microstructure,
    and nutrient bioavailability crucial to soil microorganisms. Overall, the effect
    of BC on soil thermal conductivity is a function of interactions and changes in
    soil BD, soil WHC, and soil thermal diffusivity. Certain studies suggest that
    BC can alter soil albedo and heat fluxes, influencing soil moisture, surface energy
    balance, global radiative forcing, and climatic feedback (Genesio et al. 2012;
    Verheijen et al. 2013). Two critical factors affecting soil albedo are soil color
    and soil moisture content. Biochar may darken soil color based on several factors,
    including initial soil color, BC color, application rate, surface roughness, and
    soil water retention characteristics (Verheijen et al. 2010). Therefore, in bare
    soil, BC amendments could potentially reduce albedo. Lower albedo generally means
    higher soil temperature, and vice versa. Global energy balance models indicate
    that applying BC at 120 t ha−1 to global croplands could reduce the negative radiative
    forcing of farmlands by 5% (Verheijen et al. 2013), suggesting the climate change
    mitigation potential of BCs. The soil albedo may decrease with increasing BC rates,
    dependent on soil water content (Usowicz et al. 2016). However, Genesio et al.
    (2012) observed no significant difference in albedo as BC rates increased from
    30 to 60 t ha−1. While there are opportunities to mitigate albedo effects of BC
    through soil management practices like deep tillage and incorporation into the
    topsoil, it is crucial to acknowledge that such management regimes could exacerbate
    water loss, nutrient leaching, and carbon mineralization and emissions. 3.6 Biochar
    impacts on soil water holding capacity The impact of BC on soil WHC exhibits variability,
    ranging from short-term to long-term effects, depending on BC properties and soil
    types. Many researchers have consistently reported an increase in soil WHC following
    BC applications (Table 3) in multiple field-based studies (Karhu et al. 2011;
    Liang et al. 2014) and laboratory investigations (Bohara et al. 2019; Duong et
    al. 2017; Igalavithana et al. 2017; Jones et al. 2010). Biochar has been documented
    to increase soil WHC at a rate of as high as 4 Mg ha−1 (de Sousa Lima et al. 2018).
    However, some studies indicate improvements in WHC only at higher BC rates, reaching
    20 Mg ha−1 or beyond (Amoakwah et al. 2017; Siltecho et al. 2022). This increase
    in WHC is primarily governed by two mechanisms, as discussed earlier: (i) an increase
    in soil-specific surface area and (ii) an increase in soil porosity. Further,
    the water retention capacity of the soil is influenced by the soil texture, the
    type of feedstock, and the rate of BC applications (Dugan et al. 2010; Gunal et
    al. 2018). In a recent meta-analysis by Wei et al. (2023a, b), the assessment
    of BC''s impact on soil water retention across various textures revealed a notably
    greater influence on field capacity (23.8%) and available water capacity (25.6%)
    in coarse-textured soils compared to medium (5%, 20.9%) and fine (7.2%, 11%) textured
    soils, emphasizing the textural dependency of BC effects. In an organically managed
    farm, Karhu et al. (2011) showed that 9 Mg ha−1 BC application, a by-product of
    birch produced at 400 °C, increased soil WHC by 11% compared to control plots
    in the same application year. Indeed, BC application could increase soil WHC by
    reducing BD (Githinji 2014; Novak et al. 2016; Usowicz et al. 2016), increasing
    porosity (Abel et al. 2013; Gamage et al. 2016; Obia et al. 2016), increasing
    surface area (Laird et al. 2010), and promoting soil aggregation (Blanco-canqui
    et al. 2020; Herath et al. 2013), especially in coarse-textured soils. Table 3
    Impact of BC derived from different feedstocks and pyrolysis temperature on WHC
    across different soils Full size table A few studies also demonstrate the positive
    effects of BC on WHC in fine-textured soils. For example, bamboo-derived BC pyrolyzed
    at 600 °C exhibited an increased water retention capacity in low plastic clay
    soil, potentially attributed to an increase in smaller pores (Yadav and Bag 2023).
    Additionally, some studies have shown that a BC-mediated increase in WHC can positively
    influence soil functions and crop productivity (Bohara et al. 2019; Glab et al.
    2018; Liu et al. 2016). According to Bohara et al. (2019), an increased soil WHC
    leads to a reduction in water stress and a subsequent decrease in irrigation water
    requirement by lowering evaporation loss during surface irrigation. These factors
    collectively contribute to an increase in plant available water and crop yield
    (Jeffery et al. 2011). Generally, BCs may potentially increase PAW (Table 4) and
    crop yields in soils characterized by low WHC, such as sandy to loamy sand soils
    (Obia et al. 2016). For example, Aller et al. (2017) reported an increase in PAW
    and soil water retention with fresh BC produced from corn stover, switchgrass,
    soybean, and hardwoods at temperatures ranging from 500–600 °C in sandy loam soil.
    The impact of BC on PAW varies depending on whether it is applied as a single
    treatment or through reapplication. In the silty loam soils of Slovakia, a single
    application of 10 t ha−1 and 20 t ha−1 of BC, derived from cereal husks and paper
    fiber sludge at a pyrolysis temperature of 550 °C, led to improvements of 8–51%
    and 18–21%, respectively, while reapplication further enhanced PAW by 18–34% (10
    t ha−1) and 19–31% (20 t ha−1) (Tokova et al. 2023). Table 4 Impact of BC derived
    from different feedstocks and pyrolysis temperature on PAW across different soils
    and study types Full size table The impact of BC on PAW is a function of BC''s
    particle size, shape, and internal structure. Finer particles of BC may mix more
    effectively with the soil than coarser particles, positively impacting soil pore
    size distribution and PAW. Liao and Thomas (2019) demonstrated a substantial increase
    in water retention capacity (91–258%) with sieved sugar maple wood BC in comparison
    to ground BC of equivalent particle size. This enhancement was attributed to the
    elongated particles of the sieved BC, leading to an augmentation of soil interpore
    volume. A study by Liu et al. (2017a, b) on the effect of mesquite BC pyrolyzed
    at 400 °C on soil water retention curves indicated that particle size modifies
    inter-pores and adds intra-pores to alter soil water content. Pores within BC
    (intra-pores) control water retention at lower suctions, increasing field capacity,
    permanent wilting point, and PAW for medium and coarse BC-sand media. Additionally,
    inter-pores regulate water retention at higher suctions in fine BC-sand media
    (Liu et al. 2017a, b). Therefore, BC-induced changes in WHC and PAW are often
    associated with BC properties, pore morphology and distribution, and soil aggregation
    (Mukherjee and Lal 2013). The physical characteristics of BCs often serve as prime
    factors controlling WHC in diverse soils. As a result, soil WHC depends on the
    type of material used to produce BC and the conditions applied for pyrolysis.
    Water absorption rates increase with prolonged BC gasification conversion times
    under high-temperature pyrolysis, such as in the case of peanut shell and palm
    kernel shell BC pyrolyzed at 900 °C, possibly due to higher pore volume (Bikbulatova
    et al. 2018). The internal porosity of BC and grain-to-grain interaction frequently
    contribute to an increase in WHC (Barnes et al. 2014). Further, certain additive
    compounds during the pyrolysis process could enhance the porosity and WHC of the
    resulting BC. Mohamed et al. (2016) observed increased porosity (micropore volume
    increased by > 1400%) and, consequently, higher WHC with switchgrass BC. Also,
    water retention increases with oxidation of the BC surface. In a microcosms study,
    Suliman et al. (2017) used the molarity of ethanol droplet test and reported higher
    hydrophilicity in BC produced from pine wood at high-temperature pyrolysis (600
    °C) compared to pine bark BC produced at low temperature (350 °C). The particle
    size of the BC can significantly affect WHC, influencing surface area and exposure
    of internal pore space. Liao and Thomas (2019) reported maple wood BC produced
    at 363−374 °C with particle size of 0.06 mm to 0.5 mm exhibited 91 to 258% higher
    WHC compared to BC with a particle size of 2 mm to 4 mm. Porosity and surface
    area remain pivotal controlling factors in determining soil WHC but additional
    factors such as CEC and negative zeta potential also contribute to enhancing the
    soil WHC (Batista et al. 2018). The diverse surface functional groups of BCs are
    influenced by the feedstock used and production conditions, exerting a significant
    impact on BCs’ WHC. Kinney et al. (2012) established a positive correlation between
    hydrophobicity and alkyl functional groups in BC. The varied functional groups
    facilitate the retention of nutrient and water on BC surfaces. Biochars are characterized
    by a predominant aromatic C structure, encompassing both aromatic (amorphous phase)
    and polyaromatic rings (crystalline phase) (Brewer et al. 2014; Keiluweit et al.
    2010). The presence of polar oxygen-containing functional groups increases hydrogen
    bonding, thereby enhancing the WHC of BCs. Suliman et al. (2017) reported a positive
    relationship between total acidic functional groups and soil WHC. During pyrolysis
    and gasification at very high temperatures, the decomposition of functional groups
    may occur in biomass, potentially minimizing BCs'' interaction with water (Bikbulatova
    et al. 2018). Understanding these intricate relationships between BC properties
    and WHC is crucial for optimizing soil management practices and enhancing water
    retention in agricultural systems. Additionally, management factors, such as the
    depth and method of BC applications, also play a crucial role in affecting soil
    WHC. The mechanical disturbance of soil may stimulate the decomposition of BCs
    by exposing them to the surface of soil aggregates and increasing their availability
    to microorganisms (Kuzyakov et al. 2009). This process can consequently reduce
    aggregation and porosity, essential for water retention. Basso et al. (2013) observed
    that uniform surface application with topsoil mixing of BC resulted in a reduction
    of drainage loss of water and, therefore, improved water retention compared to
    deep and band application of BC. A few studies also report no significant effect
    of BC on soil water retention. In a long-term field experiment, Wang et al. (2019)
    found that BC application had no significant impact on water retention in silty
    clay loam soil after six years of management, compared to control plots. This
    lack of impact was attributed to decreased porosity resulting from the infilling
    of BC pores with smaller particles. Similarly, another field study involving Miscanthus
    BC pyrolyzed at 450 °C observed no effect of BC on loamy and sandy loam soils
    (Moragues-Saitua et al. 2017). Overall, studies indicate that BC has the potential
    to improve water retention in coarse and medium-textured soils, with minimal effect
    in fine-textured soils. This increase in water retention with BC amendment is
    particularly beneficial for minimizing water stress in non-irrigated crops under
    rainfed cultivation, especially in arid and semi-arid regions (Herath et al. 2013).
    4 Research gaps and opportunities While the application of BC has demonstrated
    significant benefits for soil health and sustainability, challenges associated
    with large-scale production and agricultural utilization pose potential impediments.
    The scale-up of BC production and its incorporation into agriculture can be hindered
    by the considerable time and cost involved. Additionally, transportation costs
    associated with moving biomass to pyrolysis facilities and distributing end products
    to farmland present logistical challenges. The pyrolysis process, integral to
    BC production, has the potential to generate harmful chemicals such as polycyclic
    aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), cresols, xylenols, and acrolein ash. The impact of
    these by-products on public health and soil ecosystems necessitates thorough investigation.
    Furthermore, the use of heavy machinery for BC application or the utilization
    of finer BC may induce soil compactions, thereby altering infiltration rates and
    WHC. This emphasizes the need for a comprehensive understanding of the potential
    field impacts of different BCs to optimize water use efficiency and prevent degradation
    of croplands. Overall, there are several research gaps that need to be addressed
    by future research to improve our understanding of soil water dynamics in BC-amended
    soils. (i) The majority of studies examined in the review are laboratory-based,
    with only a limited number of field studies available, and these tend to be predominantly
    short-term (1–2 years). Also, several inconsistent results are evident between
    field and laboratory studies, arising from variations in soil properties and environmental
    conditions (Edeh et al. 2020). Therefore, there is a critical need for further
    long-term field-based investigations spanning diverse management regimes, soils,
    and pedoclimatic conditions to comprehensively understand the behavior and effects
    of BC on water dynamics. Long-term studies should extend their focus beyond near-surface
    soil properties, delving into deeper layers, while also investigating the differential
    effects of single versus multiple applications on soil hydrological properties.
    Additionally, large-scale applications of BC require careful consideration to
    minimize disturbance to both soil physical properties and biota. Environmental
    aspects like surface runoff and nutrient leaching to groundwater should also be
    considered. Overall, the potential enhancements in soil water dynamics through
    BC amendment offer promising opportunities to reduce irrigational water use in
    agricultural systems and to revitalize or rehabilitate degraded croplands. (ii)
    A comprehensive understanding of how BC impacts soil water availability necessitates
    a deeper exploration of field capacity and wilting point dynamics. Unfortunately,
    limited long-term studies addressing these soil quality indicators and/or water
    characteristics impede our ability to unravel the intricate mechanisms governing
    BC''s influence on soil water availability for optimal plant water use (Razzaghi
    et al. 2020), highlighting the need for additional scientific inquiry in this
    crucial domain. Advanced tools such as stable water isotopes (18O and 2H) and
    drones with multispectral, hyperspectral, or thermal remote sensing enable precise
    assessment of crop water status and soil water distribution, offering valuable
    insights into field-scale responses to BC amendments (Acharya et al. 2021; Fischer
    et al. 2019). (iii) The dynamic impact of BC on soil properties is likely attributed
    to variations in size, intra-porosity, and hydrophobicity. Currently, the available
    research is inadequate to comprehensively elucidate how water retention modifies
    the fate of BC within the vadose zone and its interaction at the plant-soil interface
    across varying temporal and spatial scales (Lehmann et al. 2011). Also, there
    is a notable gap in understanding the interplay between water and BC, as well
    as the influence of BC structure on WHC. Therefore, it is imperative to undertake
    additional studies focusing on the mechanisms governing water retention in BC-amended
    soils. Similarly, the temporal evolution of BC properties during aging necessitates
    long-term field studies to elucidate how BC properties change after a single BC
    application and how this transformation influences soil water dynamics (Edeh et
    al. 2020). (iv) Research on the interactions between BC and microorganisms in
    soils has predominantly centered around small-scale laboratory incubation and
    greenhouse pot experiments. There is a compelling need to shift focus towards
    large-scale field trials (Palansooriya et al. 2019). The interrelationship between
    WHC and the microbial community under BC applications is not well-understood.
    Future research should aim to unveil and address the potential effects of soil
    microorganism activity, abundance, and diversity on WHC. (v) While BCs increase
    PAW and WHC due to an increased specific surface area and increased volume of
    mesopores and macropores, in some cases, BCs become hydrophobic. More studies
    on water repellency at the molecular level, encompassing a range of BC and soil
    types, are necessary. (vi) The importance of soil water dynamics in BC-amended
    soils under future climate change, and their interconnections with plant water
    use, irrigation management, tillage systems, and crop rotation deserves considerable
    attention. 5 Summary Agricultural water demand for on-farm irrigation is on the
    rise, driven by the expansion of arable land and changes in global, regional,
    and localized hydrological cycles. Therefore, management practices that improve
    irrigation water-use efficiency, soil water retention, and crop productivity are
    essential. Biochar, as a soil amendment, holds the potential to significantly
    influence soil water dynamics, and the magnitude of these impacts is dependent
    on factors such as feedstock, pyrolysis temperature, and soil type. Biochar application
    generally increases porosity, soil water retention, and PAW, but reduces Ksat
    in coarse-textured soils such as sand, loamy sand, and sandy loams. Biochar amendment
    may increase infiltration in clay loam soils and decrease infiltration in sandy
    loam soils. Biochars appear to have a mixed effect on soil water repellency, although
    studies are very few. Overall, the positive impact of BC on soil functions, particularly
    soil water dynamics, bears significant implications for irrigation and nutrient
    management in agricultural systems. There is a critical need for more long-term,
    field-based studies encompassing diverse management regimes, pedoclimates, and
    soil types to better inform the effects of different kinds of BC on soil hydrology.
    Additionally, the impact of BC on soil thermal properties warrants further investigation.
    Overall, BC applications should be more targeted, accounting for the specific
    characteristics of sites, soil types, and BC properties. Data availability No

  description: 'Climate change, characterized by rising temperatures and limited precipitation,
    has intensified the demand for irrigation water while simultaneously restricting
    its availability. This challenge poses significant risks to agricultural and food
    production, particularly in the Mediterranean regions where, recently, water deficits
    have led to substantial production losses and quality issues. Water is a critical
    determinant of crops'' economic viability, especially for water-intensive crops,
    making it essential to estimate its economic relevance, especially in the absence
    of reliable water market prices. This study has two primary objectives: first,
    to evaluate the shadow price of irrigation water for maize grain at the farm level,
    which is defined as the value generated by the marginal unit of water consumed;
    and second, to analyse its heterogeneity. Leveraging a Farm Accountancy Data Network
    (FADN) panel of 1625 Italian farms over a decade (2010–2020), an econometric production
    function approach is employed. Moreover, quantile regressions reveal variations
    in the shadow price linked to geographical, managerial, and structural farm characteristics.
    Our findings underscore water''s key role in economically viable maize grain production,
    significantly enhancing the productivity of other inputs like fertilizers and
    pesticides. The average shadow price is 0.29 €/m³, with a median of 0.20 €/m³
    and water total productivity accounts for one-third of maize''s average gross
    output. Quantile regressions uncover how factors like geographic location, altitude,
    farm management, irrigation water source, and farm size influence the distribution
    of water productivity, reflecting either efficient use or scarcity of this resource.
    Our estimation provides valuable insights for policymakers by offering accurate
    shadow price estimates for irrigation water in Italian maize grain production.
    Furthermore, it enhances our understanding of irrigation water''s role in the
    economic viability of this crop, while contributing to support evidence-based
    water management strategies, identifying vulnerable areas and farms and allowing
    for future methodological developments.'

    analyse its heterogeneity. Leveraging a Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) panel
    of 1625 Italian farms over a decade (2010–2020), an econometric production function
    approach is employed. Moreover, quantile regressions reveal variations in the
    shadow price linked to geographical, managerial, and structural farm characteristics.
    Our findings underscore water’s key role in economically viable maize grain production,
    significantly enhancing the productivity of other inputs like fertilizers and
    pesticides. The average shadow price is 0.29 €/m³, with a median of 0.20 €/m³
    and water total productivity accounts for one-third of maize’s average gross output.
    Quantile regressions uncover how factors like geographic location, altitude, farm
    management, irrigation water source, and farm size influence the distribution
    of water productivity, reflecting either efficient use or scarcity of this resource.
    Our estimation provides valuable insights for policymakers by offering accurate
    shadow price estimates for irrigation water in Italian maize grain production.
    Furthermore, it enhances our understanding of irrigation water’s role in the economic
    viability of this crop, while contributing to support evidence-based water management
    strategies, identifying vulnerable areas and farms and allowing for future methodological
    developments. Previous article in issue Next article in issue JEL classification

    1. Introduction Water is necessary for human existence and a key input for several
    economic activities, including agriculture, which is crucial for the global food
    supply (Damania et al., 2020). Population growth, urbanization, and the growing
    demand for food make water an increasingly scarce resource in several areas of
    the world. In addition, climate change makes adverse weather events more violent,
    frequent, and less predictable. This is also true for drought, a threat now spreading
    to areas that do not usually face precipitation constraints or extremely high
    temperatures (FAO, 2022). Moreover, water is primarily allocated to industrial
    and civilian uses in the case of water shortages, leading to losses in irrigated
    crop yields and revenues. However, the rising temperatures and increasing scarcity
    of precipitation have led to a greater demand for irrigation water, often making
    groundwater recharge insufficient to counterbalance extractions (Wada et al.,
    2010). In this scenario, agriculture accounts for 72% of global water extractions
    and represents 70% of extractions in Mediterranean areas (Berbel et al., 2019,
    FAO, 2022). Policies and institutions have failed to face these human and economic
    implications in the past, and even today, water management policies are struggling
    to address this complex scenario.1 In recent decades, the European Union has attempted
    to promote the rational use of water resources among its Member Countries. One
    of the fundamental approaches used in this regard has been the adoption of the
    Water Framework Directive (WFD) (European Commission, 2000), which aims to encourage
    efficient water use through economic incentives such as Full Cost Recovery (FCR)2
    and the “polluter pays” principle. In 2015, Italy took a step further by introducing
    mandatory measurements and estimations for irrigation volumes and environmental
    and resource-related costs associated with such activities (D.M., 31 luglio 2015).
    However, the number of countries in which water pricing meets the requirements
    set out by the WFD remains relatively low, with most countries, including Italy,
    failing to fully comply with these principles (Zucaro, 2014). In fact, in certain
    areas, especially where volumetric tariffs are not applied and where metering
    is not adopted, the quantification of irrigation volumes poses the most significant
    challenge when analysing water consumption in agriculture. Giannoccaro et al.
    (2020) highlighted that in Italy, defining access rights to groundwater withdrawals
    and managing asymmetric information and free riding is a complex matter. Introducing
    pricing mechanisms and FCR measures, as highlighted by Berbel et al. (2019) and
    Galioto et al. (2017), is also an ambitious objective that requires the knowledge
    of water’s economic value as well as environmental and related service costs (Gómez-limón
    and Martin-Ortega, 2013). In addition, recently, the European Green Deal and Farm
    to Fork Strategy (European Commission, 2019)have further emphasized the need for
    natural resource preservation, leading to the new Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)
    design which, among many other goals, aims to help the WFD reach its objectives.3
    Considering the urgent need for sustainable water resource management, driven
    by policies aimed at preserving natural resources and by climate change threats,
    such as rising temperatures and reduced water availability, the estimation of
    water economic value and productivity arises as a powerful tool to thoroughly
    understand the key economic aspects of water use. However, the estimation of water
    economic value is particularly difficult when market prices are absent or distorted
    and, in such circumstances, it is primarily feasible using simulated market or
    “shadow prices” (Young, 2005). Several definitions of water shadow prices exist
    in the literature (He et al., 2007): For irrigation water, they can be either
    based on the value of water alternative use (e.g., different users or different
    time) or farmer’s behavior. In this study, we consider the latter circumstance,
    in which the economic mechanism behind water consumption is based on two main
    assumptions: farmers are price takers (for outputs and inputs) and profit maximizers.
    Thus, they will use water up to the point where its price will be equal to the
    added value derived from using a marginal unit of this input (Williams et al.,
    2017). Bierkens et al. (2019), following this approach, stated that water shadow
    price denotes the value of crops produced per marginal unit of water consumed,
    given the quantity of other inputs. Therefore, estimating the shadow price is
    crucial for the optimal allocation of scarce water resources and the efficient
    functioning of water markets. Under these assumptions, this study aims to assess
    the relevance of irrigation water in agricultural production. Specifically, it
    seeks to estimate the irrigation water shadow price for maize grain production
    at the farm level leveraging data from a sample of 1625 farms over Italy spanning
    from 2010 to 2020. Maize grain was selected as the focal crop due to its economic
    importance among irrigated crops and its vulnerability to market volatility and
    climate change threats. Italy, ranking as the fourth-largest maize producer in
    the European Union (Erenstein et al., 2022), relies heavily on maize in various
    supply chains, including Parmigiano Reggiano production, where silage fodder as
    feed is prohibited (Mantovi et al., 2015). Nonetheless, water deficits have forced
    many parts of Italy to rationalize or suspend irrigation water, resulting in yield
    losses and concerns related to crop quality (CREA, 2021). Moreover, this situation
    could worsen due to the increasing occurrence of extreme weather events, e.g.,
    water scarcity (IPCC, 2019, Rosenzweig et al., 2014), especially in Mediterranean
    countries (Hristov et al., 2020, Lionello and Scarascia, 2018), including Italy
    (Mereu et al., 2021). Several methods have been proposed to estimate water shadow
    price, most of which rely on production functions (Johansson et al., 2002). This
    strand of literature mainly focuses on estimating the irrigation water shadow
    price for river basins (Garciá Suárez et al., 2019, Koundouri et al., 2014, Mesa-Jurado
    et al., 2010, Williams et al., 2017) or at the national scale (Kiani and Abbasi,
    2012, Takatsuka et al., 2018, Veninga, 2017), and it rarely uses detailed microeconomic
    data to estimate shadow prices for irrigation water at the farm scale (Mesa-Jurado
    et al., 2010, Koundouri et al., 2014). While previous studies have already estimated
    irrigation water shadow prices for various crops at the Country or River Basin
    level, this study contributes to the existing literature by focusing on maize
    grain production in Italy at the farm level. An econometric production function
    approach coupled with detailed microeconomic data spanning a decade was adopted
    to derive reliable estimates. Furthermore, quantile regression was implemented
    to better understand the factors influencing water irrigation shadow prices among
    farms. By providing accurate and up-to-date estimates of water shadow price and
    its variability, this study can help suggest evidence-based water management strategies
    and identify vulnerable areas or clusters of farms that may be particularly vulnerable
    to water-related challenges. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 briefly
    overviews water shadow price definitions and estimation methods. Section 3 describes
    data and methodology specifying the econometric models, production function form,
    and shadow price estimation procedure. Section 4 presents econometric estimates
    and the obtained results. Section 5 discusses the implications of these results.
    Finally, conclusions are provided in Section 6. 2. Shadow prices of irrigation
    water: a brief overview The variety of theoretical frameworks in approaching the
    estimation of shadow prices of irrigation water is associated to multiple definitions,
    each contingent on different underlying economic mechanisms such as the value
    of alternative use or farmer behavior (He et al., 2007) and relying on different
    methodologies. While this section does not intend to be an exhaustive overview,
    it does offer a brief overview that addresses some theoretical and methodological
    issues in the analysis of irrigation water shadow prices. 2.1. Definitions and
    assumptions Among the various definitions, Bierkens et al. (2019) use the following
    definition: “The shadow price of water reflects the value of crops that can be
    produced by the marginal unit of water consumed, given the quantity of the other
    inputs.” This definition is based on the assumption that farmers are price takers
    (for outputs and inputs) and profit maximisers; as rational agents, farmers use
    water up to the point where its price equals the added value derived from using
    a marginal unit of this input (Williams et al., 2017). While this definition provides
    a snapshot of the actual irrigation water economic value at the farm level, it
    has several advantages as well as limitations. One of its main advantages is that
    it allows one to precisely pinpoint the maximum price a farmer would be willing
    to pay for the last unit of irrigation water used, thus making it particularly
    relevant for short-term policy considerations. It provides a practical framework
    for assessing irrigation water productivity, which is essential for farmers who
    operate under stringent budget constraints and face immediate production decisions.
    On the flip side, this definition intentionally sidesteps some complexities. Unlike
    more comprehensive approaches like those by Young and Loomis (2014), it does not
    incorporate broader environmental or opportunity costs, nor does it explicitly
    consider the temporal aspect of irrigation water allocation (Elnaboulsi, 2001,
    Young and Loomis, 2014). Indeed, this study follows the aforementioned definition,
    without delving into long-term environmental externalities, the value of water
    in alternative uses, or the intertemporal efficiency or opportunity costs that
    may emerge in longer-term scenarios. In this specific context and under these
    assumptions, the shadow price aligns with the marginal value (He et al., 2007,
    Wang and Lall, 2002). Limitations can be seen as calculated, as a narrower perspective
    is common because farmers often prioritize maximizing their current profits and
    may not account for the availability of water in the future when making decisions.
    We assume, then, that farmers aim to maximize their current net returns and that
    the shadow price is determined through free competition among them. 2.2. Methodologies
    and limitations Several methods exist to estimate the shadow price of irrigation
    water. According to Young (2005), there are two main methods: deductive and inductive.
    Deductive methods use logical processes and rely on economic postulates, such
    as profit and utility maximization, whereas inductive methods rely mainly on econometrics
    and statistics. Among deductive methods, the most popular are the Residual Value
    Method (RVM) (Berbel et al., 2011, Hellegers and Davidson, 2010, Ziolkowska, 2015),
    General Equilibrium Models (GEM) (Jiang et al., 2014, Smith et al., 2015) and
    Mathematical Programming (MP) (Liu and Chen, 2008, Rosegrant et al., 2000). Under
    RVM, it is assumed that all inputs except for water are priced at market rate.
    The price of irrigation water is then calculated as the ratio between the net
    returns from crop production and the total quantity of water used for irrigation.
    As for MP, this method derives the optimal allocation of resources, including
    water, based on objective functions such as profit maximization or cost minimization.4
    For analyzing the broader, economy-wide implications of changes in water use and
    availability, General Equilibrium Models are often preferred (Jiang et al., 2014,
    Smith et al., 2015). However, the aforementioned methods have several limitations.
    RVM, upon which most deductive methods are based, estimates water value by deducting
    costs from predicted revenues. It requires the assumption that all markets are
    perfectly competitive, with the exception of the water market. Additionally, this
    method requires a thorough estimation of input costs, which can be challenging
    when dealing with inputs that are not priced on markets—for example, assets owned
    by the firm like land and machinery. Under these circumstances, a certain degree
    of uncertainty is inevitable, and omitting or misrepresenting some input costs
    will inevitably lead to an overestimation of water value. Similarly, both MP and
    GEM, rely heavily on theoretical assumptions and may oversimplify complex economic
    relationships. Inductive procedures include econometric estimations of the production
    function or water demand (Bruno and Jessoe, 2021, de Bonviller et al., 2020, Scheierling
    et al., 2006), Hedonic Pricing, Contingent Valuation (Calatrava and Garrido, 2005,
    Li et al., 2021), Choice Experiments (Rigby et al., 2010), Stochastic Frontier
    Analysis (SFA) (Coelli and Orion, 2013; P. Koundouri et al., 2014a) and Data Envelopment
    Analysis (DEA), or a combination of both (Shen and Lin, 2017). Inductive methods
    are more reliable when data are available. Given an accurate specification of
    the production function that captures the relationship between water and production,
    these estimates can provide a reliable assessment of shadow prices using experimental
    (field experiments) or observational (primary or secondary) data (Mesa-Jurado
    et al., 2010).5 Among its various applications, Njuki and Bravo-Ureta (2019) employed
    a Cobb-Douglas stochastic production function to determine the shadow price of
    irrigation water in the US. In a similar vein, Bopp et al. (2022) applied this
    method to Chilean wine grape production, Conradie et al. (2006) to South African
    vineyards, and Coelli and Orion (2013) to wine grape production in Eastern Australia.
    More recently, Nouri-Khajebelagh et al. (2021) estimated the average water shadow
    price for various crops in Iran. In different contexts, Bellver-Domingo et al.
    (2019) derived the irrigation water shadow price by analyzing the avoided environmental
    cost through water desalination using distance function estimation. Irrigation
    water shadow price estimates based on distance functions were also used by Riera
    and Brümmer (2022) in Argentina, by Koundouri et al. (2014b) and Koundouri et
    al. (2014a) in Greece and by Li et al. (2019) in the Beijing- Tianjin-Hebei city
    region in China. Bierkens et al. (2019) utilized macro data and a Cobb-Douglas
    production function to estimate the irrigation water shadow price for various
    crops in 11 countries, including Italy. Similar studies have been conducted to
    estimate green water economic value in the Czech Republic (Grammatikopoulou et
    al., 2020) and South Florida (Takatsuka et al., 2018). Veninga (2017) applied
    a translog production function to calculate irrigation water shadow prices for
    maize, sugarcane, and citrus in twelve countries, among them, Italy, where groundwater
    extraction is the primary water source. Garciá Suárez et al. (2019) assessed the
    impact of increased irrigation volumes on the total biomass yield in the High
    Plains River Basin, US. A table concisely summarizing key features of some relevant
    studies using the production function approach is available in Appendix (Table
    A1).6 While previous studies have mainly focused on estimating the economic value
    of irrigation water for crops at the country or river basin scale using secondary
    or primary macro data, our study estimates the water irrigation shadow prices
    for Italy using detailed microeconomic data, which offers two significant advantages.
    Firstly, using farm-level accurate and reliable data over 10 years enhances the
    accuracy of the shadow price estimates. Secondly, by estimating the shadow prices
    at the farm level, we can identify the circumstances or areas in which irrigation
    water productivity is most affected by water scarcity or efficiency. This approach
    aids in better resource allocation and identification of vulnerable farms or territories.
    Furthermore, a better understanding of the factors affecting shadow prices at
    the farm level could aid in the development of more effective strategies and interventions
    for water management. 3. Materials and methods 3.1. Data This study focuses on
    Italian maize grain farms, leveraging a Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) sample
    that provides detailed information at both farm and crop levels. FADN is the only
    source of microeconomic data based on harmonized bookkeeping principles. Based
    on national surveys, it aggregates data on 68,000 farms, representing almost 5
    million EU farms, 90% of the European UAA and Standard Output. The Italian sample
    comprises 11,000 farms, whose data are stratified by region, size, and type of
    farming (TF). The data include Gross Output, land, crop-specific variable costs,
    work-related costs for families and employed workers, and irrigation water volumes.
    To ensure the homogeneity of the sample and enable accurate attribution of measured
    costs at the farm level to the specific crop (particularly work-related expenses),
    we selected an unbalanced panel of 1625 farms growing irrigated maize grain, and
    excluded those with livestock, for the period 2010–2020; a total of 5224 observations
    were analysed. Northern Italy regions (predominantly Lombardy, Piedmont, Friuli-Venezia
    Giulia, Emilia-Romagna, and Veneto) accounted for 87.3% of the sample, Central
    Italy for 11%, and the South for 1.7%. The majority of farms were family-run (67.5%),
    and corporate entities comprised only 18% of the sample. In terms of economic
    size, 48% of the observations’ Standard Production ranges from 50,000 to 100,000
    €, while 35.7% ranges from 8000 to 50,000 € and only 16.3% exceeds 100,000 €.
    Concerning water sources, a significant part of the sample relied on Water User
    Associations (WUA) infrastructures (78.1%), while the rest relied on self-supply
    irrigation. In fact, in Italy, WUA are the primary administrators of irrigation
    water and play an essential role in planning the responsible use of this resource.7
    These associations typically consist of organized groups of water users, such
    as farmers and agricultural communities who collectively manage and allocate water
    for irrigation purposes. The infrastructure associated with WUAs often includes
    a network of canals, ditches and water distribution systems that serve as conduits
    for irrigation water. These structures are designed to facilitate the distribution
    of water, involving the scheduling and coordination of water deliveries to ensure
    that each member receives their allocated share during the irrigation season,
    which typically goes from spring (March-April) to the end of the summer (September-October).
    The characteristics of irrigation across various regions of the country are shaped
    by a combination of hydrogeological, topographical, environmental, and historical
    factors and these influence both the infrastructure and the management of water
    provision. 8 Table 1 presents sample descriptive statistics for key variables
    that are utilized in the estimation of shadow prices. These variables include
    the total agricultural area measured in hectares, family and employed labor quantified
    in work units, and a range of cost factors—namely, land value, work costs, machinery,
    pesticides, and fertilizers—all expressed per hectare for the cultivation of maize
    grain. The table also includes data on the volumes of irrigation water, also denominated
    per hectare. Table 1. Descriptive statistics of the farm sample – unit of measure,

    3.2. Econometric Model Following the definition provided by Bierkens et al. (2019),
    the water shadow price has been estimated by calculating the value of maize that
    can be produced using a unit of irrigation water. From an empirical standpoint,
    the shadow price can be obtained by estimating the production function and taking
    its partial derivative of the production function concerning irrigation water.
    The production function (Eq. 1) describes the relationship between crop production
    and various marketable inputs (such as seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides), labor,
    land, and water. (1) Here, Y represents the Maize Grain Gross Output; L, land;
    W, water; F, use of fertilizers; P, use of pesticides; VC, other variable costs;
    WR, labor, and M, use of machinery. All the aforementioned quantities are expressed
    as monetary values, except for water, which is expressed in volume (m³). In addition,
    T represents average annual temperatures (°C) and R is the average annual precipitation
    (in 100 mm) at the provincial level. These variables are included to capture the
    effect of climate variability.9 For each observation, the expenditure on each
    input utilized for maize grain production was assessed in Euros (€). Land (L)
    is constructed by identifying the annual expenditure of rented land and attributing
    a return of 2% on the land value for owned land. F, P, and VC represent annual
    expenditures on maize production, with VC encompassing costs such as quality certifications,
    energy consumption, subcontracting, marketing, seed procurement, and machinery
    renting. The costs related to water supply are included in the variable VC and
    concern the fees charged by WUAs, as for the costs related to self-supply, this
    amount depends mainly on the energy cost required for pumping or transportation,
    which, in turn, is influenced by the well’s depth and pumping or distribution
    system adopted. Labor (WR) comprises both employed labor, whose cost is obtained
    from FADN Balance Sheets, and family labor, whose compensation includes an hourly
    wage reflecting the opportunity cost and a reward for the managerial work of the
    entrepreneur. M represents the owned machinery work expenditure and encompasses
    fuel, insurance, maintenance, and machine operator payments. W indicates the water
    irrigation volumes for maize grain production, covering both the farms’ self-supplied
    water services and those served by WUAs. The choice to use economic variables
    rather than quantities derives from the characteristics of the Italian FADN data.
    While this dataset provides extensive and detailed information on both individual
    farms and specific crops, it includes data on both the type of fertilizers and
    pesticide use. This results in significant heterogeneity in both the formulations
    and types of products used. While it might be possible to differentiate between
    organic and inorganic fertilizers distinguishing among various types of pesticides,
    and more importantly, various units of measurements are not always feasible. This
    could have introduced a bias in the creation of variables and, subsequently, in
    the estimation process. For this reason, in alignment with common practices in
    the literature (see, among others Latruffe et al., 2023; Zhu et al., 2012; Zhu
    and Lansink, 2010), we have chosen to use monetary values. However, we have chosen
    to differentiate between inputs rather than aggregating them into a single variable.
    This approach allows us to maintain a finer level of detail and provides more
    specific insights for each of the inputs under consideration. Table 2 lists all
    variables used in the econometric model. Table 2. Description of variables used
    in the production functions estimation. Variables UM Description Y Production

    Empirically, the production function is estimated following the Cobb-Douglas specification(Cobb
    and Douglas, 1928) : (2) Where represents the vector of inputs including water
    (W), and β are the estimated parameters vector reflecting input elasticities on
    production, is the intercept while e is the error component. This equation can
    be rewritten as Eq. 3 for estimation purposes: (3) Vector β includes a specific
    parameter related to water elasticity, (Eq. 4): (4) Eq. 2 can be rearranged to
    derive the partial derivative of Eq. 1 with respect to the water input ( , as
    illustrated in Eq. 5: (5) The Cobb-Douglas specification assumes that all inputs
    are substitutes, and the elasticity of substitution between inputs is constant.
    This limitation can be overcome through a translog specification of the production
    function. The latter provides a more flexible range of substitution options than
    those limited by the constant elasticity of substitution assumed in the Cobb-Douglas
    function. The translog production function is expressed as follows: (6) Where
    represents the vector of inputs including water (W); β, estimated parameters vector;
    , intercept; and e, error component. As before, β includes a specific parameter
    related to water elasticity, (Eq. 6). The marginal productivity of irrigation
    water is expressed as the partial derivative of Eq. 5 with respect to the water
    input ( , as in Eq. 7: (7) Where all the variables are the same as in Eq. 6. In
    both Cobb-Douglas and translog specifications, in order to account for environmental
    factors characterizing the varying context of each farm over time, we included
    average temperature and precipitation at the provincial level per year. By following
    Coelli et al., (1999) and Rahman et al., (2009) we assume that the environmental
    factors, enter in the production function linearly.10 The constant term was augmented
    to: (8) With and are parameters that quantify the influence of average annual
    temperature and precipitation, respectively on agricultural production, providing
    a more comprehensive and nuanced analysis. From an empirical perspective, a weighted
    fixed-effects specification was estimated. Several methodological issues emerge
    when elasticities and Total Factor Productivity (TFP) are estimated using traditional
    methods such as OLS. This is because productivity and input choices are correlated,
    which causes simultaneity or endogeneity problems (Beveren, 2012, Wooldridge,
    2009). In addition, if market entry and exit are not allowed, selection bias will
    emerge. Several estimators have been proposed to address these biases, including
    those developed by Olley and Pakes (1996) and Levinsohn and Petrin, 2003, Levinsohn
    and Petrin, 2004. However, by assuming that firm-specific productivity is time-invariant,11
    it is possible to estimate production functions using a fixed-effects estimator
    (Pavcnik, 2002), as done by several studies focusing on the marginal productivity
    of irrigation water (Bierkens et al., 2017; Grammatikopoulou et al., 2020; Veninga,
    2017). Moreover, the fixed-effects estimator addresses potential sources of endogeneity
    that may arise from the exclusion of time-invariant variables in the estimates
    (Baltagi, 2008). In addition, using an unbalanced panel, we overcome the self-selection
    bias. Upon calculating shadow prices according to Eq. 7, a quantile regression
    (Koenker and Bassett, 2013) was estimated, which enabled us to identify farm characteristics
    associated with various levels or quantiles of shadow prices. (9) Qp(τ | z) =
    θ(τ) +z''γ(τ) + u(τ) Table 3 reports all the variables used in the quantile regression.
    In particular, we rely on the first and the third quartiles, τ = 25 and τ = 75,
    and on the differsence between them, Δ = Qp(25)–Qp(75), to immediately note which
    characteristics of the farm are associated with relatively low and high levels
    of shadow price, while γ(τ) parameters can be estimated by using the estimator
    described by Hunter and Lange (2000). The independent variables represent territorial,
    structural, and managerial farm characteristics. Among territorial attributes,
    we consider geographic and altimetric location while we examine farm size for
    structural factors. Lastly, regarding organizational aspects, we consider labor
    organization, specifically the proportion of family or employed labor and irrigation
    water sources. Table 3. Description of the quantile regression independent variables

    of a translog, we compared these functions using an F-test (Greene, 2002); and
    the results showed that the translog production function fitted the data significantly
    better. Moreover, as the Hausman test suggests, a fixed-effects model was employed
    rather than a random-effects specification. To the latter, year fixed effects
    have been included to control for systematic temporal variability. Table 4 presents
    the estimated parameters of the translog production function and their significance
    levels. The estimated parameters for the Cobb-Douglas model are presented in the
    Appendix (see Table A2), alongside the parameters for the translog model without

    the linear parameter of irrigation water was significant, revealing its role in
    maize production. The coefficients further revealed the significant complementarity
    of water with fertilizers (0.027) and work (0.011). However, a negative relationship
    was observed between water and pesticides (-0.026). The coefficients associated
    with climatic variables are not statistically significant, neither for Temperatures
    nor Rainfall. This is likely because these variables, representing annual means
    at the provincial level, have their effects absorbed by the annual fixed effects.12
    After estimating the parameters, we calculated the value of water elasticity for
    gross maize output, which showed an inelastic response to irrigation water, with
    an average water elasticity of 0.08. Half of the farms in the sample showed an
    elasticity value ranging from 0.06 to 0.10. Additionally, the average water shadow
    price, calculated using Eq. 6, was found to be 0.29 €/m³, with a median of 0.20
    €/m³ (Table 5). The water shadow price for half of the farms within the sample
    ranged from 0.10 €/m³ to 0.39 €/m³. Table 5. Summary statistics of estimated water

    water for maize (i.e., the shadow price) exhibits diminishing marginal returns
    with decreasing productivity for higher volumes, as indicated by the blue line.
    On the contrary, the total water productivity (in red) showed an increasing trend,
    although at a decreasing rate. It starts higher in the initial section and decreases
    as marginal productivity decreases. The estimated water shadow price for the aforementioned
    irrigation volumes ranges from 0.02 to 0.04 €/m³. Total water productivity ranges
    between 620 and 670 €/ha, accounting for approximately one-third of the maize
    grain total gross output. Download : Download high-res image (94KB) Download :

    1 are crucial for pricing mechanisms. Assuming no adjustment of other production
    inputs, if prices exceed 0.05 €/m³, they will surpass the value of the marginal
    productivity of water. In the short term, farmers may choose to reduce irrigation
    water use, resulting in a decrease in overall production of approximately one-third,
    with potentially important consequences within the overall supply chain. While
    the above-mentioned results provide an average estimation of shadow prices and
    productivity, it is essential to note that different farms may have different
    shadow prices or productivity levels for water use. This underscores the significance
    of farm-level analysis in identifying the variability of water productivity and
    its association with farm characteristics: estimated shadow price distribution
    has been analyzed using quantile regressions to detect the influence of several
    farms’ characteristics on water irrigation economic value. The first (Q1, τ =
    25) and third quartiles (Q3, τ = 75) were considered to highlight the differences
    between low and high-water marginal productivity levels (Table 6). The model also
    highlights a negative trend, with shadow prices decreasing over time. The estimated
    parameters show significant differences between geographical areas at the Q3 level,
    with the Central Regions showing lower marginal productivity than Northern Regions
    (-0.150). The altitudinal area shows significant differences in Q1, where the
    shadow price is inversely proportional to the altitude. The Irrigation Water Source
    highlights a significant positive difference between Groundwater and WUA in Q3
    (+0.060). Concerning farm management, Family-Run farms show lower shadow prices
    than farms with Mainly Employed Labor (+0.028) or Mainly Family Labor in Q1 (+0.033),
    while farms relying on subcontracting solely on employed labor show lower shadow
    prices in Q3 (-0.143). Farm Size, instead, shows significant differences with
    increasing acreage: Medium Farms (15–40 ha), especially, show a gap with Small
    Farms (< 5 ha) equal to −0.046 and −0.153, respectively, in Q1 and Q3. Table 7

    Our analysis underscores the relevance of water irrigation for maize grain in
    Italy and shows that water is an essential input for maize production, especially
    because of its contribution to other inputs’ productivity. Both Cobb-Douglas and
    translog-derived elasticities showed low values, implying that maize grain production
    response to water was rigid on average. However, translog estimation allowed the
    detection of synergies between water and other inputs, highlighting the mutual
    dependence between water and fertilizers, which can enhance the contribution of
    both inputs to maize grain production (Hernández et al., 2015, Sadras, 2005, Zhou
    and Turvey, 2014). The same phenomenon occurs for water and work, suggesting the
    importance of water in more intensive production systems. Conversely, the negative
    relationship between water and pesticides suggests a positive contribution of
    water to maize grain quality and a reduction in sanitary risks (Medina et al.,
    2015, Wu et al., 2010). Lastly, the climate variables demonstrate no significant
    contribution. This finding aligns with Di Paolo and Rinaldi''s (2008) observation
    that in Mediterranean regions, rainfall alone may not substantially impact maize
    grain production without supplemental irrigation water.13 The estimation of the
    water shadow price indicates water’s contribution to crop productivity and assesses
    its economic value. The derived estimated average value stands at 0.29 €/m³ and
    the median at 0.20 €/m³. This analysis is based on a national sample of detailed
    microeconomic data; therefore, this variability could influence the average shadow
    price. Italy is characterized by strong territorial, climatic, and pedologic heterogeneity.
    Therefore, the median value is a more robust indicator. Our results are in line
    with the water shadow price obtained by Veninga (2017), whose value ranges between
    0.19 and 0.53 $/m³ (0.18 and 0.50 €/m³) and D’Odorico et al. (2020), who estimate
    water value as the farmers’ willingness to pay (WTP) for a marginal unit of irrigation
    water and show a global average price of 0.16 $/m³ (approximately 0.15 €/ m³).
    Finally, Bierkens et al. (2019) also estimated the same average price for maize
    grain in Italy. All these works analyzed less recent data and estimated irrigation
    water shadow prices at the country scale; hence, a comparison must be made carefully.
    The same is true for studies that rely on different approaches and focus on the
    same crop. Berbel et al. (2011) estimated a shadow price of 0.07 €/m³ while Ziolkowska
    (2015) and El-Gafy and El-Ganzori (2012) estimated a value ranging between 0.004
    and 0.12 €/m³ for Texas and Kansas, respectively. Finally, de Brito and de Azevedo
    (2022) showed a higher value (0.14 $/m³) in Brazil, and Kiprop et al. (2015) estimated
    a price of 0.13 €/m³ in Kenya. The estimated water shadow price is also consistent
    with the current pricing imposed by WUAs,14 the primary organization responsible
    for the distribution of irrigation water in Italy. However, it should be noted
    that WUA tariffs mainly aim to recover water delivery and distribution costs.
    Considering the estimated shadow price as an indication of water pricing would
    be inaccurate, our price could be viewed as an estimate of water resource value,
    not accounting for water-related costs, externalities, or opportunity costs as
    WFD requires. However, any pricing imposed above the marginal productivity level
    would present a potential constraint for the producer, considering that according
    to our estimation, total water productivity accounts for one-third of the maize
    average gross output. In such a scenario, farmers would have to choose between
    reducing water usage, which could lead to a loss of production, and optimizing
    the overall production process by reducing water usage and adopting novel technologies
    in the long term.15 The results of these strategies depend on local and regional
    characteristics as well (Hatfield et al., 2011). Shadow price heterogeneity could
    reflect multiple scenarios and even water availability or efficient usage; a higher
    price reveals a water shortage or lower efficiency in water allocation, while
    a lower price reveals the opposite. Considering the first quartile (Q1), that
    is, farms not constrained by water availability, the Geographic Area does not
    show a significant difference. In contrast, the altimetric area shows that the
    water shadow price decreases with increasing altitude levels, reflecting greater
    water availability for Hill and Mountain. This result could also highlight the
    greater productivity of water in traditional maize-growing areas, such as Po Valley.
    In contrast, where water is scarce, this constraint mainly affects the most productive
    areas (Northern Italy). At the Q1 level, Farm Management shows a higher price
    for Mainly Employed Labor and Mainly Family Labor farms, revealing greater efficiency
    in Family-Run farms and Subcontracting or Only Employed Labor farms, which is
    in line with the findings of Speelman et al. (2008). Instead, at the Q3 level,
    management plays a role especially in Subcontracting or Only Employed Labor farms,
    that show a significantly lower price, likely reflecting higher efficiency in
    irrigation water management. Small farms (<5 ha) were the most vulnerable in both
    Q1 and Q3, possibly because of the greater incidence of water-related costs, making
    them more susceptible to water shortages. These results are consistent with those
    of Speelman et al. (2008) and Gadanakis et al. (2015), who found that farmers
    need to develop economies of scale to be more efficient and achieve input cost
    savings. Concerning irrigation water sources, when farmers rely on groundwater,
    the marginal productivity is lower in Q1, indicating a lower shadow price compared
    to that obtained for farms relying on WUAs infrastructure. Considering that WUAs
    impose seasonal programming and farmers must schedule irrigation volumes and shifts
    before the sowing season, this result could depend on greater flexibility in irrigation
    schemes for farms relying on groundwater. WUAs usually carefully plan the irrigation
    season and the planning process typically takes into account factors such as anticipated
    water availability, crop water requirements and historical usage patterns. These
    schedules aim to strike a balance between providing a consistent water supply
    for irrigation needs and managing water resources. However, water availability
    can be highly variable, especially in regions prone to seasonal fluctuations or
    drought conditions. When water availability becomes limited WUAs may need to implement
    restrictions on water delivery. For example, they might prioritize supplying water
    for high-value crops or essential agricultural activities. As a result, there
    may be occasions when water delivery is curtailed or restricted to ensure equitable
    distribution during periods of scarcity. However, this can also reveal lower efficiency
    and suboptimal use of water resources. The main costs incurred by self-supplied
    farms concern infrastructure, delivery, and water extraction, which translates
    to fewer constraints on resource usage (Gómez and Pérez Blanco, 2012). Where farms
    are constrained by water availability or are less efficient in this input allocation
    (Q3) the most affected farms are self-supplied farms (groundwater). The use of
    a support decision tool (smart irrigation), recycling water at the farm level,
    has been proven to have a positive effect on water efficiency at the farm scale
    (Gadanakis et al., 2015) and collective action in irrigation management (Chaudhry
    (2018), seems to improve on-farm water use efficiency. However, Wang (2010) found
    that farmers adopting well, or mixed irrigation exhibited higher water efficiency
    than those using river irrigation, probably because of greater flexibility and
    less water wastage during transportation. However, these results often depend
    on social and territorial characteristics, making comparisons inappropriate. In
    summary, small and family-run farms are the most affected by water shortages,
    especially where water is already scarce. Where water is not very scarce, improving
    the efficiency of irrigation water use in farms located on the Plain can contribute
    the most to maize productivity. Concerning water irrigation sources, it must be
    highlighted that if water is scarce, thanks to seasonal planning, WUAs can probably
    guarantee farmers a more efficient water distribution and lower risks or production
    losses. Concomitantly, groundwater allows greater flexibility when water is not
    scarce, potentially leading to the suboptimal use of this resource. However, it
    has to be reminded that Italian WUAs can follow different pricing approaches:
    Northern Regions often apply a fixed cost per year or crop, while Southern Regions
    mainly use a volumetric approach. In the latter, farmers could be pushed to search
    for alternative water sources (groundwater) to reduce water-related costs and
    compensate for water scarcity (Cortignani et al., 2018). Hence, farmers’ responses
    to water shortages should be further examined when they rely on both irrigation
    sources, to establish whether a substitution or additional effect exists between
    them. For this reason, it is crucial to analyze the economic value of water in
    detail, highlighting variations and differences across territories, areas, and
    types of farms, to develop strategies to balance the economic value of water with
    its environmental significance and to ensure sustainable water usage practices
    in agriculture (Bozzola and Swanson, 2014). 6. Conclusions The results of our
    analysis have several potential applications, including establishing the relevance,
    productivity, and economic value of irrigation water and allowing for further
    methodological development. We found that water is a crucial input for making
    maize grain economically viable, emphasizing the significant dependence of this
    crop on water, and the contribution of this resource to other inputs’ productivity.
    This is particularly significant because Italy is the fourth-largest maize grain
    producer in the EU, and Northern Regions account for 85% of the Italian maize
    agricultural area. Maize plays a strategic role in several supply chains, particularly
    in Parmigiano Reggiano production, which does not allow the use of silage fodder
    (Mantovi et al., 2015). Moreover, if imposed prices surpass the value of the marginal
    productivity of water, farmers may choose to reduce irrigation water use resulting
    in losses in overall production of approximately one-third, or to replace maize
    with rainfed crops (Aldaya et al., 2023, Sapino et al., 2022). Consequently, a
    shortage in maize production could result in greater dependence on imports and
    economic losses in several Italian agricultural sectors. Moreover, our water shadow
    price estimation can assist policymakers in partially fulfilling the requirements
    of the WFD by estimating the resource value, which assesses water relevance and
    scarcity, and by identifying vulnerable areas and clusters of farms, taking into
    account Italy’s territorial and productive heterogeneity. Additionally, our estimation
    facilitates the assessment of each input’s impact on output, allowing the distinction
    between fertilizers and pesticides. Combining these results with a Mathematical
    Programming approach could lead to the estimation of flexible models, establishing
    economic, social, and environmental impacts on farms resulting from a reduction
    in chemical input use, as required by the F2F targets (Cortignani et al., 2022).
    Importantly, it should be noted that our estimation of the water shadow price
    for irrigation neglects any other economic returns derived from the overall supply
    chain; namely, it does not include the contribution of maize to downstream or
    upstream supply chains. As such, the provided estimation only indicates the direct
    economic value of water for maize production and does not reflect the full value
    of water’s contribution to the supply chain and economy. Further, our analysis
    presumes that unobserved firm-specific water productivity does not vary over time
    and does not consider external productivity shocks that could influence the level
    of inputs used by the farmer. Moreover, our analysis does not account for intertemporal
    efficiency and opportunity costs associated with water use. In specific circumstances
    where extraction costs are notably high or where externalities have a significant
    impact, the estimated shadow price in our study may be lower than in an assessment
    that includes these considerations. These limitations should be kept in mind when
    interpreting the estimated shadow price of water. In conclusion, our estimation
    serves as a starting point for further research and analysis that incorporates
    these additional factors to establish a more accurate assessment of water’s value
    and its impact on agricultural production and supply chains. Integrating social,
    environmental, and economic factors is crucial for achieving sustainable water
    use practices that account for the total value of water as a vital resource for
    agriculture and the economy. CRediT authorship contribution statement Rebecca

    by (0) 1 Indeed, water has commonly been considered a renewable resource. However,
    at the International Conference of Water Environment in 1992, it was admitted
    that the failure to acknowledge the economic value of water has led to waste and
    inefficient use of this resource (ICWE, 1992). 2 WFD makes of FCR principle one
    of its pillars: in Article 9 it is stated that Member States must take account
    of the principle of recovery of the costs of water services, including environmental
    and resource costs in accordance with the “polluter pays” principle. This, with
    the aim to provide an adequate incentive for users to use water resources efficiently.
    This incentive had to be given through the adoption of effective economic instruments
    of pricing, and, as underlined by Gallego-Ayalal et al. (2011), volumetric pricing
    has primarily been seen as the most suitable tool, since accurate water-metering
    is considered a necessary condition to estimate appropriate costs for water usage
    in agriculture. See Berbel and Expósito (2020) for an overview on WFD water pricing
    and cost recovery. 3 In fact, the European Court of Auditors in 2021 published
    a special report stating that past CAP policies have failed to promote sustainable
    water use in agriculture (ECA Special Report 20/2021, Sustainable water use in
    agriculture: CAP funds more likely to promote greater rather than more efficient
    water use). 4 Distinct approaches are employed such as linear programming (Dayananda
    et al., 2023, Esmaeili and Shahsavari, 2015, Liu et al., 2009, Schmitz et al.,
    2013, Shi et al., 2014, Weerahewa and Dayananda, 2023), revealed preference models
    (Pérez-Blanco and Gutiérrez-Martín, 2017) and positive mathematical programming
    (Lionboui et al., 2018, Rodríguez-Flores et al., 2019). 5 Among others, Baniasadi
    et al. (2020) and Jana (2018) use several methods, including production function,
    to obtain water shadow price to monetize environmental impacts of excessive groundwater
    extraction in Iran and the use of wastewater in aquaculture. 6 Although not exhaustive,
    Table A1 in the appendix illustrates the diversity of functional forms, variables,
    and contexts used in recent irrigation water valuation research. This highlights
    the complexity and context-specific nature of the studies considered. 7 The National
    Association of Management and Protection Consortia for Land and Irrigation Waters
    (ANBI) estimates that approximately 59.47% of the national territorial surface
    is covered and managed by WUAs. 8 see Dono et al. (2019) and INEA (2011) for a
    comprehensive overview of irrigation sector in Italy. 9 The source used for climate
    data is the ISTAT database (Italian National Institute of Statistics) for the
    years 2010–2020. 10 We assume the separability of precipitation and temperature
    variables from the other production inputs in our model. This assumption is based
    on the spatial and temporal scales at which these environmental factors are measured.
    Specifically, they are calculated as annual averages at the provincial level,
    and as such, do not represent moment-to-moment variations in weather that might
    directly interact with other production inputs. Instead, these variables serve
    to characterize the broader climatic landscape or ecosystem within which the farms
    operate. In this context, they are conceptually distinct from the production inputs,
    thus justifying their separable treatment. 11 The marginal productivity of water
    is unlikely to be affected by productivity or “innovation” shocks that could affect
    the efficiency of this input in maize production over-time. 12 Excluding year-level
    fixed effects results in minor, statistically insignificant changes to the parameters,
    except for the climatic variables, which in that specification become indeed significant
    (see Table A3). 13 Rainfed maize production is not widely observed in Italy, and
    this can be attributed to the predominance of intensive production methods and
    specific climatic and soil conditions. 14 Tariffs for irrigation vary widely and
    are influenced by individual WUAs and regional regulations. In Northern Regions,
    they are based on irrigated or irrigable areas, while in Central and Southern
    regions, they depend on water volume or irrigated crops in compliance with the
    Water Framework Directive. In addition, tariffs can take various forms, including
    flat rates, volumetric rates, or tiered structures and some WUAs also impose fixed
    annual fees to cover service access and administrative costs. On average, volumetric
    rates typically range from 0.10 to 0.40 €/m³ while the cost per m3 of well water
    is highly variable due to factors like the well’s depth and operational expenses,
    making precise estimation challenging. 15 Among these, precision farming, digitalization,
    and more efficient management of water productivity are promising strategies (Hatfield
    and Dold, 2019), coupled with the adoption of soil conservation measures, such
    as the introduction of legume crops in modern cropping systems (Stagnari et al.,
    2017, Wreford and Topp, 2020). The most common crop management practices include
    crop cultivar diversification, scheduling of planting dates, early maturing crops,
    drought-tolerant cultivars, and crop rotation (Dono et al., 2016, Pais et al.,

    score matching (PSM)approachPeninsular India 1. Introduction Rice is a staple
    food for more than half of the world''s population [1]. South Asian countries
    produce and consume almost 90% of the world''s rice, which amounts to 678.7 million
    tons, according to the FAO in 2018 and the GRSP in 2013 [2,3]. India is the second-largest
    producer and consumer of rice, while also ranking first in rice exports. In India,
    during the Kharif season, almost 55% of the total cultivated area (39.54 million
    hectares) is dedicated to paddy production, as per the Government of India report
    (GOI) in 2022 [4]. Furthermore, paddy production directly involves 57.5% of the
    country''s farming population and contributes significantly to the agricultural
    gross domestic product, according to the GOI in 2020 [4]. Due to industrialization,
    urbanization, and crop diversification, the area under paddy cultivation has decreased
    worldwide. An additional 114 million tons of milled rice are required by 2035
    to ensure food security, but land and water resources are scarce for further expanding
    paddy cultivation [5]. Sustainable rice farming methods are needed to improve
    productivity and farming efficiency, safeguard the environment, ensure food security,
    and improve rural livelihoods due to drought, rainfall variability, and resource
    and labor constraints. In rural India, livelihoods are under constant strain due
    to various factors such as water scarcity, soil salinity, high agricultural wages,
    irrigation, and fertilizer costs. Efficient resource management is essential to
    tackle these issues [[6], [7]]. Furthermore, with saturating yield and rocketing
    input prices, agriculture is becoming costly in Southeast Asia, including India
    [[8], [9], [10]]. Farmers should switch to climate-smart agriculture practices
    that conserve resources and increase efficiency instead of conventional practices
    that harm the environment [11]. However, it is predicted that one-third of Indian
    farmers will face water shortages by 2030. Therefore, adopting sustainable water
    management practices in paddy cultivation becomes imperative, reducing the strain
    on water resources [12]. Two standard methods for paddy production are transplanting
    and direct seeding. Transplanting is done in rainfed or irrigated lowland ecosystems
    with sufficient water available. Direct-seeded rice (DSR) is a potential water-saving
    technology for paddy production, which cuts land preparation time, involves direct
    sowing, and minimizes irrigation water requirements and soil greenhouse gas emissions
    [13]. Many farmers have transitioned from puddled transplanted rice (PTR) to DSR.
    The DSR method is primarily practiced by resource-poor farmers facing severe climatic
    constraints, i.e., low water table, occasional rainfall, and long dry periods
    that prevent rice-intensification system [[14], [15], [16]]. However, other paddy
    growers in India and other developing nations are also trying to substitute the
    PTR method with the less costly DSR technique [17]. DSR in paddy cultivation offers
    numerous benefits. For instance, it can be practiced in irrigated, rainfed, and
    deep-water ecosystems and has no transplantation shock, resulting in faster maturation
    than PTR. Dry-DSR (DDSR) and Wet-DSR (WDSR) are two classifications of DSR. The
    selection of the paddy establishment method depends on socioeconomic, demographic,
    and environmental factors. Several studies have shown that DDSR provides better
    yield and efficiently utilizes water under scarce irrigation water conditions.
    However, the adoption of DDSR is still low due to a lack of demand originating
    from inadequate DSR facilities, like DSR machines. Previous studies have primarily
    focused on comparing the yield gain in DSR over conventional methods based on
    experimental studies conducted in a controlled environment. While some studies
    have examined the impact of various tillage and plant protection techniques along
    with DSR on paddy productivity and energy use, only a few have estimated the effect
    of DSR on paddy yield and economic performance by collecting primary data from
    household surveys. Furthermore, no previous study has measured the diverse impact
    of DDSR and WDSR on paddy yield and income. This study aims to analyze the heterogeneous
    impact of dry and wet DSR on paddy productivity, revenue, and cost management.
    Additionally, our study aims to bridge the gaps in previous analyses presented
    for DSR by utilizing primary data for grain yield, additional income from DSR
    adoption, and estimating its impact on different cost components such as land
    preparation costs, irrigation costs, labor costs, and intercultural operation
    costs (Annexure 1). Furthermore, we present the socioeconomic and demographic
    constraints that play a critical role in DSR adoption, which may help the government
    and non-government organizations to fine-tune the existing policies for sustainable
    farming. We also present the results using propensity score matching, making it
    possible to measure the impact of DSR over the PTR establishment method. 2. Conceptual
    framework of the study Fig. 1 represents the conceptual framework of the study.
    The entire study is divided into three stages. In the first stage, various socioeconomic
    and demographic variables that play a critical role in DSR adoption are identified.
    In the second stage, using propensity score matching, the study identified the
    impact of DSR adoption on the cost incurred at various operational activities,
    income, and crop yield. Finally, the study performs the impact analysis to measure
    which DSR method (Dry DSR and Wet DSR) is economically viable. Download : Download

    framework of the study. 3. Methods Adopting the DSR establishment method is a
    dichotomous choice of the farmer. If the net benefit from DSR adoption is higher
    than non-adoption, then farmers will adopt the technology. The net benefits achieved
    by the farmers from adoption over non-adoption is denoted as (Equation (1)). If
    means that farmer''s net benefit from DSR adoption exceeds that of non-adoption.
    Nevertheless, is unobservable; however, it can be presented as a function of measurable
    elements in the following latent variable model: (1) where is a dichotomous variable
    that equals 1 when the household adopted the DSR and 0 otherwise. is the coefficient
    of the parameters to be measured. is the vector of household and farm-related
    characteristics. is the error term expected to be normally distributed. The likelihood
    of adopting the DSR establishment method can be presented as in equation (2):
    (2) where is the cumulative distribution function for . Regression models like
    logit and probit normally result from the assumptions made on the functional form
    of . The adoption of DSR technology is likely to be affected by various socioeconomic
    and demographic characteristics, yield, and net revenue from production. To link
    the DSR adoption choice with the potential outcomes of adoption, considering a
    risk-neutral production system that maximizes net return , subject to competitive
    output and input market and a single-output technology that is quasiconcave in
    the vector of variable inputs, . This may be represented as in equation (3): (3)
    where is the price for the output, is the expected output level, is a common vector
    for input costs, is the input vector, and represents household and farm characteristics.
    Net return from DSR adoption can be expressed as a function of DSR adoption choice
    , price of output, input variables, and household attributes as follows (Equation
    (4)): (4) Equations (4), (5), (6)) indicate that the adoption choice of DSR technology,
    output and input prices, and household and farm characteristics may impact input
    demand, net return, and farm productivity. 3.1. Problem associated with impact
    assessment DSR adoption may enhance the farm yield and farmers'' crop income and
    improve their welfare. However, the variance in welfare between DSR non-adopters
    and adopters cannot be attributed to technology adoption. A counterfactual scenario
    is usually captured when experimental data is collected through randomization,
    eliminating the causal inference problem. On the contrary, when data are collected
    from a cross-sectional survey (as in the case of this study), no information on
    counterfactual scenarios is obtained. A possible way to mitigate this problem
    is to measure the direct impact of DSR adoption on outcomes differences between
    technology adopters and non-adopters [18]. The decision of farmers to adopt or
    not adopt the DSR technology may be allied with adoption benefits associated with
    self-selection bias. To understand the importance of self-selection bias, consider
    the following equation, which shows the relationship between technology choice
    and outcome variables. (5) In equation (5), represents a vector of dependent variables,
    i.e., input costs, various farm operations, farm productivity, and farmers'' net
    income, for household . Likewise, represents household and farm characteristics
    and is the error term. The selection-bias issue arises if unobservable factors
    influence both the error term of DSR adoption, i.e., (in equation (1)) and error
    term of outcome specification, i.e., , which results in a correlation of both
    error terms. If the correlation between the two error terms exceeds zero, ordinary
    least square (OLS) regression may produce a biased estimation. Using Heckman''s
    two-stage selection approach is one way to overcome selection bias. However, in
    both regression stages, it is assumed that unobserved variables are normally distributed,
    which may not be possible every time. Using the instrumental variable (IV) approach
    is another way to control the selection bias. However, the major drawback of the
    model is that it requires an instrumental variable in the treatment equation to
    serve as an instrument in specifying the outcome equation. Furthermore, OLS and
    IV techniques commonly assume a linear functional form, implying that the coefficients
    on the control variables are expected to be comparable for adopters and non-adopters.
    However, Jalan & Ravallion and Mendola mentioned that this assumption seems improbable
    to be valid [19,20]. Difference-in-difference matching estimator is another way
    to avoid selection bias where it allows temporally invariant differences in outcomes
    between adopters and non-adopters [21]. Unfortunately, it is valid when panel
    data is available. In the absence of panel data, the fixed effect model performs
    statistical matching to address the issue of selection bias [22]. It makes pairs
    between adopters and non-adopters comparable regarding observable characteristics
    [23]. 3.2. Propensity score matching approach The propensity score matching (PSM)
    method has the potential to provide an unbiased assessment of the treatment impact
    when the outcomes are independent of the assignment into treatment, given the
    pre-treatment baseline covariates. The PSM method primarily measures the treatment
    effect for the treated population, which can be presented as in equation (6):
    (6) where is the average treatment effect on treated (ATT), shows the outcomes''
    value of the new technology adopters and is the value of same variable for non-adopters.
    However, we do not measure . Rather, we measure the difference ( between and .
    Hence, acts as a potential bias estimator. Without experimental data and/or panel
    data, the PSM model can overcome the sample selection bias [23]. For this, the
    PSM model uses conditional probability that the farmers adopt DSR technology based
    on pre-adoption characteristics [24]. The PSM model uses the unconfoundedness
    assumption (i.e., also known as conditional independence assumption) to produce
    the condition of a randomized experiment that suggests that once is controlled
    for, DSR technology adoption is random and uncorrelated with the outcome variables.
    Then, PSM can be expressed as equation (7), (7) where is the adoption indicator,
    and is the vector of pre-adoption characteristics. The conditional distribution
    of , in given is similar in both clusters of DSR adopters and non-adopters. PSM
    approach does not require functional form assumption, specifying the association
    between outcomes and predictors of outcomes. The assumption of unconfoundedness
    is the major drawback of the PSM method. Systemic differences may still exist
    between the outcomes of non-adopters and adopters even after conditioning, as
    selection relies on unmeasured baseline characteristics [21]. Still, the PSM approach
    provides a specification check to remove biases higher than average. After measuring
    the propensity score (PS), the ATT can be measured as in equation (8): (8) Several
    matching techniques can be used to match the adopters with non-adopters of similar
    PS This study employs nearest neighbor matching (NNM), kernel-based matching,
    and radius matching to check the robustness of the outcome. 3.3. Study area and
    sample size India is the second largest producer of paddy globally. The eastern
    and southern peninsular states in India are among the leading producers of paddy.
    The predominant cropping systems in these areas constitute the paddy-paddy system.
    Among the peninsular Indian states, Telangana is one of the largest producers
    of paddy. The area under paddy crop is 17.5 lakh hectares. Among the state''s
    ten major paddy-producing districts, Nalgonda stands first for the area under
    paddy production (21% of the total) and paddy produce (1068828 tons, i.e., 21%
    of the total) [25]. About 98% of the Nalgonda farmers followed rice monocropping
    for both seasons, and nearly 90% have irrigation facilities. Hence, we purposively
    selected this district as the study area (Fig. 2). The district also represents
    agroecological zones of peninsular India having heavy clayey soils of vertisol
    order [26]. Download : Download high-res image (444KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. Study area used in this study. According to Census (2011), the district''s
    population was 34,88,809 [27]. Out of the total, the number of farmers who owned
    land and were directly involved in agriculture was 3,12,130. We employed the Bartlett
    et al. sample size calculation formula (Equation (9)) to calculate an adequate
    sample size for the study [28]: (9) where N= Size of the population (312130),
    n = size of the sample population; Z = confidence interval at 95% (Z = 1.96);
    d = error at 5% (d = 0.05); p = proportion of target population (p = 0.5); and
    q = 1-p (q = 0.5). We found that 384 household data were sufficient for this study.
    However, we surveyed 669 households from 20 blocks of Nalgonda district. Of the
    669 households, 577 farmers adopted the DSR method, while 92 farmers followed
    the conventional (PTR) method for paddy cultivation. 4. Results and discussion
    4.1. Descriptive statistics The descriptive statistics in Table 1 show that DSR
    adopters differ significantly from non-DSR adopters regarding land preparation,
    fertilizer application, weed management, pest management, irrigation, and harvest
    cost. According to our analysis, establishing DSR may simplify the package of
    practices required for paddy production, as predicted way back by Serrano in 1975.
    This could increase farmers'' income, especially since the rising cultivation
    costs in the coming years may force more farmers to adopt the DSR method for paddy
    cultivation. The land preparation cost for DSR adopters is 22.6% less than for
    non-DSR adopters. Similarly, fertilizer costs, pest management costs, irrigation
    costs, and harvest costs are also significantly lower compared to non-DSR adopters.
    However, the weed management cost is 12% higher for DSR adopters. This result
    agrees with Eskandari & Attar, mentioning that total energy consumption was significantly
    higher in transplanted rice, while herbicide usage was higher in the DSR system
    [29]. Moreover, the yield and additional income due to DSR adoption are 7.69%
    and 44.3% higher than non-DSR adopters. This result is congruent with a report
    from a systematic review that indicates that paddy productivity can be improved
    by 3.1% in the case of DSR adoption and 0.7% if PTR farmers shift to the DSR method
    [30]. Furthermore, the economic benefits identified through this study support
    Singh et al. mentioning that in DSR, integrated use of stale seedbed, shallow
    tillage, and sequential application of herbicides has the potential to improve
    the paddy yield by 2.1–2.5 t ha−1 and economic return by $ 1310 ha−1 [16]. Table

    Authors'' calculations using the survey data. This study uses 17 independent variables
    as baseline covariates to measure the propensity score. Out of these 17 variables,
    the mean of 7 variables differs significantly among DSR adopters and non-adopters.
    Table 1 shows that 50% of the DSR adopters are members of farmers’ organizations
    and accept institutional credit and crop insurance to protect the farmer from
    adverse climatic conditions. However, 77% of non-DSR adopters have assured irrigation,
    while only 54% of DSR adopters have the same facility. Smartphone and television
    ownership are also higher among the DSR adopters than non-adopters. Moreover,
    48% of DSR adopters also have additional off-farm income, while 38% of non-DSR
    adopters are involved in off-farm income. This demonstrates that technology beyond
    agriculture also significantly impacts adoption of new agricultural technologies,
    acting as a catalyst for behavioral change among farmers [31]. 4.2. Determinants
    for direct seeded rice adoption A standard probit model is used to determine the
    constraints of DSR technology adoption. Table 2 represents the outcomes of probit
    estimation. The analysis reveals a statistically significant inverse correlation
    between age and the adoption of the DSR technique. With a 1-year increase in the
    average age of the sample population, the chance of DSR adoption decreases by
    0.12%. This finding is similar to the earlier outcome [32]. This suggests that
    younger farmers are more inclined to embrace DSR technology than their older counterparts.
    One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that younger farmers are more
    enthusiastic about adopting novel technology. In contrast, elderly farmers tend
    to adhere to traditional rice cultivation methods and are reluctant to venture
    beyond their comfort zone in embracing new technological advancements. This outcome
    is similar to the findings of [33,34]. However, Sodjinou et al. reported that
    farmers’ age positively influences the adoption of new farm practices [35]. Table

    has a pivotal influence on technology acceptance, as evidenced by a positive and
    statistically significant correlation between education levels and the adoption
    of DSR technology. Results show that with a one-year increase in education level,
    the likelihood of DSR adoption improves by 0.18%. Farmers who have received education
    know the possible impact of new technology on crop production and financial returns.
    As a result, the household head''s educational attainment tends to positively
    affect the decision to adopt new technologies, such as direct rice seeding. This
    finding is similar to the earlier reported outcomes [[36], [37], [38]]. Educated
    farmers are typically better able to adapt to new challenges and employ new technologies
    [39,40]. The coefficient associated with the membership in the farmers'' organization
    variable exhibits a positive and statistically significant relationship, indicating
    a positive association between farmers’ organization membership and technology
    adoption. The increase in organization membership by 10% improves the probability
    of DSR adoption by 1.4%. This outcome is in the same line with Tura et al. [41].
    Membership in a farmer-based organization positively correlates with a higher
    probability of embracing agricultural innovations. Conley and Udry have demonstrated
    that extension services and farmers'' organizations are conduits for disseminating
    knowledge among producers [42,43]. The findings align with the results reported
    by different researchers [[44], [45], [46], [47]]. Utilizing information and communication
    technology enhances the likelihood of adopting agricultural innovations [40].
    Producers with a television and/or smartphone exhibit a higher propensity to embrace
    agricultural innovations. Information and communication technology (ICT) enables
    farmers to access a wide range of information about various agricultural technologies,
    improving the chance of adoption [48]. Similar outcomes are obtained in this study,
    where smartphone and television ownership farmers have a better chance of adopting
    DSR technology. The study represents a favorable correlation between the availability
    of institutional loans and the probability of adopting agricultural technology.
    Results show that a 1% improvement in institutional credit adoption enhances the
    chance of DSR adoption by 0.16%. This finding is similar to Tura et al. and Idrisa
    [36,41]. The adoption of agriculture technology is more likely among farmers who
    have acquired institutional credit. According to Mdemu et al. in Tanzania and
    Nonvide et al. in Benin, a significant limitation in technology adoption is the
    absence of access to formal finance [40,49]. The authors reported that the availability
    of finance potentially enhances the purchasing of farm inputs and the adoption
    of new technology in agriculture. Farmers possess a variety of alternatives when
    it comes to managing agricultural hazards, and it is common for them to employ
    many risk management strategies concurrently. Adopting a particular risk management
    tool favors embracing additional risk management tools. The results indicate that
    improvement in adopting crop insurance by 1% positively impacts adopting other
    risk management techniques like DSR by 0.19%. Moreover, farmers adopting DSR over
    conventional PTR also assume that if crop yield gets hampered due to their inefficiency
    in practicing new technology, crop insurance will provide an additional shield
    against the loss. The results in Table 2 also indicate that landholding size positively
    influences DSR adoption. A 1% improvement in land size from the mean increases
    the likelihood of DSR adoption by 0.09%. This means farmers with large farm sizes
    are more interested in DSR adoption. This finding is similar to the findings of
    past studies [41,[50], [51], [52], [53]]. Perhaps smallholder thinks that if they
    lose their average yield due to adopting new technology, they cannot achieve food
    security and expected income. In contrast, large holders allocate their land under
    both interventions (DSR and PTR). With a relatively large farm size, they are
    confident that even if yield decreases due to DSR adoption, they can compensate
    for their income and ensure food security with PTR. Unlike landholding size, assured
    irrigation negatively influences the adoption of DSR technology. It means farmers
    having assured irrigation opt for PTR. DSR is primarily a water-saving paddy production
    system that reduces the methane emission from paddy fields and enriches soil health.
    However, farmers with assured irrigation are rarely informed about flood irrigation''s
    soil and environmental ill effects [39,44,54,55]. Also, in the study area, the
    government provides electricity at a subsidized rate for the farmers, which further
    motivates the farmers to use flood irrigation. 4.3. Matching quality of the PSM
    approach The propensity score ranges from merely zero (0.020) to almost one (0.999)
    (Fig. 3). The mean propensity score is 0.882. Households adopting DSR practice
    have a mean propensity score of 0.938 (minimum 0.062; maximum 0.999) with a standard
    deviation of 0.134. Similarly, farmers without DSR adoption consist of a mean
    propensity score of 0.067 (minimum 0.020; maximum 0.959) with a standard deviation
    of 0.122. The estimated propensity score distribution reveals that the common
    support area with and without DSR adoption expands from 0.120 to 0.999, indicating
    enough common support area to perform PSM. The remaining households with a propensity
    score outside this common support area are excluded from the analysis. Download

    Covariate balancing and common support area. The primary objective of the Propensity
    Score Matching (PSM) method is to achieve covariate balance both before and after
    the matching process. Table 3 displays the covariate balancing indicators before
    and after the matching process. Table 3 presents the results of several balancing
    tests utilized in this study. These tests include the assessment of median absolute
    bias before and after matching, the evaluation of pseudo R2 before and after matching,
    and the determination of the p-value of joint significance of variables before
    and after matching. The median absolute bias is relatively high prior to matching,
    falling within the range of 27.16–19.54. However, the median absolute bias demonstrates
    a notable decrease following the matching process, falling within the range of
    11.24–18.36. This suggests that a significant reduction in bias has been achieved
    by matching. The outcomes demonstrate a satisfactory bias reduction, ranging from
    72.89% to 57.33%. The pseudo-R2 has a very high value prior to matching for the
    nearest neighbor matching (NNM), kernel-based matching (KBM), and radius matching
    methods. The pseudo-R2 value has a relatively low magnitude following the matching
    process, suggesting a substantial resemblance between the adopters and non-adopters.
    Similarly, it is imperative to assess the collective significance of variables
    prior to matching and to reject it after matching if there is no discernible distinction
    between adopters and non-adopters. Fig. 3 also displays the signs of covariate
    balancing. Table 3. Covariate balancing test before and after matching. Matching

    calculations using the survey data. 4.4. Impact of DSR-practice adoption on cost
    incurred in various farm practices, paddy productivity, and income The impact
    of DSR technology is measured using the PSM approach, and we have presented the
    outcomes in Table 4. We have applied three different matching algorithms, i.e.,
    nearest neighbor matching (NNM), kernel-based matching (KBM), and radius matching
    (RM), to measure the average treatment effect on treated (ATT), i.e., the difference
    in the outcome of the DSR adopters and non-adopters. The impact of DSR adoption
    is significant and positive in the case of NNM, KBM, and RM, indicating that DSR
    adopters are getting an additional paddy yield of 0.042t/acre to 0.085t/acre.
    This may be because the DSR technique helps alleviate water scarcity by improving
    soil physical properties and slowing organic matter loss [56]. The cost of land
    preparation for DSR adopters is significantly lower by ₹1605/acre to ₹1643/acre
    due to avoidance of puddling and nursery preparation, as indicated by the negative
    and significant results at a 1% significance level. Likewise, adopters of DSR
    experience reduced fertilizer and pest management costs of ₹1090/acre and ₹590/acre,
    respectively, due to improved nutrient efficiency with split application compared
    to PTR [57]. Furthermore, by adopting the DSR method, farmers can save between
    ₹2000–2067 per acre on irrigation costs due to reduced water requirements. However,
    DSR fields tend to have a higher weed intensity, requiring more herbicides to
    control. This leads to a higher cost of weed management, ranging from ₹179–390
    per acre for those who adopt DSR technology compared to those who do not. Table

    calculations using the survey data. The overall cost of production for DSR technology
    is minimal. As a result, the additional income gain from paddy production using
    DSR technology is ₹5099–5289/acre. DSR adopters achieve higher income with minimum
    land preparation investment and reduced irrigation requirements. The rise in farm
    income is a huge incentive for farmers to adopt DSR technology in paddy farming.
    Besides the financial benefits, DSR adoption promotes sustainable farming practices
    that enhance soil health and encourage the growth of beneficial microorganisms.
    This, in turn, supports regenerative agriculture. Table 4 presents the critical
    threshold of hidden bias in this study. If an unobserved independent variable
    has the potential to impact both DSR adoption and outcome variables, there is
    a possibility of unobserved heterogeneity arising, which might potentially modify
    the importance of the influence [58,59]. Determining the extent of hidden bias
    in non-experimental studies poses challenges due to the absence of a suitable
    assessment instrument. Rosenbaum proposed a viable solution in 2002 [60]. Researchers
    can assess the extent to which unobserved exogenous factors impact the significance
    of the estimate by employing the Rosenbaum-bounds-sensitivity calculation [61,62].
    The findings presented in Table 4 indicate that each ATT value is linked to a
    corresponding τ-bound value. This value indicates a significant gamma level at
    which one might justify the causal inference of DSR technology adoption. For example,
    the gamma value for irrigation cost is 1.7–1.8, which means that if farmers have
    the same vectors of baseline covariates in their odds of DSR adoption with a factor
    of 70–80%, the positive impact of DSR adoption on irrigation cost saving, may
    be questioned. It means that the strength of hidden bias must be high enough to
    alter the findings in Table 4. Additionally, such high gamma values associated
    with the outcomes indicate that the study considers most exogenous factors as
    baseline covariates that may influence the treatment and dependent variables.
    4.5. Impact of dry DSR-practice adoption on cost incurred in various farm practices,
    paddy productivity, and income We present the cost comparison between dry and
    wet DSR adoption and the impact on farm operations, yield, and crop income in
    Table 5. The result shows that adopting dry DSR marks significantly lower land
    preparation and irrigation costs (₹1195/acre and ₹880/acre) than wet DSR. However,
    wet DSR is still an alternative approach to crop establishment if the monsoon
    gets delayed in rainfed areas. It can conserve irrigation water when coupled with
    effective water management techniques. Table 5. Impact of DSR-practice adoption

    Source: Authors'' calculations using the survey data. Nevertheless, both methods
    eliminate the need for puddling, reducing the overall water need and shortening
    the land preparation period [13,63]. Although there is no significant difference
    in weed and pest management costs between dry and wet DSR, dry DSR still indicated
    a better yield of 0.052t/acre than wet DSR in heavy soils. Saving on land preparation
    and irrigation costs and better yield achievement result in an additional income
    of ₹2467/acre for dry DSR adopters than wet DSR farmers. The range of gamma values
    associated with each outcome in Table 5 indicates that hidden bias arising from
    counterfactuals that can potentially influence both the treatment and dependent
    variables is considered during the propensity score calculation. 5. Conclusion
    Rice is a widely grown crop that requires many resources, but farmers are moving
    towards sustainable methods like DSR due to unpredictable rainfall, labor shortages,
    and resource limitations. DSR is a feasible and cost-effective alternative to
    traditional rice cultivation methods like PTR. In India, farmers are shifting
    to the more modern and efficient DSR method. Despite its benefits, only a few
    farmers have adopted DSR over PTR. This study aims to identify the critical determinants
    of DSR adoption and its impact on farmers'' yield, income, and costs in different
    farm operations. It also compares the effect of dry DSR adoption over wet DSR
    in terms of yield and economic welfare, filling a research gap in identifying
    the best-suited DSR method for farmers in peninsular India. The study found that
    factors such as farmers'' education, institutional credit, off-farm income, and
    smartphone ownership positively impact DSR technology adoption. However, farmers''
    age and irrigation availability restrict DSR adoption. DSR adopters have lower
    land preparation, fertilizer application, pest management, and irrigation costs
    than PTR adopters. Adopting DSR technology can save a paddy farmer ₹5192 per acre
    over PTR. Land preparation and irrigation costs are significantly lower for dry
    DSR adopters than for wet DSR farmers, bringing an additional crop income of ₹2467
    per acre for dry DSR farmers. There are two alternative ways to eliminate the
    risk of adopting DSR and engage wider farming communities under D.S.R. First,
    the central government must promote clustering and cooperative approaches to engage
    sizable and suitable areas under DSR implementation. Second, state and central
    government and non-governmental organizations need to provide training on DSR
    agronomy and other management practices (including weedicide and pesticide spraying,
    nutrient management, and irrigation) to up-skill the farmers sufficiently to practice
    DSR in their conventional fields. Also, the policymakers need to develop incentive
    structures to promote the uptake of the DSR method. Policies designed to enhance
    the adoption of DSR should prioritize the development of operator capabilities
    in weed control through comprehensive training on optimal management approaches.
    Adopting the DSR method by rice farmers can yield environmental benefits, such
    as less tillage or soil disturbance, mitigation of soil erosion, and decreased
    water use. Implementing soil and water conservation technologies in DSR would
    enhance yield and contribute to food security, hence supporting the National Food
    Security Mission. Sustainable paddy production will align with government policies
    such as Sustainable Livelihoods, Sustainable Land Management, Soil Moisture and
    Nutrient Improvement, Improved Agriculture/Crop Land Management, Cropland and
    Grassland Land-use Conversions, and Soil Protection and Conservation. Adhering
    to DSR practices can be a highly effective method for preserving and safeguarding
    soil biodiversity. Furthermore, this practice can contribute to broader climate
    policies, such as achieving net zero emissions, and support other government economic
    goals, such as Doubling Farmers'' Income. There are a few limitations of the study;
    the study was conducted in a representative area of peninsular India, i.e., Telangana
    state, and may be replicated in various agroecological conditions to measure DSR''s
    suitability over PTR. Moreover, this study only concentrates on the economic benefits
    of DSR adoption. However, future studies could focus on environmental outcomes
    and soil characteristics that benefit societies at scale. Ethics declarations

    Abstract To expand financial knowledge and promote the socioeconomic sustainability
    of agricultural production systems, this work applied financial instruments to
    small-scale irrigated crops, making use of agricultural projects from the Bom
    Sucesso/Santa Cruz Settlement, located in the Tocantins-Araguaia basin, Brazil.
    The economic viability indicators of two irrigated okra production systems (furrow
    and drip) were calculated using the following indicators: Net Present Value, Modified
    Internal Rate of Return, Cost–Benefit Index, Discounted Payback, and Average Cost
    of Production. And a risk assessment through sensitivity analysis, a tornado chart,
    and Monte Carlo simulation was performed in a simplified financial model. The
    economic viability results showed that both irrigated systems were economically
    viable, although the okra drip system had lower indicators and reduced financial
    resilience, with a 58% probability of success, while the furrow system’s was 89%.
    The crops’ financial return was mainly influenced by okra’s sale price and productivity,
    followed by harvesting and planting costs. The financial tools applied in this
    study demonstrated some key factors to assess socioeconomic sustainability, such
    as the necessity to increase producers’ organizational capacity and to achieve
    technical improvements, which could result in market power, competitive sale prices,
    lower input costs, and greater productivity. The applied instruments increased
    financial management and have the potential to the build economic and social strength
    in the area of small-scale irrigated crops, and they can be replicated using simplified
    tools for producers, companies, and policy makers. Keywords: financial tools;
    irrigation; sustainability; agriculture 1. Introduction Brazil is one of the major
    agricultural players in the world, aiming to become one of the most important
    food suppliers globally in the long term [1]. Brazil’s competitive advantages
    rely on its agriculture, which is adapted to tropical regions with remarkable
    productivity, as well as increased profitability per cultivation area. The country
    also has an increasingly qualified workforce, operations technology, and well-established
    agricultural procedures [2]. These factors have resulted in a dynamic national
    agribusiness that is connected to various segments of the agro-industrial production
    chain, as well as production with lower relative costs compared to global competitors,
    which has increased Brazil’s market share [3]. Brazil is the fourth largest exporter
    of agricultural products in the world, and is only behind the entire European
    Union, the United States, and China [4]. The main exported products are soybeans,
    coffee, orange juice, sugar, chicken meat, and beef [5]. Regarding the Gross Production
    Value (GPV), which corresponds to the revenue within national agricultural establishments,
    the products with the highest GPV in 2021 were soybeans, beef, corn, milk, and
    chicken [4]. In relation to job creation, the 2022 National Household Sample Survey
    pointed out that more than 20% of the Brazilian employed population works in the
    agricultural sector, corresponding to almost 20 million workers [6]. Currently,
    one of the main challenges of this sector is aligning the increased agricultural
    productivity with the use of water and energy resources [7,8]. That is due to
    competition for water resources, rising energy costs, and increasing water scarcity
    [9,10]. This shortage is increased by climate change and deforestation, and in
    response to such challenges, sector agents are seeking improvements to optimize
    the efficiency of using these inputs through irrigated agriculture [11,12]. Irrigated
    crops are production models that are designed to produce sustainable food in irrigated
    areas, i.e., using water and energy efficiently [13]. Its efficiency also involves
    selecting the most suitable irrigation method and establishing criteria for determining
    each crop’s water needs. After establishing adequate irrigation management, in
    addition to saving water and energy, greater agricultural productivity has been
    achieved [14,15,16]. Although the potential of Brazilian irrigated agriculture
    is widely agreed on, several challenges still need to be overcome [8,9,10,13,16,17].
    Achieving socioeconomic sustainability stands out as one of the major challenges,
    since it involves economic, financial, and administrative practices. These practices
    aim to promote rural economic development and social responsibility while preserving
    the environment for future generations, combining technical and financial practices
    and considering not only profit but the effects on the environment and communities
    [18]. In this sense, irrigated agriculture should not be seen only as a matter
    of engineering but also as an activity with a relevant social role, which can
    be considered another challenge. Such practices should be evaluated within technical,
    economic, environmental, and social criteria according to their distinct production
    scales [19,20]. On the one hand, there are large vertical enterprises operating
    in raw material production, industrialization, and trading, with mechanized labor,
    a high operational performance, and exploiting extensive territorial areas. On
    the other hand, there are numerous small and medium-sized producers located in
    smaller areas, with their market niche being characterized by a reduced production
    scale and less technological input [21,22]. However, these producers still play
    a pivotal role in supplying local agricultural markers, e.g., CEASA (in Portuguese),
    which are large supplier centers that are dedicated to receiving and organizing
    the marketing of agricultural products at a wholesale level for a given region.
    Considering the high competition and dynamism of the national agricultural sector,
    smaller-scale producers need to be increasingly prepared to meet sustainable business
    criteria in the long term. One of the leading tools for improving project management
    is financial planning, which comprises the financial management of an enterprise
    based on its objectives for the long term [23,24]. Through planning combined with
    feasibility studies and risk management, it is possible to assist decision makers
    in steering future scenarios and visualize the enterprise’s success/failure, as
    well as understanding whether it aligns with the agricultural market. By anticipating
    these scenarios, rural producers can achieve optimized business management and
    capacity to reflect positively on future outcomes [25]. However, it is noteworthy
    that many rural producers do not formulate or plan their projects and do not perform
    long-term financial planning, which limits their understanding of future scenarios
    relating to the business. Generally, rural producers only carry out their implementation
    and follow their operational status based on prior knowledge derived from family
    tradition and sociocultural factors [26,27]. Several studies in the literature
    have carried out economic feasibility studies on smaller-scale irrigated agricultural
    systems [9,12,14,15,20,28,29]. Most of them use traditional and deterministic
    economic methods to evaluate crops’ viability. Nevertheless, there is still a
    research gap regarding the use of financial tools in rural areas. Some works also
    indicate that small-scale crops have financial barriers that can delay their progress.
    One of the main challenges is their reduced financial management, considered a
    critical factor of success. Some other barriers that are usually found are the
    decision making process being motivated by cultural factors; reduced knowledge
    of financial instruments; and an inadequate capital structure. The current study
    aims to fill this gap by improving the knowledge on financial tools, aiming to
    assess socioeconomic sustainability in agricultural production systems. To this
    end, a financial planning tool was implemented for smaller-scale irrigated crops
    through the development of a simplified financial model. The analysis was conducted
    based on agricultural projects in the Bom Sucesso/Santa Cruz Settlement, located
    in the Tocantins-Araguaia Hydrographic Basin in the Central-West Region of Brazil.
    This region is recognized for its agricultural occupation and for its high dependence
    on irrigation, which justifies studies, interventions, and also public policies
    aiming to improve the rural development of this and other areas. This paper is
    organized as follows: Section 2 presents the data collection and the methodology
    for developing the financial planning tool; Section 3 presents the results; and
    Section 4 discusses the results, followed by the Conclusions in Section 5. 2.
    Materials and Methods The current study utilized a combination of descriptive
    research with a quali–quantitative approach, following the methodological structure
    presented in Figure 1. Figure 1. Work’s methodological workflow. 2.1. Data Collection
    This work relies on primary and secondary data. Primary data were gathered through
    interviews and online questionnaires with local producers in the Bom Sucesso/Santa
    Cruz Settlement, totaling 25 people who were directly involved in irrigated production.
    Although not a very large sample of producers were able to respond to the interviews/queries,
    they were selected due to their representation in terms of quantity and quality
    of technical and financial information, and also for reasons of schooling and
    willingness to talk. The interviews were based on three axes of questions: (i)
    productive aspects; (ii) technical aspects about irrigation; and (iii) financial
    aspects of production and irrigation. Secondary data, such as sectorial and market
    information, were collected from specialized Brazilian agricultural websites (such
    as CNA, IBGE, CEASA) and from a literature review. Data sources were mostly primary,
    and the collection period was between January 2022 and July 2023. 2.2. Site Characterization
    The study area is the Bom Sucesso/Santa Cruz Settlement, located in Flores de
    Goiás municipality in Goiás state, Central-West Region of Brazil, at coordinates
    14°26′18″ S of latitude and 47°2′55″ W of longitude. The area is part of the Tocantins-Araguaia
    hydrographic basin, the largest basin belonging exclusively to Brazil, and encompasses
    178 municipalities in the Central-West Region. The Settlement, established on
    23 August 2000, shelters 84 families in its 2605 hectares (~31 ha/family). Agriculture
    is the economic force playing the main role in the Settlement, with passion fruit,
    cashew, mango, and vegetable crops, e.g., okra, as the main crops. The areas with
    irrigated agriculture are incipient, with the Paranã River as its main water body.
    The Settlement also has small areas of eucalyptus plantation for firewood, fences,
    and other uses. Regarding its edaphoclimatic characteristics, the study area has
    a semi-humid tropical climate with rainy summers and dry winters, an average annual
    temperature of 20 °C, and an average annual precipitation of 1000–1300 mm. The
    predominant soil class is Gleisols, and vegetation is predominantly natural, typical
    Brazilian Cerrado, with areas of pasture and agriculture [30]. 2.3. Financial
    Planning Tool The financial planning tool was evaluated in the economic study
    of the production of 1 hectare of okra. Okra cultivation is the main agricultural
    activity in the Bom Sucesso/Santa Cruz Settlement. Two small-scale irrigated production
    models that are used in the Settlement, and which are considered common in Brazil
    and developing countries, were compared based on the following characterization:
    Production system with furrow irrigation (PS-furrow): Okra cultivation with non-automated
    furrow irrigation, where water is pumped from a nearby river into canals using
    an electric pump, and where it is taken to the cultivation area by animal traction,
    being slowly thrown into the furrows. This model is called “water rolling” by
    producers [31] and is currently performed by settlers located in productive areas
    close to the Paranã River, combining manual, animal, and electrical pumping activities.
    Production system with drip irrigation (PS-drip): Okra cultivation with an automated
    drip irrigation system. The irrigation equipment has an electric pump, 10 thousand
    meters of drip hose, 100 dripping records, 100 inserted connections between the
    water meter and the pipeline, as well as 17 PVC pipes (50 mm). According to interviewees,
    this model is followed by producers located in areas farther from the river. The
    okra production cycle reported by producers comprises the stages of soil preparation,
    area clearing, liming, plowing, harrowing, furrowing, fertilization, sowing, herbicide
    application, and post-planting amendments of crop cover. All operations last approximately
    30 days, and irrigation is carried out with a daily watering shift. Once okra
    seedlings reach 45 days and the fruit is already soft, harvesting takes place.
    Harvesting selection and transportation are carried out manually, lasting around
    90 days. The entire cycle lasts around 130 and 140 days, leading to 2.5 annual
    production cycles [32]. 2.3.1. Financial Planning Both primary and secondary data
    were analyzed and classified into financial and technical information and, therefore,
    arranged in a financial planning model developed in Excel®. The model “financial
    planning tool” was developed based on the structures proposed in financial management
    manuals [33,34], with inputs and outputs (Figure 2) combining cash flow budgeting,
    economic–financial feasibility analysis, risk analysis, and adjustments to the
    reality of smaller-scale rural producers. Figure 2. Structuring the financial
    planning tool. 2.3.2. Economic–Financial Analysis This analysis aimed to determine
    the economic viability of the production systems by using the following indicators
    as outputs: Net Present Value (NPV), Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR),
    Cost–Benefit Index (CBI), investment return time (Discounted Payback), and Average
    Cost of Production (ACP). To calculate the indicators, the cash flow of each production
    system was projected in the financial planning tool. The cash flow is the sum
    of financial inflows (positive values) and outflows (negative values) over 10
    years of the investment’s life, corresponding to the investment depreciation period.
    All values were in Brazilian Reais (BRL) and were converted into the average USD
    of the period in the proportion of BRL 5.00 to USD 1.00. The financial inputs
    are related to production and, consequently, the estimated revenue. Revenue calculation
    was made based on the average productivity data, which were the same for both
    production systems, i.e., 480 boxes of okra harvested per cycle multiplied by
    18 kg of okra per box. From that amount, 3% of losses were deducted due to handling
    and transportation, totaling 8381 kg of okra sold per cycle. To estimate the annual
    production, this value was multiplied by 2.5 annual cycles [32]. The average selling
    price for the entire period was USD 10.00/box (USD 0.56/kg), i.e., the historical
    average value gathered from the interviews. Therefore, the estimated annual revenue
    corresponds to the annual production discounted from losses and multiplied by
    the average sale price. The financial costs were the inputs related to initial
    investments, production costs, and sales, as well as general and administrative
    expenses (Table 1). Table 1. Production system costs. After cash flow projections,
    the financial performance of each production system was measured using viability
    indicators. To this end, the conventional capital investment analysis technique
    called discounted cash flow (DCF) was applied to estimate each production system’s
    return, discounted at a rate that reflects the investment risks. The indicators
    based on several references are described below [34,35,36,37]. a. Net Present
    Value (NPV) NPV is a financial formula used to determine the present value of
    the sum of future cash flows, discounted at a given interest rate (i). The production
    system will be economically feasible if its NPV is positive. The higher the NPV
    is, the more economically attractive the project will be. On the other hand, once
    the NPV is negative, the project becomes economically unfeasible. The interest
    rate (i) was determined as 10% p.a., which is above the average interest rate
    for rural credit (8% p.a.) [38]. The NPV equation is expressed by NPV= ∑ j=0 n
    R j (1+i) −j − ∑ j=0 n C j (1+i) −j (1) where i = interest rate; Rj = revenues
    at the end of the year j; Cj = costs at the end of the year j; and e, n = project
    duration in years, expected to be 10 years b. Modified Internal Rate of Return
    (MIRR) IRR is the rate that leads to an NPV of zero. MIRR is a derivation of IRR,
    aiming to correct its limitations by assuming that positive cash flows are reinvested
    at the capital cost, and the initial investments are financed at the project’s
    financing cost rather than at the IRR itself [39]. The production system will
    be economically viable if the MIRR is greater than the interest rate (i), established
    as the minimum attractive rate (MAR), i.e., MIRR > MAR = 10% p.a. The MIRR equation
    is expressed by MIRR= ⎡ ⎣ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎢ ⎛ ⎝ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ⎜ ∑ n j=0 R j (1+r) l ∑ n j=0 C j
    (1+f) −k ⎞ ⎠ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ ⎟ 1 n −1 ⎤ ⎦ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ ⎥ (2) where r = reinvestment rate that is
    equivalent to interest rate i, set at 10% p.a.; f = financing rate set at 8% p.a.;
    n = project duration in years, expected to be 10 years; l = revenue discount period;
    and k = cost discount period c. Cost–Benefit Index (CBI) CBI indicates the return
    on invested capital. CBI is acquired by dividing the NPV of projected revenues
    by the project costs’ NPV. If the result of this division is greater than 1.00,
    the investor receives a return on the invested capital; if the CBI is less than
    1.00, the investor does not receive a return. d. Discounted Payback The Discounted
    Payback is used to determine how long an investment reimbursement takes. It is
    calculated by accumulating the inflows and outflows of the discounted cash flow
    up to the period in which the negative values become to positive ones. e. Other
    indicators The Average Cost of Production (ACP) was calculated by dividing the
    total estimated cost for the project and updated to the present value by the equivalent
    estimated total production. It was also possible to calculate the minimum viable
    sale price in order to verify the minimum price that still maintains a viable
    production system, i.e., with NPV > USD 0.00 in a pessimistic scenario. The analysis
    was carried out in Excel, using the Hypothesis Test/Achieve Goal tool with NPV
    = USD 0.01. 2.3.3. Risk Analyses After obtaining the outputs of the economic–financial
    analysis, the risk analyses were integrated in the financial planning tool through
    the following techniques: (i) sensitivity analysis; (ii) tornado plot; and (iii)
    Monte Carlo simulation. The sensitivity analysis (i) was performed to verify how
    the return of production systems, expressed by their NPV, is affected by changes
    in critical variables, such as okra’s production and sale price. More pessimistic
    and optimistic scenarios were also modeled to evaluate the NPV’s impact under
    different production and market conditions. The tornado plot (ii) assessed the
    NPV sensitivity to 20% increases and decreases in several significant variables.
    That resulted in a graphical arrangement of the variables that most impacted the
    return of each project, ordered from the most influential to the least influential.
    Both analyses (i) and (ii) were performed in Excel using the Hypothesis Test/Data
    Table tool, already integrated into the financial planning tool. Monte Carlo simulation
    (iii) applied probabilistic distributions in various cash flow components in a
    mathematical model. The simulations were repeated 10,000 times (iterations) to
    obtain the NPV probability distributions of each production system, as well as
    the probability of reaching NPV > USD 0.00, i.e., the project’s success/failure
    probability. A Macro was developed in Excel for such simulations. Table 2 indicates
    the selected variables for the simulation, their probability distributions, and
    the simulated values. Table 2. Variables simulated in Monte Carlo. 3. Results
    3.1. Economic–Financial Analysis Figure 3 compares the financial projections of
    the irrigated production systems relative to the annual and the cumulative free
    cash flows for the investment life cycle (10 years). Figure 3. Annual and cumulative
    free cash flows (FCF) of PS-furrow (a) and PS-drip (b). Even achieving the same
    okra productivity, the production systems presented different annual free cash
    flows. PS-drip had lower annual free cash flow values, a disparity that is mainly
    due to (i) its higher expenses arising from investments in the irrigation system,
    including higher annual maintenance expenses and (ii) higher irrigation costs
    (water and energy). Therefore, PS-furrow resulted in an enhanced cash flow, even
    though its irrigation system is considered simple and non-automated. When delving
    deeper into the technical field, it is noteworthy that PS-furrow takes place close
    to a river, which plays a role in terms of costs. Regarding the cumulative FCF,
    both systems had negative values in year zero, the year of investments, and year
    one, which was the start of okra production. However, PS-furrow reached a positive
    cumulative cash flow in year two, while PS-drip accumulated a positive balance
    only after five years. That is led by the lower initial investment for installing
    the PS-furrow compared to the other system, corroborating previous findings [40,41,42,43,44].
    The results indicate that PS-furrow from year two onwards provides sufficient
    revenue from the sale of okra to cover all annual investments, planting and harvesting
    costs, and expenses, thus generating a positive cash balance for the first time.
    PS-drip takes longer to reach such a pattern. By analyzing the cumulative cash
    flow, both production systems achieved cash sustainability after the reimbursement
    of the investment without losses in the following years, thus improving the enterprise’s
    cash management. This analysis also involves the Discounted Payback indicator,
    which is presented in Table 3 together with other economic viability indicators.
    Table 3. Production systems’ economic indicators. Table 3 shows that both production
    systems were economically viable, since they presented positive NPVs, MIRRs above
    the previously defined discount rate (>10% p.a.), and CBIs that were greater than
    1.00. It is noteworthy that PS-furrow led to the best financial results, with
    a higher NPV (USD 5625.34), MIRR (27.4%), and CBI (1.07). Although PS-drip has
    shown comparatively lower values, i.e., NPV (USD 732.27), MIRR (12.3%), and CBI
    (1.01), the system can still be seen as viable in all aspects. Regarding the Discounted
    Payback, PS-furrow reimbursed the investment in 1.6 years, while PS-drip took
    7.4 years, a significantly longer period in the comparative analysis between them.
    PS-furrow’s Average Cost of Production was marginally better than PS-drip, i.e.,
    USD 0.50/kg versus USD 0.53/kg, respectively. The difference between them resulted
    from the lower operational costs in PS-furrow due to its reduced energy costs.
    Furthermore, PS-furrow investments were relatively contained over time. Its minimum
    sale price also outshined the other irrigated system’s price, which reached USD
    9.20/box versus USD 9.84/box for PS-drip. 3.2. Risk Analyses Table 4 and Table
    5 present the NPV sensitivity analyses of PS-furrow and PS-drip, respectively.
    Table 4. PS-furrow NPV sensibility analysis. Table 5. PS-drip NPV sensibility
    analysis. It can be observed that if the sale price remains constant at USD 10.00/box
    for PS-furrow, a permanent decrease in the quantity of harvested boxes (36/week)
    would lead to a negative NPV (Table 4). In contrast, if the quantity of harvest
    boxes remains at 40, the selling price dropping to USD 9.00/box would make the
    enterprise unviable, with negative NPVs. To enable a USD 8.00/box market price,
    which in the market’s recent history can be considered a low price, the production
    would have to reach ≥48 boxes/week. Regarding the NPV sensitivity analysis for
    PS-drip (Table 5), if the selling price was maintained as constant at USD 10.00/box,
    38 harvested boxes per week would lead to negative NPV values. On the other hand,
    if maintaining 40 harvested boxes per week and if a reduction in selling price
    to 9.00/box occurred, the enterprise would be unfeasible, with negative NPVs.
    Below USD 9.00/box, there is no tested production scenario that could maintain
    the business viability under such circumstances, which implies reduced market
    and production resilience for PS-drip. The results obtained in the sensitivity
    analysis should be considered relevant, as they represent the financial return
    of the systems under pessimistic and optimistic market and production conditions.
    Figure 4 presents the tornado plot analysis for PS-furrow (a) and PS-drip (b),
    applied in the financial planning tool, in which the graph’s central axes are
    their NPVs. Figure 4. Tornado plot of PS-furrow (a) and PS-drip (b). As shown
    in Figure 4, the most influential variables for the PS-furrow’s financial performance
    were the okra’s sale price, production, harvesting costs, and planting costs,
    respectively. Acquisitions, energy costs, and investments in the irrigation systems
    had a relatively minor impact on its NPV. PS-drip’s NPV performance followed a
    similar pattern in the tornado plot, and the most relevant variables were the
    okra’s sale price, production, harvesting costs, and planting costs, as well.
    A reduced impact of the NPV was observed for the variables investment in irrigation
    system, energy costs, and acquisitions. When comparing the outcomes between the
    two production systems, only irrigation investments and acquisitions changed in
    order of relevance, in which irrigation investments had some financial importance
    for PS-drip, due to its higher values. The tornado plot results can be interpreted
    as pertinent, since they present the key variables that affect the financial return
    of the projects. The last risk analysis, the Monte Carlo simulation, led to the
    indicators shown in Table 6. Table 6. Outputs from Monte Carlo simulation. The
    Monte Carlo results demonstrated that the average of 10,000 NPVs was USD 8795
    for PS-furrow and USD 1499 for PS-drip. These values exceeded the deterministic
    NPVs obtained, which were USD 5625 and USD 732, respectively. The average Monte
    Carlo NPVs can be considered high values due to the various risk factors, including
    some more conservative factors that were considered in the calculations. PS-furrow’s
    probability of success (P (NPV > 0)) was 89%, while PS-drip scored 58%. That means
    that the probability that the project’s NPV is greater than zero was higher than
    the probability of scoring an NPV below zero, which was 11% and 42%, respectively.
    Given the simulated risk factors, including some pessimistic ones, PS-furrow had
    a significant probability of success, while PS-drip showed a reasonable probability
    of success. The Monte Carlo simulation results were pertinent, as they simulated
    seven relevant variables under realistic conditions of the market, prices, and
    productivity, being a proxy of the probability of success of the enterprises.
    4. Discussion Comparing the results obtained in this study with the literature,
    it is important to mention that a gap exists regarding the economic analysis of
    irrigated crops. Most of the literature focuses on technical analyses and only
    uses traditional financial indicators, such as the Total Annual Operating Cost,
    to examine irrigated agricultural projects over just one year, which does not
    consider the investment life cycle, as investigated in the present study. For
    instance, Souza et al. [12] estimated the Total Annual Operating Cost of irrigated
    sweet corn production in the northeast of Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil. The
    authors also evaluated several treatments involving irrigation plates and growing
    seasons, and their outcomes demonstrated that irrigated sweet corn was technically
    and economically viable for one year, with greater productivity during the summer/autumn
    season. Souza et al. [28] analyzed the technical and economic feasibility of hybrid
    tomatoes grown with irrigation in the northeast of Mato Grosso do Sul state, Brazil,
    as well, also using the Total Annual Operating Cost. Their results pointed out
    that irrigation had no effect on the agronomic characteristic of the tomatoes
    that were planted in the rainy season. Moreover, they observed that hybrids grown
    in the rainfed system had greater economic viability over one year due to positive
    returns on investments. Silva et al. [14] compared the economic viability of two
    irrigation systems with central pivots for sugar cane and soybeans in Brazil.
    Unlike other research, this study evaluated irrigation systems’ NPV and Payback
    for a useful life of 27 years of investments. Their outcomes uncovered that the
    two irrigated crops had positive NPVs and a Payback of 7 years for 27 years of
    investments in the central pivot irrigation system. The current work brought to
    light that PS-furrow reached higher economic indicators than PS-drip in terms
    of comparative economic viability due to the difference in initial irrigation
    investments and in operating costs, including the energy ones. Although equivalent
    production was perceived and PS-drip is still considered economically viable,
    this system had lower viability and worse financial indicators. On the other hand,
    a drip irrigation system is generally believed to be more efficient and technological
    compared to a traditional furrow irrigation system, which could implicate a better
    productivity for a drip system. However, it does not occur in the present work,
    as some difficulties for producers in using the drip system were reported in the
    interviews, e.g., problems with water quality, pipe clogging, maintenance, and
    operational troubles. It is also important to comment on the implications of the
    study for sustainable agriculture. The combination of technological and financial
    analysis performed in this study generated results that can improve information
    levels for producers, opening possibilities to plan water’s and other resources’
    allocation and improve their management, contributing to water conservation and
    preventing fertilizer leakage. The risk analyses performed in the study showed
    higher financial resilience for PS-furrow, with comparatively better indicators
    regarding reductions in okra’s selling price and production, while PS-drip was
    more susceptible to production and market fluctuations. Both investments were
    considered sensitive to market conditions (selling price), productivity, harvesting,
    and planting costs, but in terms of financial resilience, okra’s production with
    furrow irrigation can be considered a simple and a more profitable system in terms
    of the technical and financial conditions observed in the present study. Hence,
    it can be seen that the financial planning tool led to improvements in comparison
    to the limitations of the traditional economic analysis. This resulted from many
    factors: (i) the tool allows for the evaluation of different production and market
    scenarios through a sensitive risk analysis followed by a tornado plot and Monte
    Carlo simulation; (ii) the traditional economic evaluation is deterministic, whereas
    the Monte Carlo simulation can assign probability distributions to the main variables
    and estimate the enterprise’s chance of success, thus providing a holistic perspective
    for calculating the viability of an agricultural enterprise; (iii) the integration
    of economic–financial and risk analyses provided a wide range of tools for the
    agricultural manager; and (iv) the view of the business’ cash flow generated by
    the tool enables improvements in the producer’s cash management, leading to a
    better capital and resource allocation over time. The financial planning tool
    could induce economic and social sustainability in rural areas by generating knowledge
    on financial administration, given the technical and economic aspects of these
    kinds of projects. The tornado plot, for instance, facilitates the determination
    of the most relevant variables for the success or failure of smaller-scale crops,
    which were, in the present study, okra’s sale price and productivity. From the
    producer point of view, in order to maintain and/or to improve their sale prices,
    farmers must have market power and organizational capacity, a quality that is
    achievable through cooperatives, management development, and emerging rural companies
    that could together positively impact business sustainability, as previously discussed
    in the literature [22,24,26,27,45]. Another variable that is relevant for improving
    small-scale irrigated crops is productivity, which requires producers to increase
    their operation, the quality of planted material, crop knowledge, and soil and
    fertilization practices and implement improved irrigation systems, such as sprinklers
    and central pivot systems, or even seek to adjust their current irrigation systems.
    Agricultural fertilizer costs can also be reduced with greater organization and
    management by smaller-scale producers [46,47,48]. However, there are still challenges
    and limitations to applying a financial tool in rural areas [49,50,51]. Monte
    Carlo, for example, is not a simple tool and is generally based on paid software.
    In its use, it is also difficult to estimate the relationship between the variables
    and define the probability distribution of the variables in order to obtain realistic
    research results, which requires financial and technical knowledge from the researcher/manager.
    Furthermore, taking financial instruments to farmers requires financial education,
    extensive programs of training and monitoring of the use of the tools tested,
    development of free software and applications that are user-friendly, as well
    as support from the rural population. These challenges can limit the application
    of financial planning in rural areas and have to be considered for decision makers
    in ongoing and future public policies. 5. Conclusions The economic viability analysis
    enabled the following observations: (i) the two analyzed irrigated okra production
    systems generated financial returns for the rural producer after the start of
    production, i.e., they were economically feasible given the indicators tested;
    (ii) both systems achieved cash sustainability after the reimbursement of the
    investment without losses in the following years of production; (iii) the production
    system with furrow irrigation showed the best viability indicators in addition
    to reimbursing the investment in a shorter period of time; and (iv) the furrow
    system resulted in the best financial multiples, with a lower average cost of
    production and less sensitivity to the decrease in okra sale prices and its production,
    standing out as more resilient and showing a higher probability of success in
    risk analyses. The financial planning tool generated complete knowledge of financial
    administration and a wide range of tools for the agricultural manager, who can
    collaborate actively in their decision making process, contributing to assessing
    socioeconomic sustainability. Author Contributions Conceptualization, G.B.d.D.R.

  description: The pivotal role of computer technology in augmenting crop productivity,
    optimizing supply chain management in food production, and reducing wastage through
    precision agriculture techniques is undeniable. The utilization of computers has
    significantly transformed the field of food production, enhancing effectiveness,
    environmental sustainability, and economic viability. This study examines the
    asymmetric and long-term effects of computer usage on grain output in the selected
    Chinese provinces. Additionally, it investigates the impact of other variables,
    such as energy use and the application of pesticides and fertilizers on grain
    yields. To analyze the dataset spanning from 2002 to 2020, the researchers employed
    the FGLS, D-K, and Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality methods. The study's findings underscore
    the substantial positive impact of computer utilization on grain production. Besides,
    fertilizer application and adoption of irrigation practices positively influence
    grain yields. Conversely, the utilization of pesticides, power consumption, and
    rural labor engagement exhibit a negative impact on grain output. Therefore, evaluating
    the potential of investing in sophisticated technologies, considering multiple
    elements including local conditions, the availability of financial resources,
    and the role of agricultural industrialization in regional development is imperative.

    1. Introduction The steady increase in the global population drives the demand
    for agricultural products. The demand is further intensified by biofuel production
    and the shift in tastes and preferences toward higher-calorie diets, which can
    be attributed to elevated income levels and enhanced living conditions [1]. By
    the year 2030, there is an anticipated 50% surge in the demand for food, a figure
    that is projected to escalate to 80–100% by 2050 compared to current levels [2].
    Ensuring a consistent and equitable provision of agricultural commodities is vital
    for the preservation of food security, the promotion of sustainable development,
    and the maintenance of economic and social stability. The agricultural sector
    is closely linked to several sustainable development goals, including the promotion
    of good health, the eradication of hunger, the reduction of poverty, the improvement
    of human well-being, and the mitigation of inequalities [[3], [4], [5], [6]].
    However, the growing demand for the agriculture sector is aggravating the existing
    supply limitations. Nevertheless, addressing this increased demand poses difficulties,
    such as the scarcity of cultivable land, the worldwide influence of climate change
    on agriculture, and the changing food habits resulting from the growing per capita
    incomes in developing countries [7,8]. The fertility of agricultural land is jeopardized
    by factors such as a large population, fast urbanization, and considerable industrial
    development. Moreover, the difficulties posed by climate change and global warming
    impede endeavors to improve agricultural productivity by intensifying the strain
    on resources [9]. In addition, the agricultural sector is confronted with internal
    challenges such as the significant strain of fierce global competition on smallholder
    farmers, escalating input costs, and imbalanced resource utilization. Besides
    all this, the conventional approach of augmenting production through methods like
    increased chemical fertilizer usage poses potential drawbacks. The aforementioned
    circumstances require the implementation of more inventive approaches to enhance
    agricultural production. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) has emerged
    as a highly promising advancement in recent times [10,11]. China has experienced
    significant difficulties in providing sustenance for its vast population, which
    is the largest in the world, while also ensuring food security despite several
    limits and hurdles. Thus, this study aims to investigate the many factors that
    influence grain production in China, with a specific focus on ICT. The results
    of the study have the potential to deliver valuable policy recommendations. The
    agricultural sector has long been of utmost importance to China, as it is responsible
    for providing sustenance to a significant portion of the global population. Ensuring
    the dietary requirements of around 22% of the global population, while utilizing
    only 7% of the cultivated land worldwide [12], presents a significant challenge
    and national security concern for the people of China [13]. The COVID-19 outbreak
    and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine have made food security an increasingly
    significant issue for China. The fact that there are many smallholder farmers
    in China is another unique aspect of the country''s agricultural sector. It is
    critical to make sure these farmers can access contemporary farming techniques
    and sell their products. Because of its massive scale, China''s agricultural sector
    is also vital to the security of the worldwide market for agricultural goods.
    Grain holds an important place within the context of China and in different regions
    of the world (see Fig. 1). During the 1950s, China embarked on a reform initiative
    aimed at augmenting grain production and enhancing agricultural infrastructure.
    The implementation of these changes led to a sustained growth in grain output
    over an extended period. However, there was a temporary fall in 2015, followed
    by a subsequent recovery that culminated in the attainment of the highest recorded
    level of grain production in 2022 [14]. The utilization of chemical pesticides
    and fertilizers has significantly contributed to the increase in productivity
    [15]. China has emerged as the world''s foremost grain producer, accounting for
    over 25% of worldwide production. Furthermore, the country''s production per unit
    is 1.3 times the world average [16]. However, China''s grain output remains inadequate,
    leading to a substantial reliance on grain imports [17]. China must augment grain
    production to uphold the equilibrium between supply and demand. Nevertheless,
    the agricultural industry is currently encountering numerous challenges. Download

    Cereal production in various regions of the world. Urbanization and increased
    per capita income have led to a growing demand for agricultural products, resulting
    in increased pressure on the supply. Moreover, the agricultural sector is progressively
    impacted by worldwide atmospheric fluctuations, posing a threat to grain cultivation
    in China [18]. The substantial disparity between precipitation and evaporation
    in a considerable portion of China necessitates the reliance on irrigation for
    crop cultivation [19]. The majority of the country''s grain output, exceeding
    70%, is derived from irrigated farms [20]. Water resources are becoming insufficient
    due to population expansion, urbanization, and environmental degradation, exacerbating
    their already limited and uneven distribution [21]. In addition, the utilization
    of groundwater as a result of insufficient surface water supplies has a detrimental
    impact on the environment [20]. The increasing gap between the demand and supply
    of water in China is posing an impending threat of water scarcity. Moreover, China,
    the predominant global consumer of pesticides and chemical fertilizers since the
    1980s, has faced severe scrutiny for the detrimental impact it has on the atmosphere
    and human health [22]. The reliance of the agricultural industry on environmentally
    detrimental chemicals presents a risk to the long-term viability of sustainable
    agricultural practices. China is also criticized for its inefficient utilization
    of chemical fertilizers [23]. This situation necessitates investigating the consequence
    of fertilizer use on grain productivity in China. China is confronted with two
    formidable objectives: firstly, to guarantee food security through the augmentation
    of agricultural output while adhering to predetermined resource limitations; and
    secondly, to accomplish this while minimizing the adverse externalities associated
    with agricultural production and employing environmentally sustainable practices.
    An analysis of the Chinese agricultural sector reveals that the country''s long-standing
    strategy of increasing output through input intensification will not be sufficient
    to achieve the stated targets [24]. China should consider implementing measures
    to substantially decrease the utilization of chemical pesticides and fertilizers
    in agricultural practices, while concurrently promoting the adoption of technology
    advancements to enhance agricultural production. Grain yields in China''s main

    major producing regions of China for 2010 and 2020. Countries worldwide are recognizing
    the crucial significance of digital technologies in transforming agricultural
    practices and procedures. Farmers are benefiting from several advancements, such
    as the extensive adoption of precision farming techniques, which provide them
    with immediate information regarding soil quality, weather patterns, and crop
    conditions. Agricultural practitioners are integrating cutting-edge technologies
    to enhance soil cultivation methods and agricultural procedures, resulting in
    enhanced efficiency and productivity. For instance, Talaviya et al. [25] investigated
    different automated systems in agriculture, emphasizing the importance of AI in
    advancing the agro-based sector and addressing challenges in irrigation, weeding,
    crop monitoring, and spraying through automated robotic systems. According to
    Zhang [26], precision agriculture, utilizing smart and digital technologies, optimizes
    resource usage for increased efficiency and reduced environmental impact. This
    involves real-time monitoring of crop conditions through sensors and IoT devices,
    enabling data-driven decisions. Furthermore, digital technologies like data analytics
    and machine learning enhance crop planning, yield prediction, and disease detection
    in agriculture Agricultural companies are also using the latest tech to improve
    their supply chains, logistics, and overall effectiveness. The deployment of Internet
    of Things (IoT) applications establishes a connection between agricultural equipment,
    enabling seamless communication and collaboration. These progressions facilitate
    the anticipation of crop yields, identification of illnesses, and advocacy for
    sustainable practices through the reduction of resource wastage. The advent of
    digital technology has ushered in a new era in Chinese agriculture, with remarkable
    prospects for innovation and productivity, thereby making significant progress
    in China as well. To comprehend the substantial alteration occurring in China''s
    agricultural and technology integration, it is imperative to grasp the most recent
    advancements that propel this process. China''s initiatives are in line with the
    worldwide trend where Information and Communication Technology (ICT) plays a crucial
    role in driving significant changes in the agricultural sector. ICT has the potential
    to offer novel and inventive approaches to establish a more intelligent, streamlined,
    and environmentally sustainable agricultural industry. China is making significant
    progress in the adoption and utilization of ICT. As of July 2022, the total number
    of Internet users has reached 1.051 billion [27]. Additionally, the number of
    Internet users in rural areas amounted to 297 million, with a corresponding rural
    penetration rate of 59.2% [28]. The expeditious proliferation of ICT has a substantial
    influence on the agriculture industry and the socio-economic circumstances of
    rural households. ICT possesses significant potential to bring about dramatic
    changes within the agricultural industry. The proliferation of applications has
    yielded expeditious and efficient resolutions to the specific challenges encountered
    by agricultural practitioners. Information and communication are essential components
    of agriculture due to their inherent characteristics [29]. ICT facilitates the
    acquisition of high-quality information by farmers about crucial aspects such
    as meteorological conditions, moisture levels, and the health of plants. Moreover,
    the availability of ample location-specific data facilitates the adoption and
    implementation of “Precision Agriculture” [30]. Besides, ICT is one of the most
    effective ways to integrate and participate especially small-scale disconnected
    farmers, into the market. ICT enables farmers to reduce search costs, make price
    comparisons, bargain [31], buy input cheaper, and sell their products at higher
    prices, thus increasing profitability and sales volume. ICT facilitates farmers''
    access to public information [32], financial services, insurance, convenient credit
    opportunities, agricultural technology and research, and e-commerce opportunities.
    ICT also affects the structure of the markets and the economy. It provides market
    efficiency [33], reduces uncertainty, creates an incentive for more production
    [34], and reduces price dispersion spatially and over time [35]. Hence, ICT contributes
    to affordable food prices, remunerative agriculture, sustainable production, and
    agricultural income increase by addressing many challenges of agriculture. The
    emergence of computer technology led to its rapid utilization in various fields.
    Agricultural producers, however, initially lagged behind other industries in adopting
    and incorporating computers during the 1980s. Nevertheless, in the 1990s, the
    increasing affordability of computers and enhancements in their performance facilitated
    a rise in their usage within the agricultural sector. Academic investigations
    into the utilization of computer technology gained prominence during this period,
    with the initial academic studies in this domain beginning to surface in the late
    1980s. These early works predominantly took the form of survey studies, focusing
    on the determinants of computer usage in agriculture [36]. Amponsah [37] noted
    that computer usage had not yet become widespread enough. Ascough et al. [38]
    argued that the insufficient use of computers in the agricultural sector was a
    rational choice given the prevailing conditions of the time. As an early attempt,
    Day [39] provided examples of how computer technology could be employed in agriculture.
    The 2000s marked a period of rapid increase in both the use of computers in agriculture
    and the corresponding academic research on the subject. Batte [40] highlighted
    the swift growth of computer usage in agriculture, attributing it, in part, to
    the significance of Internet technology. The proliferation of ICT usage in agriculture
    was further propelled by increased computing power, personal computers, management
    software, various business models, e-commerce platforms, and smartphones. There
    is an abundance of empirical evidence suggesting these technologies significantly
    enhanced the efficiency of the agricultural sector and led to meaningful increases
    in production [41,42]. Academic studies provide ample evidence of the positive
    consequences of the use of ICT. Lezoche et al. [43] claimed that ICT can support
    the holistic transformation of the country''s agricultural sector. Ma et al. [35]
    found that ICT facilitates the agricultural sector''s access to credit. Moreover,
    the opportunities brought by using ICT increase rural households'' income [44].
    Deng et al. [45] claimed that Internet use increases green agricultural productivity.
    Besides, Li and Zhao [46] stated that using the Internet promotes technological
    innovation. Kaila and Tarp [47] found that the Internet increases efficiency in
    using fertilizers and agricultural production in Vietnam. Ma et al. [35] stated
    that the use of the Internet is effective in choosing more environmentally friendly
    organic fertilizers as a substitute for chemical fertilizers. However, the impact
    of ICT on cereal production in China has not been adequately studied. Numerous
    scholarly investigations have previously explored the effects of climate change
    on the production of cereal crops [[48], [49], [50]], the interrelationship between
    energy consumption and agricultural productivity [51], the nexus between greenhouse
    gas emissions and agricultural output [52], as well as the connection between
    technological progress, climate change, and soybean yields [53] specifically within
    the context of China. Nevertheless, the aforementioned research overlooked the
    crucial significance of computer utilization in the overall framework of grain
    production. Hence, the current paper contributes to the ongoing literature in
    three ways: Firstly, to the best of our research knowledge, no empirical paper
    assessed the impact of computer utilization on grain production in the case of
    China. Secondly, the current empirical paper utilized the various panel data estimation
    techniques such as FGLS and D-K methods to explore the long-run impact of computer
    use and other production factors on grain production. The robustness of the long
    run is verified by using the panel autoregressive distributed lag (PARDL) model.
    In addition, this work utilized advanced estimate techniques, specifically the
    Westerlund ECM panel cointegration test and the Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality approach,
    to investigate the long-term cointegration relationship and causal interaction
    among the variables under examination. The dynamic nexus between the variables
    is exhibited in Fig. 3. Download : Download high-res image (421KB) Download :

    also provides effective policy recommendations that target sustainable development
    of the Chinese agricultural sector. Furthermore, it is imperative to address some
    research questions in the present study, which are outlined as follows: • Does
    the utilization of computer technology contribute to the enhancement of grain
    production? • Is there evidence of a long-term cointegration relationship between
    the variables? • What is the nature of the directional causation between grain
    production and all the regressors? The subsequent sections of this research study
    are given in the following ways The subsequent section of the paper delves into
    a comprehensive exploration of our data and methodology, elucidating the strategic
    choices made in the research design. Subsequently, we intricately unfold the empirical
    findings and engage in in-depth discussions, systematically connecting the outcomes
    to the broader research questions and objectives. This section aims not only to
    present results but also to provide the logical progression of our argument. Finally,
    the concluding section encapsulates the synthesis of our study, drawing together
    key insights, and discussing their implications. 2. Data and methodological procedure
    2.1. Data The present study draws an empirical relationship between computer usage
    and grain yields in the main grain-producing provinces of China: Henan, Hunan,
    Hebei, Hubei, Neimenggu, Heilongjiang, Jilin, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui,
    Shangdong, Sichuan. In addition, this study also considered technical inputs such
    as fertilizer consumption, pesticide usage, the total power of agricultural machinery,
    irrigated area, and rural labour force as important factors of grain production.
    The data for studied variables are gathered from the National Bureau of Statistics
    of China (NBSC) (see Table 1). The trend plots of the considered variables are
    presented in Fig. 4. The descriptive statistics of candidate variables are displayed

    The empirical model linking the long-term influence of computer usage, fertilizer
    utilization, pesticide usage, the total power of agricultural machinery, irrigated
    area, and rural labour force on grain yields is required to light the aims of
    this research. Hence, the following function is constructed as: (1) By transforming
    the studied time series of Equation (1) into the log form, the baseline function
    is explained as follows: (2) Where GY denotes the grain yields, while i represents
    the cross-section of the individual province, t represents the period from 2002
    to 2020, and denotes the intercept term. to are the coefficients of variables:
    computer usage, fertilizer consumption, pesticide usage, the total power of agricultural
    machinery, irrigated area, and rural labour force. The flow of panel data estimation

    dependency tests The analytic method in this paper unfastens with a vital inspection
    of the nominated panel long-run range of datasets for deliberation of their connected
    properties. These vital investigating spot plainclothesmen for the creation of
    a conversant valuation on the issue of selections of the precise procedures and
    methods regarding the compatibility of connected approaches with specific panel
    series structures and data features. Quantified the current interlinked between
    nations all over the world that common consequences in the communication of comparable
    trends, financial drawbacks, economic shocks, and similar patterns and trends
    amongst other concerns between economies, an inspection of potential cross-sectional
    dependency (CD) in their linked errors between the mixed applied dataset turn
    into obligatory. In this pursuit, Chudik and Pesaran (2015) highlighted the importance
    of concentrating on this approach as it is identically significant for approximating
    reliable and vigorous findings simultaneously as favoring the suitable heterogeneous
    estimators of longitudinal panel data analysis. To do this, this research syndicates
    and performs the scaled LM test [54], bias-corrected scaled LM test [55], Lagrange
    multiplier test [56], and Pesaran [57] to control the occurrence of potential
    CD issues. The criticality of these approaches has been additional durable in
    some earlier empirical works [58,59]. The practical results relating to such tests
    authorize the CD occurrence in the variables. The practical mathematical form
    of Pesaran''s [60] CSD approach can be approached as: (3) T = (1, 2, 3, 4, … …
    50, … … N) (4) Where explores the coefficient of correlation for stochastic residual
    estimates approximated through simple ordinary least squares. 2.2.3. Panel second-generation
    stationary tests Quantifying the appropriate approach to the possible existence
    of potential CD, the panel stationary approach to be espoused for series and matching
    long-run cointegration examination should be applied for tackling the possible
    CD problem. Individually, the cross-sectionally augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF)
    and Cross-sectionally augmented Im, Pesaran, and Shin (CIPS) approaches proposed
    by Ref. [61] were employed to influence the unit root properties of the nominated
    time series. These stationary tests are consistent and convenient for perceiving
    changes within the particular panels and the abovementioned approaches also propose
    indispensable attributes for perceiving the second-order generation in an idiosyncratic
    analysis of panel data [62]. The panel CADF stationary test statistics can be
    reported as follows: (5) The function form of the CIPS stationary test can be
    articulated as: (6) where here, and shows the cross-section averages. Further,
    the present research shows mathematically expression of the CIPS test as: (7)
    2.2.4. Panel long-term westerlund cointegration approach In the very next phase,
    comportment in attention to the possible CD issue of the variables and applied
    a panel stationary approach that offers the nominated panel characteristic, the
    consequential long-run panel cointegrating test to be employed also taken into
    understanding the CD problem in the designated sample examination. Subsequently,
    the traditional and first-generation long-run cointegration approaches could produce
    inconsistent and ambiguous results under the long-run cointegration examination
    for rejecting a null hypothesis (H0) of the no long-run cointegration. Accordingly,
    the 2nd generation Westerlund [63] approach was employed to confront the problem
    of conceivable CD and afterward validate precision with a gaze to the validity
    of the verdict on the H0. The Westerlund [63] long-run association approach is
    demonstrated after the rectification procedure in error term as presented in the
    below equation to control the long-run connection between time series in assessment
    with the estimated group (Gt, Gα) statistics and panel (Pt, Pα) statistics. (8)
    £ Where presents the modification and convergence adjustment speed that hindrance
    the steady balance from short-to long-run system dynamics. The Westerlund-based
    error correction model (ECM) shows the 2nd generation that includes four assorted
    test equation statistics, for example, two mean group cointegration (Gt, Ga) statistics,
    and two Panel long-run cointegration tests (Pt, Pα) statistics are explored as:
    (9) (10) (11) (12) 2.2.5. Panel long-run elasticity estimates For the estimation
    of longitudinal data analysis, this research employed the Driscoll and Kraay regression
    (D–K) developed by Ref. [64]. The standard error-based D–K method has been comprised
    beforehand in the interconnected literature [65,66]. This approach competently
    tackles the possible issues of CD, serial error correlation, and heteroscedasticity
    [65]. Another advantage of this approach is standard D–K error tackles the most
    usual problem of missing values whereas it is more appropriate for the analysis
    of both unbalanced and balanced analysis of panel data. This approach is also
    consistent and robust in contradiction of slope heterogeneity and CD in the panel''s
    series. To sum up, this study grasps the benefit and assimilating standard error
    D–K edifice for Pooled Ordinary Least Square (POLS) test throughout a multiple
    linear regression model that will be presented as follows: (13) Where: i = 1,
    2 …. …. N, and t = 1, 2 …. ….. T (T denoted time dimensions, and i presents the
    panel countries). denoted the dependent variable); presents the independent panel
    of the series, and is the random error term. This approach is the primarily suitable,
    dependable, consistent, and common pragmatic method in very up-to-date studies
    [65,66]. Moreover, Reed and Ye [67], proposed the Feasible Generalized Least Square
    (FGLS) method to tackle numerous longitudinal data examination problems for instance
    FGLS is proficiently employed in the occurrence of serial correlation, heteroscedasticity,
    imaginable CD, and slope heterogeneity together employing the Monte Carlo simulation
    from the panel research. This test performs more competently and generates consistent
    results when the cross-section number (i) is fewer against the time dimensions
    (N < T) in the dataset as this is impeccably fit in this study case. The parameters
    and variables for the FGLS estimators’ parameters are presented in the subsequent
    equation as follows: (14) € € (15) € In Eq. (15), € includes latent conjecture
    regarding potential CD, serial correlation, and heteroskedasticity in the contemporaneous
    error term. 2.2.6. Panel non-causality Dumitrescu and Hurlin(D-H) approach When
    the detection of the long–run connection of the selected panel series validates
    in the estimation of the panel dataset, it is important to determine the direction
    of causality association among variables. To do this, the present research used
    the panel non-causality approach developed by Dumitrescu and Hurlin [68] to determine
    the causality–direction association between the panel-selected time series. Newly,
    this approach is extensively applied in recent literature [58,62,65]. This causality
    approach has many advantages for example it accounts for the potential problem
    of slope heterogeneity and CD in the dataset. The D-H approach accomplishes spectacularly
    in the case of smaller data et . Moreover, Dumitrescu and Hurlin [68] approach
    also can be worked efficiently in both unbalanced and balanced datasets. The Dumitrescu
    and Hurlin [68] test can be expressed as follows: (16) While presents the optimal–lag–length
    selection, and to examine the H0 is “Z does not Granger cause X” for all i (cross–sections).
    3. Empirical findings and discussions The existence of a correlation and unit
    root between units should be tested to ascertain which of the first and second-generation
    long-run relationship approaches applies to the study. To ensure whether disturbances
    in the panel series are CD or not, we first employed cross-sectional dependence
    tests. The results of Pesaran''s [57] CD test and Pesaran''s [61] cross-sectionally
    augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) approaches are demonstrated in Table 3. According
    to the results, it is evidenced that the CD test strongly rejects the null hypothesis
    of no CD, confirming the CD across the selected provinces in China. CADF test
    results also indicate that all series are non-stationary at level but stationary
    at first difference. Based on these findings, panel Pedroni [69,70], Kao [71],
    and Westerlund cointegration tests [63] are performed to investigate the long-run
    relationships as the next step. Table 3. Findings of CD and CADF unit root tests.

    Table 4 displays the outcomes of the Pedroni panel and Kao residual-based cointegration
    tests. At a significance level of 1%, the null hypothesis of no cointegration
    connection is rejected by four out of the seven panel tests. The results obtained
    from the Kao residual cointegration test provide evidence supporting the presence
    of a long-term cointegration relationship among the variables included in the
    model. Based on the findings from the Westerlund ECM panel cointegration tests,
    the null hypothesis cannot be rejected using either the Ga or the Pa test. However,
    it can be rejected using the Gt and Pt tests at the 10% and 1% significance levels
    respectively. These results confirm a cointegration relationship between grain
    yields, computer usage, fertilizer, pesticide, power, irrigated area, and rural
    labour in China, as shown in Table 5. Table 4. Findings of cointegration tests.

    the cointegration relationship, two estimators, namely the Feasible Generalized
    Least Squares (FGLS) approach and the D-K method, are utilized to manage the long-term
    equilibrium association in the co-integrated panels. Table 6 displays the estimated
    evidence for both the FGLS and D-K approaches. All the variables, except irrigated
    area, were articulated in natural logarithms, so the coefficients projected from
    both methods can be construed as elasticity. The results obtained using the FGLS
    estimator indicate a significant positive relationship between computer usage
    and grain yields. Specifically, the findings suggest that a 1% increase in computer
    usage is associated with a corresponding 0.04% increase in grain yields. The utilization
    of smart farming technologies and farmers'' computer proficiency can enhance the
    efficiency of decision-making processes and facilitate the identification of optimal
    crop management strategies [72]. In recent times, there has been notable progress
    in the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology in enhancing crop production,
    agricultural monitoring systems, real-time weather monitoring, harvesting processes,
    resource utilization, and the overall efficiency of agro-based businesses. Artificial
    Intelligence (AI)-enabled technology, including computer control systems, deep
    learning algorithms, and smart-farming techniques, can be employed to predict
    future crop yields and optimize agricultural conditions. To optimize crop planning
    and cycles, farmers must possess knowledge regarding the soil properties of their
    fields and farms during the stages of planting and harvesting. According to a
    report published by the McKinsey Company [73] in 2022, the field of agriculture
    exhibits a lower level of digitalization in comparison to several other industries
    on a global scale. The aforementioned findings align with recent empirical research
    that has reached comparable conclusions on the positive impact of computer usage
    [74], Internet usage [47,[75], [76], [77], [78]], Internet technology [28], broadband
    connections [79], and ICT [80] on the efficiency and productivity of agricultural
    production. Table 6. Findings of long-run elasticity estimates. A) Cross-sectional

    NS Denotes non-significant. Moreover, it is worth noting that the application
    of fertilizer and the expansion of irrigated areas both contribute positively
    to the enhancement of grain yields. This implies that a 1% increase in fertilizer
    consumption and intensification of irrigated areas leads to a corresponding increase
    in grain output by 0.01% and 0.07% respectively. The utilization of fertilizers
    to enhance soil fertility constitutes a fundamental aspect of contemporary agricultural
    practices. The expansion of agricultural land experienced a constrained growth
    of 15% from 1961 to 2015; however, the application of nitrogen fertilizers witnessed
    a substantial increase of over eightfold over the same time frame. Chemical fertilizers
    have a significant role in enhancing agricultural output, particularly in developing
    nations. According to Adhikari and Ramana ([81], it has been asserted that chemical
    fertilizers have contributed to around 50% of the rise in agricultural output
    in emerging nations. Nevertheless, the overutilization and unselective use of
    fertilizers give rise to challenges with ecosystem services. Furthermore, the
    estimated results indicated that the consumption of pesticides and the utilization
    of power have a negative effect on grain yields. Based on the findings, it can
    be observed that a marginal increase of 1% in pesticide consumption and electricity
    usage results in a reduction of grain output exceeding 0.03%. The findings showed
    that there is no statistically significant relationship between rural labor and
    grain yields. The results of the D-K test exhibit comparable outcomes with the
    results obtained from the FGLS analysis. The estimated evidence of the D-K method
    exhibits a high degree of similarity to the results obtained by the FGLS approach.
    The effects of a 1% increase in computer use, fertilizer use, and irrigated areas
    are 0.04%, 0.02%, and 0.15% increase in grain yields, respectively. However, though
    pesticide and power use reduce grain yields by approximately 0.02%, the coefficients
    are not significant. In contrast to the FGLS test results, the effect of rural
    labor on grain yield was found to be adverse but significant in the D-K test.
    The results of our study align with previous research conducted in various countries,
    which also examined the relationship between control variables and agricultural
    productivity. For instance, a study conducted in Pakistan [9] found a significant
    impact of fertilizer consumption on cereal productivity. Similarly, research conducted
    in China [53] demonstrated the influence of pesticides and chemical fertilizers
    on soybean yields. Additionally, studies conducted in ASEAN countries [82] highlighted
    the impact of cropped areas and rural labor on cereal production and agricultural
    value-added. Furthermore, research conducted in Asian countries [83] explored
    the influence of total fertilizer usage on agricultural value-added. The computer
    usage elasticity acquired through the ARDL technique is found to be within a similar
    range as the coefficients obtained through the FGLS and D-K estimations, as demonstrated
    in Table 7. This comparison serves as a robustness check for the ARDL method estimations.
    Consequently, the utilization of computer by 1% exhibits a notable enhancement
    in grain yields, resulting in a 0.04% increase. The primary impartial for ensuring
    food security should be the enhancement of technological accessibility, as agricultural
    efficiency is crucial in enabling a majority of farmers to produce commodities
    with limited and scarce resources. This, in turn, can lead to reduced unit costs
    and decreased agricultural prices. Furthermore, the ARDL model''s results about
    the impact of variables such as fertilizer use, pesticide use, power consumption,
    irrigated areas, and rural workforce on grain output were found to be congruent
    with the findings of the FGLS and D-K techniques. Additionally, Fig. 6 illustrates

    full-size image Fig. 6. Long-run outcomes of FGLS, D-K, and ARDL methods. We test
    the causal interaction among our dependent and selected regressors using Dumitrescu
    and Hurlin [68] panel Granger non-causality approach, as can be seen in Table
    8. There is a strong causal relationship between grain yields and all of the model''s
    regressors, which means that each agricultural input plays a key role in the production
    of grain yields. The causality test findings also reveal a bilateral causal association
    between grain yields and fertilizer use, grain yields and pesticide use, and finally,
    between grain yields and rural labor. The causality findings are intriguing because
    they support the FGLS and D-K estimates of the results. What inferences may be
    made regarding causality based on these findings? In addition to disseminating
    meteorological data and facilitating the adoption of innovative agricultural practices,
    the utilization of computers assists farmers in the management and maintenance
    of records. Agricultural management information systems can be highly beneficial
    due to their ability to deliver up-to-date information on environmental conditions.
    The influence of diverse technical improvements on the agricultural industry is
    evident, as it is anticipated to affect agricultural performance in both direct
    and indirect ways. As indicated by Ma et al. [75], investment in ICT adoption
    in the agriculture industry can enhance the probability of obtaining loans. Farmers
    can employ programming techniques to automate the adjustment of fertilizer quantities,
    taking into account the specific requirements of both the crops and the soil.
    This practice contributes to the enhancement of soil quality and the augmentation
    of crop productivity. The results of the study provide strong evidence in favor
    of the positive impact of fertilizers on enhancing crop yield. Farmers can enhance
    crop output and optimize land usage by adopting a strategic approach to planting
    seeds. By planting seeds more sparsely in low-productivity agricultural areas
    and more thickly in high-productivity fields, farmers may effectively increase
    their crop yield. This practice not only enables farmers to produce more food
    on a smaller land area but also offers protection to crops against pests, diseases,
    and weeds. Table 8. Results of the D-H causality tests. Null Hypothesis W-Stat.

    is increasingly acknowledged as a powerful tool for improving profitability and
    sustainability in the field of agricultural development. The use of computers
    is widely acknowledged as a crucial factor in generating significant progress
    in agricultural sustainability in the face of climate change. The use of computer
    technology into agricultural production systems has profoundly transformed the
    techniques utilized in food production. Technology has enabled farmers to monitor
    and improve various aspects of their agricultural practices, including soil quality,
    irrigation, and insect management. Farmers can optimize their decision-making
    processes for crop planting, fertilizing, and harvesting by employing sensors,
    drones, and other advanced technology. These instruments facilitate the gathering
    and examination of data, hence promoting enhanced agricultural practices. Moreover,
    computer technology has enabled farmers to have easier access to markets, increased
    communication with consumers, and more efficient financial management. Through
    the utilization of e-commerce platforms and mobile applications, farmers may directly
    sell their products to consumers, bypassing intermediaries and effectively reducing
    their expenses. Furthermore, individuals have the opportunity to access financial
    services, such as loans and insurance, which can help reduce risks and support
    investment in their endeavors. Hence, the main objective of this research is to
    assess the importance of taking into account computer usage as a technological
    advancement regarding processing grain yield in China. By handling key control
    variables as inputs and accounting for the importance of computer use during the
    grain production process, we used sophisticated econometric techniques. To this
    end, we employed grain production data covering the main grain-producing regions
    of China for the period 2002–2020. As per the results, a significant estimate
    of the implied yield-computer usage response elasticity is about 0.04. Besides,
    the short-run and long-run effects between grain yield and other agricultural
    inputs proxied by control variables such as fertilizer and pesticide usage, power
    usage, irrigated area, and rural labor were also examined. Consequently, the findings
    show that fertilizer usage and irrigated areas positively impact grain yield,
    while pesticide usage, power usage, and rural labor significantly reduce grain
    production in China. While our study has given us valuable insights, we need to
    be aware of some limitations that come with the territory of studying how technology
    and farming connect. Our focus on how using computers affects grain production,
    in line with what Lezoche et al. [43] and Ma et al. [75] talked about, might miss
    out on other things influencing farming outcomes. While we''re filling a gap in
    what we know, not looking at how computers connect with other technology or outside
    influences, as Lezoche et al. [43] pointed out, is a limitation we should think
    about in future research. Lastly, what we found might only apply directly to China,
    as suggested by Kaila and Tarp [47] and Li et al. [29]. These limitations show
    us where our study might fall short and give us ideas for future research. Our
    research extends from a substantial body of existing literature that has investigated
    the potential for transformation through the use of information and communication
    technology (ICT) in agriculture within the context of China. The literature has
    consistently emphasized the positive impact of ICT on various facets of agricultural
    practices, corroborated by studies such as Lezoche et al. [43], Ma et al. [75],
    and Deng et al. [45]. These prior investigations underscored the potential of
    ICT in enhancing agricultural productivity, fostering technological innovation,
    and increasing income for rural households. However, our study takes a distinctive
    step forward by concentrating specifically on the relationship between computer
    utilization and grain production, an aspect that, surprisingly, has been overlooked
    in the existing literature. While existing literature broadly supports the positive
    consequences of ICT adoption in agriculture, our findings suggest a nuanced relationship
    between computer utilization and grain production in China. Our study agrees with
    what Lezoche et al. [43] and Ma et al. [75] suggested - that using computers can
    help make farming more productive. However, our specific focus on grain production
    unveils complexities not previously addressed in the literature. Methodologically,
    our study aligns with the existing literature''s emphasis on robust econometric
    techniques. Similar to studies such as Deng et al. [28] and Ma et al. [75], we
    employed advanced panel data estimation techniques, including FGLS and the D-K
    method, to ensure the robustness of our results. The application of the panel
    autoregressive distributed lag (PARDL) model, as well as tools like the Westerlund
    ECM panel cointegration test and the Dumitrescu-Hurlin causality approach, contributes
    methodological depth to our analysis, aligning with the methodological sophistication
    observed in the literature. In considering future directions, a more in-depth
    exploration of regional variations within China could yield valuable insights
    into context-specific factors influencing the relationship between ICT adoption
    and grain production. How exactly do these findings contribute to agricultural
    development? The implementation of sophisticated computer systems, specifically
    those powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), enables precision agriculture.
    By integrating computer systems into the agricultural process, it is possible
    to forecast environmental conditions and precipitation, maximize irrigation efficiency,
    minimize surplus labor, and optimize all other external inputs. All of these enable
    producers to maximize yield at the lowest possible cost by maximizing the utilization
    of all available resources. However, there are several drawbacks to using computer
    technology in agriculture. It necessitates large investments in hardware, software,
    and training, which may be prohibitively expensive for small-scale farmers. When
    lending to farmers, financial institutions should consider computer technology
    investments. Improving finance access as an agricultural policy instrument can
    undeniably improve the adaptive capacity of agricultural processes and all other
    farming systems affecting long-term investments in agri-business sectors. In general,
    sustainable farming systems rely on the adoption of appropriate technologies in
    the face of global warming, particularly in high-risk locations. Farmers'' long-standing
    issues should be mitigated by agricultural transformation, primarily through the
    use of technical advancements such as computer use, robots, GPS technology, and
    all other information systems. Further study is needed to evaluate these technologies
    in varied farming and market systems under varying finance availability conditions
    and government intervention scenarios. Declaration of interests The authors declare

  description: In recent times, India has witnessed a remarkable surge in agricultural
    production, surpassing the demand and establishing itself as a leading global
    exporter in agronomy and horticulture crops. However, it is important to note
    that this sector has also been associated with environmental impacts, contributing
    to various forms of pollution that negatively affect water, soil, air quality,
    and human health. To address the environmental impact of food production, it is
    essential to assess the overall environmental consequences of the entire food
    supply chain. Maize cultivation significantly impacts the environment, especially
    concerning resource usage and the environmental effects of fertilizer, insecticides,
    and electricity production. In order to evaluate the environmental consequences
    associated with maize cultivation, a life cycle assessment was conducted using
    the cradle-to-farm gate approach. The aim was to quantify and pinpoint the system’s
    environmental hotspots. A land-based functional unit (i.e., one hectare of potato
    cultivation) has been taken in the study. For the evaluation of environmental
    correlations and estimation of potential environmental impact, the LCA research
    incorporated the use of SimaPro version 9.5 software in conjunction with the ReCiPe
    midpoint and endpoint methods. This selected approach facilitated the assessment
    of all inputs and outputs included in the study, providing valuable insights into
    their environmental implications. The characterization results show that fertilization,
    irrigation, sowing, and harvesting have considerable environmental impacts, with
    fertilization having the most influence. Irrigation contributes 94.5 percent to
    water usage and 21.3 percent to freshwater eutrophication. Based on the recipe
    endpoint scores, the overall impact totals 144.8 points, with human health prominently
    leading at 129.0 points. Additionally, in order to see the environmental and economic
    viability of the selected crop an alternative scenario along with life cycle costing
    has been performed.

    2020 Introduction Agriculture is coming under ever-increasing amounts of pressure
    to keep up with the booming demands of civilization for food, fiber, bioenergy,
    and animal feed (Foley et al. 2011). In light of the growing scarcity of land,
    the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO 2014) recognizes crop intensification
    as the most viable option. Over the course of several decades, increases in agricultural
    output have been accomplished in part by expanding the use of fertilizers and
    pesticides, extending fieldwork operations (for example, irrigation) and automation
    of machinery (Gil et al. 2019). However, these contemporary agricultural techniques
    have a broad variety of negative consequences on the environment, such as the
    reduction of biodiversity and the depletion of fossil or natural resources (Guignard
    et al. 2017; Kross et al. 2022). To be more precise, agricultural production contributes
    to the emission of greenhouse gasses, the acidification of the environment, the
    eutrophication of the land, and the toxicity of the water (Shafiq and Rehman 2000).
    The Green Revolution in India has achieved self-sufficiency in food production
    (Singh 2000). However, this has led to ongoing environmental deterioration, notably
    concerning the soil, vegetation, and water resources. The amount of organic matter
    in the soil is decreasing, while the usage of chemicals is increasing (Edmeades
    2003). Even though newly introduced crops or hybrid varieties of crop demand higher
    fertilizer application, weed management, and higher water requirements, this leads
    to resource depletion and raises the environmental burden. Additionally, the intensification
    of agricultural practices over the years has resulted in the overall deprivation
    of the delicate ecosystem (Selvaraj et al. 2021). According to a recent assessment
    by the National Institution for Transforming India, a government-run research
    institution, almost 70% of all fresh water in the ground or on the surface of
    the nation is contaminated (NITI Aayog 2018). Freshwater resources in India are
    also being polluted by the discharge and infiltration of nitrates from farmland
    and the excessive application of chemical pesticides (Agrawal 2010) (Agrawal et
    al. 2010). Furthermore, natural resources are greatly decreased by agricultural
    output, which puts a significant load on the planet’s ecosystem. The magnitude
    of these impacts and how various forms of energy are utilized are largely depending
    on the agricultural management activities, the characteristics of the soil, and
    the conditions of the agroecosystem (Boone et al. 2016). Agriculture yield must
    be reshaped in a more sustainable approach. This implies that food consumption
    and production should place a greater emphasis on sustainability, producing and
    consuming foods with a reduced carbon footprint and using less land to produce
    more food. It is also projected that policymakers will steer future advancements
    toward more sustainable agriculture practices in responding to rising environmental
    consciousness. Therefore, in order to get environmental profile of farming systems,
    an assessment tool is required (Tillman 2000). The life cycle assessment is a
    methodology that has been shown to be effective in quantifying and analyzing the
    potential negative impacts on the environment that are associated with a product,
    process, or system (Fig. 1). In addition to this, it is a well-respected instrument
    for doing comprehensive research on products connected to agriculture (Andersson
    2000). LCA can assist decision makers for sustainability comparison of different
    products or processes. LCA employs the ISO 14040 and 14044 techniques to model
    the complete life cycle and assess environmental consequences, as well as an explanation
    with a range of midpoint, endpoint, and single score impact indicators (Fantin
    et al. 2017). Fig. 1 A framework of life cycle assessment along with direct applications
    Full size image Maize, renowned as the queen of cereals, is an exceptionally versatile
    crop that exhibits adaptability across various agro-climatic settings. With its
    immense genetic yield potential, maize has established its prominence in global
    grain production, accounting for 36 percent (782 million tons) of total output
    across more than 160 countries and approximately 150 million hectares of cultivation.
    The growth of maize is influenced by diverse factors, including soil conditions,
    environmental elements, ecological factors, and management practices. Notably,
    maize contributes around nine percent of India’s staple food supply (Erenstein
    et al. 2022), reflecting its significance in the country’s agricultural landscape.
    The primary factor contributing to the growth of maize production is the elevated
    demand for livestock and poultry feed. Figure 2 illustrates the life cycle assessment
    of the maize cultivation system, presenting a comprehensive overview of all the
    inputs involved. Fig. 2 LCA of maize cultivation along with all major inputs Full
    size image The review of the relevant literature found that a number of studies
    have highlighted the benefits of implementing the LCA method in terms of the ecological
    oversight of agricultural production systems. These benefits were discussed in
    the context of environmental protection and adopting contemporary agriculture
    techniques. For instance, Wang et al. (2014) studied the ecological consequences
    of wheat–maize rotation system farming in northern Thailand, highlighting high
    crop production and high resource usage efficiency. It was found that the application
    of fertilizers in the winter wheat-summer maize production system resulted in
    a decrease in global warming potential, acidification, and aquatic eutrophication.
    Another research (Wang et al. 2015) investigated the carbon footprint of one tonne
    of produced corn based on direct and indirect energy sources such as diesel, fertilizers,
    pesticides, equipment, and other inputs. They conclude that reducing farm inputs
    may reduce carbon emissions on farms while also forcing farmers to adopt contemporary
    agricultural methods. Along similar lines, Boone et al. (2016) used the ReCiPe
    and CEENE methodologies to quantify the environmental performance of grain maize
    production. The study found that farm management may have a comparatively smaller
    impact on environmental consequences when evaluated using CEENE alone. Nevertheless,
    the use of certain fertilizers and other farm management practices can play a
    substantial role in contributing to issues such as eutrophication and acidification.
    Similarly, Fantin et al. (2017) also investigated the ecological footprints of
    wheat and maize using ILCD methodology along with system boundary as cradle to
    cooperative gate. They concluded that the agriculture phase was the major hotspot
    in all impact categories. Moreover, recent research (Supasri et al. 2020) found
    crucial results in the north of Thailand by using two different databases, IDEA
    v2.0, and Ecoinvent v3.0. They have found that PM2.5 was the main contributor
    to air pollution during maize cultivation (1 kg of maize grain) according to the
    IDEA v2.0 database, followed by NOx at about 7% due to biomass burning after the
    harvest of maize. Several recent studies have also been conducted on agricultural
    practices of maize cultivation for instance (Keshavarz Afshar and Dekamin 2022)
    on different soil tillage systems, (Lal et al. 2019) on Soil health, (Afshar et
    al. 2019) on economic profitability, and (Kumar et al. 2022b, 2022a) on environmental
    impact. Despite the attention given to maize cultivation in recent studies, there
    remains a lack of comprehensive research on its environmental impact, particularly
    concerning more advanced LCA methodologies like ReCiPe midpoint and endpoint impact
    categories. Most of the earlier studies have also not covered individual agricultural
    practices. Moreover, from the geographical point of view, it has been also found
    that most of the studies have been conducted with respect to Europe and North
    American countries. The lack and difficulty in generating and collecting the LCA
    data is the major challenge that results in reduced reliability of the calculated
    results. This is the major drawback in most of the LCA studies, especially those
    based on agriculture (Goebes et al. 2003). A major issue that hinders the reliability
    of life cycle assessment (LCA), particularly within agriculture, is the lack of
    representative data inventories. This has been recognized as a significant drawback
    of the LCA methodology (Niero et al. 2015). Agricultural production systems are
    characterized by a high degree of variability due to their reliance on site-specific
    factors like soil type, climate, and the availability of water and nutrients (Fedele
    et al. 2014). Thus, it is also necessary to investigate into the regionally specialized
    research that deliberate the environmental profile and tailored to local climate
    and temporal aspects. To identify the most pressing ecological issues, this research
    examines the life cycle evaluation of maize cultivation through the lenses of
    the ReCiPe midpoint and endpoint methodologies. A sensitivity analysis was also
    performed in order to identify the most sensitive inputs to the cultivation of
    maize system. Methodology The research heavily relied on foreground data that
    was gathered from maize agricultural systems in the Jalandhar district area of
    Punjab state, India. This specific region was chosen for its favorable conditions
    and suitability for maize cultivation. A total of 30 plantation land plots located
    in the dominant areas of maize cultivation within the Jalandhar district were
    carefully identified for the purpose of data collection (Sharma et al. 2014).
    One of the key considerations in selecting these land plots was maintaining coherence
    and consistency throughout the data inventory. Therefore, farms of the same size
    were deliberately chosen to be surveyed during the crop session. This approach
    not only helped in minimizing variations caused by farm size but also allowed
    for better comparability and analysis of the collected data. The background data,
    which was unavailable, was collected from the renowned Ecoinvent database version
    3.9.1. By adopting this systematic approach and focusing on the maize agricultural
    systems in the Jalandhar district, we aimed to gather reliable and relevant data
    that would contribute to a more accurate understanding of the subject matter.
    Goal and Scope The primary goal of the study is to evaluate the ecological impacts
    and spot the major hotspot of the conventionally grown maize cultivation in the
    state of Punjab. An in-depth understanding of the results would be helpful to
    choose environment-friendly agriculture practices as well as promote more sustainable
    cultivation in terms of total environmental impacts. Moreover, this study also
    assists worldwide authorities to establish environmental policies related to agriculture
    production. Functional Unit In life cycle assessment (LCA), the functional unit
    represents the primary function being studied and serves as the reference unit
    for both inputs and outputs. As per the International standards ISO 14040–44,
    it is essential to choose the right functional unit depending upon system inputs
    and outputs (ISO 2006). In the present study area based, i.e., one hectare of
    maize cultivation has been chosen as a functional unit. As per the literature,
    area based functional unit gives outstanding results w.r.t to the other functional
    unit mainly due to it permits the comparison between low and high input/output
    systems (Cerutti et al. 2013). This study focused exclusively on crop production
    and analyzed all material and energy input and output flows up to the farm gate.
    System Boundary The system boundaries differentiate the system under analysis
    from its environment. It describes the unit process of a specific system that
    the LCA research must take into account for an accurate evaluation of the environmental
    burden (Cerutti et al. 2013). The present study is taken as a cradle-to-farm gate
    boundary system in which all activities starting from land preparation to harvesting
    have been considered (Fig. 3). The processes used to evaluate the sustainability
    of the production of maize include agriculture machinery and infrastructure, transportation
    of inputs, production of nutrients, direct emissions released due to fertilizer
    and pesticide application, electricity production, and water consumption. Fig.

    Cycle Inventory The life cycle inventory (LCI) is an important part of the study
    as the subsequent processes depend on this phase. This pertains to gathering data,
    identifying connections, and quantifying the input and output of the system being
    evaluated (Chaurasiya and Singh 2023). The information was collected via field
    survey and a standardized questionnaire at the farm level during the crop season
    2021–22. In order to prevent any errors, data was further examined by agricultural
    experts. Table 1 shows the all-field operations and input for each system was
    recorded in terms of resource use and consumption. Table 1 Life cycle inventory
    for selected boundary system of per hectare maize cultivation Full size table
    For optimal growth, maize needs a seedbed that is well-drained, well-compacted,
    and clear of weeds and stubble. One deep plowing was performed, followed by two
    or three harrowing to create a smooth and fine soil texture. During the maize
    production inventory collection, a total of 20 kg of seed was recorded. Furthermore,
    during the fertilization period, the crop’s nutrient need is rather high, and
    fertilizer treatment is deemed vital in order to achieve economic and high yields.
    The other activities related to crop management, for instance, pesticide application,
    and removal of weeding have also been recorded in terms of resources use per hectare.
    According to a field investigation, 400–700 mm of water is required to irrigate
    the crop. Because participation only partially meets the water requirement, one
    to four irrigations are usually expected, though this may vary depending on the
    participation rate and temporal attributes. In this research, we collected the
    average amount of energy used by all farms to run their water pumps. Despite these
    practices, maize has been collected for harvest once its husk has become dry and
    brown in color. The transportation of inputs was taken an average distance of
    20 km from the local market by cargo vehicle (Isuzu D-Max space cab). The output
    direct emissions from fertilizer have been taken with reference to previous studies
    (Table 2). Owing to insufficient data on the proportion of eroded soil, the discharge
    of phosphates into surface waters through erosion was not taken into account.
    Table 2 Output life cycle inventory for selected boundary system of per hectare
    maize cultivation Full size table Life Cycle Impact Assessment In order to assess
    the environmental correlations of inputs and outputs involved in the LCA research
    and to estimate their impact on the environment, the study employed SimaPro version
    8.1.0 software application. This software coupled with Ecoinvent database was
    utilized to analyze and predict the environmental implications of the collected
    data. The assessment of emissions is performed by the ReCiPe methodology with
    indicators at the midpoint and endpoint. The endpoint indicators indicate the
    impact on the environment at three higher aggregation levels, specifically (1)
    the effect on human health, (2) biodiversity and ecosystem, and (3) resource scarcity
    (Goedkoop et al. 2009). In addition, for the sake of comparison, the overall findings
    of the analysis carried out using the ReCiPe Midpoint approach were presented.
    Result and Discussion Interpretation of Midpoint Characterization Results Figure
    2 depicts the difference in the outcome and impact of maize cultivation by ReCiPe
    midpoint characterization results. The graph clearly shows that farming practices
    such as fertilization, irrigation, sowing, and harvesting have significant impacts
    on the environment. The fertilization phase contributes the most to the overall
    impact due to the production of fertilizers and the associated transportation,
    which relies heavily on fossil fuels (Khanali et al. 2020). The significant environmental
    cost of using pesticides and fertilizers supports the findings of prior studies,
    which suggest that conventional farming aims to maximize production through economically
    viable means, taking into account environmental factors to some extent (Brentrup
    et al. 2004). According to Longo et al. (2017), a significant amount of the influence
    on the natural ecosystem is attributable to the use of fertilizers, insecticides,
    and fuel by agricultural machinery (Longo et al. 2017). The irrigation phase also
    holds a significant position with the highest contribution in the water consumption
    and freshwater eutrophication impact category with the contribution of 94.5% and
    21.3%, respectively. The higher proportion made by the irrigation phase is owing
    to high water consumption as well as electricity usage while pumping water from
    ground level. The rest of the practices like sowing and harvesting contributes
    by high diesel consumption in a planter and combine harvester. As the data depicted
    Table 3, when we see the overall impact caused among the eighteen impact indicators,
    terrestrial ecotoxicity, global warming, human toxicity, and fossil resource scarcity
    indicators stand out as the most concerning. When considering these indicators,
    it would appear that the fertilization phase holds the predominant position with
    shares of more than 60 percent in each category. This results from the widespread
    utilization of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers, which subsequently leads to
    direct emissions into the environment (Longo et al. 2017). Moreover, the manufacturing
    of fertilizer shares a high value in the impact category of climate change, whereas
    fossil resource scarcity is dominant for resource usage involved during the production
    and transportation of these fertilizers (Guignard et al. 2017). The extensive
    use of synthetic fertilizers significantly increased the ecotoxicity of the ecosystem
    (Hasler et al. 2015) (Fig. 4). Table 3 Midpoint characterization values of one-hectare
    maize production Full size table Fig. 4 Midpoint characterization results of one-hectare
    maize cultivation Full size image Interpretation of Normalized Results To better
    understand the significance of the impacts associated with maize cultivation,
    it was necessary to normalize them (Prasara-A and Gheewala 2016). The ReCiPe midpoint
    model was used since it provides normalized data with points as a unit. Figure
    5 reveals that “marine ecotoxicity” is predominantly attributed (78%) to the fertilizer
    phase, due to the nitrogen and phosphorus found in surplus chemical fertilizers
    that seep into groundwater or are transported with sediment by runoff, polluting
    freshwater aquatic ecosystems and promote eutrophication (Tuomisto et al. 2012).
    The widespread use of pesticides has a significant impact on marine ecotoxicity,
    as well as, to a lesser extent, “freshwater ecotoxicity” and “human toxicity.”
    The other category, i.e., marine eutrophication and water consumption also stands
    out due to the high consumption of irrigation required which led to groundwater
    depletion as well as increased toxicity levels in waterbodies. Nutrient solution
    discharge from farmlands has a high concentration of nitrogen, which contributes
    to the eutrophication effect category. Muñoz et al. (2010) found that diverse
    water sources contribute significantly to eutrophication when discharged into
    the watercourse. Fig. 5 Normalization results of one-hectare maize cultivation
    Full size image Interpretation of Endpoint Single Score The end-point results
    are finally aggregated to achieve the single-point score which are presented in
    Fig. 6. Combining all the agriculture practices includes in maize cultivation
    the total single-score impact of 144.8 pt, in which human health appears with
    a dominant position with a share of 129.0 pt. score (Table 4). Fertilization and
    irrigation practices stand out clearly with a share of 57.75 pt and 58.87 pt,
    respectively. Furthermore, out of 57.75 pt. score by fertilization, 91.5% of the
    contribution comes from the human health category. In similar lines, 85.3% of
    the 58.87 pt. score of the irrigation practice is contributed by human health-related
    indicators. Fig. 6 Endpoint point-wise score of one-hectare maize cultivation
    Full size image Table 4 Point-wise score by ReCiPe endpoint results of one-hectare
    maize production Full size table Alternative Scenario After a careful evaluation
    of the inputs and outputs in the previous section LCA, the current section involves
    the LCA conducted in an alternative scenario. This scenario is based upon reductions
    in the quantities of several inputs and the replacement of certain energy sources
    with more sustainable alternatives. The major target of designing such a scenario
    is to compare the impacts of reducing the chosen inputs on the overall yields
    and thus evaluate the whole process ecologically as well as financially. For the
    current study, the quantity of fertilizer (UREA, DAP, and MOP) was all reduced
    by 30% throughout the crop cycle to reduce the same share of emissions during
    their manufacturing while also lowering costs. The selection of this reduction
    in fertilizer quantity in the alternative scenarios has been based on the feedback
    from farmers. Farmers have expressed that further reducing the fertilizer quantity
    would result in significantly decreased yields. This reduction in yields would
    skew the results toward organic cultivation, increasing the impact per unit production
    to unsustainable levels. Hence, the fixation of the yield has been determined
    through interactive farmer surveys, considering their insights and experiences.
    Furthermore, the use of chemicals like atrazine, pendimethalin, and chlorpyrifos
    was eliminated and substituted with human labor wherever possible (for example,
    in weeding manually). Furthermore, the usage of electricity from the pump for
    irrigation purpose was taken entirely from solar photovoltaic panels in order
    to eliminate the emissions caused due to the generation of power. This was implemented
    on a 5-hectare plot adjacent to one of the plots studied under the previous LCA
    with simultaneous data collected from both sources. Table 5 shows the results
    of the base and alternative scenario in conventional maize production. Table 5
    Midpoint characterization results w.r.t to selected scenarios Full size table
    The environmental impact categories with the highest average percentage change
    in environmental burden are “Global Warming” (29.76%), “Stratospheric Ozone Depletion”
    (29.04%), “Ionizing radiation” (27.14%), “Fine particulate matter formation” (28.75%),
    “Freshwater ecotoxicity” (25.97%), “Marine ecotoxicity” (25.70%), “Human carcinogenic
    toxicity,” and “Fossil Resource Scarcity.” These categories exhibit an average
    percentage change of 26.85 percent. This reduction in environmental impacts is
    due to the lesser usage of fertilizers and the complete shift from coal-based
    electricity to solar-based electricity as well as a shift to manual removal of
    weeding instead of chemical weedicides. A major change of 29.76% toward global
    warming potential has been noted due to the lesser degree of direct and indirect
    emission released from fertilizers to the atmosphere as well usage of clean energy
    to irrigate the selected cropland (Table 5). The obtained results show that the
    reduced fertilizer usage and adopt renewable energy are responsible for the lower
    characterization of given impact categories that are depicted in Fig. 7. Furthermore,
    it has been noted that the decrease in fertilizer usage within the alternative
    scenario has resulted in a decline in yield, leading to a reduced environmental
    impact per hectare. However, this may not be beneficial as the environment impact
    per unit yield has increased. Moreover, among the 18 impact categories, the marine
    eutrophication, land use, and water consumption categories have been identified
    as having a greater ecological impact per unit yield compared to the base scenario.
    These findings underscore the need to carefully evaluate the effects of agricultural
    practices in order to effectively mitigate environmental impacts. Fig. 7 Midpoint
    characterization of alternative scenario w.r.t to individual impact categories,

    ecotoxicity, g human carcinogenic toxicity, and h mineral resource scarcity Full
    size image By adopting agricultural practices as per the alternative scenario
    is advantageous from the environmental point of view but on the contrary side,
    during the harvesting of matured maize, it has been recorded that the decline
    in maize yield of up to 18–20 percent from selected croplands compare to conventional
    maize yield (base scenario). It has been also noted that due to the reduction
    in the uptake of nutrients, the quality of maize cob decreases and the crop takes
    more time to fully ripe for harvesting. The complete removal of pesticide also
    results to pest infestation (namely stem borer), which poses the danger of huge
    losses in the yield. Impact of Reduced Fertilizers on Crop Yield The quantity
    of fertilizer used can impact the physiological and metabolic processes of plants,
    including nutrient uptake, enzyme activity, photosynthesis rate, respiration rate,
    and water balance. These factors can ultimately affect plant growth and crop yield
    (Guo et al. 2007; Szczerba et al. 2008; Yang et al. 2012) and (Ding et al. 2015).
    Nigussie et al. (2021) found that nitrogen affected the grain yield, N-uptake,
    and selected soil properties. Due to nutrient deficiency in alternative scenario
    maize, lower yields of maize produced per hectare have also been recorded (Table
    6). Low soil fertility and yields are recognized as the primary obstacles to food
    production and security in highly populated countries such as India. Consequently,
    it is essential to identify more sustainable solutions to replace synthetic fertilizers.
    Table 6 Production cost and profit of maize cultivation Full size table Recent
    research conducted by Wang et al. (2023) suggests that altering the amount of
    nitrogen fertilizer that is applied to crops may help minimize N2O emissions without
    negatively impacting crop yields. To be more specific, increasing the amount of
    nitrogen fertilizer used to the first crop during the dry, cool winter season
    and decreasing the amount applied to summer crops (such as maize) might be effective.
    This is due to the fact that summer crops are able to retain their output by using
    leftover nitrogen fertilizer from the previous crop season. In a study conducted
    by Zahir et al. [53], the researchers found that mixing urea and compost in ratios
    of 75:25 or 50:50 (based on N content) resulted in considerably greater maize
    grain yields compared to single treatments or control groups. According to the
    findings of the research, combining these two strategies is a productive way to
    increase both the profitability of yields and the productivity of soils over the
    long term. According to Fustec et al. (2009), the cropping methods that are used
    may have an impact on the nutritional status of the soil and the availability
    of those nutrients to successive crops. Nigussie et al. (2021) found that combining
    the use of compost with inorganic nitrogen fertilizer resulted in a significant
    increase in the amount of maize grain produced. They concluded that an integrated
    nitrogen treatment coupled with minimal tilling and a rotation system should be
    encouraged and that this would increase the soil characteristics and maize grain
    production. In brief, integrated fertilization, precision farming techniques,
    and partial use of agrochemicals in soils can be a more sustainable option than
    a sole application of synesthetic fertilizer and pesticides. This kind of alternates
    is not only environmentally friendly but also may economical viable for grain
    yield. On the financial front, it is obvious that the adoption of sustainable
    techniques and practices also carries a cost. This cost is either due to the heavy
    price the farmer pays of implementing technology such as solar energy assessed
    water pumping. Thus, moving toward sustainable practices directly affect the farmer’s
    income and food supply so life cycle costing has been performed in order to see
    the economic performance of the alternative scenario in comparison with the base
    scenario. Life Cycle Costing Life cycle costing (LCC) was used as an analytical
    technique in order to investigate the costs associated with the production of
    maize during the whole cultivation phase (Guinée et al. 2001). The LCC process
    for producing maize covers everything from the land preparation to its subsequent
    practices sowing, fertilization, irrigation, weedicide and pesticide, and to harvesting.
    The costs were approximated using the current market prices of energy (diesel
    and electricity) and materials (chemical fertilizer, herbicide, insecticide, etc.)
    marketed in India, which were obtained through field surveys at a marketplace,
    reputable govt. websites, and published literature. In addition, the monetary
    value of the net economic profit was calculated in terms of Indian Rupees per
    hectare or unit of output. It is determined by subtracting the price of yield
    from the calculated production costs. The cost of agricultural practices and revenues
    was calculated taking into consideration the following: The minimum rates of wage
    (“Ministry of Labour & Employment, Govt of India,” 2022) has been taken for the
    labor work of removal of weedicide manually. They generally labor more than 8
    h per day and are paid between 200 and 400 INR per day, depending on local living
    conditions The cost of diesel per liter has been taken as an average of the selected
    two crop season prices was 85.3 INR in both scenarios To irrigate the crop in
    the base scenario, the cost of electricity has been taken as zero due to the policy
    of free electricity to the agriculture sector by govt. of India (Fosli et al.
    2021). In the case of the alternative scenario as total energy has been taken
    from solar photovoltaic, so total cost of panel modules, cost of mounting and
    civil work, cost of electrical apparatus, and operational cost has been considered.
    As the average life span of solar modules to 25 years as well as the underproduction
    warranty offered by reputed manufacturers so the total cost to install the power
    generation system has been divided by 25 in accordance to consistency in data.
    This amount further has been divided by two as the two crops have been irrigated
    in a year by this solar generation unit The fixed capital or indirect costs such
    as land improvements, indirect labor, and depreciation on machinery and equipment,
    interest, rent, farm buildings, and work animals have not been considered in this
    study as the lifespan of such commodities is too long to have a significant impact
    on single crop production as stated in earlier studies (Guinée et al. 2001; Prasara-A
    and Gheewala 2016) The selling price of maize has been taken as an average of
    the last two years minimum support price approved by Government of India (“Cabinet
    Committee on Economic Affairs (Govt. of India),” 2021). The government has approved
    the minimum support prices (MSPs) for mandated Kharif crops with fair average
    quality to fulfill the commitment to the farmers to provide at least 50 percent
    return over the cost of production Using current market prices of materials and
    energy sold in the selected regions, the production of cost of maize was estimated
    to 29,007.75 INR for base scenario and 41,410.20 INR for alternative scenario
    (Table 6). The key variable related to the production cost of maize (in case of
    BS) consists of seed, fertilizers, seed, chemicals used to crop management, and
    diesel burnt in agriculture practices contribute to 46.05%, 34.47%, 10.64%, and
    7.64% of total cost, respectively. In case of alternative scenario, the cost of
    electricity generation by solar and cost of labor expenses for manual removal
    of weeding lends the major portion of total cost with the share of 28.97% and
    18.11%. When comparing the base scenario to the alternative scenario, there is
    a significant 29.95% decrease in the production cost per hectare in favor of the
    base scenario. The observed cost advantage could be attributed to the better maize
    yield, level of mechanization, and efficient resource management strategies utilized
    in the base scenario. The incorporation of weedicide machinery and automation
    technologies in the production process may have led to increased yield, reduced
    labor costs and ultimately contributed to the lower overall production cost. Conclusion
    Based on the findings, it has been established that the fertilization practice
    has the greatest impact on the overall assessment, primarily due to the production
    and transportation of fertilizers, which heavily rely on fossil fuels. Additionally,
    the irrigation phase occupies a notable position, accounting for 94.5% and 21.3%
    of water consumption and freshwater eutrophication impact categories, respectively.
    The midpoint characterization analysis also identifies terrestrial ecotoxicity,
    global warming, human toxicity, and fossil resource scarcity indicators as the
    most worrisome. Notably, the fertilization phase dominates these categories, representing
    over 60 percent shares in each of them. According to the recipe endpoint scores,
    which take into account all agricultural practices implemented in maize cultivation,
    the cumulative impact amounts to 144.8 points. Notably, human health takes the
    lead with a share of 129.0 points. Additionally, as part of the objective to promote
    eco-friendly agricultural practices, an alternative scenario was designed and
    implemented to evaluate the ecological impact of reducing specific inputs on overall
    yields. The results obtained indicate that decreased fertilizer usage and the
    adoption of renewable energy are key factors in minimizing the characterization
    of the impact categories under consideration. Furthermore, to assess the financial
    feasibility of the alternative scenario, a life cycle cost (LCC) analysis was
    performed after conducting interviews with farmers and agriculture input sellers.
    The analysis revealed a production cost surge of approximately 30 percent compared
    to the base scenario. The cost of solar-powered electricity usage, which was roughly
    29 percent, was the key variable in higher production costs in the alternative
    scenario. Overall, the LCA clearly shows environmental hotspots w.r.t different
    agriculture practices, thus highlighting the need for more sustainable agricultural
    techniques for the production of maize. Given that fertilization accounts for
    the largest portion of all environmental impact categories, it may be worthwhile
    to investigate ways to make fertilizer use more efficient in order to minimize
    waste and, thus, lessen environmental impacts. It is suggested to find sustainable
    ways of producing organic manures and fertilizers which can reduce the impacts
    related to the industrial production of various types of fertilizers. In order
    to protect the environment, restrictions on the use of fertilizers and pesticides
    must be placed up to a certain threshold. Furthermore, the study also points toward
    more effective policy formulation at the government’s end with policies designed
    to provide cheaper solar energy usage equipment to the farmers in order to make
    the alternative scenario more viable and improve the overall sustainability of
    the maize production cycle which is highly vital for the global economy. Data

  description: 'The forecasted expansion of arid and semi-arid lands worldwide due
    to climate changes requires alternatives for economically viable agricultural
    cropping systems to produce biomass for food and energy purposes under water-limited
    environments and with low emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). The cultivation
    of cactus pear (Opuntia cochenillifera) may be a viable alternative for biomass
    production in water-limited environments, to be used as animal fodder, or for
    energy purposes. Usually, cactus pear is cultivated using low technological inputs,
    such as mechanization and fertilization, but a growing number of farmers have
    been adopting management practices with greater inputs. Thus, the study aims to
    analyze the economic and energetic viability of the biomass production of cactus
    pear biomass production systems with increasing levels of technological inputs
    in the semiarid region of northeast (NE) Brazil. The research was carried out
    with primary data covering seven states in NE Brazil, under three levels of cropping
    system technological intensity: A) low; B) medium; and C) high technological intensity,
    based on the different inputs of mechanization, fertilization, irrigation, and
    other variables. A semi-structured questionnaire was applied to 54 farmers to
    collect data about crop management practices and biomass productivity of cactus
    pear production systems. Energy balances were carried out using the energy return
    on investment (EROI) method, and the economic analysis used a deterministic approach
    based on the criteria of Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return, and
    Discounted Payback. The risk was analyzed through sensitivity and stochastic Monte
    Carlo simulation analysis. System A had the lowest energy expenditure and biomass
    productivity, resulting in an EROI of 4.42, and the lowest NPV return, with a
    94.7% probability of economic viability. System B had an EROI of 3.60, therefore,
    the lowest economic viability (90.1%). System C stood out with the highest energy
    expenditure and biomass productivity, resulting in the highest EROI (5.26), economic
    return, and probability of viability (99.4%). Energy return of high intensity
    systems reached maximum values when chemical fertilization and irrigation were
    included (EROI of 6.14). Therefore, the high-intensity production system proved
    to be the most economically and energetically efficient and the most viable alternative
    for large-scale biomass production, regardless of the use of biomass for animal
    feed (fodder) or the production of biofuels. However, less productive, low-intensity
    systems are also energetically and economically viable and are easily accessible
    to small rural producers, which is an important result that supports the use of
    this crop in regions prone to desertification. The study contributes to the development
    of sustainable practices in the production of biomass in the semiarid region of
    Brazil and offers policymakers and stakeholders in the energy sector novel and
    useful information about the potential of cactus biomass as a renewable feedstock
    for biofuel production in the Brazilian semiarid region and other dry regions
    around the globe.'

    1. Introduction The production and use of biofuels is an important component of
    sustainable development, as outlined by the United Nations Sustainable Development
    Goals (UN, 2016). Therefore, one of the main objectives of the Brazilian National
    Biofuels Policy (RenovaBio) is to promote the expansion of the production and
    use of biofuels in the Brazilian energy matrix, reducing the emission of atmospheric
    pollutants caused by fossil fuels and reducing climate change (Brasil, 2017).
    Due to the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, biomass is an essential renewable
    source (Ubando et al., 2020) and it is an alternative to fossil fuels. Despite
    their recent appreciation, bioenergy and biofuels have been used by humanity since
    prehistoric times, when biomass such as wood, straw, and animal manure was used
    for heating, lighting at night, cooking food, and producing clay artifacts. Over
    time, at the end of the 18th century, vegetable oil became the main fuel for lighting
    worldwide. In 1913, ethanol was tested as a motor fuel before commercial gasoline
    production. In 1917, Alexander Graham Bell highlighted the wide variety of potential
    raw biomaterials, such as agricultural waste, grasses, and any other plant material
    capable of fermentation (Guo et al., 2015). In 2016, ethanol and biodiesel were
    the most significant renewable energy sources worldwide, covering 70% of energy
    production from renewable sources. The leading countries in biofuel and bioethanol
    production are the USA and Brazil, accounting for 86% of world production (Ferrari
    et al., 2020). However, semi-arid regions have a climate pattern that limits the
    traditional agricultural biomass used for biofuel production (Vitt et al., 2022).
    The semi-arid region of Brazil encounters similar challenges, as low and unpredictable
    rainfall patterns restrict the cultivation of sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum),
    corn, and soybeans (Glycine max), both of which represent more than 80% of the
    biomass used to produce biofuels in Brazil (Santos et al., 2016). This limitation
    is expected to become more intense since future scenarios of climate change point
    to an increase in the extent and degree of aridity of drylands around the world
    (Abel et al., 2021). Climate simulation reports an increase of 23% in the aridity
    of lands worldwide and that up to 80% of this will probably occur in developing
    countries (Cherlet et al., 2018). One potential solution for promoting socio-economic
    viability in these regions is through the development of biofuel production chains
    using plants adapted to the local soil and climate conditions (Santos et al.,
    2016). Previous research has indicated that the biomass of certain cactus pear
    species, such as (O. ficus-indica L.) Mill and (Nopalea cochenillifera L.) Salm-Dick,
    presents high potential as a feedstock for the production of ethanol and biogas
    through hydrolysis and fermentation of their cladodes (Ramírez-Arpide et al.,
    2018, Kuloyo et al., 2014, Santos et al., 2016). In the Brazilian semi-arid region,
    livestock is the main rural activity, and cactus pear species of the Opuntia and
    Nopalea genera have long been introduced and are largely cropped as animal fodder,
    due to their high tolerance to water shortages and high biomass production (Dubeux
    Jr. et al., 2015, Silva et al., 2015). However, many researchers have stated that
    cactus pear positively responds in terms of biomass stocks when subjected to improved
    technological practices such as irrigation and fertilization (Dantas et al., 2023;
    Araujo Filho et. al, 2021 and Moreira et al., 2020). Previous studies have reported
    the advantages of cactus for biofuel production and in achieving GHG reduction
    targets. For example, in Mexico, Ramírez-Arpide et al. (2019) reported low CO2
    emissions for the production of biogas, electricity, and methane from the co-digestion
    of cactus pear cladodes with animal manure. However, those authors concluded that
    the profitability of electricity generation from biogas was very narrow and emphasized
    the need to both reduce the costs of cactus biomass production in the field and
    improve the efficiency of the biodigestion system to make energy conversion more
    profitable and environmentally sustainable. The productivity and production cost
    of cactus pear biomass vary according to the species, the cultivation practices,
    the use of inorganic (chemical) or organic fertilization, climate variability,
    among other factors (López-Sandin et al., 2019). All these variables may have
    positive or negative impacts on production costs and the environment (Tavera-Cortés
    et al., 2018). The agronomic potential for cactus pear biomass production has
    been well demonstrated (Kuloyo et al., 2014, Santos et al., 2016), but the literature
    is incipient concerning energy and economic performance evaluations (Silva et
    al., 2022). For other crops, such as sweet sorghum, low, medium, and high technological
    intensity cultivation systems influenced their energy viability and calculations
    allowed identifying how to improve the cost-effectiveness of biomass production
    (López-Sandin et al., 2019). In cardoon cultivation, it was also seen that the
    type of cultivation system influenced the productivity and energy return of biomass
    production (Deligios et al., 2017). Highest energy efficiency is an essential
    condition in the production of energy crops (Budzynski et al., 2015). In general,
    crops with high biomass yield per unit area have a positive energy balance (Budzynski
    et al., 2015; Jankowski et al., 2016). An energy balance analysis makes it possible
    to identify energy inputs and outputs in the production process (Melo et al.,
    2007) and takes into account both land use and energy efficiencies (Muylle et
    al., 2015). In addition to the energy balance, economic evaluation is a significant
    parameter for the agricultural production structure, capable of inferring process
    viability and production profitability (Tirkey et al., 2022). Feasibility analysis
    can be deterministic, i.e., scenarios without variation, or stochastic, where
    uncertainties are considered and the probabilities of occurrence of costs and
    revenues are incorporated. Some tests about energy balances of cactus pear cultivation
    have already been carried out in the semi-arid Brazilian Northeast region (Silva
    et al., 2022). Based on the above, to contribute towards increasing energy efficiency
    and maximizing the profitability of agricultural systems in drylands, an energy
    and economic balance analysis was carried out, analyzing different levels of use
    of technology in cactus pear biomass production systems in the semi-arid region
    of NE Brazil. Thus, the study aimed to quantify the economic return and energy
    balance of these systems, while also identifying the most efficient and profitable
    production systems. These findings may bring significant implications not only
    for regional producers in Brazil but also for those in other dry regions of the
    globe. 2. Material and methods 2.1. Data collection Primary data were obtained
    from 54 cactus pear producers, through a survey conducted from April to August
    2021, covering 29 municipalities, in seven states (two rural producers in Alagoas,
    three in Ceará, four in Bahia, 11 in Paraíba, 31 in Pernambuco, two in Rio Grande
    do Norte, and three in Sergipe) across the semi-arid region of NE Brazil (Fig.
    1). It is important to mention, that in Brazil, almost exclusively the cactus
    Pear is used as a supplementary fodder source for livestock animals, especially
    during the dry season. The producers were selected from a group of cactus producers
    with 230 participants in WhatsApp® and from those assisted by the Agronomic Institute
    of Pernambuco State (IPA). Semi-structured questionnaires were applied to each
    cactus producer previously selected. Twenty-four producers were interviewed face-to-face,
    in the states of Pernambuco and Paraíba, and 30 producers were interviewed remotely.
    In addition to the questionnaire, direct observations were also measured in the
    cactus cultivation areas within the farms visited during the study. Download :

    of the municipality of the cactus pear producers who participated in the research.
    The producers were classified into three groups according to the level of technology
    implemented in the cactus production system: Group A) 16 farmers that adopted
    a low technological intensity, characterized by simple cropping system, where
    the land was cleared, plowed and fertilized only with animal manure (organic fertilizer);
    Group B) 18 farmers that adopted a medium technological intensity, characterized
    by conventional cropping system, where the land was cleared, plowed, harrowed
    and fertilized with organic or inorganic (chemical) fertilizers; and Group C)
    20 farmers that adopted a high technological intensity, where the land was cleared,
    subsoiled, plowed and harrowed, fertilized with organic and/or inorganic fertilizers,
    and in some cases herbicides and irrigation were applied. Direct field observations
    were restricted to producers of the C system. The inventory covered data from
    land preparation to harvesting, collecting information on land management, types
    of machinery used, amount of manure or inorganic fertilizer application, type
    and amount of herbicides applied, type and frequency of irrigation, spacing and
    number of plants per hectare, biomass harvested per hectare, and amount of labor
    used. The number of interviews had an estimated 90% confidence level and an estimated
    sampling error of 11% points on the total number of cactus pear producers in the
    semi-arid region of Brazil. Overall, there were 16 properties in system A, 18
    in system B (in which nine used inorganic fertilization and ten used only organic
    fertilization), and 20 in system C (in which seven used irrigation and 12 had
    rainfed cultivation systems). 2.2. Energy balance analysis The data obtained provided
    the basis for the construction of an energy balance (Melo et al., 2007), using
    the method known as \"energy returned on investment (EROI)” which aims to assist
    in decision-making of essential aspects of productive activities, indicating energy
    viability (Hall, 2016). The conversion of inputs and production into consumed
    and produced energies (MJ ha−1 year−1) was done from equivalent energy data obtained
    from the literature (Table 1). The energy efficiency (E) was calculated by dividing
    the total output energy (MJ) by the direct and indirect energy input. An energy
    efficiency greater than one is classified as a net energy producer and equal to
    or less than one is a net energy consumer. Table 1. Energy equivalent of each

    4.5 Tabatabaeefar et al. (2009) The total energy (MJ ha−1 year−1) expended in
    the agricultural activity was obtained from Eq. 1 (López-Sandin et al., 2019).
    (1) Where ET is the total energy used; EM is the energy in materials, manufacturing,
    and transportation; EF is the energy in fuel; ELF is the energy in lubricants
    and filters; EMR is the energy in maintenance and repair; ES is energy in seeds;
    EFHP is energy in fertilizers, herbicides, and pesticides; EE is energy in electricity;
    EL is energy in labor; and Ei is energy invested in irrigation water. EM comprehends
    the value referring to the energy used in the production of tractors and implements.
    The energy spent in fieldwork was calculated from an adaptation of the method
    used by López-Sandin et al. (2019) and Paneque; Fernandes & Oliveira (2002), represented
    in Eq. 2. (2) Where MT and MM are the masses in kg of the tractor and machinery;
    EMT and EMM are the energies per unit mass (MJ kg−1), HMT and Hm are the number
    of hours per hectare per year (h ha−1 year−1) and VT and VM are the useful life
    in hours of the tractor and agricultural implements, respectively. The useful
    lifetime of the tractor and implements were considered to be 10,000 and 2000 h,
    respectively (Pacheco, 2000). The mass values of the machines were obtained from
    the manufacturer''s technical data. EF was obtained by the product of the volume
    of fuel consumption (L ha−1 year−1), and the equivalent energy (EF), as shown
    in Eq. 3. In the estimation of ELF e EMR the values of 5% of EC and 129% of Em
    were adopted (Paneque et al., 2002). (3) Fuel consumption was obtained from the
    product of the number of hours spent on the activity per hectare, the conversion
    coefficient of 0.25, and the tractor power (P), according to Eq. 4 (Pacheco, 2000).
    (4) The energy related to the planted cladodes and the fertilizers and herbicides
    was obtained by Eq. 5. The energy expenditure with insecticides was not considered,
    since no considerable equivalent value was obtained for calculations. (5) Where
    MC and MF are the masses in kg ha−1 of the planted cladodes and fertilizers used,
    respectively; MD is the dry matter proportion of the cactus pear (%); EECLA, EEFER,
    and EEHER are energy equivalent in MJ kg−1 of the planted cladodes, the fertilizers
    and the herbicides used, respectively; and VH is the volume in L ha−1 year−1 of
    herbicides. The energy invested in human labor, EL, was calculated from the methodology
    used by Tabatabaeefar et al. (2009), using Eq. 6, in which both manual labor and
    the tractor driver''s work are taken into account. Assumed that human labor in
    agricultural activities was eight hours per day. (6) Where Tman and Tmec are the
    hours of work per hectare per year, and Eman and Emec correspond to the equivalent
    energy in MJ h−1 of manual and mechanical work, respectively. The EE considered
    in this study refers to the consumption of electricity from the use of a hydraulic
    pump for irrigation and is most common in the C system, but in a few cases also
    used in the A system. The energy obtained from the cactus pear harvest (output
    energy) in MJ ha−1 year−1 was calculated from Eq. 7, in which the product between
    the average green matter (GM) productivity per hectare per year and the lower
    calorific value (LCP) in MJ kg−1 and dry matter (DM) percentage of the biomass
    was considered. (7) The dry matter concentration of cacti pear varies widely according
    to genus and species, with values ranging from 6.1% to 17.1% (Frota et al., 2015).
    Thus, the average dry matter content of 10% was considered for calculations (Lima
    et al., 2015). The PCI values of the varieties of cactus pear do not differ significantly
    and the value of 14 MJ kg−1 was used (Pinos-Rodríguez et al., 2010). However,
    20% of the interviewees were unable to provide complete information about the
    specifications regarding the machinery used, the number of hours of manual labor
    for the cultivation, or the productivity obtained. In these cases, literature
    values consistent with the reality of the producer''s harvest were sought. 2.3.
    Statistical analysis The energy balance and other data were subjected to an analysis
    of variance (ANOVA) of the non-parametric type, using the Kruskal-Wallis test,
    since the data did not follow normality. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney post hoc test
    was used (Mann and Whitney, 1947, Wilcoxon, 1945) after the Kruskal-Wallis test.
    Multiple pairwise comparisons were performed, comparing EROI values between cropping
    systems, productivity, time of planting, level of education of the rural producers,
    and their age. The tests were run using the R Core Team Software (2021). 2.4.
    Financial analysis of the production systems Initially, a deterministic analysis
    was made for the three systems with increasing technological intensity, in which
    the study variables were considered constant. The variables considered are shown
    in Table 2. Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), and discounted
    payback (DPB) were used as viability indices. In the second step, a sensitivity
    analysis was performed to identify the variables with the greatest impact on the
    system, using NPV as a selection metric. Finally, a stochastic analysis was carried
    out, varying the costs of cactus pear seed and human labor in the field and the
    final sale price of the cactus produced. The average biomass productivity in the
    systems was defined based on the reported volume harvested annually by the producers,
    then converted to kg per hectare. These values were used in a stochastic simulation
    model to define the biomass productivity distribution in each group. The decision
    to choose this method was taken because of the high environmental variability
    in the semi-arid region of NE Brazil, which leads to high variability of cactus
    biomass productivity during different growing seasons. Table 2. Prices ($ USD)

    = Man Day NPV uses the flow of expenditures and receipts over a future cash flow,
    converting the future values of the series to a current value, based on a fixed
    discount rate. Eq. 8 presents the NPV formulation. It should be noted that for
    a production system to be considered viable, the NPV must be greater than zero
    (Arnold and Yildiz, 2015). (8) Where: I is the investment; C1 to Cn represent
    annual cash flows; n is the number of periods (10 years); r is the discount rate.
    The discount rate used was calculated considering the cost of equity capital,
    with an unleveraged β of 0.81, and incorporating the investment risk in Brazil
    (Damodaran, 2022). Complementing the NPV, the internal rate of return (IRR) was
    evaluated (Eq. 10), corresponding to the moment when the NPV equals zero (Doile
    et al., 2021). It should be noted that in this study the IRR was compared with
    an appropriate interest rate of 6%. For IRR values higher than the minimum attractiveness
    tax (TMA), the investment is viable. (9) The payback period of the investment
    was also evaluated, for which the Discounted Payback (DPB) was used. The method
    differs from the traditional payback in that all future flows are considered on
    date zero, based on the study''s discount rate. Eq. 10 and Eq. 11 present the
    formulations to obtain this index (Oliveira et al., 2022). (10) (11) Based on
    the concept of discounted cash flow (DCF), Cn is the cash flow in period n; r
    indicates the discount rate; PF is the final period with negative cumulative discounted
    cash flow; B is the absolute value of the accumulated discounted cash flow at
    the end of period L; and A is the discounted cash flow during the period after
    L. In the third stage, the uncertainties associated with the cactus pear cultivation
    process were included. For this, Monte Carlo simulations (SMC) were used (Arnold
    and Yildiz, 2015). According to Rocha et al. (2017) the possible stochastic values,
    determined from a probability density function (PDF; Table 3), are associated
    with a probabilistic model. The variables of the purchase cost of cactus pear,
    the cost of human labor in the field, the final sale price of the cactus produced,
    and productivity were tested. In cases where it was not possible to obtain the
    PDF, an adequate empirical approach was performed (Arnold and Yildiz, 2015). Table

    analysis The most widely cultivated species of cactus pear in the region are Opuntia
    stricta Haw (clone “Orelha de Elefante Mexicana”) and Nopalea cochenillifera Salm
    Dick) (clones “Miúda” and “Sertânia”), which were present in 91%, 61%, and 35%
    of the cultivated areas, respectively (Fig. 2). Other clones like “Gigante” and
    “Redonda”, both of the species Opuntia fícus-indica Mill, and “Orelha de Elefante
    Africana” (Opuntia stricta Haw) were also reported to be cultivated, but in a
    smaller proportion, being observed in only 18% of the farms visited. The farmers
    cultivate cactus pear as a strategic fodder source for their livestock (goats,
    sheep, and cattle), especially during the dry season. The processing of cactus
    pear biomass to be offered to the animals commonly consists of harvesting, chopping,
    and placing the cladodes in troughs. Download : Download high-res image (47KB)

    pear clones on rural properties visited in the Brazilian semi-arid region during
    the study. There was a significant variation in the area cultivated with cactus
    pear among the farms included in the study, with the smallest ones being one hectare
    (ha) or less in all three systems, and the largest reaching 35, 85, and 115 ha
    cultivated with cactus pear in systems A, B and C, respectively. The cactus field
    size averaged 9.6 ha. The average size of the cultivated areas observed in the
    present study is similar to that reported in Soledade municipality, which was
    less than ten ha (Ramos et al., 2014), and larger than those in the Cariri region,
    which averaged 3.7 ha (Leite et al., 2014), both in Paraíba state. Almost all
    producers used agricultural mechanization for land preparation (Table 4), the
    exception being only 12.5% of those in the low technological intensity system
    (A), which used animal traction to plow the soil. Among the farmers that use mechanization,
    all of them rented tractors, a practice also followed by most (55.6%) of those
    in the medium technological intensity system (B) compared with only 20% in the
    high technological intensity system (C). This high use is attributed to a lack
    of available human labor, but planting and harvesting, in all systems, are done
    manually, with high labor requirements. Therefore, the relative efficacy of the
    mechanical and manual operations may influence the decision. Efficient planting
    and harvesting machines are not commercially available, probably because they
    have to be designed specifically for the crop and the demand is still too low
    to attract machinery-building companies. As labor tends to become scarcer and
    more expensive in the region (Mason et al., 2015), the pressure for mechanization
    may increase. Table 4. Use of agricultural machinery (tractor and implements)

    322,543.66 472,147.47 Average of EROI 4.42 3.60 5.26 In all the systems analyzed,
    the most energy invested came from the cactus pear cladodes used as seedlings
    at planting. System B had the highest average investment for producing biomass,
    consuming more inorganic fertilizers (4907.25 MJ ha−1 year−1), herbicides (261.48
    MJ ha−1 year−1), and manual labor (6690.42 MJ ha−1 year−1) than the other systems
    studied. While system A had the lowest input energy investment in cactus pear
    production, it excelled only in animal traction labor energy (27.60 MJ ha−1 year−1).
    Finally, system C stood out for the highest energy consumption in fuel (9272.15
    MJ ha−1 a−1), irrigation (462.40 MJ ha−1 year−1), and electricity (431.65 MJ ha−1
    year−1). Even though system C uses more intense mechanization, the work of distributing
    the seedlings at planting and the cutting at harvesting the biomass from the plants
    is still performed manually. System C is marked by the use of traditional practices
    in the cultivation of cactus pear for livestock fodder in northeast Brazil. In
    general, the energy spent on fuel and electricity in the systems analyzed has
    a share of renewable sources. In 2022, the share of renewable sources in the Brazilian
    electricity matrix was more than 87% (Empresa de Pesquisa Energética - EPE, 2023),
    while in the transportation sector, the inclusion of biodiesel in fossil diesel
    was 10% (Ministério de Minas e Energia - MME, 2022), rising to 12% in 2023 and
    promising to reach 15% in 2026 (MME, 2023). Thus, for the scenarios analyzed,
    it corresponds that in system A and C, for pumping the irrigation system, an average
    of 87.70 MJ and 379.42 MJ of electricity were spent, respectively, from renewable
    sources, while 12.07 MJ and 52.23 MJ, respectively, were from non-renewable sources.
    With regard to the fuel used in the tractors, it can be understood that, for all
    the systems, there was a saving of 10% from non-renewable sources. Among the studied
    farmers, 28% did not perform any treatment to control weeds, while 28% reported
    the use of manual harms and weddings, even though the cultivation of cactus pear
    for forage production responds positively to weeding (Ramos et al., 2014). Although
    there are still no registered herbicides in Brazil for weed control in cactus
    pear cultivation areas (Lira et al., 2017), it was observed that 35% of the producers
    interviewed applied herbicide by using a hand pump and 9% with a mechanized sprayer,
    the latter being used only by producers in system C. The system that stood out
    with the highest average energy consumption in herbicides was system B (261.48
    MJ ha−1 year−1), corresponding to 35% of those using this input. Although system
    B invested more in fertilizer inputs and labor, its productivity was lower than
    that of system C (Table 5), which used more intensive mechanization. The cactus
    plantations of system A presented lower productivity, probably due to the lower
    density of plants per hectare, the limited application of organic fertilizer,
    and the absence of inorganic fertilizer. In the studies of Ramos et al. (2014),
    they verified that the low fertility of soils and the lack of use of fertilizers
    were the main factors limiting cactus pear productivity in the region of Cariri,
    Paraíba State, the driest zone in the Brazilian semiarid. It should be emphasized
    that the use of inorganic fertilizers should be done according to the results
    of soil analysis (Lira, 2017), which is difficult for cactus producers to do,
    and they usually opt for organic fertilization with animal manure (Souza et al.,
    2019). In the energy balance, organic fertilization was not considered because
    it is a waste product. In the interviews, it was observed that 96.3% of the producers
    use animal manure, which is generally obtained from livestock corrals within their
    farms. All the systems analyzed had a positive EROI value given the environmental
    conditions of cultivation, showing that the systems traditionally adopted for
    cactus pear production as forage in the Brazilian semiarid region have energy
    viability (Table 5). In an overall analysis of the three systems, per hectare
    per year, system C had the highest EROI with a value of 5.26, meaning that the
    energy produced is 5.26 times higher than the energy invested. The lower value
    of 3.6 for system B, despite its good productivity, resulted from the high investment,
    while system A showed an EROI of 4.42. If the interval from planting to harvesting
    was two years, the EROI would rise to an average of 8.73, 6.19, and 9.71 for systems
    A, B, and C, respectively, which makes energy efficiency even more interesting.
    In a more detailed analysis of EROI, taking into account also the productivity
    of biomass, as for the subdivisions of the three management systems, in Table
    6 it can be seen that in system B, in rainfed cultivation, with inorganic fertilization,
    the lowest energy efficiency (EROI of 3.21) and lowest productivity (18.78 t DM
    ha−1 year−1) were observed when compared with areas with the same system using
    only organic fertilization (EROI of 3.85 and productivity of 27.37 t DM ha−1 year−1).
    Although system C without irrigation and with inorganic fertilization had a slightly
    lower productivity (26.14 t DM ha−1 year−1) than system B without inorganic fertilization
    (27.37 t DM ha−1 year−1), it had a relevantly higher EROI than the latter. However,
    the system that showed the highest energy efficiency was system C with irrigation
    and inorganic fertilization, having an EROI of 6.14, and obtaining the highest
    productivity (37.03 t DM ha−1 year−1). Table 6. Comparison between the average
    values of productivity and Energy Returned On Investment (EROI) of cropping systems
    of low technological intensity (A), medium technological intensity (B) with and
    without synthetic fertilization and high technological intensity (C) with or without

    Brazilian semi-arid region. Technological level of cropping system Fertilization
    and irrigation practices Average Productivity (tDM ha−1 year−1) Average EROI A
    Without inorganic fertilizer 14.57 4.42 B With inorganic fertilizer 18.78 3.21
    Without inorganic fertilizer 27.37 3.85 C Without irrigation and without inorganic
    fertilizer 36.22 4.05 Without irrigation and with inorganic fertilizer 26.14 5.62
    With irrigation and without inorganic fertilizer 28.33 4.57 With irrigation and
    with inorganic fertilizer 37.03 6.14 Based on these results, it was observed that,
    without the use of irrigation, the application of inorganic fertilizers in the
    semi-arid region leads to low energy and economic efficiency, given the low availability
    of water in the environment, which may not be sufficient for the solubilization
    of nutrients and uptake by the plants. Thus, the combination of inorganic fertilization
    with irrigation, as well as the use of intensive mechanization for soil preparation
    and, in some cases, also in crop care, proved to have favorable energy and biomass
    yields, which is relevant in the cultivation of cactus pear, although it still
    relies heavily on labor for planting and harvesting. System A had the lowest yield
    (14.57 t DM ha-1 year-1) and used little or no agricultural machinery. It also
    did not use any inorganic fertilizer and had the least amount of energy efficiency.
    However, it was better than system B and even system C without inorganic fertilizer
    when it came to using energy. Although the cactus cropping management systems
    in the Brazilian semiarid region has been increasing the use of technology in
    recent years, even today the majority of its producers have implemented minimal
    use of technology and little investment in the activity. Even so, this traditional
    cactus cropping system showed a very favorable energy yield for its use for livestock
    and energy purposes. Even though the EROI of systems A and B were overall lower
    than C, they proved similar to the cultivation of mustard and rapeseed (ranging
    from 1.24 to 4.92) in Poland (Jankowski et al., 2016). However, they were lower
    than those of sunflower in western Sudan, whose average energy efficiency was
    7.11 (Lotfie et al., 2022), and sugar sorghum in Mexico, which ranged from 13.21
    to 18.68 (López-Sandin et al., 2019), which is able to reach such high energy
    efficiency due to the greater use of agricultural mechanization, hence a lower
    labor requirement in sorghum crop care. Table 7 shows a comparison of the EROI
    of these and other biomass production systems around the world. Table 7. Energy
    Return of Investment (EROI) for different biomass production systems in the world.

    the correlation between the EROI of the different management systems is analyzed
    (Fig. 3a), it can be seen that there was no statistically significant difference
    between systems A and C, nor between A and B. However, between systems B and C
    there is a statistically significant difference at a 1% level of significance.
    However, system C was shown to have the highest EROI, however with values of greater
    variability. In fact, as can be seen in Table 5, the average EROI of system C
    was 65.8% higher than system B. Download : Download high-res image (212KB) Download

    is a significant difference in EROI values between the management systems at the
    significance level of 5%, 1%, 0.1% and 0.01%, respectively. And \"ns\" denotes
    not significant. It was also found that the age and time of experience of the
    farmer regarding cactus pear cultivation did not significantly influence the results
    of EROI (Figs. 3b and 3c). However, it is noteworthy that the cropping systems
    of farmers older than 65 years were shown to have higher variability concerning
    EROI. Moreover, there was a significant difference between the EROI and farmer
    education level (P < 0.05) (Fig. 3d). It is also observed in the graph that the
    greatest variability of EROI was associated to producers who had a high educational
    level, and it was observed in the interviews that 50% of them used cropping system
    C and had the highest average EROI, compared with the other systems, and most
    had experience with cactus cultivation for more than ten years. This is in agreement
    with Leite et al. (2014) who stated that the educational level of the producers
    is, as expected, one of the factors that influence the adoption of more efficient
    agricultural practices in the cultivation of cactus pear. However, 33.3% of the
    farmers interviewed fit the following profile: older than 65 years, cultivated
    cactus for ten to 20 years, and high educational level. Of these, 66.7% adopted
    the C system for cactus cultivation (high technological intensity), in which it
    can be verified that the experience and knowledge gained during the cultivation
    and drought periods, together with the age of the producer, could have influenced
    the search for production alternatives with better energy yield. However, when
    analyzing the difference between the energy values with the harvesting productivity
    of the different cropping systems (Fig. 4), there was a significant difference
    between systems A and B and between B and C (P < 0.05), but between A and C there
    was a greater significance (P < 0.01). As can be seen in Table 3, biomass productivities
    of systems A and B correspond to 43% and 68.7%, respectively, of system C productivity.
    It is also observed that although systems B and C had similar variability, system
    C showed higher values of biomass productivity. It can be seen that productivity
    is more relevant as the technological level increases, incorporating agricultural
    mechanization, adequate fertilization, and even complementary irrigation in periods
    of greater drought, especially in regions of low altitude and high temperatures.
    When having an irrigation system, even with limited amounts of water in which
    irrigation does not supply the full requirements of the crop, there is a positive
    response in biomass productivity, compared with rainfed crops (Lira et al., 2017).

    Fig. 4. Graph of analysis by the Kruskal-Wallis test of the average energy of
    harvest productivity of low (A), medium (B) and high technological intensity (C)
    cultivation systems of cactus pear. The results of the present study show that
    the cactus has energy viability, which can be used both to increase animal fodder
    production and for various purposes, including biofuel production. However, according
    to Mason et al. (2015), when considering the alternative of using cactus biomass
    for bioenergy purposes, there could be an increase in the value of the biomass
    used for forage, due to the higher economic return when using the land for energy
    production. But, cultivating cactus pear also has environmental benefits, such
    as preventing ecological degradation in drylands, as well as soil recovery in
    degraded areas (Souza et al., 2019). They can be cultivated for energy purposes
    in areas that already suffer this degradation effect, thus mitigating the impact
    and contributing to the energy development of the locality, without compromising
    the areas already destined for food production (Quiroz et al., 2021). In the Mediterranean
    region, the introduction of rapeseed as an energy crop in cereal crop systems
    for food production and, to a lesser extent, the conversion of forage systems
    into energy systems, showed positive effects on the environmental sustainability
    of agriculture. The harvesting of artichoke residues for energy production, however,
    required additional energy consumptions, leading to an increase in impact compared
    to their non-utilization (Solinas et al., 2015). However, the use of biomass residues
    for energy production can contribute to reducing environmental emissions and increasing
    the energy efficiency of supply chains, but the long-term effects on soil fertility
    with the systematic removal of crop residues must be taken into account (Cocco
    et al., 2014). In addition, it is possible that the development of a strong value
    chain based on cactus biomass production may lead to the reduction of cultivation
    costs, due to gains obtained by the increase in the scale of operations of this
    sector. In this respect, for example, it is evident that the development of equipment
    to reduce manual labor during planting and harvesting would bring great cost reduction
    to the cost of producing cactus biomass. The potential for establishing large
    systems for cactus cultivation and processing is very significant in many dry
    regions of the world. Comparetti et al. (2017) stated that the cactus pear (Opuntia
    ficus-indica L.) could be used in 14% (≅ two million hectares) of Sicilia, Italy.
    Currently, these areas are in the process of desertification. The potential of
    these areas, if cultivated with cactus for biogas production in co-digestion with
    animal manure and slurry could supply the equivalent of 15% of the demand for
    natural gas in Italy. Thus, one can see the promising potential that the cactus
    can have in areas currently in disuse, especially in semi-arid regions. 3.2. Financial
    analysis The results indicated the economic viability of the cultivation of cactus
    pear in the semi-arid region of Brazil, regardless of the management systems.
    This is probably the reason why the cultivation of cactus pear is widely observed
    in all socioeconomic strata of the rural areas of this region. The viability of
    cactus production was also observed by Silva et al. (2022) and Dantas et al. (2017),
    according to Table 8, which presents the deterministic project feasibility assessment,
    for the different cactus pear production management systems, in the semi-arid
    region of Northeast Brazil. Table 8. Deterministic analysis of economic viability
    for cactus pear biomass production, per hectare, for crop management systems with
    increasing levels of technological intensity in the semiarid region of northeast
    Brazil. Handling system NPV (USD) IRR DP A – Low technological intensity 18,611
    73.00% 2 years B - Medium technological intensity 28,100 61.87% 2 years C - High
    technological intensity 47,883 70.84% 2 years 1NPV: Net Present Value 2IRR: Internal
    Rate of Return 3DP: Discounted payback As with other studies carried out in the
    study region for all systems, the use of leased agricultural implements was considered
    (Dantas et al., 2017), although some interviewed producers had their own tractors,
    which were used for more than one agricultural crop, and the inclusion of this
    variable for financial analysis could lead the reader to overestimate the hourly
    cost of equipment. For system A, the productivity considered was 142.10 tons of
    cactus pear per hectare, every two years, with a biannual income of USD 6.96 thousand.
    This arrangement had a NPV of USD 18,611, over a 10-year horizon, an IRR twelve
    times higher than the TMA, and a discounted payback of two years. The biggest
    investment was the purchase of seed cladode, which occurred at a most probable
    price of USD 0.07. Profitability was high, but lower than that found by Dantas
    et al. (2017), who identified an NPV of USD 22,723 and an IRR of 88%, with a TMA
    of 8%, but the productivity used was higher than that presented for low technological
    intensity system in this study. The results pointed out by Silva et al. (2022)
    presented an NPV much lower than that identified in this research, with an NPV
    of USD 2.196, but the authors considered only two years for the cash flow. The
    system B showed more promising results when compared with system A. In this case,
    the NPV was USD 28.53 and the IRR 61.87%, likewise, the discounted payback was
    two years. For this system, the main costs were associated with the purchase of
    the initial seed cladodes and the manual labor for cropping operations, considering
    that the planting and harvesting processes were centered on human labor. System
    C had the highest return on investment among those evaluated. This system included
    the most intense use of machinery and fuel when compared with the other systems.
    High technological intensity inputs led to higher productivity (314,327 kg/ha
    of fresh cactus pear biomass) and profitability, since it reduced in almost half
    the costs of manual field work. Like the other systems, the high technological
    intensity had its payback discounted in two years. The cactus pear crop proved
    to be profitable for systems with only one ha of cultivation, unlike what was
    observed for crops such as sugarcane, which require larger areas to reach a viable
    return (Santos et al., 2018). These values can be understood by two variables;
    firstly, this study did not consider the purchase and depreciation of tractors,
    and secondly, cactus pear, unlike sugarcane (C4 metabolism), requires less water
    and fertilizer in its cultivation process. It is important to point out that the
    expansion in area cultivated can save money and, as a result, increase even more
    the return on investments (Patel et al., 2021a, Patel et al., 2021b). Carrer et
    al. (2020) also pointed out that other crops grown in Brazil, such as soybeans,
    corn, and peanuts, require high initial investments in fixed capital (tractors,
    machinery, and storage facilities), which makes returns dependent on economies
    of scale. In order to obtain higher yields, rotations in agropastoral systems
    have been tested, for example, for corn, which reached an NPV of R$ 2782.69 per
    hectare (Vinholis et al., 2020), a lower value than cactus cultivation under the
    conditions presented in this research. Silva et al. (2022) indicated that due
    to the large extension of the Brazilian semi-arid region, the evaluation of a
    deterministic scenario could differ from the reality of some local producers.
    To fill this gap, Fig. 5 presents the sensitivity analysis for the variables of
    cactus biomass production systems using increasing technological intensities.

    Fig. 5. Sensitivity analysis for NPV in low (A), medium (B) and high technological
    intensity (C) cultivation systems for cactus pear. The sensitivity analysis, Fig.
    5, highlighted that the variable with the greatest influence on the NPV was the
    selling price of the cactus pear. In the case of a variation of ± 10% in the selling
    price of the cactus pear, alterations of up to 14% in the NPV were observed for
    system A, with the low technological intensity (Fig. 5a). In addition to the sale
    price, the cost of purchasing the seed cladode and the cost of labor for cultural
    practices were the most impactful for system A. For system B, the changes were
    even more significant, given the greater productivity of this system. As in system
    A, the costs of selling the cactus, purchasing the cladodes, and human labor were
    the most significant. For system C, which employed a greater variety of technologies,
    the same variables were shown to be important. It should be noted that the change
    in the cost of purchasing cladodes and installing the irrigation system was also
    evaluated, but variations of − 10% in the total cost, resulted in only a 0.4%
    increase in NPV. Based on sensitivity analysis and assuming that there are different
    levels of productivity for each technological system, a stochastic feasibility
    analysis was performed. This analysis studied the results presented in Table 8.
    Fig. 6 shows the simulation results for the NPV. System B, management with a medium
    technological intensity, proved to be the system with the highest risks of unfeasibility,
    with 90.12% probability of positive return. System A, presented a probability
    of 94.66% for viability, it should be noted that this system is the one that presented
    the lowest probable productivity, so changes in this variable tend to be less
    impactful than for System B. Download : Download high-res image (249KB) Download

    production systems, in the northeastern semi-arid region, by technological level.
    (A) Low, (B) medium, and (C) high technological intensity. System C presented
    the lowest risk for implanting the cactus pear crop, with a 99.43% chance of a
    positive return. The high productivity combined with the highest level of mechanization
    gave the system a high degree of reliability. It should be noted that this system
    incorporated the existence of an irrigation system, which raised productivity
    well above systems A and B. About irrigation, some studies delve into the variability
    of the chosen systems, showing that there is a positive economic return both for
    sale as seed or as cactus for fodder, using dripping systems with saline water
    (Lima et al., 2018). 3.3. International implications Although Opuntia originated
    in the American continent, this cactus is currently considered a cosmopolitan
    crop with large commercial production for multiple purposes on all continents
    of the globe, highlighting the following countries: Algeria, Chile, Tunisia, South
    Africa, Italy, Israel, the US, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, China, and Brazil (Comparetti
    et al., 2017). According to Mason et al. (2015), Opuntia is a strong candidate
    as an energy crop because of its ease of propagation, good cutting capacity, maximum
    utilization of photosynthetically active radiation, and ease of anaerobic digestion.
    In recent years, there has been more interest in cactus pear as a lignocellulosic
    raw material for making biofuels and higher-value chemicals, especially bioethanol
    and biogas. This shows how important this biomass is as a long-term solution for
    drylands where the weather is inadequate for raising traditional bioenergy crop
    species (VITT et al., 2022). The energy analysis of the various types of cactus
    pear management, as well as the economic study of production discussed in this
    research, further certify the production potential of this biomass and its energy
    and economic efficiency for production for energy purposes and can contribute
    to studies for various semi-arid regions in the world. 4. Conclusions The energy
    and economic balance of low, medium, and high technology intensity systems of
    cactus pear biomass production in the Brazilian semiarid region, based on primary
    data, demonstrated that this crop has favorable energy and economic viability
    in all three systems. However, our data indicate that high technology intensity
    systems are more efficient, with an average energy return on investment (EROI)
    of 5.26, versus 3.60 and 4.42 in medium and low technology intensity systems,
    respectively. The EROI of high-technology intensity systems can be increased using
    irrigation and mineral fertilization (6.14). However, future studies should include
    economic and energy cost variables, such as transport and processing of the cactus
    pear biomass, and perform an environmental evaluation from the perspective of
    life cycle assessment. Simulation analysis indicated a large variation in biomass
    productivity in cactus pear cultivation systems. The selling price of cactus biomass
    could render the production system unviable, but these scenarios are unlikely,
    given the growing demand for clean energy. Therefore, pear cactus production can
    be a bioenergy solution, with the potential for a strong positive economic and
    social impact in the Brazilian semiarid region and possibly in many other dry
    regions of the globe. CRediT authorship contribution statement Jéssica Bárbara

    water resourcesConjunctive water resources management 1. Introduction Population
    growth and the development of agriculture, industry and tourism worldwide have
    led to high demand for water resources and increased groundwater abstractions
    (Gleeson et al., 2012; UNESCO, 2022; Bhattarai et al., 2023; Schipanski et al.,
    2023). When groundwater is systematically over-exploited, withdrawn groundwater
    volumes cannot be easily replaced by the natural recharge of aquifers (Casanova
    et al., 2016). The over-exploitation of groundwater resources can have an adverse
    impact on groundwater quantity and quality, for example unsustainable abstraction
    of major aquifers (Cui et al., 2022; Ji and Senay, 2023) and saltwater intrusion
    in coastal aquifers (Hingst et al., 2023). The deterioration of groundwater quality
    from multiple chiral pollutants (for example, pesticides, polychloro-biphenyls,
    polyaromatic hydrocarbons and brominated flame retardants; Basheer, 2018a) and
    the pervasive presence of new emerging contaminants such as endocrine-disrupting
    pharmaceutical residues and their metabolites in the environment (Ali et al.,
    2009; Burri et al., 2019) are a further serious threat to groundwater resources.
    Faced with these pressures, innovative ways of treating and modelling contaminated
    water resources to control environmental contamination (Basheer, 2018b; Basheer
    and Ali, 2018) and of managing groundwater resources are needed to conserve aquifers
    to sustain groundwater use (Taylor et al., 2014; Cuthbert et al., 2023). An example
    of a sustainable groundwater management technique for improving or maintaining
    aquifer levels and enhancing groundwater recharge is managed aquifer recharge
    (MAR), which is the purposeful recharge of water to aquifers with subsequent recovery
    (re-abstraction) or environmental benefit (Ross and Hasnain, 2018; Stefan and
    Ansems, 2018). MAR encompasses a range of recharge methods with the four main
    categories being in-channel modification, bank filtration, water spreading and
    recharge wells (Dillon et al., 2019). A fifth category of runoff harvesting is
    recognised by IGRAC (2023). MAR can restore over-used or brackish aquifers, enhance
    water quality, protect groundwater-dependent ecosystems and improve water security
    (Dillon et al., 2009, 2019; Zheng et al., 2021). Although MAR storage volumes
    are typically low relative to surface reservoirs, MAR can be an important local-scale
    strategy to help alleviate regional water stress (Scanlon et al., 2023). Since
    the 1960s, the implementation of MAR has accelerated at a rate of ∼5% a−1. Currently,
    MAR has reached an estimated 10 km3 a−1, about 2.4% of groundwater abstraction
    in countries reporting MAR (or about 1% of global groundwater abstraction) (Dillon
    et al., 2019). According to Sprenger et al. (2017), MAR schemes are widely distributed
    and applied at various scales and for various purposes in European countries.
    The most widespread MAR type is induced bank filtration (57% of active sites),
    with surface-spreading methods ranked second (34%) and well injection third (5%).
    Most MAR sites (67% of active sites) are situated in unconsolidated geological
    formations given the predominance of bank filtration and surface-spreading schemes.
    Geological formations such as fluviatile and glacial sediments, as well as aeolian
    deposits, are commonly utilised in Europe, while MAR sites situated in consolidated
    geological strata are comparatively rare (Sprenger et al., 2017). MAR schemes
    provide environmentally sustainable groundwater storage able to support drought
    and emergency supplies. Together with surface reservoirs, MAR slows the movement
    of water through catchments and basins, giving greater resilience to water supplies
    by augmenting groundwater reserves during wet seasons that can be drawn upon during
    a drought, for example when water supplies are in demand for agricultural use
    (Rawluk et al., 2013). Such conjunctive water resources management to expand local
    storage options supports a climate change adaptation strategy where water users
    utilise both surface water and groundwater depending on the instantaneous level
    of abundance and cost (Evans and Dillon, 2017; Dillon et al., 2022; Scanlon et
    al., 2023). Sustainable aquifer recharge and recovery rates and periods are likely
    to depend on multiple variables that are established during a trial period. These
    factors include aquifer characteristics, recharge field and borehole performance,
    quality of the source and receiving waters, environmental characteristics and
    protected rights of receptors, source water availability and abstractor demand
    profiles (Maliva, 2015; Song et al., 2019; Fuentes and Vervoort, 2020; Zheng et
    al., 2023). The aquifer hydraulic conductivity is an important factor for MAR
    in terms of infiltration and later abstraction. Generally, high hydraulic conductivity
    and low specific yield of the aquifer, natural boundaries to stop groundwater
    escaping horizontally and vertically, and low salinity of existing groundwater
    are favourable characteristics (Knapton et al., 2019). A further important consideration
    is the risk of aquifer contamination, especially where reclaimed water is used
    for recharge, with pre-treatment potentially needed. Even though natural filtration
    removes many contaminants, pathogens and trace chemicals can remain (Yuan et al.,
    2019). Despite advances in research that has enlarged the scope of MAR, Dillon
    et al. (2019) considered that there remain several basic steps that would improve
    efficiency of investment in MAR and underpin its uptake where this is currently
    low. To address this challenge, Dillon et al. (2019) advocated extending case
    study information to include economic evaluations, extending research on fundamental
    processes to better locate, design, operate and monitor MAR schemes, and to translate
    scientific evidence into governance arrangements for water allocations and water
    quality protection. Bruce et al. (2023) introduced recharge net metering (ReNeM)
    as a cost-effective, market-based mechanism to incentivise distributed groundwater
    recharge on privately owned land to overcome the hurdles often confronted by water
    management agencies when implementing MAR (Rohde, 2023). MAR is not commonly practiced
    in the UK due to regulatory concerns about groundwater quality, the hydrogeological
    conditions of the principal consolidated aquifers, and the need for clear guidance
    to farmers and environmental groups of the benefits of MAR. An early technical
    review of artificial recharge practice is provided by Hunter Blair (1970) and
    a later review of the potential for aquifer storage and recovery in major aquifers
    in England and Wales is presented by Jones et al. (1998). Previous pilot schemes
    in the Triassic sandstone in Nottinghamshire and Lower Cretaceous Greensand in
    Sussex are summarised by Downing (1986). An example of a fully developed scheme
    is the North London Artificial Recharge Scheme involving the storage and recovery
    of water from the Cretaceous Chalk aquifer to support low river flow and reservoir
    levels in the Lea Valley (Downing, 1986; O''Shea and Sage, 1999). As experienced
    elsewhere, water resources in East Anglia, eastern England, are under pressure
    due to population growth, demand for irrigated crops, environmental requirements
    and climate change. In this region, an additional 570 × 103 m3 day−1 for public
    water supply and an estimated 444 × 103 m3 day−1 for other users, including agriculture,
    power generation and industry, will be needed between 2025 and 2050 (Environment
    Agency, 2020; Water Resources East, 2022). Traditionally, farmers have used lined
    surface reservoirs to store water for summer irrigation use. This solution can
    require large areas of potentially productive land and involve high capital and
    environmental costs. Matching growth with enhanced environmental protection requires
    innovative solutions and MAR offers the possibility of storing excess winter flows
    underground for later abstraction during periods of peak demand (DEFRA, 2021).
    Given the background to water resources availability in East Anglia and the need
    for extended case studies that combine evaluation of hydraulic, water quality,
    regulation and economic aspects of MAR schemes that add to global understanding
    (Dillon et al., 2019; Bruce et al., 2023), the aims of this study were to demonstrate
    the viability of the MAR approach in providing a cost-effective and sustainable
    solution to storing surplus surface water for later recovery. The research, which
    is novel for the UK, and an example of an integrated approach to the conjunctive
    use of surface water and groundwater resources, is based on a MAR scheme developed
    in the Pliocene marine sand and gravel (Crag) aquifer in an area of coastal Suffolk,
    a region prone to dry climatic conditions and in need of water storage to meet
    local irrigation demand for high-value crops. 2. MAR site selection, characterisation
    and investigation methods 2.1. Site selection The Crag aquifer of coastal Suffolk
    has good groundwater storage properties and lies close to the surface beneath
    permeable topsoil, making MAR possible as a low-technology solution to supplement
    local irrigation water use. Stored water can be considered potentially available
    for recovery to avoid draining naturally into adjacent springs and rivers. In
    selecting a suitable site, the key elements of the MAR scheme, including identifying
    the source of recharge water, the recharge method, design of the recharge site,
    the water recovery method and ultimate uses of the recovered water, were in accordance
    with other MAR schemes (Yuan et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2020; Salameh et al.,
    2019). To demonstrate that the Crag aquifer is able to retain water that can then
    be recovered, a hydrogeological assessment was completed at the investigation
    stage of the project. The site chosen for the MAR trial was determined by several
    factors including proximity to the recharge source water, thickness of the Crag
    aquifer, sufficient depth of the unsaturated (vadose) zone to store recharged
    water, distance away from groundwater discharge zones, distance from groundwater-dependent
    features such as springs and ponds, land access, and within proximity of a power
    supply. Within these constraints, Bucklesham (latitude 52° 1′ 42″ N, longitude
    1° 16′ 54″ E) was selected in an area of agricultural land on the interfluve between
    surface water tributaries to the west and northwest and a small tributary of the
    Mill River to the southeast and east (Fig. 1). Download : Download high-res image

    Physiographic setting The topographic elevation across most of the study site
    is level at ∼26 m Ordnance Datum (OD) (sea level) with gentle slopes towards the
    tributaries. The area experiences a temperate maritime climate, with a mean annual
    temperature of 10.9 °C and a mean annual precipitation total of 569 mm (1991–2020)
    (Meteorological Office, 2023). Land use in the region includes arable/horticultural
    land (40%), urban area (32%), grassland (16%), woodland (11%) and heath/bog land
    (1%) (UKCEH, 2023). Predominant crops in the area include cereals (28%), beans
    (18%), potatoes (18%) and maize (10%) (DEFRA, 2023). The Pliocene Crag Formations,
    which extend across the Suffolk coastal area (Fig. 1), comprise a locally important
    intergranular aquifer, up to about 80 m thick (Allen et al., 1997). In the study
    area, the Crag Formation is up to 30 m thick with an unsaturated zone thickness
    of between 5 and 10 m. The geological succession at the recharge site is summarised
    in Table 1 and comprises the Eocene London Clay Formation, overlain by the Pliocene
    Red Crag and Norwich Crag Formations, which are in turn overlain by Quaternary
    glacial sand and gravel deposits (Mathers and Smith, 2002). The groundwater level
    in the Crag aquifer at the recharge site indicated an unsaturated zone thickness
    of about 12 m and a saturated zone thickness of approximately 5–6 m. Together
    with a low hydraulic gradient, the available groundwater storage and residence
    time was considered sufficient for the development of a MAR scheme. Table 1. Geological

    at the recharge site showed a layered heterogeneity with the Crag and glacial
    sand and gravel deposits in hydraulic continuity. Groundwater yields in the Crag
    are typically moderate to low, of the order of 10 L s−1 from well point systems,
    although better yields of between 30 and 40 L s−1 have been obtained from gravel
    packed or screened boreholes (British Geological Survey, 2022b). 2.3. Hydrogeological
    properties A 5-day, constant rate pumping test of an abstraction borehole at the
    Bucklesham recharge site (ABH1, Fig. 2c) with an average pumping rate of 101 m3
    day−1 (1.17 L s−1) was conducted in December 2021. Analysis of drawdown data for
    ABH1 and the adjacent observation borehole OBH6 at a distance of 45 m produced
    a calculated Crag transmissivity value of between 49 and 62 m2 day−1. The calculated
    transmissivity value is lower than the interquartile range of 238–722 m2 day−1
    compiled by Jones et al. (2000), most likely due to the nature of the medium-grained,
    poorly sorted Crag lithology at the recharge site. Based on the calculated transmissivity
    value, and for a saturated thickness of 5 m, the Crag hydraulic conductivity at
    the site is ∼10–12 m day−1. The pumping test analysis gave an estimated storage
    coefficient of between 0.06 and 0.07, within the interquartile range of 0.004–0.11
    for the Crag aquifer (Jones et al., 2000). Download : Download high-res image

    and observation boreholes (3, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9), including the position of the
    recharge lagoon and layout of backfilled infiltration trenches. (d) Recharge distribution
    trench with slotted pipe under construction. The Crag aquifer at the recharge
    site is unconfined and overlain by a shallow, freely draining, slightly acidic
    sandy and loamy topsoil. Soil infiltration tests at the site gave an average vertical
    hydraulic conductivity value of 0.56 m day−1. Free drainage of the topsoil makes
    it vulnerable to the leaching of agricultural fertilisers and pesticides to groundwater,
    while low soil moisture limits crop yields without irrigation (Cranfield University,
    2022). Further tests in trial pits indicated infiltration rates of between 50
    and 80 mm h−1 (1.20−1.92 m day−1), with hydraulic conductivity increasing at depth.
    Preliminary investigation of the groundwater storage and recovery potential of
    the Crag aquifer was modelled by the Environment Agency using the Crag component
    of its numerical North-East Anglia Chalk (NEAC) groundwater model (Black et al.,
    2012). Model results indicated that potentially up to 120,000 m3 of water could
    be stored and recovered over a 9-month cycle (4 months of recharge – 1 month of
    storage – 4 months of recovery) with negligible leakage into or from nearby watercourses.
    2.4. Abstraction source The source water for the MAR scheme is the 4.6 km King''s
    Fleet drainage channel that discharges to the River Deben estuary and North Sea
    at Felixstowe Ferry (latitude 51° 59′ 44″ N, longitude 1° 22′ 41″ E) (Fig. 1).
    The distribution system relies on two high-volume, low-head abstraction pumps
    (Fig. 2a) each delivering 0.03 m3 s−1 operating either individually or together,
    with abstraction primarily during the high-flow winter months. The total capacity
    of the MAR scheme is consented for infiltration and re-abstraction of up to 40,000
    m3 a−1. Water is transferred inland via two, 14-km length, 200 mm-diameter pipelines
    (Fig. 1) to supply nine surface storage irrigation reservoirs and the MAR recharge
    site. 2.5. Recharge and recovery system design Recharge at the MAR site is induced
    through a recharge lagoon (Fig. 2b) connected to an array of backfilled infiltration
    trenches (Fig. 2c) positioned in the Crag unsaturated zone at a depth of ∼2.7
    m, in which slotted pipes were installed (Fig. 2d) (see Supplementary Material
    for further engineering design details). The infiltration system was chosen given
    its several advantages compared to open recharge basins. Heilweil et al. (2015)
    reported that a covered trench infiltration rate is an order of magnitude higher
    than an open basin. Advantages include reduced clogging and biofilms and minimum
    land take compared with open basins. Additionally, covered trench infiltration
    avoids low-permeability surface soils and low temperatures that increase water
    viscosity and so further reducing hydraulic conductivity. An overview of vadose
    zone infiltration is given by Bouwer (2002) who described the technique as typically
    less than 1 m wide and up to 4 m deep, backfilled with coarse sand or fine gravel,
    with water normally applied through a perforated pipeline. An analytical equation
    for estimating the steady-state infiltration rate for a trench in the vadose zone,
    not in connection with the regional water table, is given by Heilweil et al. (2015),
    modified from Bouwer (2002), as follows: Equation 1 where Qf is the final or steady-state
    infiltration rate per unit area of the trench floor, Ksat is saturated hydraulic
    conductivity, H is height of the water column in the trench, and w is the trench
    width. For conditions at the recharge site, selecting values of Ksat in the range
    2–12 m day−1 based on the trial pit and pumping test data, H = 0.75 m and w =
    0.5 m produces an infiltration rate using Equation (1) of 1.79–10.7 m3 m−2 day−1.
    Therefore, a potential total recharge volume of 900 m3 day−1 (10.4 L s−1), yielding
    108,000 m3 for a 120-day pumping period, would require a length of infiltration
    trenches equal to 168–1009 m. In practice, as shown in Fig. 2c, the final length
    of installed, parallel covered trenches was 565 m. An analytical solution for
    the development of a steady-state groundwater mound resulting from artificial
    recharge for long-strip basins (analogous to the infiltration trenches), in which
    groundwater flow away from the strip can be approximated as linear horizontal
    flow, is given by Bouwer et al. (1999) as: Equation 2 where Hc is the height of
    the groundwater mound at the centre of the recharge area, Hn is the height of
    the groundwater table in the control area at a distance, Ln, from the edge of
    the recharge area, i is the infiltration rate in the recharge area, W is the width
    of the recharge area, and T is the aquifer transmissivity, ignoring the effects
    of water table height on T. Natural groundwater discharge to springs draining
    to the Mill River 750 m northeast of the recharge site at an elevation of about
    5 m OD provides a control on the feasibility of the MAR scheme in respect of the
    elevation of the recharge mound that can develop under equilibrium conditions.
    For an infiltration rate of 1.77 m day−1 (the permitted daily recharge rate (1000
    m3 day−1) applied over a trench length of 565 m and an assumed width of the recharge
    area of 1 m) and a Crag transmissivity of between 49 and 62 m2 day−1 as estimated
    from the 5-day pumping test, then the elevation of the groundwater mound beneath
    the recharge site is, using Equation (2), calculated in the range 15.7–18.6 m
    OD. The average rest groundwater level recorded in May 2022 at the location of
    ABH1, near the centre of the expected recharge mound, was 14.0 m OD (Table S2).
    Therefore, under equilibrium conditions, the increase in groundwater level at
    the centre of the recharge mound is acceptable at ∼2–3 m above the rest level
    and well below the ground elevation at ABH1 of 27 m OD. Water was re-abstracted
    from the Crag aquifer using submersible pumps in two abstraction boreholes (ABH1
    and ABH2, Fig. 2c) sited adjacent to the join between the main and secondary recharge
    trenches. The boreholes were drilled to the base of the Crag aquifer to a depth
    of 18 m below ground level (bgl) and lined with 165-mm diameter casing material
    with a slotted screen (Fig. S1) with the aim of improving yield from approximately
    9 m bgl to the base of the aquifer. Water recovered from the MAR system is then
    pumped to surface water reservoirs via the inland pipeline where it can then be
    used for irrigation. 2.6. Water level monitoring The observation borehole (OBH)
    network for the scheme was designed to monitor groundwater levels proximal to
    the recharge field and towards the edges of the recharge mound. All OBHs monitored
    to the base of the Crag aquifer, with details of locations, datum levels, geological
    strata and rest groundwater levels given in Tables S1 and S2. The site of OBH10
    was chosen as a sentinel borehole for the spring-fed lakes located 500 m northeast
    of the recharge site. Groundwater levels were recorded with a pressure transducer
    and datalogger at 15-min intervals with an accuracy of ±0.1%. 2.7. Water quality
    monitoring The main contaminants of concern were chloride (with possible sources
    in the coastal pumped drainage ditches, saline intrusion and salt washing from
    a major road) and nitrate and herbicides from agricultural sources. Grab samples
    of the recharge source water were collected periodically and analysed for a list
    of over 570 substances between July 2020–June 2022 (n = 13). Monitored parameters
    included: (i) parameters indicative of saline or other intrusions, including electrical
    conductivity; (ii) trichloroethylene and tetrachloroethylene; and (iii) substances,
    ions or indicators which may occur both naturally and/or because of human activities,
    including arsenic, cadmium, lead, mercury, chloride, sulphate, nitrate and ammonium.
    Of less concern were polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metals from road
    runoff. Fluorosurfactants (PFOS, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid and PFOA, perfluorooctanoic
    acid) were added to the list of analyses for the recharge source water from October
    2021 (n = 8) as emerging contaminants of concern. Pumped samples from the Crag
    aquifer were collected between October 2021–September 2022 (n = 46). Groundwater
    samples from abstraction borehole ABH1 were analysed for the full suite of inorganic
    species and organic compounds between October–December 2021 (n = 3) prior to and
    during a preliminary trial of the recharge and re-abstraction system (6352 m3
    of source water were recharged between 15 and 21 November 2021 and 525 m3 of groundwater
    were re-abstracted between 8 and 14 December 2021). Further samples were collected
    from abstraction borehole ABH1 in November–December 2021 (n = 3) and June–September
    2022 (n = 5) and analysed for a more restricted suite consisting of major ions
    and electrical conductivity, with the summer 2022 samples collected during the
    main trial of the recharge and re-abstraction system. Pumped samples from observation
    boreholes OBH3, OBH5, OBH6 and OBH7 collected in November–December 2021 (n = 5
    each) were analysed for major ions during the preliminary recharge and re-abstraction
    trial. In addition, pumped samples from abstraction borehole ABH2 and observation
    boreholes OBH5 and OBH8 were collected in June–September 2022 (n = 5 each) and
    analysed for major ions and electrical conductivity during the main recharge and
    re-abstraction trial. In total, chemical analysis of 59 water samples was conducted
    by a certified commercial laboratory (ALS Laboratories (UK) Ltd). Laboratory methods
    included spectrophotometric analysis of chloride, sulphate, nitrate and nitrite
    with limits of detection (LoDs) of, respectively, <2, <2, <0.3 and < 0.05 mg L−1.
    Ammonium was analysed by colorimetry with a LoD of <0.3 mg L−1. Dissolved metals
    were analysed by ICP-MS with LoDs for arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury of, respectively,
    <0.5, <0.08, <0.2 and < 0.01 μg L−1. Phenols, PAHs, volatile organic compounds,
    acid herbicides and suites of pesticides were analysed by mass spectrometry with
    LoDs of, respectively, <0.5, <0.005, <1, <0.1 and < 0.01 μg L−1. PFOS and PFOA
    were analysed by LC-MS with a LoD of <0.65 ng L−1. Total organic carbon (TOC)
    concentrations were measured by high-temperature combustion with the carbon dioxide
    produced measured by non-dispersive infrared adsorption with a LoD of <0.7 mg
    L−1. Dissolved oxygen was analysed by the Winkler titration method with a LoD
    of 0.3 mg L−1 and electrical conductivity (at 20 °C) with a probe with a LoD of
    <5 μS cm−1. The concentration of total suspended solids (TSS) as a measure of
    both organic and inorganic solids in water was analysed by the amount of material
    retained by a 1.2 μm pore size filter with a LoD of <2 mg L−1. To explore the
    change in water quality resulting from the introduction of recharge source water
    into the Crag aquifer, a conservative mixing approach was adopted. For conservative
    mixing of two end-member solutions: Equation 3 where ci is the concentration of
    ion, i, and mix, sw and gw indicate the conservative mixture and end-member recharge
    source water and groundwater, respectively, and fsw is the fraction of recharge
    source water. 2.8. Regulatory requirements The groundwater investigation consent
    issued by the environmental regulator specified limits on the maximum infiltration
    rate (1200 m3 day−1) and re-abstraction rate (250 m3 day−1), and the requirement
    for all infiltrated water, which should not exceed 18,000 m3, be recovered. Monitoring
    of the water level of the recharge lagoon, soil moisture and precipitation above
    the recharge field were stipulated. Water level monitoring of the observation
    boreholes and two abstraction boreholes at the recharge site, together with monitoring
    of abstraction borehole pumping rates, were also required. To legally permit MAR
    infiltration, the discharge conditions were risk-assessed based on environmental
    quality standards (EQS) and drinking water standards (DWS) (European Commission,
    1998, 2008). An additional safeguard was provided by setting an alarm to stop
    the recharge water entering the infiltration array at any concentration above
    the designated threshold. In the example of chloride and nitrate-N, an increase
    in concentration of the local groundwater quality was permitted if the maximum
    concentrations in the source water did not exceed 165 mg L−1 and 7.5 mg L−1, respectively.
    3. Results and discussion 3.1. Water quantity and water levels Between 9 and 20
    June 2022 during the recharge period of the main MAR trial, 12,262 m3 of source
    water were recharged to the aquifer at an average infiltration rate of 1022 m3
    day−1 (Fig. 3). Of the recharged water, 12,301 m3 were successfully abstracted
    from the Crag aquifer from 18 July–10 September 2022, augmenting surface storage
    irrigation reservoirs during drought conditions. Download : Download high-res

    levels at abstraction (ABH) and observation (OBH) boreholes recorded during the
    main recharge and recovery trial (June–September 2022). Also shown are the daily
    volumes of source water recharge and re-abstraction during the trial. Spikes in
    water levels for ABH1 and ABH2 show temporary pump outages. Abstraction borehole
    ABH1 delivered a maximum pumping rate of approximately 90 m3 day−1 (∼1 L s−1).
    Given this modest abstraction rate, a second abstraction borehole (ABH2) adjacent
    to the recharge field was installed to provide a combined discharge rate of 250
    m3 day−1. Hence, the results indicated that a significant factor constraining
    the volume of water that can be usefully stored and recovered is the rate of re-abstraction
    from the Crag aquifer. Without further abstraction boreholes, the hydraulic conductivity
    of the Crag at the recharge site (K = 2−12 m day−1) and thin saturated zone (5–6
    m) limit the yield of the MAR scheme, limitations that are reported for other
    MAR schemes (Knapton et al., 2019). Groundwater levels monitored at the observation
    boreholes during the period May–September 2022 varied between 13.3 and 14.8 m
    OD, with less variation of levels observed at OBH10 (11.4−11.6 m OD) (Fig. 3).
    Levels recorded at ABH1 and ABH2 varied between 9.5 and 15.0 m OD due to the influence
    of groundwater pumping. Crag groundwater levels were lower at OBH5 and OBH7 to
    the east of the recharge lagoon by ∼0.5 m, suggesting an eastward flow component
    from the area of the MAR site. The application of artificial recharge in June
    2022 caused an increase in groundwater levels at all sites except for OBH9 and
    OBH10. As shown in Fig. 4a, the relative increase in groundwater level during
    the recharge period ranged from 0.1 m at OBH5, OBH6 and OBH7 to 0.2 m at ABH2
    and OBH8 and 0.3 m at ABH1 and OBH3. These results imply a good delivery of artificial
    recharge to the area of the abstraction boreholes and to the end of the pipe array
    near OBH8, but lesser receipt to the east of the lagoon, perhaps due to a localised
    decrease in aquifer hydraulic conductivity at this location. Download : Download

    Water table surfaces drawn using triangulated irregular network (TIN) analysis
    to raster format in ArcGIS Pro. If the extent of the recharge mound is delimited
    by OBH9 where no increase in groundwater level was observed, then the radius of
    the artificial recharge mound is approximately 250 m. Using the equation for the
    volume of a spherical cap, and assuming a Crag aquifer porosity in the range 25–40%
    (Jones et al., 2000), then an approximation of the height of the recharge mound
    with a radius of 250 m to accommodate an injected pore volume of 12,262 m3 is
    between 0.3 and 0.5 m, corresponding to the actual observed value of 0.3 m at
    the assumed centre of the recharge mound adjacent to ABH1 and OBH3. The relative
    decrease (drawdown) in groundwater level during the following recovery (re-abstraction)
    stage of the trial was greatest at the abstraction boreholes, ABH1 and ABH2 (4.6
    and 4.2 m, respectively), with a 1.0 m decrease in groundwater level observed
    at OBH3 equidistant between the two abstraction boreholes (Fig. 4b). The decrease
    in groundwater levels varied between 0.4 and 0.6 m in OBH5, OBH6 and OBH8. The
    smallest decreases in groundwater level of between 0.1 and 0.3 m were observed
    in OBH7, OBH9 and OBH10. The water level response at the boreholes varied with
    changes in pump rate/outages, except for the more distant OBH8 where the response
    to these events was muted. As shown in Fig. 3, water level recovery after every
    pump outage was rapid such that it is reasonable to assume that a good recovery
    in water level occurred after re-abstraction had ceased. Regarding the impact
    of artificial recharge on local water features, groundwater level data from the
    trial suggested that the recharge mound remained within 250 m of the recharge
    site, based on the lack of response from the more distant OBH9 and OBH10. During
    the recovery period, the results indicated that the re-abstraction did not impact
    on spring-fed lakes northeast of the recharge site. 3.2. Water quality 3.2.1.
    Recharge source water A summary of monitoring results for the recharge source
    water abstracted from the King''s Fleet drainage channel is given in Table 2 for
    the monitoring period July 2020–June 2022, and time series data for selected determinands
    are presented in Fig. 5. Elevated values of electrical conductivity (1160 μS cm−1
    in January 2022), chloride (178 mg L−1 in February 2022) and sulphate (138 mg
    L−1 in March 2022) (Fig. 5b) were caused by abstraction from the King''s Fleet.
    The lowering of the surface water level relative to sea level during abstraction
    stimulated saline water intrusion. During the recharge period of the main MAR
    trial (9–20 June 2022), the source water quality was stable with a mean electrical
    conductivity value of 834 μS cm−1 and mean chloride concentration of 133 mg L−1,
    below the regulated threshold concentration of 165 mg L−1. Table 2. Summary results

    monitoring of recharge source water quality abstracted from the King''s Fleet
    drainage channel from July 2020–June 2022. The two light blue lines represent
    the periods of source water recharge during the preliminary and main trials of
    the MAR scheme in November 2021 and June 2022, respectively. The single light
    grey line represents the re-abstraction of groundwater in December 2021 during
    the preliminary trial of the MAR scheme. The high nitrate-N concentrations observed
    in April 2021 and February 2022 (7.6 and 7.2 mg L−1, respectively; Fig. 5c) resulted
    from winter flushing of residual nitrogen from the soil profile and the timing
    of spring applications of fertilisers to arable crops in the King''s Fleet catchment,
    responses that are observed in other catchments in East Anglia (Outram et al.,
    2016; Garrard et al., 2023). At other times of the year, nitrate-N concentrations
    are between 0.1 and 3.1 mg L−1 and demonstrated the removal of nitrate by biological
    uptake and denitrification within the riparian zone of the King''s Fleet, as observed
    for other surface water systems and wetlands (Walton et al., 2020; Steiness et
    al., 2021; Raulerson et al., 2023). Ammoniacal-N and nitrite-N concentrations
    remained within the ranges 0.2–0.3 mg L−1 and 0.02–0.1 mg L−1, respectively (Table
    2). Elevated nitrite-N concentrations of 0.05, 0.1 and 0.07 mg L−1 recorded in
    October 2020, October 2021 and May 2022, respectively (Fig. 5c), coincided with
    low nitrate-N concentrations (0.3, 2.3 and 3.1 mg L−1, respectively) and likely
    represent nitrite-N produced as an intermediate product of denitrification in
    the riparian zone (Rivett et al., 2008). Dissolved oxygen concentrations in the
    recharge source water were generally saturated, with peaks occurring in October
    2020 (11.0 mg L−1) and in February 2022 (11.4 mg L−1) (Fig. 5a). The lowest concentrations
    of dissolved oxygen of 5.5 mg L−1 were recorded in October 2021 and June 2022
    most likely because of warmer surface water temperatures promoting reducing conditions,
    similar to conditions observed by Itoh et al. (2007) in riparian wetlands in a
    temperate forest catchment and Cooper et al. (2020) in shallow headwater streams
    in an arable catchment. TSS ranged between 2.0 and 9.5 mg L−1 (Table 2), with
    most of the samples recording <4 mg L−1 (Fig. 5a). TOC concentrations ranged between
    5.4 and 10.0 mg L−1 throughout the whole monitoring period (Fig. 5a). Hence, the
    loading of suspended inorganic and organic material from the recharge source water
    to the Crag aquifer was low and so limiting the risk of clogging and decline in
    permeability of the sands and gravels following infiltration. The formation of
    clogging layers on the bottom of recharge basins or other infiltration surfaces
    is well documented in the literature (Bouwer, 2002; Schubert, 2002; Song et al.,
    2019). Different factors determine the reduction in infiltration rates, including
    effluent water quality, hydraulic loading rate and recharge cycles (Lippera et
    al., 2023). However, the rate and degree of clogging are controlled mainly by
    the rate of suspended solids deposition, the size distribution of the fines and
    the size distribution of the receiving sediments (Hutchinson et al., 2013). For
    the current MAR scheme, should clogging become a problem in the longer term, then
    solutions include desilting or other pre-treatment. For example, the installation
    of sand filters and periodic backwashing of injection wells were required at an
    aquifer storage transfer and recovery (ASTR) site in The Netherlands where tile
    drainage water is stored in a sandy brackish coastal aquifer (Kruisdijk et al.,
    2023). Mercury and cadmium concentrations remained stable at 0.01 and 0.08 μg
    L−1, respectively (Table 2 and Fig. 5d). Ranges in arsenic and lead concentrations
    were within 0.58–1.35 μg L−1 and 0.20–0.44 μg L−1, respectively. Occasional detections
    of chromium (mean concentration = 6.6 μg L−1, n = 2), copper (1.8 μg L−1, n =
    1) and manganese (126 μg L−1, n = 1) were observed. Apart from manganese, the
    trace metal results were within the DWS and indicated a source in urban and road
    runoff at the head of the King''s Fleet drainage channel. Very few organic compounds
    were detected (Table 2), with most concentrations below the DWS. The pesticide
    metabolites desphenyl-chloridazon (mean concentration = 1.21 μg L−1, n = 8) and
    2,6-dichlorobenzamide (mean concentration = 0.12 μg L−1, n = 11) were detected.
    The herbicides simazine, triallate and propyzamide were detected on fewer occasions
    at concentrations of <0.05 μg L−1. The herbicide pendimethalin and molluscicide
    metaldehyde were each detected on one occasion with concentrations of 0.03 and
    0.02 μg L−1, respectively. A mean concentration of total PAH of 1.21 μg L−1 (n
    = 4 detections) was recorded, with fluoranthene (mean = 0.09 μg L−1, n = 6), phenanthrene
    (mean = 0.05 μg L−1, n = 7) and pyrene (mean = 0.06 μg L−1, n = 5) the most frequently
    detected (Table 2). Mean concentrations of total PFOS and PFOA of 2.54 and 2.25
    ng L−1, respectively, were detected for all sampling occasions (n = 8) (Table
    2), comparable to median concentrations of 3.2 ng L−1 for PFOS and 3.1 ng L−1
    for PFOA reported in a review of surface waters by Zareitalabad et al. (2013).
    In the case of PFOS, the mean concentration is above the European annual average
    EQS for inland waters of 0.65 ng L−1 (Lindim et al., 2016). The most probable
    sources of PAH, PFOS and PFOA compounds are urban, municipal and road runoff at
    the head of the King''s Fleet drainage channel. 3.2.2. Groundwater The range in
    Crag groundwater composition monitored across the Bucklesham recharge site during
    the period November 2021–September 2022 (Table 3) showed that no exceedances of
    regulatory limits were observed, except for nitrate-N that exceeded the DWS of
    11.3 mg N L−1. Concentrations of chloride, sulphate and nitrate-N showed similar
    trends to those observed in the recharge source water, with peaks in concentrations
    (198, 141 and 46.5 mg L−1, respectively) recorded during the winter recharge period
    November–December 2021 (Fig. 6). Table 3. Summary results of water quality monitoring

    Time series monitoring of Crag groundwater quality for (a) abstraction borehole
    ABH1 and (b) observation borehole OBH5 at the Bucklesham MAR site from October
    2021–September 2022. The two light blue lines represent the times of source water
    infiltration during the preliminary and main trials of the MAR scheme in November
    2021 and June 2022, respectively. The two light grey lines represent the re-abstraction
    of groundwater during the preliminary and main trials of the MAR scheme in December
    2021 and July–September 2022, respectively. A measured mean TOC concentration
    of 3.0 mg L−1 compares with baseline concentrations in UK groundwaters, which,
    as observed here, are generally lower than for surface waters (Gooddy and Hinsby,
    2009). Mean concentrations of nitrite-N and ammoniacal-N were 0.02 and 0.30 mg
    L−1, respectively, throughout the monitoring period. Low concentrations of metals
    of <0.5 μg L−1 were detected in groundwater samples, within the ranges of baseline
    concentrations for the Crag aquifer reported by Ander et al. (2006). Concentrations
    of organic compounds analysed from October–December 2021 (n = 3) were below the
    limits of detection except for the pesticide metabolites desphenyl-chloridazon
    (mean concentration = 1.34 μg L−1, n = 3 detections) and 2,6-dichlorobenzamide
    (mean concentration = 0.17 μg L−1, n = 3 detections). In addition, the fungicide
    oxadixyl was detected on three occasions with a mean concentration of 0.22 μg
    L−1. The herbicide dinitro-o-cresol and the PAH compound benzo[ghi]perylene were
    each detected on one occasion with concentrations of 0.49 and 0.02 μg L−1, respectively.
    While average concentrations of chloride, ammoniacal-N and metals in groundwater
    were comparable to the average concentrations of these determinands in surface
    water, the average concentration of nitrate-N (29.5 mg L−1) and, to a lesser extent,
    sulphate (114 mg L−1) were noticeably higher than the recharge source water (Table
    3). Elevated concentrations of these compounds in groundwater are likely due to
    agricultural land use in the vicinity of the recharge site and are similar to
    the ranges of values reported for the Crag aquifer in northern East Anglia (nitrate-N,
    0–49 mg L−1 and sulphate, 8–1480 mg L−1; Ander et al., 2006). Fig. 6 shows the
    effect of recharging the King''s Fleet source water on the water quality of the
    Crag aquifer. For both the preliminary and main MAR trials, the chloride concentration
    was observed to increase. The effect was most pronounced for abstraction borehole
    ABH1 during the preliminary trial in November 2021 with a 52% increase in chloride
    concentration (equivalent to 51 mg L−1) before declining to a background concentration
    of 113 mg L−1 following the re-abstraction period in December 2021 (Fig. 6a).
    The effect was smaller during the main trial in June 2022 with an increase of
    only 5 mg L−1 before declining to a background concentration of 96 mg L−1 in September
    2022 following the re-abstraction period. The more limited sulphate data showed
    an increase in concentration of 19 mg L−1 at ABH1 in November 2021 (Fig. 6a) but
    with a less discernible increase of 7 mg L−1 at the location of OBH5 at a greater
    distance (∼110 m) from the recharge mound (Fig. 6b). The groundwater nitrate-N
    and electrical conductivity data showed an inverse response to source water infiltration
    compared with chloride, particularly at ABH1 during the preliminary trial in November
    2021 with decreases of 65% in nitrate-N concentration (equivalent to 30.6 mg L−1)
    and 15% in electrical conductivity (equivalent to 139 μS cm−1) before recovering
    to background levels following the short re-abstraction period (Fig. 6a). Similar
    responses were observed during the main MAR trial in June 2022 with decreases
    of 69% in nitrate-N concentration (equivalent to 23.6 mg L−1) and 11% in electrical
    conductivity (equivalent to 106 μS cm−1) during the recharge period. The effect
    of the recharge is to improve the groundwater quality with minimum nitrate-N concentrations
    of 16.8 and 10.7 mg L−1 recorded in ABH1 after the recharge periods of the preliminary
    and main MAR trials, respectively (Fig. 6a). Similar improvements in water quality
    due to dilution are reported for other MAR studies. For example, Garciá-Menéndez
    et al. (2021) reported a decrease in electrical conductivity of 80–90% at a distance
    of 80 m from recharge wells in a brackish alluvial plain aquifer in coastal eastern
    Spain. Although the recovered groundwater did not meet drinking water standards,
    Rafiq et al. (2022) observed the mixing of 90% fresh recharge water with native,
    arsenic-rich groundwater within 4 m of an array of infiltration wells in a confined
    sand aquifer in a coastal area of southwest Bangladesh. Given the greater distance
    from the recharge mound, little effect on nitrate-N concentrations is observed
    at OBH5 for either the preliminary or main MAR trials (Fig. 6b). Similarly, only
    a small effect was observed in groundwater electrical conductivity values at OBH5,
    decreasing by 101 μS cm−1 during the re-abstraction period of the main MAR trial
    towards a background value of 768 μS cm−1 for the final sample taken on September
    12, 2022. The degree of mixing between the infiltrated source water and background
    Crag groundwater would be expected to be greatest close to the centre of the recharge
    mound, at ABH1, becoming less with distance, for example at OBH5. Table 4 presents
    chloride and nitrate-N concentrations for the recharge source water and Crag groundwater
    at the MAR site during the recharge and recovery periods of the main MAR trial.
    The strongest evidence for mixing was represented by nitrate-N given the two orders
    of magnitude difference in concentrations between the source water (0.20 mg L−1)
    and Crag groundwater (range from 34.3 to 42.5 mg L−1) on June 8, 2022, the day
    before recharge commenced. At the end of the recharge period on July 19, 2022
    (the day after re-abstraction had commenced) nitrate-N concentrations at ABH1,
    ABH2 and OBH5 were 10.7, 22.4 and 40.4 mg L−1, respectively. Table 4. Concentrations

    12/09/22 – – 96.3 37.7 90.4 42.2 82.9 39.1 Based on conservative mixing of source
    water and groundwater end-member solutions (Equation (3)), and assuming no denitrification
    for an infiltration rate above 0.7 ± 0.2 m day−1 (Schmidt et al., 2011), as achieved
    in this study (1.81 m day−1), the nitrate-N concentrations at ABH1, ABH2 and OBH5
    represent mixed fractions of recharge source water to Crag groundwater of 69%,
    39% and 5%, respectively. Therefore, and as expected, the fraction of recharge
    water mixed with Crag groundwater decreased with distance from the centre of the
    recharge mound. These results are consistent with those presented by Kattan et
    al. (2010) for aquifer storage and recovery in a shallow alluvial Quaternary aquifer
    in the Damascus basin, Syria, in which a hydrochemical mass balance showed that
    the stored water remains within close proximity (<100 m) to the injection well
    with the proportion of recharged water (volume = 24,160 m3) in the range 50–90%
    at a distance of 80 m. A similar mixing trend was not observed for chloride given
    the similarity of values between the recharge source water (136 mg L−1) and Crag
    groundwater (123 mg L−1 at ABH1) prior to the start of recharge on June 8, 2022.
    Following the end of the recovery period on September 12, 2022, chloride values
    recorded at the two abstraction boreholes, ABH1 and ABH2 (96.3 and 90.4 mg L−1,
    respectively), were similar to the groundwater at OBH5 (82.9 mg L−1) suggesting
    that re-abstraction of the mixed groundwater was largely completed with background
    Crag groundwater with a lower chloride concentration now being drawn towards the
    abstraction boreholes. 3.3. Regulatory considerations Regulatory considerations,
    which are important in the implementation of a MAR scheme, include issues related
    to water quantity and aquifer storage aspects, the protection of human health
    and the environment in relation to water quality, and the general regulatory framework
    for MAR schemes including cross-cutting aspects such as economic costs and benefits
    (Zhang et al., 2020). In the example of the MAR scheme presented here, data collection
    followed by discussion with the environmental regulator indicated that the primary
    regulatory concern was the potential impact of the MAR scheme on chloride concentrations
    within the receiving Crag aquifer. The regulator indicated that for licensing
    purposes it would use an ‘absolute threshold’ for chloride of 250 mg L−1 based
    on the DWS, and a ‘relative threshold’ limiting chloride concentrations in the
    aquifer to an increase of no more than 10% above baseline concentrations. The
    results of the MAR trial demonstrated that the ‘absolute threshold’ was not challenged.
    Chloride concentrations within the source water averaged 134 mg L−1, significantly
    below the 250 mg L−1 DWS limit. However, the ‘relative threshold’ may be more
    problematic. Background chloride concentrations in Crag groundwater below the
    recharge field averaged 117 mg L−1, similar to the source water, but across the
    Crag aquifer, chloride concentrations vary from 13 to 2680 mg L−1 (Ander et al.,
    2006). The MAR trial further showed that the risk can be minimised by: (i) setting
    a limit to the chloride concentration in the source water; and (ii) introducing
    relatively small volumes of water into the aquifer and ensuring that a high proportion
    of this infiltration is re-abstracted. Additional regulatory concerns related
    to other potential contaminants and water resource impacts on nearby water features
    (streams, licensed abstractions and protected rights). The risks of other contaminants
    were considered low in the case of the current MAR scheme. The source water was
    monitored 13 times over 24 months for over 570 compounds of potential concern
    and none were found to be problematic. Water resource impacts were also considered
    a low risk with any effects on the spring-fed lakes to the northeast of the recharge
    site likely to be below detection thresholds. Overall, the MAR scheme demonstrated
    that water quality and water resource requirements were successfully met, and
    that the MAR system can be managed to augment water resources in addition to providing
    an alternative means of storing high surface flows. 3.4. Economic assessment For
    MAR to be a viable solution to alleviate water resource pressures, it must prove
    to be a cost-effective alternative to, for example, lined surface storage reservoirs.
    Compared to alternative resource options, the cost of MAR schemes can be favourably
    low (Hasan et al., 2019). The largest cost component of the MAR scheme presented
    here (Table 5) was for monitoring, data collection and licensing, which together
    accounted for approximately 57% of the total budget of GBP 178,815 at 2022 prices.
    The costliest elements were the installation of observation boreholes and loggers
    followed by water quality testing and analysis. Construction costs including the
    recharge field, abstraction boreholes and pumping systems accounted for the remaining
    43% of the capital costs. Table 5. Capital and annual operating costs for the
    MAR scheme presented in this study compared with a typical lined surface storage
    reservoir of equivalent cost. Component Cost (GBP) Cost (GBP) Managed aquifer
    recharge Surface storage reservoir Capital costs Construction 76,996 187,095 Monitoring
    and testing 77,157 12,900 Permits and licences 24,662 17,013 Total 178,815 217,008
    Annual operating costs 21,458 15,191 The breakdown of costs of the MAR scheme
    differed significantly from that of a surface storage reservoir of equivalent
    cost where construction work accounts for up to 86% of the overall budget of GBP
    217,008 at 2022 prices. Design, reservoir licensing, environmental assessment,
    fencing and landscaping costs typically come to only 20% of the total budget (Weatherhead
    et al., 2014), although planning and archaeological investigation costs vary widely
    and can add significantly to the capital costs. Construction costs for the MAR
    system were comparatively low but the high costs of data collection and securing
    regulatory permits brought the overall capital costs to within 18% of an equivalent
    surface storage reservoir. From an abstractor''s perspective, unless a larger
    volume of water is available from a MAR scheme, this marginal difference is unlikely
    to outweigh the perceived difficulties and uncertainties involved in constructing
    and operating a MAR system. The annual operational costs of the MAR scheme were
    estimated at 12% (GBP 21,458) of the total capital costs, the greatest proportion
    of which is the additional costs of pumping the recovered water into a balancing
    facility so that it can be re-abstracted at higher rates sufficient to run an
    irrigation system. In comparison, the annual operating costs for an equivalent
    reservoir are about 7% (GBP 15,191) of the capital costs and are comprised of,
    in diminishing order of size, power supply, maintenance costs and loss of income
    due to land-take (Weatherhead et al., 2014). The higher data collection and licensing
    costs for the MAR scheme reflected the greater regulatory challenges. Aquifer
    recharge is a relatively novel technique in the UK and the licensing regime is
    required to address potential impacts on both groundwater quality and water resources.
    In contrast, agricultural surface storage reservoirs have a long history of development
    and licence considerations are limited to water resources impacts only. Water
    resources mitigation measures, such as protected minimum flows, are well understood
    and the licensing regime has matured to accommodate reservoir abstraction permits.
    It is likely, however, that if more MAR schemes are developed, the regulatory
    process will become more streamlined, reducing licensing overheads and making
    MAR more attractive to agricultural irrigators. 4. Conclusions The key findings
    of this research are summarised as follows: 1. Overall, the MAR scheme developed
    in this study demonstrated that water quality and water resource requirements
    were successfully met, and that MAR can be managed to augment irrigation water
    resources. The recharge source water contained concentrations of hazardous substances
    below the relevant minimum reporting values with only the non-hazardous substances
    (chloride, sulphate and nitrate) considered to be slightly above the permitted
    limits on several occasions. 2. The MAR scheme proved technically feasible, with
    the recharge mound restricted to within 250 m of the recharge site for an injected
    volume of 12,262 m3 during a period of 12 days. During this time, hydrochemical
    modelling showed that the fraction of recharge water mixing with the Crag groundwater
    ranged from 69% to 5% close to the centre and boundary of the recharge mound,
    respectively, leading to an improvement in background groundwater quality with
    a reduction in nitrate-N concentration of 23.6 mg L−1 at the centre of the recharge
    mound. Following infiltration, a volume of 12,301 m3 of recharged water was successfully
    recovered over a period of 55 days for irrigation water use, during which the
    groundwater quality returned to background concentrations. 3. As applied in this
    study, the risk of groundwater quality deterioration can be minimised by setting
    thresholds on the source water and by introducing relatively small volumes of
    water into the aquifer and ensuring that a high proportion of this infiltration
    is re-abstracted. 4. As in other MAR studies (Knapton et al., 2019), the aquifer
    permeability was an important factor, with the Crag aquifer hydraulic conductivity
    (∼10 m day−1) and thin saturated zone (∼5 m) at the recharge site found to be
    limiting factors constraining the volume of water that could be usefully stored
    and recovered. 5. Importantly, the loading of suspended inorganic and organic
    material from the recharge source water to the Crag aquifer was low and so limiting
    the risk, at least in the short term, of clogging and decline in permeability
    of the sands and gravels in the covered infiltration trenches, a problem that
    is reported for other MAR schemes (Kruisdijk et al., 2023). 6. In comparison to
    surface storage reservoirs that can require large areas of potentially productive
    land and involve high capital and environmental costs, MAR offers the opportunity
    of matching growth with enhanced environmental protection. Additionally, MAR provides
    an alternative means of storing high surface flows to ensure water supplies during
    periods of peak demand. 7. Construction costs for the MAR system designed in this
    study were comparatively low but the high costs of data collection and securing
    regulatory permits brought the overall capital costs to within 18% of an equivalent
    surface storage reservoir. 8. The marginal difference in costs in comparison to
    surface storage reservoirs is unlikely to outweigh the perceived difficulties
    and uncertainties involved in constructing and operating a MAR system without
    cost-effective, market-based mechanisms to incentivise groundwater recharge schemes
    on privately owned land (Bruce et al., 2023). Also, more streamlined regulatory
    processes to reduce licensing overheads are required. 9. This study showed that
    this and similar MAR schemes should ideally operate in conjunction with surface
    reservoir storage facilities to balance the demand, although the incorporation
    of reservoir storage has further economic implications. Alternatively, MAR could
    be used directly for low-volume irrigation systems such as trickle tape or mini
    sprinklers. 10. The wider benefits of the MAR scheme presented here are reflected
    in the contribution made to the sustainable use of water resources as an important
    strategy in helping alleviate regional water stress (Scanlon et al., 2023), while
    at the same time building partnerships that adhere to the international Sustainable
    Development Goals (United Nations, 2015). Author contribution statement Kevin

    06 December 2021 1 Introduction Agriculture is central to achieving water, energy,
    and food security [1], with irrigation playing a vital role in increasing productivity.
    In Brazil, a leading exporter of agricultural commodities, irrigation employs
    15 million people and has been essential to food and nutrition security [2]. This
    activity has historically been employed to increase food production, and recent
    studies have suggested that it provides multiple pathways to improved nutrition
    in areas suffering from severe food insecurity [3]. Typical national diet foods,
    such as rice, beans, vegetables, fruits, and vegetables, are produced through
    irrigation [4], a critical context with two billion people globally facing food
    insecurity [5]. Irrigated agriculture in Brazil has demonstrated steady growth
    over recent decades, even during unstable economic periods. From 2012 to 2019,
    this growth was further fueled by increased credit and private investments, leading
    to an annual expansion rate of approximately 4%, with an increase of around 216
    thousand hectares in irrigated areas each year. By 2019, the total value of irrigated
    production exceeded the BRL 55 billion mark [4]. Irrigation stands as the most
    electricity-intensive activity within agriculture, giving rise to environmental
    concerns such as resource depletion, global warming, and risks to human health
    [6]. In 2019, the agriculture sector accounted for 5.7% of Brazil’s electricity
    consumption, totaling 35.6991 TWh [7]. By 2020, the average consumption among
    irrigating rural consumers reached 2.50 MWh per consumer unit, in contrast to
    non-irrigating farmers at 0.34 MWh—a value seven times lower [8]. These figures
    underscore the significant impact of irrigation on the national energy scenario.
    Mitigating environmental damage poses a significant challenge to energy use within
    the agricultural sector. The development and integration of renewable energy sources,
    such as biomass, wind, and solar, are essential for creating sustainable solutions
    to this problem. This shift toward renewable energy not only promises a more diversified
    energy matrix for Brazil but also potentially reduces farmers’ dependence on potentially
    unreliable grid electricity. In turn, these changes can lead to a substantial
    reduction in the use of nonrenewable sources, contributing to the decarbonization
    of the electrical matrix. The use of solar energy to pump water for both irrigation
    and human consumption is not a novel concept. In this application, photovoltaic
    panels convert solar irradiation into energy, translating irradiance into available
    power, which is dependent on the efficiency of the photovoltaic panel. The principles
    of this conversion process, along with analyses of the economic viability of solar
    energy, have been thoroughly explored in extensive scholarly reviews [9, 10].
    In evaluating the economic and life cycle of solar panels, it is crucial to consider
    factors such as material degradation, efficiency reduction, and module replacement
    needs, not just financial depreciation [11]. Despite Brazil’s notable potential
    in solar energy—it was the leading source of electricity generation for micro
    and mini-generation in 2019 [7]—there are surprisingly few studies conducted within
    the country focusing on its innovative application in irrigation. Furthermore,
    Australian studies on off-grid irrigated sugarcane crops have identified opportunities
    for installing small-scale solar PV systems, resulting in cost savings in pumped
    irrigation and notable emission reductions [12]. Another study in Australia investigated
    the integration of renewable energy into off-grid irrigation systems by comparing
    replacing diesel generators with photovoltaics or combining the two technologies
    in a hybrid system [13]. The results showed that integrating solar PV systems
    in off-grid scenarios reduced emissions and costs and decreased exposure to future
    diesel fuel price fluctuations. In addition, Rehman and Sahin [14] in Saudi Arabia
    compared the costs of water pumping using diesel and solar power systems. They
    found that the water pumping costs were competitive when using a PV-only system.
    The cost of water pumping in a diesel-only system varies considerably based on
    the price of the diesel fuel. Yu et al. [15] conducted a case study on developing
    solar-irrigated cassava farming, showing that Guangxi (China) area is suitable
    for solar pump irrigation, promoting local development. According to the 10-year
    Brazilian Energy Plan [16], PV power generation has seen substantial growth within
    the Brazilian electricity matrix, reaching approximately 5.475 GW, and is projected
    to continue evolving through 2030, as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Yearly photovoltaic
    electricity generation forecast Full size image Some factors contribute to the
    growing popularity of solar energy. Investing in this energy source can increase
    property value; moreover, solar energy is considered inexhaustible, and the maintenance
    required after installation is minimal. 2 Background and objectives This section
    outlines the pertinent background of the Brazilian electricity market and the
    objectives of this research. State regulation in the electricity sector plays
    a vital role in economic development and lays the groundwork for sustainability
    in today’s world. Key legal milestones of this study include discounts on electric
    energy tariffs, modifications in the use of credits within a net-metering system,
    and certain tax exemptions. Table 1 provides a summary of the legal framework
    discussed. Table 1 Legal framework for discounts on electricity tariffs Full size
    table In 2012, Normative Resolution 482 classified consumers with distributed
    micro-generation and an installed power of up to 100 kW. These consumers were
    permitted to generate their energy using renewable sources [17] and could connect
    to the power network, with benefits credited in a net-metering system for use
    within 36 months [18]. In 2015, Normative Resolution 687 reduced the installed
    power requirement to 75 kW and extended the credit consumption period from 36
    to 60 months [19]. Electricity in Brazil is subject to three taxes: two federal
    (PIS and COFINS) and one state (ICMS). In 2015, two legal milestones enabled discounts
    on these taxes for consumers with distributed micro and mini-generation. Law 13,169
    [20] provided a total rebate of PIS and COFINS, while ICMS Agreement 16 [21] allowed
    a partial refund, about 60%, on ICMS [22]. Law 10,438 of 2002 first established
    electricity tariff discounts for rural consumers [23]. In 2013, Decree 7891 created
    a 30% discount for the rural class, which could be combined with additional discounts
    for irrigation or aquaculture at specific times [24]. Decree 9642 in 2018 reduced
    these discounts, phasing them out by 2023 [25]. Additionally, Law 13,169 in 2015
    exempted generating units of distributed micro-generation from certain taxes [23].
    Therefore, establishments with distributed micro-generation, having an installed
    power of up to 75 MW, can utilize generated credits within 60 months and benefit
    from certain tax exemptions. In 2022, Law 14,300 introduced new legislation regarding
    distributed generation. However, since the base year for this study was 2021,
    these changes have not yet been applied. After the preceding background information,
    this paper seeks to further investigate the topics by contributing the following
    analyses: Compare the financial performance of an on-grid photovoltaic system
    with a system connected to the Brazilian national grid Analyze the impacts of
    Brazilian Decree 9642 from 2018 on energy prices and the viability of on-grid
    photovoltaic systems 3 Study areas Brazil encompasses an area of 8, 5 million
    km2 and had an estimated population of 213 million in 2021 [26]. The country is
    divided into five geographic regions, as depicted in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Map showing
    the division of Brazilian regions Full size image Table 2 illustrates the total
    electricity consumption per region along with the consumption specific to rural
    and irrigating rural consumers. The Southeast region leads in electricity consumption,
    while the North region has the lowest. Notably, the Northeast region displays
    the highest percentage of rural and irrigating rural consumption concerning total
    consumption, underscoring the sector’s significance in that region. Table 2 Electricity
    consumption per region (GWh) Full size table In 2019, Brazil had an irrigated
    area of 8.2 million hectares (Mha), including both irrigation and fertigation,
    with an effective potential for expansion of 13.7 Mha [27]. Figure 3 illustrates
    the relative irrigated area for each region. The Southeast region accounted for
    most of the irrigated area in 2019. However, the Midwest region holds 46% of the
    potential for expansion, indicating a significant opportunity for increased irrigation
    in that area. Fig. 3 Relative irrigated area per region by [27] Full size image
    This trend in electricity tariffs, coupled with the fact that rural areas may
    not always have reliable access to electricity, underscores the importance of
    studying the use of renewable energy for these consumers. Diversifying the Brazilian
    electrical grid can enhance service reliability by increasing operational safety
    [28]. Pioneering studies that analyze service possibilities are essential to achieving
    this diversification for rural consumers (Fig. 4). Fig. 4 Electricity tariff by
    region—years 2012 and 2021 Full size image Different taxes are applied across
    Brazil’s regions. Table 3 outlines relevant taxes, including ‘imprur,’ the average
    rural tariff ratio with and without tax from 2012 to 2021, and ‘impirr,’ the corresponding
    ratio for irrigating taxation, both cited from reference [29], with ‘rICMS’ being
    the value of the ICMS rate [30]. The Midwest region holds the highest tax rate,
    and the Southeast region has the largest maximum ICMS value. Table 3 A summary
    of the taxes per region Full size table 4 Electricity tariff To analyze the evolution
    of electricity tariffs in Brazilian regions, we examined two models: linear and
    exponential, commonly used in the literature to study energy price evolution [31,
    32]. Energy tariff price data from 2012 to 2021 was obtained from the ANEEL Captive
    Market Report, aiding in the evaluation of the proposed models [30]. Equations
    (1 and 2) were applied, and the determination coefficient (r2) was calculated.
    The model with the highest r2 was used for subsequent calculations. $$ c\\left(
    y \\right) = c\\left( {y_{0} } \\right) + a \\times y\\quad {\\text{wherein}}\\quad
    a = \\frac{{c\\left( {y_{{\\text{L}}} } \\right) - c\\left( {y_{0} } \\right)}}{{y_{{\\text{L}}}
    - y_{0} }} $$ (1) $$ c\\left( y \\right) = c\\left( {y_{0} } \\right) + a^{y}
    \\quad {\\text{wherein}}\\quad a = \\left( {\\frac{{c\\left( {y_{L} } \\right)}}{{c\\left(
    {y_{0} } \\right)}}} \\right)^{{y_{L} - y_{0} }} $$ (2) wherein: c(y) is the electricity
    cost (BRL/kWh) in the year y, y0 is the first year of 2012, and yL is the last
    year of 2021. Table 4 presents the results of modeling residential tariffs without
    considering taxes, showing the r2 value for both linear and exponential models
    and the equation for the chosen model. The exponential model was the best fit
    for all regions, with the Southeast and Northeast regions having the highest and
    lowest escalation values, respectively. Table 4 Model results summarizing per
    region—residential tariff Full size table The residential tariff serves as a basis
    for calculating other tariffs over time. Table 5 details the two electricity tariff
    options and their corresponding equations. Table 5 Electricity rural tariff options
    Full size table Wherein: disrur is the rural tariff discount, and disirr is the
    irrigating tariff discount. For rural discounts, the authors considered two study
    cases: 1. Case 1: before Decree 9642, a 30% discount accumulation on the irrigation
    tariff was considered 2. Case 2: after Decree 9642, discount accumulation was
    considered only up to 2023 It is crucial to note that the cases studied, as referred
    to immediately above, are marked with a subscript corresponding to their number.
    Additionally, the authors considered a 73% discount on the nightly irrigator’s
    tariff for the Northeast region, 67% for the Midwest and North regions, and 60%
    for the others [33]. 5 Life cycle cost Financial analysis of systems can employ
    several metrics, including the life cycle cost (LCC). LCC considers all costs
    over the project’s lifetime, adjusted to present value. This makes it particularly
    useful in comparing systems with identical functionality but varying initial and
    operating costs [34]. For grid-connected systems, the LCC is based solely on electricity
    consumption. In contrast, the LCC for photovoltaic systems encompasses not only
    the cost related to minimum monthly electricity usage but also includes expenses
    for acquiring and maintaining photovoltaic generation equipment. The LCC calculation
    assumes a 25-year life cycle, with the project commencing in 2021. In this context,
    ‘systems’ refers to: Network (NW): a system without a photovoltaic panel, considering
    the irrigation tariff Photovoltaic (PV): an on-grid PV system, not considering
    the irrigation tariff Note that these systems are identified with a subscript
    corresponding to their name. For the PV system, the authors used a commercial
    photovoltaic kit, including a microinverter. Figure 5 depicts a schematic diagram
    of the elements involved in both the NW and PV approaches, with the photovoltaic
    equipment being the distinguishing factor. Fig. 5 Schematic of the network and
    photovoltaic systems Full size image The LCC for the network system is calculated
    using Eq. (3), adapted from [31]. This method can only be applied assuming that
    the annual electricity request (E) remains constant over the analyzed period.
    $${\\mathrm{LCC}}_{\\mathrm{NW}}=E\\times \\sum\\limits _{y=0}^{y=n-1}\\frac{{\\mathrm{imp}}_{\\mathrm{irr}}\\times
    {c}_{\\mathrm{irr}}\\left(y\\right)}{{\\left(1+i\\right)}^{y}}$$ (3) wherein:
    n is the period considered, and i is the annual discount rate of about 5% [31].
    To enhance the visualization and analysis of the data, the LCC was divided by
    the total energy required throughout the project’s lifetime, represented by the
    product of variables n and E. As a result, this value becomes independent of the
    annual electricity needed for the network system. This modified value is referred
    to as rLCC, as it represents the LCC relative to the total energy demand. Table
    6 displays the results for rLCCNW. Notably, the value for Case 2 is about 42%
    higher than the tariff value in Case 1. Table 6 Life cycle cost per kWh for the
    entire life of the network system (rLCC) Full size table The LCC for the PV system
    (LCCPV) comprises the sum of initial capital costs (ICC), operation and maintenance
    costs (O and M), electricity costs related to the minimum consumption (CEmin),
    and the tax cost on the compensated energy (CEimp), as shown in Eq. (4). $${\\mathrm{LCC}}_{\\mathrm{PV}}=\\mathrm{ICC}+O\\wedge
    M+{\\mathrm{CE}}_{\\mathrm{min}}+{\\mathrm{CE}}_{\\mathrm{imp}}$$ (4) Brazilian
    electricity distribution regulations mandate a minimum cost in tariffs related
    to availability. For two-phase consumers, this cost corresponds to 50 kWh/month
    [33], a value considered in this work. The ICC and O and M are calculated using
    Eqs. (5 and 6) [31], respectively. $$\\mathrm{ICC}=\\left(1+0.3\\right)\\times
    \\mathrm{Caq}\\times P$$ (5) $$O\\wedge M=0.02\\times \\mathrm{ICC}\\times \\frac{{\\left(1+i\\right)}^{n}-1}{i\\times
    {\\left(1+i\\right)}^{n}}$$ (6) wherein: 0.3 represents the relative cost for
    the project and implementation, equivalent to 30% of the acquisition cost [35];
    Caq is the acquisition cost of the PV kit per kWp (BRL/kWp); P is the peak power
    of the PV panels (kWp); 0.02 is the relative cost for operation and maintenance
    of a photovoltaic system, which is 2% of the investment cost per year [36]. The
    authors conducted a market survey to obtain the acquisition cost, resulting in
    a Caq of 4378.97 BRL/kWp. The P value was calculated according to Eq. (7). $$P=\\frac{E-600}{\\mathrm{Efv}}$$
    (7) The 600 represents the yearly minimum consumption measured in kWh/year, while
    Efv denotes the annual photovoltaic energy produced per kWp. Table 7 displays
    the minimum and maximum values for Efv for each region, sourced from [37]. Table
    7 Annual photovoltaic energy generated (Efv) per kWp: minimum and maximum values
    by Brazilian region Full size table Equation (8) illustrates the method for calculating
    CEmin. This approach mirrors the methodology used for LCCnw, with the value E
    replaced by the annual minimum consumption of 600 kWh/year and utilizing the electricity
    cost crur. $${\\mathrm{CE}}_{\\mathrm{min}}=600\\times \\sum\\limits _{y=0}^{y=n-1}\\frac{{\\mathrm{imp}}_{\\mathrm{rur}}\\times
    {c}_{\\mathrm{rur}}\\left(y\\right)}{{\\left(1+i\\right)}^{y}}$$ (8) Finally,
    Eq. (9) presents the method for calculating CEimp, adapted from [22]. This represents
    the portion of the electricity cost not subject to tax exemptions. $${\\mathrm{CE}}_{\\mathrm{imp}}=0.4\\times
    \\left(E-600\\right)\\times \\frac{{a}_{\\mathrm{ICMS}}}{1-{a}_{\\mathrm{ICMS}}}\\times
    \\sum\\limits _{y=0}^{y=n-1}\\frac{{c}_{\\mathrm{rur}}\\left(y\\right)}{{\\left(1+i\\right)}^{y}}$$
    (9) The annual minimum consumption is set at 600 kWh, and 0.4 represents the portion
    of the tariff subjected to taxes, as indicated by [22]. For the PV system, two
    scenarios were delineated for each region: The worst-case: using the lowest Efv
    value and the highest aICMS The best case: employing the highest Efv value and
    assuming no ICMS Furthermore, a spectrum of yearly energy requirements was established:
    The minimum power, based on market research, was pegged at 0.1 kW. Incorporating
    the smallest Efv value into the peak power calculation yielded the lowest annual
    electricity demand for the PV system at 696,828 kWh/year For this study, the upper
    limit for power consumption per unit is 75 kW. Assuming a pump runs continuously
    throughout the year (24 h/ 365 days), the maximum energy requirement is calculated
    at 657 MWh/year As for LCCNW, LCCPV was divided by the total electricity consumption
    for clearer representation, termed as rLCCPV. The results are illustrated in Fig.
    6. Fig. 6 Life cycle cost per kWh for the photovoltaic system over its entire
    lifespan Full size image When analyzing the results for the average annual energy
    requirement (328,848.414 kWh/year), the disparity between the worst and best-case
    scenarios ranges from 47% (for Case 1 in the Midwest region) to 180% (for Case
    2 in the Southeast region). The variance between Cases 1 and 2, under the same
    scenarios, spans from 0.26% (best-case in the South region) to 12% (worst-case
    in the Southeast region). These findings underscore two primary conclusions: (1)
    the final LCC of the photovoltaic system—and consequently, its attractiveness—is
    significantly influenced by the scenarios analyzed; and (2) the on-grid PV system
    offers increased resilience to legislative shifts in electricity tariff pricing.
    Figure 7 summarizes the LCC results for both NW and PV systems. Fig. 7 Life cycle
    cost per kWh generated over the entire life cycle for network and photovoltaic
    systems Full size image In the Midwest region, the PV system consistently outperforms
    the grid-connected system, especially when compared to Case 2 of the NW system.
    The PV system is always viable based on annual electricity demand. In contrast,
    the viability in other regions varies depending on the scenario. When the LCC
    of the photovoltaic (PV) system was lower than that of the non-PV system, it was
    deemed financially superior. Table 8 lists the least energy needed for this favorable
    outcome. Under Case 1, the PV system is not viable in the worst-case scenario,
    except for the Northeast in the best case. In Case 2, the Midwest is viable even
    in its worst scenario, while all regions are viable in the best-case scenario.
    These findings suggest that PV systems may offer irrigation producers a solution
    to offset the financial ramifications of legislative changes. Table 8 Minimum
    energy (kWh) for optimal photovoltaic system viability Full size table 6 Conclusion
    The discontinuation of the rural tariff discount has significantly increased energy
    costs for nighttime irrigators, with the estimated life cycle cost of electricity
    rising by about 42%. This presents a notable challenge for farmers who irrigate
    at night. However, on-grid photovoltaic (PV) systems emerge as a resilient solution
    to offset these tariff-driven cost increments from legislative changes. Notably,
    their cost varied only between 0.26 and 12%, demonstrating the stability of a
    PV system against tariff legislation changes. After Decree 9442, the PV system
    outperformed the grid system across all Brazilian regions. Its performance depended
    on energy requirements, PV generation levels, and the ICMS rate. Thus, PV systems
    present a viable strategy for nighttime irrigators to combat tariff-induced cost
    spikes in agriculture. For grid-connected systems in Brazil, photovoltaic (PV)
    systems are economically viable across all regions. Yet, their feasibility hinges
    on irradiation levels and the goods and services tax rate. Notably, the economic
    appeal of PV systems grows with increased electricity demand. This study highlights
    PV systems as a beneficial alternative for nighttime irrigators against fluctuating
    energy tariffs. By promoting policies focused on financing, cooperatives, and
    education, stakeholders can foster a sustainable and cost-effective agricultural
    energy framework, paving the way for a greener and more robust sector future.

  description: An extensive field study was presented to optimize the irrigation techniques
    for water use efficiency (WUE) and yield in dwarf and densely planted fragrant
    pears in South Xinjiang. A two-factor and fully randomized design was conducted
    in the 29th regiment of Xinjiang. Three advanced micro-irrigation systems were
    selected— surface drip irrigation (M1), subsurface drip irrigation (M2), and root-zone
    infiltration irrigation (M3)— with traditional flood irrigation (CK) as a comparative
    baseline. Three irrigation quotas were set as low (I1), medium (I2), and high
    (I3) to evaluate their suitability under the varying limitations of water resources.
    A systematic analysis was then implemented to assess the impact of these irrigation
    modes on several critical parameters, including electrical conductivity (EC),
    desalination rate, growth patterns, yield, WUE, fruit quality, and economic viability.
    The results show that the subsurface drip irrigation (M2) demonstrated superior
    performance to enhance the yield and WUE. Notable benefits were obtained to promote
    the pear growth for the fruit quality. The performance was statistically comparable
    to M3 (P > 0.05) in the effective salt leaching. Moreover, irrigation modes and
    irrigation quotas significantly dominated the soil salinity distribution (P<0.05).
    Three micro-irrigation modes produced a certain degree of salt aggregation, except
    for the diffuse irrigation. The difference among irigation modes was not significant
    (P>0.05). Both irrigation modes and irrigation quotas dominated the yield and
    water use efficiency of fragrant pear. The fruit diameter, yield, water use efficiency,
    and net profit of M1 were significantly higher than those of surface irrigation
    (CK and M1) under the same irrigation quotas. But there was no significant difference
    with M3 (P<0.05). Despite the higher initial investment, M3 generated substantial
    net profits, second only to M2. Further analysis revealed that the higher irrigation
    quota consistently improved the fragrant pear growth, yield, and salt-leaching
    efficiency. PPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA), technique for order preference
    by similarity to an ideal solution (TOPISIS), and rank-sum ratio (RSR) were also
    employed to evaluate— integrating environmental, qualitative, and economic factors,
    and then identify fifteen key indices. The M2I3 treatment emerged as the most
    effective, while M1I1 was the least. In conclusion, the M2 irrigation mode was
    recommended for the dwarf and densely planted first-fruiting fragrant pears. An
    optimal irrigation quota of 6 750 m3/hm2 was achieved in the growth period. This
    finding can greatly contribute the significant insights and practical guidance
    for the higher efficient, water-conserving, and salt-controlled production in
    the arid regions of Southern Xinjiang. Substantial theoretical and technical support
    can also be offered for the forestry and fruit industry. Furthermore, a scientific
    basis can be gained for the application of water-saving irrigation in the "labor-saving
    and dense planting" cultivation area of fragrant pear.

    conductivity，EC）和脱盐率（rate of desalination，ROD）、香梨生长、产量、WUE、果实品质和净效益的影响。结果表明：M2的产量和WUE最高，与M1和CK相比，其产量分别提高22.11%～26.27%、7.04%～14.14%，WUE分别提高26.51%～29.58%、20.11%～24.99%，且与M3相比差异不显著（P>0.05）；此外，M2可以促进香梨生长，提高果实品质以及促进盐分淋洗。M3前期的投入成本最大，但获得的净利润仅次于M2。灌溉方式相同时，增加灌溉定额能有利于香梨生长，提高产量和盐分淋洗。基于主成分分析等3种综合评价方法从环境效益、果实品质和经济效益3个方面，选取15个评价指标进行综合评价，M2I3处理综合得分最高，M1I1处理综合得分最低。因此推荐矮化密植初果期的香梨采用地下滴灌模式，生育期灌溉定额为6

    Introduction Throughout its war against Ukraine, Russia has remorselessly targeted
    civilian infrastructure, focusing on energy facilities [ 1] and dams that are
    crucial for water distribution, resource management, and transport routes. The
    repercussions of these dam demolitions extend beyond disruption of domestic and
    industrial water supply: they are ecological emergencies and societal turmoil
    encompassing loss of livelihoods, depletion of ecosystem services and recreational
    opportunities [ 2]. As of the current date in the summer of 2023, the cumulative
    economic damages amount to $US150billion, including some $4-5 billion in direct
    disablement of irrigation systems and $2 billion attributed to flooding of adjoining
    territories [ 3]. At dawn on 6 June 2023, the Nova Kakhovka Dam on the Dnipro
    River near Kherson, suffered a catastrophic breach. The dam held back one of the
    world’s largest reservoirs, referred to within Ukraine as the Kakhov Sea [ 4].
    Immediately, some 80 settlements found themselves within the flood zone, compelling
    about 36 000 inhabitants to relocate under artillery fire, and 450 tonnes of fuel
    and machine oil were released into the water. The regions of Dnipropetrovsk (with
    a loss of 30% irrigation capacity), Zaporizhzhia (experiencing a 75% loss in irrigation
    capacity), and Kherson (nearly 100% loss) face a severe reduction in their irrigation
    systems. Moreover, disruption of the mains water supply affected 700 000 residents,
    and the shortage of water for industry halted metallurgical and mining operations
    in the Dnipropetrovsk region [ 5]. The Kakhov irrigation system relied on the
    main canal to transport nearly 4 km3 of water annually. Similarly, the North Crimean
    Canal, normally dry during winter, ordinarily transported 1.2 km3 of water per
    year but, in the summer of 2022, Russian forces took control of the main intake
    of this canal and deliberately filled the reservoirs in Crimean Peninsula with
    Dnipro water to levels 120% higher than usual, flooding territories adjacent to
    the canal. The Kakhov Reservoir constitutes the sixth reservoir within the Dnipro
    River’s sequence [ 6] (Figure 1). The Nova Kakhovka dam and its associated hydroelectric
    power plant were completed in 1956 but their origins go back to the drought of
    1946 that triggered famine in 1946–1947. The Soviet administration responded by
    initiating a transformation of the country, encompassing industrialisation and
    the irrigation systems alongside provision of domestic water supplies [ 7]. The
    alteration of natural landscapes and ecosystems to meet burgeoning human demands
    has brought considerable and irreversible damage across every facet of the natural
    environment. Figure 1. The largest reservoirs of Ukraine on the Dnipro River:
    a) Ukraine, topography; b) river catchments; c) cascade and main operating characteristics
    of reservoirs. Display full size Transformation of the landscape included construction
    of reservoirs, inter- basin water transfer, planting windbreaks, and the cultivation
    of previously untouched land [ 8]. Over time, the adverse repercussions on river
    ecosystems have grown increasingly conspicuous [ 9, 10], emerging as a pressing
    concern within the framework of Ukraine’s present ecological and water-security
    considerations [ 11, 12]. The safeguarding, rehabilitation, and judicious use
    of land and water resources are now focal points of sustainable development and
    are regulated by legislation [ 13]. The creation of the Kakhov Reservoir epitomised
    the assumptions of its time: ‘We cannot wait for favours from nature, our task
    is to wrest them from her’. 1 The primary objective behind the construction of
    the Kakhov dam was to irrigate tracts of Ukraine’s steppe zone, along with providing
    water for Crimea. The disparity in scale becomes evident upon examining Figure
    1, which underscores the modest capacity of the Kakhov hydropower compared to
    others along the Dnipro River [ 14]; contributing merely one percent of the country’s
    electricity output. Amidst the rhetoric of affordable and sustainable electrical
    power, the actual cost was substantial. Tracts of fertile land were drowned with
    little attention paid to the ramifications for ecosystems. The full extent and
    consequences of the destruction of these hydraulic structures (as depicted in
    Figure 2) were largely disregarded. During the reservoir’s filling between 1955
    and 1958, an historically significant area known as Veliky Lug, encompassing flooded
    meadows, forests, lakes, and approximately 90 villages, was submerged [ 15] and
    an annual erosion of the shoreline by 1 to 3 metres ensued. A gradual adaptation
    to the transformed landscape led to a certain degree of ecological equilibrium,
    marked by alterations in the composition of aquatic, plant and animal life, as
    well as adjustments in the territory’s microclimate. Figure 2. Kakhov reservoir
    before and after destruction, from open source geoinformation systems. Display
    full size We now face a second calamity for the ecosystem and society: the towns
    of Melitopol and Berdyansk in the Zaporizhzhia region, still under occupation,
    have no potable water; cessation of irrigation across the southern steppes spells
    the loss of many thousands of rural livelihoods; moreover, a reduction of one
    and a half metres in the cooling water level of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power
    plant would render its reactors inoperative, risking a catastrophic incident [
    16]. Consequently, Ukraine confronts a series of inquiries spanning political,
    scientific, social and everyday dimensions. Should the Kakhov reservoir be reconstructed?
    What lies ahead in terms of the region’s growth prospects? How can an equilibrium
    be struck between addressing the present needs of the populace and safeguarding
    the natural environment for generations to come? In this context, we evaluate
    the present condition and future potential of irrigation development in southern
    Ukraine, drawing upon the ecological and economic principles of sustainability.
    Objective 1: Examine the ramifications of the obliteration of the Kakhov reservoir
    for the region’s irrigation infrastructure. Objective 2: Scrutinise the configuration
    of land use, levels of technical functionality and economics governing the operation
    of irrigation systems, employing the biggest of them – the Kakhov system – as
    a case study. Objective 3: Formulate recommendations for the augmentation of water
    resources for agriculture and the sustenance of water supplies for the steppe
    region of southern Ukraine, all within the framework of the evolving national
    water strategy. Review In the three decades following the dissolution of the USSR
    in 1991, Ukraine was transformed from the fifth largest economy in Europe to a
    Third World country. The population dwindled from 52 million to approximately
    40 million by 2021, with a significant portion – from 5 to 8 million individuals
    – now displaced as refugees in foreign lands. This decline has been driven by
    a political crisis that triggered a cascade of deterioration across all sectors
    of the state, coupled with the erosion of moral and physical vitality of mining,
    metallurgy, chemical and mechanical engineering, and other industries. Against
    this backdrop, tracts of fertile chernozem soil and the well-developed irrigation
    infrastructure continued to provide a foundation for agriculture, which provides
    the backbone of the economy [ 17]. Lastly, this shift is also influenced by Western
    trade partners who envision Ukraine’s trajectory centred on primary production,
    as opposed to high-technology pursuits. During the mid-20th century, animal husbandry
    held considerable prominence and demanded substantial amounts of fodder. Scientific
    advances in agronomy contributed to well-structured crop rotations [ 18], which
    in certain regions encompassed as many as ten distinct crops. But, in the new
    millennium, livestock production experienced a dramatic decline. The global appetite
    for grains and industrial crops precipitated a shift to abbreviated rotations
    of wheat, maize, soybeans, sunflower, and rapeseed [ 19]. Across the steppes,
    high yields of these crops depend on irrigation [ 20, 21]. The prospect of international
    investment and global markets was coupled with Ukraine’s robust infrastructure
    spanning irrigation systems, railways, roads and ports. Parliament has passed
    the first reading of draft law No.7577 that facilitates the establishment of non-commercial
    entities (operators) capable of drawing in investment for the enhancement of water
    management systems. Advocates assert that this step will fortify the water resource
    reforms initiated in 2019 through the adoption of the Irrigation and Drainage
    Strategy for Ukraine, initially intended to reach 2030 [ 22], now extended to
    2050 [ 13]. The World Bank and FAO estimate that $4 billion is needed for the
    achievement of this strategy, not including the annual staff costs of employees
    of governmental bodies and institutions tasked with its execution. An illustrative
    instance of investment in agricultural water resource management can be found
    in the USAID AGRO programme [ 23], which was designed to channel over $2 million
    towards the modernisation of irrigation pilot projects in southern Ukraine. Irrigation
    infrastructure of southern Ukraine Ukraine has 13 extensive irrigation systems,
    collectively encompassing a registered area of 2.3 million ha [ 24, 25]. These
    systems have been in operation for more than sixty years and over 85% of these
    assets have fallen into disrepair because of insufficient investment, inadequate
    technical oversight, and neglected maintenance. Ineffective water conservation
    practices [ 26–29] and weak system administration have made them uneconomic and,
    as a consequence, the irrigated area has dwindled from its peak of 2.3 million
    ha to about 300 000 ha by 2022 (Figure 3). Furthermore, during the three decades
    1990–2020, the use of manure and fertilisers has fallen substantially, leading
    to a decrease in both the overall yield of agricultural produce and its quality.
    Figure 3. Changes in agricultural production on irrigated land in Ukraine: cereals
    (winter wheat, barley, maize); vegetables (tomato, cabbage, carrot, cucumber,
    pepper, onion). Data on the use of mineral and organic fertilizers are presented
    for all types of soil and agricultural production conditions, including without
    irrigation. Display full size Concurrently with the construction of the Kakhov
    Reservoir [ 30, 31], a comprehensive network of irrigation systems was established,
    incorporating structural components notable for their remarkable scale and advanced
    technology (as depicted in Figure 4). The original book value of the Kakhov irrigation
    networks exceeded $3.5 billion, which translates to approximately $4–4.2billion
    in present-day currency values. The latter figure corresponds to the projected
    expense of rehabilitation, although a more precise estimate must await the region’s
    liberation. Figure 4. A fragment of the Kakhov irrigation system (centre pivot
    and lateral line irrigators) open-source data. Display full size The primary irrigation
    and water supply systems in the southern region of Ukraine, previously sustained
    by the Kakhov Reservoir, encompass the Kakhov irrigation area, spanning about
    260 000 ha (with a water intake rate of 530 m3/s); the North-Crimean Canal irrigation
    zone, spanning about 280 000 ha (water intake rate 294 m3/s); the North-Rohachytska
    irrigation region, covering roughly 102 000 ha (water intake rate 52 m3/s); and
    the Krasnoznamyansk irrigated area, spanning about 96 000 ha (water intake rate
    65 m3/s). At present, all of these areas are under occupation. On the Ukraine-controlled
    right bank, the Dnipro-Kryvyi Rih canal is without water; historically, the Kakhov
    Reservoir supplied over 500 million cubic metres of water annually for the city
    of Kryvyi Rih, as well as about 100 million cubic metres for irrigation. Irrigation
    economics Even before destruction of the Kakhov reservoir, none of this water
    was accessible and blockade of the ports prevented access to international markets,
    so the agricultural sector of the economy operated at a financial loss [ 32, 33].
    Figure 5 shows an estimation of the economic viability of the Kakhov irrigation
    system. Figure 5. Agricultural production on irrigated lands: example of Kakhov
    irrigation system. Display full size The illustrated crop rotation is representative
    of irrigated lands throughout Ukraine: incorporating grain crops (winter wheat,
    barley) at 20.0%; maize at 7.1%; soybeans at 32.1%; rapeseed at 6.3%; sunflower
    at 3.9%; and vegetables at 30.6%. Irrigation standards for each specific crop
    adhere to the established Ukrainian norms [ 34]. The pricing of water is based
    on the current rate of $0.955 per 1 m3. The product cost incorporates seeds, fertilisers,
    fuel and lubricants, land preparation and pest control [ 35]. Electricity consumption
    is computed considering an average lift height of water up to 20 m. On average,
    the following water volumes are required to grow 1 tonne of crops: about 190 m3
    for grains, 400–450 m3 for technical crops, and 150 m3 for vegetables. Currently,
    cultivating grain crops such as wheat, maize or soybeans is uneconomic. Under
    favourable weather conditions and by minimising irrigation, a break-even financial
    outcome is feasible for rapeseed and sunflower. Cultivation of vegetables and
    soft fruits proves to be profitable but vegetable cultivation, horticulture and
    vineyards demand substantial initial investment [ 36]; the yield from these activities
    is delayed, generating an income generation only after 5–7 years. The availability
    of human resources also poses challenges: war has displaced many local residents
    and the destruction of the Kakhov reservoir has eliminated employment opportunities
    for most of the remaining population. Irrigation alternatives Initial expert assessments
    indicate that restoring the hydraulic structures and the Kakhov Reservoir will
    likely require more than a decade and a financial investment exceeding $1–1.5
    billion [ 37]. Neither the environment nor society will remain in waiting. The
    ecosystems in the waterless regions will gradually adjust to the new circumstances,
    leading ecologists to highlight losses of rare species [ 38]. Similarly, society
    will actively seek other options and, considering the above calculations, there
    is potential for horticulture. On a global scale, recent years have witnessed
    significant growth in the demand and supply of certain nuts: pistachio production
    has surged threefold, almonds and walnuts have increased by 2.7 times, and hazelnuts
    by 1.5 times [ 39]. Projections indicate that, by 2030, the global nut market
    will be valued in the tens of billions of dollars. Simultaneously, advanced irrigation
    techniques like drip and subsoil micro-irrigation not only conserve water but
    can, also, deliver fertilisers and plant protection agents along with irrigation
    water [ 40–42]. In relation to the use of surface water for irrigation in the
    Kherson region, a network of streams feed into the Dnipro River, along with 1154
    ponds encompassing a combined area of 12 317 ha that were originally constructed
    to regulate streamflow [ 6] but, in practice, obstructed the natural flow and
    self-cleansing processes, leading to a significant deterioration in water quality
    [ 11, 12]. The water sources in the Kherson region derive 85–90% of their volume
    from snowmelt and 10–15% from groundwater. Consequently, during the spring, the
    ponds expand but many dry up completely during the summer. This dry period is
    accompanied by a substantial increase in water mineralisation, with concentrations
    rising from about 700 mg/dm3 in the spring to 2000 mg/dm3 or more by the end of
    summer, when irrigation becomes necessary [ 6]. As a substitute for the Kakhov
    Reservoir, the use of groundwater for irrigation offers a partial solution, particularly
    in meeting the diminished water demands associated with drip irrigation. Nonetheless,
    most of the available aquifers hold brackish water at best [ 43]. Consequently,
    implementing this alternative entails not only the costs of well drilling and
    pumping [ 44] but, also, the need to blend waters to attain an acceptable water
    quality [ 45]. Prolonged irrigation of extensive regions within the Ukrainian
    Steppe using substandard water has led to various adverse effects, including soil
    degradation, secondary salinisation, and inundation of neighbouring land [ 46–48].
    Solutions to this predicament require focused research into secondary salinity
    and the systematic validation of chemical interventions to rectify the physical
    and chemical properties of the soil – from which funding has been withdrawn over
    the past few decades. Energy usage constitutes a distinct and vital component
    of system functioning [ 49]. Historically, the high-capacity pumping stations
    displayed a great appetite for energy, compounded by obsolete machinery and high
    electricity costs, which imposed a heavy financial burden on farmers (Figure 5).
    Contemporary global patterns and advances in local technology have opened alternative
    energy resources – for instance, the integration of solar panels to supply energy
    to irrigation machinery and its corresponding control nodes [ 50, 51]. The Institute
    of Water Problems and Reclamation [ 52] projects that by 2050, the changing climate
    will render approximately 47% of the country’s agricultural land unsuitable for
    cultivation without the implementation of irrigation. Looking ahead to 2100, this
    portion could escalate to 66%, when unfavourable climatic conditions and the absence
    of irrigation infrastructure may result in Ukraine missing out on about 13.5 million
    tonnes of grain and industrial crops, as well as 11 million tonnes of fruit and
    vegetables every year. These challenges and potential remedies have been considered
    within the Water Strategy of Ukraine for the period up to 2050 [ 13]. The overhaul
    of water resource management, particularly irrigation, endeavours to augment the
    overall efficacy of water use, enhance managerial transparency, and amplify income
    streams directed towards both local and central budgets (Figure 6). Figure 6.
    Scheme of hydromelioration reform in Ukraine. Display full size Among the available
    irrigation techniques, overhead irrigation (sprinklers) remains the popular choice.
    With appropriate water supply, the initial setup expense amounts to $2000–3000
    per hectare, and the period required for recouping this investment spans 3–5 years.
    In situations where water availability is restricted, drip irrigation is an alternative
    [ 53, 54]. Drip irrigation systems can either be positioned above the soil surface
    using one-year drip tapes or be integrated beneath the surface, delivering water
    directly to plant roots via perforated tubing positioned at depths ranging from
    10 to 30 centimetres. The subsoil drip system has a lifespan of 5–20 years. Compared
    to sprinklers, drip irrigation offers water savings of up to 50% and, when combined
    with fertilisation (referred to as fertigation), can contribute to reductions
    of as much as 30% in fertiliser consumption and as much as 20% in the use of plant-protection
    agents. This technology is particularly well-suited to horticulture, viticulture,
    fruit and berry cultivation, as well as vegetable growing. The initial cost ranges
    from $1200 to $1500/ha for surface installation and between $3000 and $4500/ha
    for sub-surface systems. Throughout history, people have pursued control over
    territories rich in valuable assets: be they precious metals, minerals, or fertile
    soils. Today, water is becoming scarce in many parts of the world, because of
    accelerating climate change and other adverse impacts of human activities on the
    environment [ 55]. Given Ukraine’s straitened circumstances and the profound lessons
    of wartime [ 56], water emerges as a paramount resource for our future. In our
    view, a fresh approach to water security is imperative, and the strategy of the
    nation should be grounded in comprehensive legislation governing the preservation,
    rehabilitation, and judicious use of this precious resource. Conclusions The establishment
    of a series of big reservoirs and irrigation networks during the mid-20th century
    wrought ecological catastrophe upon the landscape of the southern steppes. The
    financial impact of the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam and the consequent loss
    of 18 billion m3 of water resources across an expanse of 2 155 km2 is estimated
    to be about $2 billion. Irrigation has been terminated across 750 000 ha of arable
    land and water supply to the southern regions of Ukraine is cut off. Assessment
    of the structural and economic viability of agriculture on irrigated lands underscores
    the unprofitability of cultivating grain and industrial crops. This challenge
    is compounded by the intricate logistics of exporting and selling these products
    at exceedingly low prices. Equitable provision of water across all sectors of
    the economy, guided by the principles of conserving energy and resources, is fundamental
    to the sustainable development of southern Ukraine. A viable substitute for surface-water
    irrigation could include tapping groundwater, facilitated by solar panels and
    other sources of renewable energy. Fresh technological strategies for irrigation
    and redesign of cropping systems are being examined. These include a greater emphasis
    on micro-irrigation and expansion of vegetable growing, horticulture and viticulture.
    Provision of water to sustain 5-7 million people and the potential for irrigating
    over 1 million ha of farmland across Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, Dnipropetrovsk, and
    Mykolaiv Districts, along with Crimea, demands novel technical, technological,
    and socio-economic paradigms within the water strategy. These advances are also
    prerequisites for water security in the face of climate change. Initial indications
    and expert evaluations suggest that post-conflict investments required for regional
    recovery and rebuilding and, specifically, in irrigation systems, will amount
    to tens of billions of dollars. Disclosure statement No potential conflict of

  description: Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the lowest rate of electricity access
    and irrigation in the world, at 45% and 5% respectively. The problem is in part
    due to the low economic viability of rural electrification, particularly through
    grid extension, lack of low-cost irrigation energy, and limited access to finance
    for the high cost of irrigation infrastructure. Despite their promising potential,
    minigrids’ deployment has been rather slow in SSA, partly due to the lack of viable
    business models for the dispersed low-income rural population. In this paper,
    we present an integrated model that couples a minigrid model with a crop model
    to explore the nexus potential of joint deployment of minigrids with smallholder
    irrigation to alleviate barriers to both minigrid scale-up and irrigation adoption.
    We apply the proposed model to three rural case studies in different geographical
    contexts in SSA. Our simulation results show the potential of irrigation loads
    to lower the unit cost of minigrid energy (LCOE) by up to 47%, depending on the
    quantity of irrigable land and its spatial distribution. A further scenario-based
    sensitivity analysis of the minigrid with and without aggregate irrigation load
    shows wide variations in LCOE–between a minimum of $0.24/kWh and a maximum of
    $1.2/kWh–with changes in the cost of capital and technology cost. Regarding irrigation
    viability, our model results show that irrigation profitability is a function
    of a complex interplay of factors, including crop type, soil fertility, infrastructure
    costs, energy prices, fertiliser application rate, and crop farm gate prices.
    We further test the effects of pay-as-you-go (PAYGo) business model incentives
    on the profitability of irrigation with minigrids; our results show that various
    incentives that alleviate either all or a fraction of upfront capital cost do
    not only mitigate irrigation adoption barrier but also enhances its profitability
    on the part of the farmer. Finally, our model results underscore that the economic
    viability of joint deployment of minigrids with smallholder irrigation depends
    on the optimal combination of agro-ecological factors of production (location
    suitability), type of crop (on a descending order, onion, tomato, and potato are
    the most profitable crops in our model), fertiliser application rate (near-optimal
    to optimal soil fertility is recommended) and cost scenarios (low cost of capital
    and technology preferred). In the main, our model and the results thereof highlight
    the potential benefits of co-planning minigrids and irrigation projects. Our model
    and results presented in this paper can be used as high-level decision-making
    pointers on the nexus planning of minigrids with smallholder irrigation farming.

    Highlights • Irrigation loads reduce the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of the
    minigrid by up to 47%. • Irrigation loads achieve minigrid LCOE range of $0.24/kWh
    to $1.2/kWh. • Pay-as-you-go (PAYGo) business model enhances irrigation profitability
    for the farmer. • Irrigation profitability depends on soil fertility, costs location,
    crop type prices. Abstract Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has the lowest rate of electricity

    Previous article in issue Next article in issue Keywords Electricity accessMinigridsSmallholder
    irrigationSub-Saharan AfricaIrrigation viabilityIrrigation benefitsLevelised cost
    of pumping energy Introduction The goal of universal electricity access has spurred
    concerted efforts to address energy poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Despite
    this, the region still lags significantly behind the rest of the world. Approximately
    65% of the SSA population remained without electricity access as of 2022 (International
    Energy Agency, 2022), with the rural population disproportionately underserved
    at a 28% access rate (Kyriakarakos, Balafoutis, & Bochtis, 2020). According to
    the Energy Sector Management Assistance Programme (ESMAP), due to current divergent
    population growth projections and low electrification rates, an estimated 650
    million people in SSA will live without electricity access by 2030 (Energy Sector
    Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), 2022). It is worth noting that this projected
    population who will live without electricity in 2030 is higher than the present
    rate (as of 2022), which is about 570 millions (Energy Sector Management Assistance
    Program (ESMAP), 2022, International Energy Agency, 2022). This projection suggests
    that the SSA region’s population is growing at a higher rate than the growth in
    electrification rate. The region is largely rural, with more than 55% of its population
    residing in dispersed settlements characterised by low population density (UN-Habitat,
    2020), limited income, and low potential electricity demand (Agenbroad, Carlin,
    Ernst, & Doig, 2018). Electrification of such a demographic through grid extension
    is cost-prohibitive from a system cost perspective (Bonan, Pareglio, & Tavoni,
    2017). This underscores that achieving United Nations Sustainable Development
    Goal 7 (SDG-7), which aims to provide affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern
    energy for all by 2030, will require the nations of SSA to think of alternative
    ways, beyond centralised grids. Contemporary research literature suggests that
    a large proportion of the currently unelectrified rural population in developing
    nations would be served at least cost by minigrids, otherwise community-level
    microgrids (Blum, Wakeling, & Schmidt, 2013). According to Daly and Walton (2017),
    minigrids play a critical role in the ‘universal electricity access for all’ scenario,
    accounting for 48% of the required investments by 2030, which is corroborated
    in Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) (2019). However, despite
    their high prospects, their deployment scale has been rather slow in SSA as compared
    to other developing regions of the world, such as South Asia. The low electricity
    demand of the predominantly rural population of SSA (ENEA Consulting, 2020, Peters
    et al., 2019) and the high non-payment risks due to limited formal income (Agenbroad
    et al., 2018) are significant barriers to private sector investment in the mini-grid
    sector in SSA (Agenbroad et al., 2018, Bonan et al., 2017, ENEA Consulting, 2020,
    Peters et al., 2019, Williams et al., 2018). Mitigating these minigrid deployment
    barriers calls for an integrated model that stimulates electricity demand while
    at the same time enhancing the economic well-being of the end-users. Admittedly,
    electricity demand is a function of varying contextual factors including the ability
    to purchase and own electrical appliances and the ability to pay for electricity
    bills (Agenbroad et al., 2018). Moreover, there exists a meaningful relationship
    between household economic poverty and energy poverty: economically poorer households
    rank high on the energy poverty scale (Bonan et al., 2017). To this end, reducing
    economic poverty has direct potential to mitigate multiple energy access barriers
    including low demand and non-payment risks (Bonan et al., 2017). Evidence in the
    current literature suggests that productive use of electricity (PUE), using electricity
    for economically productive activities, including value addition in agriculture,
    can mitigate low demand (Agenbroad et al., 2018, Dagnachew et al., 2023, Energy
    Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), 2022, Kyriakarakos et al., 2020,
    McCall and Santana, 2018) and non-payment risks and consequently improve the viability
    of operating minigrids in SSA (Blodgett et al., 2016, Bonan et al., 2017, Cabraal
    et al., 2005). According to Ngowi, Bångens, and Ahlgren (2019), PUE in agricultural
    activities, such as milling and water pumping, has the potential to increase the
    minigrids’ load factor resulting in reduced levelised cost of energy (LCOE). In
    Kyriakarakos et al. (2020), the authors present a minigrid deployment model anchored
    on maize milling using a case study in Rwanda. The results of the study show that
    maize milling can lower the minigrid’s LCOE and through cross-subsidisation, enhance
    access to electricity by residential consumers who will otherwise not afford the
    high cost of minigrid energy. These findings are corroborated in McCall and Santana
    (2018). Anchoring a minigrid with a fish freezing load increased its load factor
    and provided a revenue stream to sustain its economic operation. These examples
    underscore the potential of PUE in increasing electricity demand and improving
    affordability (by lowering the cost per unit of energy), leading to greater degree
    of inclusion. Despite the technical proof of concept, the deployment of minigrids
    in SSA has been rather slow due to the scarcity of significant PUE loads to serve
    as anchors (Agenbroad et al., 2018, ENEA Consulting, 2020), and therefore it is
    necessary to explore demand stimulation strategies (Agenbroad et al., 2018) to
    increase electricity demand for viable operation of minigrids and mitigate non-payment
    risks. Due to the critical importance of agriculture in SSA, PUE in agriculture
    has the potential to realise the broadest economic dividends in terms of alleviating
    rural poverty and enhancing economic growth when compared to other economic sectors.
    According to Shah, Verma, and Pavelic (2013), agriculture creates more than 70%
    of informal rural employment and contributes up to 40% of the gross domestic product
    (GDP) of the region, despite its low mechanisation status, and has a potential
    to reduce poverty three to four times compared to other productive sectors (Christiaensen,
    Demery, & Kuhl, 2011). Food production is dominated by smallholders who rely mainly
    on natural rainfall (Burney & Naylor, 2012); only about 5% of the region’s arable
    land was under some form of irrigation by 2016 (International Renewable Energy
    Agency (IRENA), 2016), which paled compared to 40% in South Asia (International
    Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 2016). The region’s agricultural productivity
    of maize, a staple in many countries in SSA, averages 2.0 ton/ha, which is 39%
    of the world’s average production (Ba, 2017). This low yield is partly due to
    over-reliance on unpredictable rainfall, which is projected to become more uncertain
    in mid-to-long term futures with the ongoing climate change (Burney, Naylor, &
    Postel, 2013). There is a consensus in the current literature that smallholder
    irrigation can increase agricultural productivity (Babovic et al., 2009, Burney
    and Naylor, 2012, Hagos et al., 2009), reduce the current food insecurity and
    improve economic well-being of people in SSA (Burney and Naylor, 2012, Burney
    et al., 2013). According to Hagos et al. (2009), pump-based irrigation tripled
    tomato and onion yield and doubled cereals (maize and teff) in Ethiopia and Ghana.
    However, its adoption is hampered by the high cost of irrigation infrastructure
    (Lebdi, 2016), and lack of low cost irrigation energy (Kumar, 2005, Villholth,
    2013) due to limited grid access in rural areas. Access to low-cost irrigation
    energy through government subsidies was instrumental to the success of the Asian
    green revolution, particularly in India, characterised by increased uptake of
    groundwater-fed irrigation and increased agricultural productivity (Kumar, 2005).
    From the Indian green revolution, we infer the potential of low-cost irrigation
    energy in accelerating the adoption of irrigation in SSA. For energy planners,
    policy-makers and minigrid developers, irrigation can provide the required load
    demand for viable deployment and operation of minigrids (Falchetta, 2021, McCall
    and Santana, 2018) which are currently not economically viable without subsidies
    (Maqelepo, Williams, & Taneja, 2022). Conversely, electrification of smallholder
    irrigation farming has potential to increase agricultural productivity and enhance
    food security of the region (Babovic et al., 2009, Nilsson et al., 2021). However,
    it must be remarked here that exploitation of the nexus benefits of joint deployment
    of minigrids with smallholder irrigation is complex as observed in Falchetta (2021).
    Success of such a nexus requires policy and regulatory reforms and strategic cross-sectoral
    partnerships of all the involved actors–including relevant government institutions,
    technology providers, minigrid developers, and financial institutions. It is not
    until recently that some governments in SSA have started exploring the synergistic
    potential of interaction between agriculture and rural electrification and the
    need for a systems approach to the rollout of the nexus projects. A recent relevant
    example is the Distributed Renewable Energy–Agriculture Modalities (DREAM) project
    in Ethiopia (Energy Market Accelerator Ethiopia (AMAE), 2021). The project aims
    to deploy irrigation-anchored minigrids as off-grid electrification vehicles in
    Ethiopia. In that perspective, irrigation loads will provide stable and predictable
    load demand to mitigate the low demand barrier, and, conversely, the minigrids
    will provide low-cost energy for smallholder irrigation. Besides the few recent
    pilot projects like the DREAM project (being piloted as from 2022) described above,
    there is scant evidence in the contemporary literature on minigrid deployment
    with irrigation in SSA and most importantly, literature on detailed economic analysis
    of the nexus potential to inform conditions for profitable operation of minigrids
    with smallholder irrigation is lacking. Where electrification and irrigation are
    jointly studied in the current literature, the focus has mainly been on assessing
    the latent agricultural energy demand with minimal effort in quantifying the impact
    of such loads on minigrids (Falchetta et al., 2021, Izar-Tenorio et al., 2021,
    Nilsson et al., 2021), otherwise, the economic benefits of irrigation to the farmer
    have not been analysed and quantified (Shoeb and Shafiullah, 2018, Uamusse et
    al., 2019). The results of Falchetta et al., 2021, Izar-Tenorio et al., 2021 and
    Nilsson et al. (2021) show that irrigation require substantial amounts of energy
    that can improve the financial health of utilities in the region if integrated
    in electrification planning. In Juturu et al. (2023), the authors under-take a
    scenario-based analysis of the impacts of groundwater-fed irrigation (GWI) demand
    on centralised grid demand in Ethiopia. Their results show a significant increase
    in generation capacity factor and grid capacity requirement with GWI integration.
    However, no effort is made in the analysis to assess the economic impact of GWI
    to the utility and agricultural productivity. In Wamalwa, Izar-Tenorio, and Williams
    (2022), potential economic benefits of irrigation farming of select crops in Kenya
    are analysed but the impact of irrigation on electrical utilities is not evaluated.
    Where powering of the community and irrigation loads from the same minigrid has
    been studied, the economic impacts of irrigation to the farmer have not been considered
    (Shoeb and Shafiullah, 2018, Uamusse et al., 2019). For instance, in Uamusse et
    al. (2019), the authors study the performance of a hydro minigrid with an array
    of PUE activities including milling of cereals and water pumping for residential
    use in a rural village in Mozambique. Their findings show that PUE loads can lower
    the LCOE of the minigrid. However, as with all the other literature studied above,
    Uamusse et al. (2019) does not consider the analysis of the economic benefits
    of irrigation for the farmer. In this work, we integrate a biophysical crop model
    with a minigrid model to study the nexus benefits of joint deployment of minigrids
    with smallholder irrigation farming. We employ the proposed model to hypothetical
    case studies with a goal of understanding conditions under which, when operated
    together, both minigrids and smallholders can both realise positive benefits.
    We assess the benefits of irrigation loads on the minigrids in terms of changes
    in LCOE, a reduction in LCOE being a positive performance indicator. Besides the
    impacts of irrigation loads on minigrids, we also investigate cost-competitiveness
    of minigrid-powered electric pumping over dispersed diesel engine and solar photovoltaic
    (SPV) pumping, as the latter two are immediate alternatives in unelectrified rural
    communities (Falchetta et al., 2023, Xie et al., 2021). We further assess the
    effects of pay-as-you-go (PAYGo) innovative incentives to irrigation adoption
    and profitability on the part of the farmer. To this end, we answer the following
    research questions in our work: (i) What is the impact of smallholder irrigation
    loads on the LCOE of the solar PV-battery-diesel minigrid as a technology option
    for off-grid electrification in SSA?; (ii) What is the impact of smallholder irrigation
    on the profitability of the commonly grown crops in SSA?; (iii), what is the effects
    of PAYGo innovative business model on irrigation adoption and profitability?;
    (iv) Under what conditions do minigrid operators and smallholder farmers see positive
    benefits when co-planned together? The contributions of our work are as follows:
    (i) We propose an integrated model to study the nexus benefits of co-planning
    minigrids with smallholder irrigation farming; (ii) we assess economic benefits
    of smallholder irrigation of a range of commonly grown crops in SSA under uncertain
    production conditions and cost scenarios to determine the conditions under which
    it is profitable to co-deploy minigrids with smallholder irrigation loads; (iii)
    The high upfront capital cost being a significant barrier to irrigation uptake
    in SSA (Lebdi, 2016), in this paper, we propose an innovative PAYGo business model
    to armotise capital costs over the project life for the farmer as in Falchetta
    (2021) rather than facing it upfront. The remainder of the paper is organised
    as follows: Section “Model development and case study selection” lays out the
    conceptual framework and the methods employed, including the data sources used
    in our analysis; Section “Results and Discussion” presents the model results;

    and case study selection Preliminary spatial analysis and case study selection
    Viability of a location for deploying an irrigation-anchored minigrid depends
    on a number of factors including availability and viability of alternative irrigation
    energy sources (dispersed off-grid technologies and grid proximity in this case),
    availability of irrigable cropland, and population. The distances from the centralised
    grid beyond which it is considered viable for minigrid electrification in the
    three countries are shown in Table 1. The table also contains other constraints
    for location viability for the nexus minigrids-irrigation projects; cropland,
    and population. We rely on the gridded Population of the World (GPW), gridded
    gross domestic product (GDP), and cropland data to identify viable locations for
    the case study; a summary is given in Table SI 4 in the supplement. Both the GPW
    and GDP data are provided at 30-arc-second (approx 1 km at the equator) spatial
    resolution while the cropland dataset is provided at 5-arc-min (approx 10 km at
    the equator) resolution. Therefore, the first step entails re-sampling of the
    GPW and GDP data to the cropland resolution (5-arc-min) before further geospatial
    analysis to determine viable locations (5-arc-min gridded cells in this case)
    for minigrid deployment. The resultant spatial maps for the three countries (Zambia,
    Ethiopia and Nigeria) are shown in Section SI 2.1 in the supplement. We have considered
    a 5-arc-min gridded cell as a scale for the minigrid-irrigation nexus project,
    as in Farthing et al. (2023), if the cell meets the criteria defined in Table
    1. As a general remark, we note that minigrids can be deployed in locations with
    even less than 1200 people (in Ethiopia the minimum population is 250 people (Holzigel,
    2021)), however, in this paper we consider a minimum population of 1200 to achieve
    a minimum of 300 households based on the household size data used in the model.
    Table 2 describes the identified case studies used to test our minigrid deployment
    model. We estimate the GDP per capita at purchasing power parity, GDP (PPP), at
    the three case study locations, by dividing the obtained GDP (PPP) values in each
    5-arc-min cell by the cell population. For depth-to-groundwater table (DTW) is
    a 5-arc-min spatially resolved data from the British Geological Survey (BGS) (MacDonald,
    Bonsor, Dochartaigh, & Taylor, 2012) while daily solar insolation (GHI) is obtained
    from NASAPOWER (Stackhouse, 2022), averaged over the 20-year period (2001–2020).

    study locations are 5-arc-min gridded cells identified as ‘site 1’ of the five
    marked sites in each country (Figures SI 4, SI 5, and SI 6 in the supplement);
    that is Northern Zambia, North-Western Ethiopia, and Northern Nigeria. All the
    three case study sites are off-grid agricultural communities that can be electrified
    via minigrids; In Nigeria, we have considered a location in the local government
    of Zuru in Kebbi State. In Zambia, we have considered a location in the Northern
    province of Luapua in Nchelenge district while in Ethiopia, we have considered
    a site in the Awi zone. Before characterising the three case studies, it is important
    to remark here that the selection of the three sites was random and as such, any
    one of the five sites marked in red colour or the remainder of the potential minigrid
    (MG) locations shown in green colours in Figures SI 4, SI 5 and SI 6 can be used
    in the study. The choice of the three countries is informed by the high concentration
    of rain-fed smallholder cropland, large populations without electricity access
    (mainly Ethiopia and Nigeria), and geographical locations within the SSA sub-regions
    (Southern, Eastern and West Africa). Table 2. A summary of the spatial features

    and minigrid network costs The minigrid network and its cost depends on electricity
    demand, the number of connections and the spatial distribution of those connections
    (Ciller, Lumbreras, & González-García, 2021). From Table 2, We estimate a minimum
    of 300 residential households in each of the three sites, for which a 300 household
    baseline minigrid is sized, assuming 100% subscription. Besides the electricity
    demand for the hypothetical 300 residential households, we also include electricity
    demand for productive and social uses such as schools, rural clinics, domestic
    water pumps and street lights as in Farthing et al. (2023). See a detailed account
    of community load profile estimation in Section SI 2.1.1 in the supplement. In
    SSA, it is common to find house-holds in close proximity to one another clustered
    around a community core with farmlands located a few kilometres away from the
    community core. This implies a high distribution network cost for the minigrid
    that powers both communal and irrigation loads. To account for the impacts of
    farmland locations on the minigrid network costs, we consider the four hypothetical
    scenarios: cases C-I, C-II, C-III, and C-IV. Case C-I is a baseline minigrid deployed
    to serve the community hourly load while cases C-II to C-IV consider inclusion
    of irrigation loads in C-I minigrid. Case C-II has a moderate irrigation load
    (30 ha) located 1–2 km away from the community core; case C-III assumes C-II with
    an additional 30 ha irrigable farmland located 2–4 km from the community core;
    case C-IV assumes C-III with an additional 15 ha of farmland located 4–5 km from
    the community core. A detailed account of these scenarios is presented in Section
    SI 3.1 in the supplement. The differences in the distances of the locations of
    the farmlands away from the community core (which we assume is also the minigrid
    generation hub) implies that each of the cases C-II to C-IV has different medium
    voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) network costs associated with it. For instance,
    beyond 1 km radius from the minigrid generation hub, the network voltage drop
    may exceed 10% of the nominal values (Suryani, Fadhillah, Saichu, & Mubarok, 2021)
    thus an MV network (including two service transformers–one for stepping up and
    one for stepping down voltages) is required to ensure that power of acceptable
    voltage levels is delivered to the farmland equipment (electric pumps in this
    case). As a general remark, irrigation land size of 30 ha, 60 ha, and 75 ha used
    in C-II, C-III, and C-IV minigrid deployment scenarios are not necessarily an
    optimal consideration for a single minigrid. The land sizes are chosen to generate
    moderate irrigation demand to study its impact on the minigrid energy cost. Optimal
    irrigation load on the minigrid depends on several factors such as the irrigation
    land availability and its spatial distribution, and grid infrastructure design
    constraints. For example, the DREAM project in Ethiopia (Energy Market Accelerator
    Ethiopia (AMAE), 2021) is deploying nine (as of September 2022) minigrids anchored
    by smallholder irrigation in nine villages with an average of 325 (178–652) households
    and 289 ha (42–473 ha) of irrigable farmlands (Veritas Consulting, 2020). To this
    end, our model and the results thereof will only be high level assessment and
    considerations for co-planning minigrids with irrigation but optimal design and
    results for the considered locations; the latter will depend on the available
    irrigation land at a study location. We test our model on a range of select crops
    including maize, wheat, beans, potato, onion, and tomato. The crops are selected
    based on their relative importance in SSA and more so, in the three case study
    countries. Maize, wheat, bean, and potato are common staples grown in SSA while
    onion and tomato are high value horticultural crops mainly grown as cash crops.
    Respective runs of the rainy and dry seasons used to inform planting dates in
    the model are given in Table SI 6 in the supplement. Methods, data and their sources
    In this section, we describe the methods used in our model. They include the methods
    for estimating both community and irrigation load profiles, sizing of the minigrid
    components, calculation of the minigrids’ LCOE, and the net present value (NPV)
    of irrigation as a viability metric for irrigation. Fig. 1 shows the schematic
    layout of our modelling framework. The core model comprises of two modules; the
    biophysical crop module and the minigrid module. We develop a simplified biophysical
    crop model based on the Food and Agricultural Organisation’s (FAO’s) Penman–Monteith
    equation (Allan, Pereira, & Smith, 1998) to simulate irrigation water requirement,
    , used for sizing of irrigation infrastructure and minigrid components for Cases
    C-II, C-III, and C-IV minigrids (see section “Preliminary spatial analysis and
    case study selection”). For irrigation yield gains, we follow the methods described
    in Izar-Tenorio et al. (2021) to simulate crop yields over a 20 year period (from
    2001 to 2020) in the FAO’s AquaCrop (Vanuytrecht et al., 2014) model under both
    rainfed and irrigated conditions in rainy and dry seasons (see Table SI 6) and
    then calculate the yield gain in both rainy and dry seasons as the difference
    between irrigated yield and rainfed yield assuming other production factors and
    conditions remain the same. The annual yield gains used in the farmers’ economic
    module are sums of yield gains in the rainy and dry seasons of each of the case
    study locations. Access to farm inputs, including fertiliser and improved seed
    cultivars is a major problem for smallholder farmers in SSA (Fuglie and Rada,
    2013, Jayne et al., 2010). To ensure that simulated yields are representative
    of common practices in the SSA region, we use crop files calibrated with parameters
    of traditional low-yield cultivars in AquaCrop model as in Izar-Tenorio et al.
    (2021); a detailed account is given in Section SI 2.2 of the supplement. To assess
    the impact of soil fertility on yield, we conduct a sensitivity analysis over
    a ranger of fertiliser application rates including optimal (100% required rate),
    near-optimal (85% of the required rate), moderate (50% of the required rate),
    and low soil fertility (25% of the required rate) as in Izar-Tenorio et al. (2021).
    The crop and minigrid modules are inter-linked with a pump module for estimating
    irrigation energy requirement using the pump head and as inputs. Key input data
    to the crop and pump modules are given in Table SI 7 in the supplement. Download

    Schematic layout of the model workflow. The STEMM model was originally developed
    by Williams et al. in Williams et al. (2018) to simulate techno-economic operation
    of minigrids in SSA from an investor perspective. In this work, the output of
    STEMM model is the minigrid LCOE while the output of irrigation financial model
    is the net present value (NPV) of cashflows of irrigation. HH number of house-hold,
    PUE Productive use of electricity. In this paper, we have used climate data averaged
    over a 20-year period, between 2001 and 2020, to capture seasonal and inter-annual
    variability in due to variability in climate. To estimate communal electricity
    demand, we rely on the Microgrid Load Profile Explorer Tool (MLPET) developed
    by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) for estimating hourly annual
    load profiles for minigrids in SSA (Li, Salasovich, & Reber, 2018). The output
    of the pump module, which is the daily irrigation energy demand, , and the communal
    hourly load profile are fed into the technical module of STEMM. The output of
    STEMM is the minigrid metric of interest, which in this case is the LCOE. Finally,
    the irrigation financial module takes irrigation yield gain from the crop module,
    crop and fuel prices (the minigrid LCOE in this case), irrigation infrastructure
    development costs, and discount rates as inputs to compute the irrigation profitability
    for the farmer. Since using LCOE as a minigrid tariff returns non-negative NPV
    for the minigrid, positive NPV of irrigation for the smallholder farmer powered
    by the minigrid is a positive indicator for viable condition for co-deploying
    minigrid with smallholders. Key modelling assumptions To understand the validity
    and limitations of our model, we describe, in this sub-section, the key assumptions
    considered in the modelling process. The first assumption regards the irrigation
    water source. In this work, we consider groundwater and assume aquifer storage
    at each location is sufficient to meet irrigation demand. We consider groundwater
    because of its natural abundance in Africa (MacDonald et al., 2012), even spatial
    distribution that allow its access virtually from anywhere where drilling is technically
    and economically feasible, and lastly because of its slow response to meteorological
    conditions than surface water and, as such, it provides a natural buffer against
    climate variability, including drought (MacDonald et al., 2012). The second assumption
    regards the cost structure of the minigrid. The range of costs used in this paper,
    see Table SI 10 in the supplement, are based on a research on minigrids by the
    ESMAP of the World Bank Group (Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP),
    2022). We take into account the impacts of uncertainties in network costs to the
    model performance by undertaking parametric sensitivity analyses of the effects
    of farmland location from the minigrid to the distribution network cost and hence
    the minigrid LCOE (see Section “Farmland distribution and minigrid network costs”).
    Thirdly, on irrigation infrastructure cost allocation, we assume a 10 ha cropland
    per borehole according to Shah, Namara, and Rajan (2020). Most farmer-led shallow/deep
    well small-scale irrigation projects in developing countries involve a group of
    farmers (or cooperatives) with up to 10 ha (with a holding range of 0.1–2 ha per
    farmer) of cropland distributed among themselves sharing a borehole (Shah et al.,
    2020). Since in our model we compute profitability per hectare of irrigated cropland,
    drilling and development costs of a borehole are prorated to the hectare level.
    To account for low voltage network costs associated with irrigation, we assume
    that each of these boreholes is an independent connection node in the network
    with its own associated network cost. The fourth assumption is on the system boundary
    for the comparison of minigrid, diesel engine, and solar PV powered irrigation.
    In this paper, in addition to investigating the impacts of irrigation loads on
    the LCOE of the minigrid, we also compare the pumping costs of the three technologies
    mentioned above to determine the least cost option for the smallholder farmer.
    We simplify the modelling complexity by assuming that the system’s boundary for
    comparative analysis is the power unit and the pump, as shown in Figure SI 15
    in the supplement; we ignore the cost of irrigation water conveyance in the comparative
    analysis since it is common to all three pumping systems. Lastly, in calculating
    irrigation profitability using equation (C.2), we considered 15% income losses
    for the farmer in post-harvest handling. According to Reckefeller Foundation (2015)
    up to 30% of food produced in SSA is wasted or lost between production and consumption,
    resulting in an approximate 15% income loss for the farmer. Irrigation energy
    requirement In general, irrigation energy, , briefly explained here with detailed
    formulation in the supplement, depends on irrigation water requirement, , and
    the total dynamic head (TDH) of the pumping system. is the gross crop water requirement,
    , including irrigation application losses, applied to supplement crop evapotranspiration
    needs, , not met by effective precipitation and the available soil water storage.
    TDH comprises the static head, the operating pressure, and head loss due to friction
    in the water conveyance system. Selection of the right irrigation method is essential
    for sustainable water and energy use. In this paper, we consider pressurised irrigation
    systems (drip and sprinkler) as the most suitable due to their high water application
    efficiencies. We have considered drip irrigation for vegetable crops (onion and
    tomato crops) and sprinkler for the rest of the crops (beans, maize, wheat and
    potato). Tomato and onion crops are vulnerable to diseases when water is applied
    aerially. For water withdrawal efficiency, we assume an average value of 60% for
    all the crops considered across the three countries after Falchetta et al. (2023).
    For irrigation system efficiencies, we assume 70% and 85% for sprinkler and drip
    respectively (El-Shimy, 2013, Phocaides, 2007); a summary is given in Table SI
    1 in the supplement. The minigrid model To simulate the minigrid operation, we
    rely on the STEMM model (Williams et al., 2018), which comprises of two modules;
    (i) the technical and (ii) financial modules. Briefly explained here with detailed
    formulation in the supplement, the technical module is a minigrid simulation tool
    that simulates the operation of a solar PV–diesel–battery minigrid. The inputs
    to the minigrid, include the hourly solar irradiation, hourly temperature, and
    the load profile to be served. The communal electricity demand, shown in Figure
    SI 7 in the supplement, is inflexible and must be met at each hour it occurs while
    the irrigation energy demand is modelled as a flexible daily demand that can be
    shifted over time within a 24 h period to minimise daily irrigation energy cost.
    The outputs of the minigrid, which include the hourly powerflows and diesel fuel
    consumption, are fed into the financial module that computes the metric of interest,
    which in this paper is the LCOE. Table 3 shows the system components sized based
    on the communal load (for Case C-I) and the aggregate communal and irrigation
    load profiles for Cases C-II, C-III, and C-IV minigrid models; See Figure SI 8
    in the supplement for the daily seasonal irrigation electricity demand. As shown
    in Table 3, system components for C-I to C-IV models vary across the three locations
    due to variations in climate. As a general remark, in all the cases C-I to C-IV,
    the battery storage is sized for the residential communal load but it is available
    to meet the irrigation energy demand as determined technically and economically
    feasible by the minigrid dispatch algorithm. For comparative analysis of the minigrid-powered
    electric-motor, diesel-engine, and the solar PV-powered pumping, we size the three
    systems based on the peak for 1.0 ha of the crop with the highest , which is maize
    in this paper, taking into consideration the engine and electric motor power conversion
    efficiencies shown in Table SI 11 in the supplement. The 1 ha sizing reference
    here aligns with an assumption in our model that each farmer in the model farms
    an average of 1.0 ha and therefore, an alternative to the minigrid is buying a
    diesel or solar pump to meet their 1 ha irrigation requirements. Pump power ratings
    for the three case study sites are given in Table 4. Table 3. A summary of the
    minigrid system component sizes for the four minigrid models (Cases I, II, III,

    5.2 7 6.5 Zambia 4.8 5.5 6.8 Techno-economic model development In this sub-section,
    we present formulation of the metrics used in this paper. We use LCOE, briefly
    explained here and formulated in the supplement, as a metric to assess the impact
    of irrigation loads on minigrids. In this sense, a decrease in LCOE due to the
    integration of irrigation loads into the minigrid is a positive performance indicator.
    We then use the obtained LCOE values to compute the NPV of irrigation yield gain
    as a profitability metric, a key condition for joint deployment of minigrids with
    smallholder irrigation. We use positive NPV as a proxy for the farmers’ ability
    to pay for the irrigation energy cost. In our model, positive NPV arises when
    revenue from irrigation yield gain is higher than the total cost of installing
    and operating the irrigation system. A detailed account of the model input parameters,
    and cost assumptions is presented in Section SI 4 of the supplement. For comparative
    analysis of diesel engines, solar PV and minigrid-powered electric pumps, we use
    the levelised cost of pumping energy (LCOP) as a comparative metric. Analogous
    to the LCOE, we define LCOP as the NPV of the total costs of the pumping system
    (comprising the power unit and the pump) divided by the NPV of the total irrigation
    energy delivered. The Pumping system costs include the capital, operations and
    maintenance, and fuel expenditures of the pump and its power unit. For instance,
    the pumping systems cost for a minigrid powered electric motor-pump includes the
    capital cost of the motor-pump system, the minigrid connection costs/fees, minigrid
    energy tariffs costs, and the operations and maintenance costs of the system over
    its lifetime. Economic benefits of irrigation Lack of detailed information and
    data on irrigation systems in SSA makes it difficult to estimate irrigation yield
    benefits. Where irrigation yield data exist, such as the projected yield from
    MapSPAM (You, Wood, & Wood-Sichra, 2009) and National yield statistics by FAOSTAT
    (Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), 2022), the data is either fragmented,
    and/or the information on cropping seasons and fertiliser use rates is lacking,
    making it difficult to estimate irrigation benefits from such a dataset. It is
    also worth noting that MaPSPAM and FAOSTAT yield data, respectively, are historical
    sub-national and national point estimates. These low-spatial resolution point
    estimates are not meaningful where the impact of spatial and temporal variability
    in climate – mainly precipitation – on crop yield is of interest at a higher spatial
    resolution (5-arc-min) used in this paper. In our work, we mitigate the data paucity
    and uncertainty challenge by using potential yield estimates from a crop model
    (AquaCrop model of the FAO). Yield simulation is relevant in understanding the
    benefits of irrigation and fertiliser application rate, and thereby inform policy
    measures that can close yield gaps and food insecurity in SSA. One of the major
    barriers to the adoption of irrigation in SSA is the high upfront cost of irrigation
    infrastructure (Lebdi, 2016), including the irrigation system costs, the borehole
    drilling and development costs for the groundwater-fed irrigation, and the cost
    of the pump. Many smallholder farmers cannot afford them. Therefore, a mere analysis
    of irrigation profitability is not enough if farmers cannot afford the upfront
    cost. There are various innovative business models designed to alleviate access
    barriers in the extant literature including loans, capital grants, fee for service,
    and pay-as-you-go (PAYGo) models (Bhattacharyya, 2013, Falchetta et al., 2022,
    Falchetta et al., 2023). In Falchetta et al. (2023), a novel business model that
    armotises the capital cost (all or a fraction) of the solar irrigation system
    is proposed; which is a popular model in the solar home systems (SHSs) market
    (Mergulhao, Capra, Voglitsis, & Parikh, 2023). In this paper, we propose the following
    PAYGo incentives for alleviating upfront capital cost barrier and also to understand
    their impacts on irrigation profitability; (i) ‘All costs incentive’ model which
    armotises all the upfront capital cost of the irrigation project over its life;
    (ii) ‘Irrigation system incentive’ model which armotises only the irrigation system
    costs (including the pump); (iii) ‘Borehole incentive’ model which armotises only
    the borehole drilling and development costs of the project; (iv) ‘Zero incentive’
    model, a baseline case where all the upfront capital costs are faced by the farmer.
    In all these scenarios, the farmer is responsible for the system depreciation
    costs including replacements. For instance, in ‘All costs incentive’, the full
    initial cost of the project are armotised together with the operations and maintenance
    costs of the project, including replacement costs, over its lifetime. A detailed
    account of these incentives is given in Section SI 3.4 of the supplement. Results
    and discussion Minigrid levelized cost of energy Fig. 2 shows the minigrid LCOE
    at the three case study locations across the four minigrid cases (C-I to C-IV).
    Despite having the same communal and irrigation loads, the three locations register
    different LCOEs for each minigrid case with the site in Ethiopia consistently
    having higher LCOEs as compared to the sites in Zambia and Nigeria. At first,
    30 ha irrigation demand results in a drastic decrease in LCOE of C-II minigrid
    in Nigeria and Zambia. An increase in irrigation loads in C-III and C-IV results
    in a slight decrease in LCOE before an increase in C-IV in Nigeria and Zambia.
    In Ethiopia, case C-II results in a marginal decrease before subsequent increase
    in C-III and C-IV. The results suggest different optimal irrigation load integration
    for each location if LCOE decrease is to be sustained. At the site in Ethiopia,
    irrigation loads beyond 30 ha results in LCOE increase while in Nigeria and Zambia
    is 60 ha. The LCOE trend in Fig. 2 can be explained by the disproportionate changes
    in the load factors of the minigrids with seasonal irrigation loads and increases
    in minigrid infrastructure costs resulting from increasing peak irrigation loads
    and distribution network expansion to power farms away from the generation hub;
    see Section SI 3.1 on the effects of farmland locations on the minigrid network
    costs. The observed trend highlight the benefits of irrigation loads in lowering
    the minigrid energy costs. However, this is only possible to a certain extent
    as further increase in seasonal irrigation loads (in C-IV) results in a decrease
    in minigrid load factor and eventual increase in LCOE. Our results are consistent
    with the findings in the literature (Booth et al., 2018); that seasonal PUE loads
    can either reduce or increase LCOE of minigrids depending on operation scenarios.

    of each of the components to the minigrid LCOE. As shown in the figure, distribution
    network costs accounts for up to 52% of the system costs (in Ethiopia); which
    is attributed to the infrastructure expansion to cover irrigation loads, that
    are up to 4 km away from the minigrid generation hub—according to the assumption
    in Table SI 8 in the supplement. The LCOP values of the three pumping technologies
    are presented in Table 5. As shown in the table, the LCOP varies with location
    and technology with minigrids as the least cost pumping power source at the sites
    in Zambia and Nigeria; in Ethiopia solar PV pumping is slightly cheaper than minigrid
    and diesel pumping with the latter two having no significant difference. The Variations
    in LCOP are due in part to variations in system size (Table 4), irrigation energy
    variability (Figure SI 8 in the supplement) and fuel cost (Figure SI 16 in the
    supplement). Download : Download high-res image (307KB) Download : Download full-size

    that minigrid-powered pumping in Ethiopia, justification for minigrids over distributed
    diesel and solar powered irrigation is in the fact that minigrids do not only
    provide motive power for irrigation; their excess capacity can be used for other
    productive and social uses. For instance, the excess minigrid power could be utilised
    for post-harvest agro-processing, and village lighting among others. Table 5.

    Economic viability of irrigation Fig. 4 shows irrigation yield gain (ton/ha) and
    the associated annual profitability ($/ha/yr). The reported yield gains are sum
    of the yield gains in the rainy and dry season cropping averaged over a 20-year
    period (2000–2020); see Figure SI 10 in the supplement for the 20-year averaged
    rainfed and irrigated yields of the six crops. The results highlight the dependency
    of irrigation benefits on geographical location and the type of crop grown. Horticultural
    crops – onion and tomato – record the highest annual profits (up to $1360/ha and
    $1030/ha for onion and tomato respectively) while maize, bean and wheat crops
    are not economically viable to irrigate across the three locations except maize
    in Nigeria. It is profitable to irrigate potato crop in Zambia and Nigeria with
    the latter location recording relatively higher benefits. The differences in irrigation
    profitability across the three locations can be explained by the differences in
    the model inputs including discount rates, crop prices, irrigation infrastructure
    costs (see Figure SI 11) and climate (affects crop yields) which are country-specific.
    Our results are consistent with previous research work that smallholder (often
    1–2 ha) farming of common staple crops in SSA – such as maize, beans and wheat
    – is not profitable (Giller et al., 2021) due to the low market value of these
    crops (Burney et al., 2013). As a general remark, based on the data given in Table
    2, we have estimated a minimum of 300 households in each of the case study locations
    for which we have designed a 300 household minigrid. From the household size data
    and average arable land per person in the three countries (Alliance for Green
    Revolution in Africa (AGRA), 2014), we have estimated an average farmland of 0.8–1.2
    ha (1.0 ha) per household; see Table SI 13 in the supplement for summary statistics.
    Based on this assumption, of 1.0 ha/household, we can use the reported annual
    per hectare profitability results as equivalent household annual income from irrigation
    farming. To this end, comparing the results of Fig. 4 and the GDP per capita ($/pp)
    of 460–758 for the three locations (Table 2) given the household size (Table SI
    13 in the supplement), irrigation can significantly improve the productivity,
    and potentially the well-being, of the affected communities. Download : Download

    the three location sites in Zambia (ZMB), Ethiopia (ETH), and Nigeria (NGA) based
    on C-II minigrid LCOE in Fig. 2 as irrigation energy tariffs. Sensitivity analysis
    The model results reported so far are based on cost estimates from literature
    with high spatial and temporal variability. Minigrid and irrigation system costs
    change with time (International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), 2016) and location
    (country) as well as other factors, such as technology selection, logistics, and
    import tariffs (Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP), 2022), which
    affect the minigrid LCOE. On the part of the farmer, irrigation infrastructure
    costs are highly variable depending on the service providers, project location,
    and project specifications (Villholth, 2013). Therefore, single-point estimates
    cannot tell the entire story about the economic viability of irrigation. To this
    end, on the part of the minigrid developer, we perform a sensitivity analysis
    to understand how changes in discount rates (DR) and technology costs (TC) affect
    the minigrid LCOE. We have considered three cost scenarios; low-cost, median-cost,
    and high-cost. The ‘low-cost’ and ‘high-cost’ scenarios combine the lower and
    upper bounds of TC and DR respectively. Meanwhile, the ‘median-cost’ scenario
    is based on the median TC and DR values. On the part of the farmer, we analyse
    how uncertainties in fertiliser application rates, irrigation infrastructure costs,
    and irrigation energy tariffs (minigrid LCOE in this case) affect irrigation profitability.
    This is necessary in the assumption that the farmer’s ability to pay for irrigation
    energy costs depends on irrigation profitability and hence viability of the nexus
    planning. For soil fertility, we consider four different soil fertility levels;
    optimal (100f), near optimal (85f), moderate (50f) and low fertility (25f) as
    in Izar-Tenorio et al. (2021) to study how soil fertility affects crop yield and
    irrigation profitability. Sensitivity analysis results are presented in the following
    section. Minigrid levelized cost of energy Fig. 5 shows the minigrid LCOE with
    changes in discount rates (DR) and technology costs (TC). In the figure, we have
    considered nine cost scenarios comprising different DR/TC combinations for each
    of the minigrid study cases; C-I to C-IV. As shown in the figure, changes in DR
    and TC result in a range of LCOE values with a minimum of $0.24/kWh (in Nigeria)
    and a maximum of $1.2/kWh (in Zambia), depending on location, minigrid cases,
    and TC/DR combinations. In all the three locations, there is a general decrease
    in LCOE from C-I to C-III and a slight increase going from C-III to C-IV in Nigeria
    and Zambia; for the case of Ethiopia, the increase in LCOE in C-IV is significantly
    high resulting in values greater than those of C-I minigrid model. The results
    highlight the importance of low technology cost, low cost of capital and productive
    loads in minigrid energy cost. The increase in LCOE in case C-IV partly due to
    low load factor of the increasing seasonal irrigation loads underscores the need
    for consideration of other PUE loads, such as post harvest processing (Falchetta
    et al., 2021, Farthing et al., 2023) beyond primary irrigation loads, to further
    sustain the decrease in LCOE with agricultural loads. Download : Download high-res

    (TC) scenarios for the four cases (C-I, C-II, C-III, and C-IV). Irrigation profitability
    In this sub-section, we present sensitivity analysis of irrigation profitability
    with changes in system costs; that is the low-cost, median-cost, and high-cost
    scenarios described in Section “Minigrid Levelized Cost of Energy”. For irrigation
    energy cost, uncertainties in cost drivers, both DR and TC, are factored in the
    sensitivity analyses of LCOE, results in Fig. 5. In Fig. 6, we present sensitivity
    results of irrigation profitability with different cost scenarios and soil fertility
    levels. Besides crops and location, irrigation profitability decreases with a
    decrease in soil fertility and change from low-cost to high-cost scenarios. The
    highest profits are realised by the combination of low-cost scenario and optimal
    (100f) soil fertility rates, with onion crop reaching $ 1600/ha/year under a combination
    of ‘low-cost’ and 100f soil fertility scenarios. It is generally not viable to
    irrigate at 25f soil fertility with the exception of onion, tomato and potato
    crops in Nigeria. Generally, low-value crops (mainly maize, beans, and wheat)
    are less profitable to irrigate under all scenarios considered in this paper.
    This highlights the need to explore further cost-cutting measures to understand
    conditions under which it might be viable to irrigate these crops in the nexus
    planning of minigrids with smallholder irrigation. In Fig. 7, we present the results
    of an innovative business model designed to armotise different cost components
    of the irrigation and water access infrastructure. The results highlight the benefits
    of lowering upfront cost barriers to irrigation adoption; they do not only enable
    irrigation adoption but also enhance profitability. The highest profits are realised
    when all upfront costs are armotised by the innovative PAYGo business model. On
    the other hand, ‘zero incentive’ model is the least profitable model. An important
    observation to highlight is that economic viability of less profitable crops such
    as beans, and maize is enhanced by the proposed incentive model; as shown in the
    figure, profitability of maize crop in Nigeria increased from ‘Zero incentive’
    to ‘All costs incentive’. The findings are consistent with prior works in the
    literature (Falchetta et al., 2023); that alleviating upfront cost barriers to
    irrigation adoption enhances irrigation viability. Download : Download high-res

    of different cost scenarios and soil fertility conditions on irrigation profitability.
    Note that each sub-figure in the figure has its own -axis scale. A general observation
    from the presented sensitivity analyses results is that horticultural crops seem
    by far the most profitable in terms of irrigation input benefit, while profitability
    for staple crops is more limited and depends on other factors (such as irrigation
    costs, geographical location, and crop prices). This is an important result from
    a policy point of view, and also worth remarking that often horticultural crops
    necessitates the need for cold storage (an additional electrical load which could
    be met by a minigrid) for products to be preserved and subsequently sold, i.e.
    to avoid food (and therefore income) loss. Potential energy demand for cold storage
    – not analysed in this paper – can mitigate seasonality of irrigation loads, enhance
    the load factor with the resultant benefits of reduced minigrid LCOE. Download

    Sensitivity analysis on different PAYGo model incentives for the capital costs
    of irrigation. The results are based on optimal soil fertility (100f) assumptions.
    The negative profit values are scenarios where the capital cost of the system
    cannot be recovered within the project life of 20 years. Note that wheat crop
    is excluded in the analysis because it is unprofitable under all scenarios and
    business incentives. Policy implications We have shown from our model results
    the potential benefits of irrigation loads in reducing minigrid LCOE, which is
    consistent with previous works in the literature (Shoeb and Shafiullah, 2018,
    Uamusse et al., 2019). We have also shown that irrigation profitability is a function
    of a complex interplay of multiple factors including the type of crops grown,
    fertiliser application rate, the irrigation infrastructure costs, irrigation energy
    prices, and farm-gate crop prices–which are exogenous to the model. We have further
    shown the potential of innovative PAYGo business model incentives in alleviating
    irrigation adoption barrier and enhancing irrigation profitability. However, it
    is worth remarking here that the proposed minigrid–irrigation nexus is complex
    and its implementation and exploitation of the benefits thereof will require supportive
    policy environment for both the farmer and the minigrid operator. It is acknowledged
    in the current literature that lack of supportive policies is one of the sources
    of risks that discourage private sector investment in the minigrid sector in SSA
    (Falchetta et al., 2022, Peters et al., 2019) with potential to cause project
    failures (Ikejemba, Mpuan, Schuur, & Van Hillegersberg, 2017). In this regard,
    we propose the following policy considerations for planning at the nexus of minigrid
    electrification and smallholder irrigation: First, we emphasise the need for an
    integrated system approach with synergistic partnerships of key actors, including
    public institutions that handle agricultural modernisation and energy access functions,
    policy makers, minigrid developers, financiers, and development partners and donors.
    For smallholder farmers, such a partnership should aim at enhancing access to
    farm inputs (seeds and fertilisers), credit for irrigation infrastructure development,
    access to crop markets, and access to agricultural extension services to unlock
    agricultural potential (Jama & Pizarro, 2008). It is estimated that only about
    50% of the farmers in SSA use inorganic fertilisers, while 10% do not apply any
    artificial fertiliser due to their high costs (Vanlauwe et al., 2014). Our results
    show that it is not economically viable to irrigate at a very low fertiliser application
    rate (25f in this case–a scenario that models non-application of artificial fertilisers).
    Therefore, we argue here that access to the right quantity of fertilisers is cardinal
    for high agricultural yield (Jama & Pizarro, 2008) and profitable deployment of
    the nexus project as demonstrated by our results in Fig. 6. Secondly, for the
    minigrid developers, the nexus partnership should aim at mitigating regulatory
    and financial risks (Agenbroad et al., 2018, Falchetta et al., 2022). Access to
    low cost of capital and low cost technology is still a critical challenge in SSA,
    particularly when one considers the nascency of off-grid electrification (Peters
    et al., 2019). Where financing is accessible, lending rates are high, often more
    than 15% in many countries (Agenbroad et al., 2018) (which is the case for the
    results in this paper as shown in Table SI 11 in the supplement). The implications
    of this high interest rates is the high minigrid project costs to the developer
    and the end-users (Falchetta, 2021). Mitigation of economic and financial risks–mainly
    those related to access to finance–can reduce overall system costs and encourage
    investment in the minigrid sector. Our results in Fig. 5 shows that, on average,
    a reduction of the cost of capital by 5% reduces the LCOE of the baseline minigrid
    (the minigrid without irrigation loads) by $0.14/kWh, which is equivalent to 19%
    decrease. Thirdly, we highlight the benefits of PAYGo business model incentives
    designed to alleviate upfront capital cost barriers to the adoption of irrigation.
    Despite demonstrated economic benefits of irrigation, many smallholders in SSA
    cannot afford the high capital costs of irrigation infrastructure (Lebdi, 2016)
    and therefore financial incentives designed to amortise all or a part of the upfront
    capital costs are critical in unlocking uptake and profitable operation of minigrid-powered
    smallholder irrigation in SSA. Lastly, our results shows that horticultural crops
    are by far the most profitable to irrigate while irrigation profitability of staple
    crops is dependent of other factors (such as costs and location). It is worth
    remarking here that horticultural crops often necessitates the need for cold storage
    (which has further cooling electricity demand) for the crop proceeds to be sold
    at a later dater to minimise crop and income loss. Cold storage has potential
    to increase the farmers’ income through market price stabilisation as well as
    reducing post-harvest waste, two major problems in SSA. Cold storage energy demand
    from the minigrid has potential to mitigate the effects of seasonality of irrigation
    loads of the utilisation factor of the minigrid assets resulting in LCOE reduction.
    This underscores that horticultural crops are the most favourable crops for the
    nexus deployment of minigrids with irrigation loads. Conclusion In our study,
    we investigated the impacts of irrigation loads on the levelised cost of minigrid
    energy (LCOE) as well as the appropriate conditions under which both the minigrid
    developer and smallholder farmers can realise positive returns when they operate
    together. The results of our study show that the change in LCOE of minigrid with
    irrigation loads depend on the quantity of irrigable land and its spatial location.
    Irrigation energy demand for a 30 ha of farmland, in case C-II minigrid, results
    in up to 47% decrease in LCOE, with a further increase in irrigable land resulting
    in increase in the minigrid LCOE across the case study sites. A sensitivity analysis
    of LCOE with uncertainties in the cost of capital (discount rates) and technology
    costs (minigrid equipment costs) show that low-cost scenario (low cost of capital
    and low technology cost) guarantees LCOE values of less than $0.60/kWh in all
    the three case study locations. On the part of the smallholder farmer, sensitivity
    analysis of the cost of capital and technology costs on irrigation profitability
    shows strong dependence of economic viability of irrigation on the crop grown,
    fertiliser application rates, geographical location, irrigation infrastructure
    costs, irrigation energy cost, and, to some extent, farm-gate crop prices. In
    descending order, onion, tomato, and potato are the most viable crops to irrigate
    at the obtained minigrid energy cost, particularly considering the applications
    of fertilisers that are near optimal to optimal (85f–100f). Low-value crops (common
    staples–maize, wheat, bean crops) record low economic viability of irrigation;
    wheat crop is not viable to irrigate while beans and maize record low profitability
    under low-cost production scenario. We observed a decrease in irrigation profitability
    with a decrease in soil fertility levels, which is consistent with the results
    in Izar-Tenorio et al. (2021). We further assess the effects of innovative pay-as-you-go
    (PAYGo) business model incentives to irrigation profitability; our results show
    positive benefits with the highest profitability recorded for the scenario that
    armotises all the cost of irrigation infrastructure. Besides increasing profitability
    of the already profitable crops (onion, tomato and potato), PAYGo incentives also
    enhances economic viability of less profitable crops. Maize and bean crops are
    economically viable to irrigate under PAYGo business models and cost scenarios
    in some geographical locations but wheat crop is generally not viable to irrigate
    under conditions considered in this paper. In conclusion, our model results underscore
    that profitable deployment of minigrids with smallholder irrigation depend on
    the geographical location, the choice of crop to grow, fertiliser application
    rate, cost of capital and technology costs. Horticultural crops under low-cost
    scenario and optimal fertiliser application rates are the most suitable conditions
    for the smallholder farmer to operate profitably in a joint operation with minigrids.
    Our model and results thereof can be used as high-level decision references when
    planning joint deployment of minigrids with irrigation loads. To advance our work,
    future research will explore holistic assessment of irrigation and post-harvest
    energy demand on the minigrid operation to study the potential benefits of cold
    storage to further reduce the minigrid LCOE. Another potential study area is large
    scale national and continental scale analysis of irrigation potential in Sub-Saharan
    Africa. Such a work may include quantification of irrigation profitability of
    the most important crops required to meet the region’s fast growing population’s
    food needs. Also important is the assessment of irrigation energy and infrastructure
    capacity requirement. Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that

  description: This study aims to introduce a comprehensive framework for canal modernization,
    emphasizing the integration of the Archimedes screw turbine as an alternative
    to traditional drop structures. The goal is to harness renewable energy, improve
    water distribution efficiency, and address both economic and environmental concerns
    within canal systems. Our approach employs CROPWAT8 for accurate estimation of
    crop water requirements and utilizes HEC-RAS for canal simulation. A distinct
    feature is the integration of fuzzy sarsa learning artificial intelligence within
    MATLAB. This integration facilitates a seamless operational link between HEC-RAS
    and fuzzy sarsa systems, optimizing canal operations while enhancing key water
    distribution indicators such as efficiency, adequacy, and equity. The implementation
    of our framework led to significant advancements in canal operations. The outcomes
    included a hydro-module of 0.6 l.s−1.ha−1, and Archimedes Screw Turbine designs
    with outer diameters varying between 1.17 m to 2.55 m for diverse inline gates.
    There was a marked enhancement in efficiency (0.993), adequacy (0.997), and equity
    (0.038) indicators. Additionally, the system exhibited an annual energy output
    of 219,009 kWh, curbing CO2 emissions by 153,306 kg annually. This translated
    to an economic gain of $2,146 annually from carbon credits alone. The presented
    framework not only proves its economic viability, with a payback period of 5.4
    years but also demonstrates its environmental benefits. It underscores the immense
    potential of adopting a holistic approach to canal modernization. Such an approach
    combines effective agricultural water management with renewable energy generation,
    encapsulating both economic sustainability and environmental responsibility.

    access 29 March 2024 1 Introduction Water resources face mounting pressure due
    to factors such as primary stakeholders, climate change, recurrent droughts, expanding
    food demand, and heightened urban and industrial water consumption, all driven
    by population growth and dietary shifts (El-Nashar and Elyamany 2023; Eslamian
    et al. 2018; Omar et al. 2020). This stress causes conflict between agricultural
    water authorities, farmers, industries, households, and others, fostering intensified
    competition, and undermining the agricultural sector (Shayannejad et al. 2022).
    To overcome these challenges, whether on a large scale (basin-scale) or small-scale
    (on-field), structural changes have mainly been implemented so far. However, these
    demand substantial investments. On a large scale, supply-centric methods have
    been proposed, encompassing the construction of reservoir dams, rainwater harvesting,
    inter-basin transfer, water treatment, and desalination. On a smaller scale, demand-centric
    strategies have been considered, including the extensive development of pressurized
    irrigation systems designed to substantially reduce water loss in the fields.
    Nevertheless, this approach often leads farmers to irrigate larger cropping fields,
    utilizing the extra water saved from loss reduction (Ostad-Ali-Askari et al. 2017).
    Off-field or off-farm scales, which encompass canal networks, have numerous structures
    that connect water supply systems to on-field systems by transporting water from
    sources to demand areas. These systems have often been overlooked, resulting in
    substantial water losses, particularly in arid and semi-arid countries like Iran
    (Yang et al. 2022). Research suggests that improving external water diversion
    (given the limited total water resources in each area) and implementing pressurized
    irrigation systems can alleviate water shortages by enabling efficient resource
    allocation. Providing reliable water resources allows farmers the flexibility
    to irrigate as needed; without this, investments in pressurized systems become
    futile. Consequently, it is imperative to concentrate on water conveyance and
    distribution systems to ensure equitable, reliable, flexible, and manageable water
    delivery by farmers with canal modernization either structural or nonstructural
    methods. Modernization of canal networks involves technical, managerial, and organizational
    upgrading to enhance resource utilization, including labor, water, economics,
    and environment, while improving water distribution to farms (Noory et al. 2019;
    Yang et al. 2019). While traditional practices, such as canal lining and computerization,
    necessitate extensive investments, there’s a growing focus on improving operational
    performance with minimal structural changes. To this end, the use of control methods
    like proportional integral derivative (PID) control and model predictive control
    (MPC) have been considered (Khaeez and Shahdany 2021). The former is a widely
    popular control method but may present some issues due to the distributed nature
    of irrigation canals. It was integrated with artificial intelligence and tested
    in irrigation canals (Shahverdi et al. 2022). MPC blends feedforward and feedback
    mechanisms based on measured water levels, thus optimizing canal network operation
    by managing disturbances (Fard et al. 2021; Tork et al. 2021) and planning the
    canal operator actions within the controller’s optimization problem (Sadowska
    et al. 2023). Given the interdependence of water and energy systems, modernizing
    canal networks serves not only to improve water management but also to harness
    potential energy savings. Discrepancies between water supply and demand across
    various sectors will propel a significant rise in resource demand (Adnan et al.
    2019), and efficient water usage can directly impact energy consumption, where
    structural and non-structural improvements to canal networks led to substantial
    reductions in energy usage (Ahmadi et al. 2021). The potential for energy recovery
    from canal networks, or hidden hydropower (Funes et al. 2021), serves as another
    critical element in the water-energy-food nexus. One emerging technology in this
    respect is Archimedes Screw Turbine (AST). Proven to be cost-effective and requiring
    minimal civil works, they represent an efficient method to harness hydraulic power
    in canal networks. Studies into their performance, design, construction, and optimization
    indicate that their integration during canal modernization could leverage multiple
    opportunities for energy savings and optimization (Shahverdi et al. 2021). Also,
    this line of work is gaining momentum in the literature, where multiple studies
    on small-scale hydropower generation can be found such as those collected by Quaranta
    et al. (2020) and reviewed by Sasthav and Oladosu (2022). Likewise, Mamadjanov
    et al. (2022) worked on gravitational water vortex micro hydropower plants, and
    Khokhani et al. (2022) reviewed in-pipe mesoscale submersible turbines. Pérez-Sánchez
    et al. (2017) discussed energy recovery in existing water networks, and Patsialis
    et al. (2016) explored the transformation of non-powered dams to support renewable
    energy. In the broader framework of integrated resource management, utilizing
    energy and water systems is crucial as it not only enhances the resilience and
    reliability of these systems but also boosts the usage of nontraditional water
    sources, and leverages the synergies between water and energy systems. These strategies
    are integral when it comes to modernizing canal networks. For this reason, we
    developed a holistic approach with two main objectives. First, we designed Archimedes
    Screw Turbines aimed at harnessing energy from flowing canal waters. We put this
    design to the test in the Eastern Aghili Canal Network (EACN) with promising results.
    Second, we delved into optimizing water allocation, ensuring that economic and
    environmental factors were taken into account. This unique focus on the Archimedes
    screw turbine, combined with a holistic view, artificial intelligence integration
    for canal operations, and our specific work on the EACN, constitute the main contributions
    of this work. Finally, a closer look at our framework provides a clear picture
    of the outline of the rest of the article: we begin by determining the water requirements
    of crops, move onto the design specifics of the Archimedes Screw Turbine, incorporate
    operation optimization using fuzzy sarsa learning, and wrap up by examining the
    economic and environmental impacts. We assess this framework using the previously
    mentioned case study in EACN, located in Iran’s Khuzestan Province, which helps
    us understand its practical applications and intricacies. 2 Materials and Methods
    The modernization framework for canal networks proposed in this study is illustrated
    in Fig. 1, encompassing six distinct steps. This research contemplates two facets
    of modernization: software-based (nonstructural method) and hardware-based (structural
    method). Step 1 presents the canal modernization conceptualization. Fig. 1 The
    framework developed for modern canal networks Full size image 2.1 Studied Area
    The Aghili irrigation network, situated in Khuzestan Province in southwestern
    Iran, encompasses a total irrigated area of 7225 ha with an annual water consumption
    of 150 × 106 m3. Water is transported from the Gotvand diversion dam via a primary
    conveyance canal with a capacity of 12 m3/s, supplying two secondary canals—eastern
    and western Aghili. The data obtained from the Khuzestan water and power organization
    includes: i) the canal’s design flow that is 5 m3/s; ii) a layout map of the canal
    network that depicts the canal route, cultivated areas, and gate locations; iii)
    geometric parameters of the canal and gates. As illustrated in Fig. 2, the Eastern
    Aghili Canal Network (EACN) encompasses a cultivation area of approximately 1600
    ha situated west of the canal. Lands situated east of the canal are elevated so
    that they cannot be irrigated by gravity. They hold considerable development potential
    if the requisite water and energy resources are provided. Fig. 2 The studied canal
    Full size image Regarding the geometric properties of EACN and its gates, the
    concrete trapezoidal cross-section (with a side slope of 1.5H:1V) has a maximum
    flow capacity of 5 m3/s. The network comprises 20 online rectangular vertical
    sluice gates with dimensions of 0.6 × 0.6 m2, responsible for supplying water
    to the farms. Additionally, the network has 11 inline rectangular vertical sluice
    gates, namely WLR1- WLR11, serving as Water Level Regulators (WLRs) adjusting
    the upstream water levels. WLR1, WLR5, and WLR10 have drops to dissipate excess
    water energy. The first five WLRs have dimensions of 1.5 × 1.5 m2, while the remaining
    six ones have dimensions of 1.5 × 1.0 m2, respectively. To estimate the Crop Water
    Requirement (CWR) and subsequently the water demands of the online gates, we utilized
    long-term daily meteorological data from Shushtar synoptic station (longitude:
    48.5 ˚E and latitude: 32.05 ˚N) over the period 1994–2017, received from the Islamic
    Republic of Iran meteorological organization (IRIMO). The dataset includes daily
    minimum and maximum temperatures, rainfall, average daily sunshine hours, relative
    humidity, and wind speed. 2.2 Water Demand Estimation Online gates in an irrigation
    canal extract water from the supply canal and distribute it to the farms. As EACN
    currently lacks flow measurement, CROPWAT8, a crop water estimation model, was
    used to calculate evapotranspiration and water demand of online gates (Step 2).
    To this end, the potential evapotranspiration of the reference crop was initially
    calculated using CROPWAT8 based on the Penman–Monteith formula (Allen et al. 1998),
    defined by Eq. (1). $${ET}_{o}=\\frac{0.408\\Delta \\left({R}_{n}-G\\right)+(\\gamma
    \\frac{900}{T+273}{u}_{2}(es-ea))}{\\Delta +\\gamma (1+0.34{u}_{2})}$$ (1) where
    \\({ET}_{o}\\) is the potential evapotranspiration of reference plant in mm/day,
    \\({R}_{n}\\) is net radiation at crop surface, \\(G\\) is soil heat flux density
    (\\({R}_{n}\\) and \\(G\\) are in MJ/m2/day), \\(T\\) is the mean daily air temperature
    in °C, \\({u}_{2}\\) is the wind speed at 2 m height in m/s, \\(es\\) and \\(ea\\)
    are saturation vapor and actual vapor pressures in kPa, \\(es-ea\\) is saturation
    vapor pressure deficit in kPa, \\(\\Delta\\) is slope vapor pressure curve, \\(\\gamma\\)
    is psychrometric constant (\\(\\Delta\\) and \\(\\gamma\\) are in kPa/°C). The
    meteorological data used in CROPWAT8 in this research is presented in Fig. 3.
    Fig. 3 The daily meteorological data (minimum and maximum temperatures in °C,
    humidity in percent, wind in m/s, rain in mm) to estimate the potential evapotranspiration
    of the reference plant Full size image The evapotranspiration of each crop (\\({ET}_{c}\\))
    is calculated by Eq. (2). $${ET}_{c}={K}_{c}{ET}_{o}$$ (2) where \\({K}_{c}\\)
    is the crop coefficient obtained from Allen et al. (1998) in this research. The
    specifications of major crops in the studied area are presented in Fig. 4. Fig.
    4 Specifications of major crops cultivated in EACN Full size image The water demand
    of each online gate was determined using the crop evapotranspiration, cultivation
    patterns, and cultivated areas under considered online gate, as well as the efficiencies
    of water conveyance, distribution, and application chosen as 100%, 71%, and 67%,
    respectively according to Yang et al. (2022). 2.3 Archimedes Screw Turbine Design
    In Step 3, suitable ASTs were designed, taking into account different design criteria
    for sites with dropped-checked inline structures, while acknowledging that online
    gates are not considered in this research despite their significant hydraulic
    potential. In a WLR system depicted in Fig. 5a with a drop height denoted by \\(P\\),
    an upstream water depth \\(Y\\), a downstream water depth of \\({Y}_{1}\\), a
    gate opening \\({G}_{o}\\), and a geodetic head \\(H\\), the passing flow \\(Q\\)
    in the free flow conditions can be expressed by Eq. (3). $$Q={C}_{d}.b.{G}_{o}\\sqrt{2gY}$$
    (3) where \\({C}_{d}\\) is the discharge coefficient (usually 0.6), \\(b\\) is
    the gate width in meters, and \\(g\\) is gravity in m/s2. All units of length
    in the equation are in meters, and the flow unit is in cubic meters per second.
    To establish the upstream water depth of the inline gate at a set point (\\({Y}_{s}\\))
    under all flow conditions, the gate’s position is adjusted so that the upstream
    online gate’s flow relies solely on its gate position. By substituting WLR1, WLR5,
    and WLR10 with respectively AST1, AST5, and AST10, the hydraulic energy can be
    converted into electricity. The rotation speed of the screw, as the core component
    of an AST, is determined by the flow and available head as water travels from
    upstream to downstream. As shown in Fig. 5b, the screw is characterized by an
    outer diameter \\({D}_{o}\\), an inner diameter \\({D}_{i}\\), a pitch \\(S\\)
    (specified by a blue line on the figure), a length \\(L\\), a blade number \\(N\\),
    and a tilt angle \\(B\\). Figure 5c presents the schematic of an AST replaced
    rather than a WLR. The AST functions as both a water level regulator and an energy
    generator. Fig. 5 a An inline sluice gate as water level regulator, b The body
    of the screw as the main core of Archimedes screw turbine, and c Archimedes screw
    turbine as water level regulator and energy generator Full size image The hydraulic
    power available (\\({P}_{hyd}\\)), in kW, in a dropped WLR inline gate is determined
    using Eq. (4). $${P}_{hyd}=\\rho gQH/1000$$ (4) where \\(\\rho\\) represents water
    density in kg/m3. Specifically, the hydraulic power available in WLR1, WLR5, and
    WLR10 amounts to 52.8 kW, 38.2 kW, and 4.1 kW, respectively (Table 1). It should
    be noted that an efficiency estimation of 80% under design flow conditions, as
    documented in the literature, was assumed for the calculation of mechanical power.
    Table 1 Hydraulic parameters and available hydraulic and mechanical powers in
    dropped inline gates Full size table The outer diameter of an AST for the specified
    locations can be determined by Eq. (5). $${D}_{o}=1.61{Q}^\\frac{3}{7}$$ (5) where
    \\({D}_{o}\\) is in meters and \\(Q\\) is in m3/s. According to Shahverdi et al.
    (2023), along with other related optimizations, the optimal value of \\(\\frac{{D}_{i}}{{D}_{o}}=0.43-0.56\\)
    and\\(\\frac{S}{{D}_{o}}=1-1.2\\). For this study, \\(\\frac{{D}_{i}}{{D}_{o}}=0.55\\)
    and \\(\\frac{S}{{D}_{o}}=1\\) were chosen as well as \\(B=22.5^\\circ\\) since
    its optimal range is 20–22.5\\(^\\circ\\). The blade number was set at three,
    and the Muysken (1932) limit (\\(\\omega \\le \\frac{5.24}{{D}_{o}^{0.67}}\\),
    with \\(\\omega\\) in rad/s and \\({D}_{o}\\) in meter) was used to determine
    the maximum rotation speed. By considering these geometric parameters and reorganizing
    the flow equation presented by YoosefDoost and Lubitz (2020), which computes the
    flow through an AST, the resulting equation for flow traversing an AST is as Eq.
    (6). $$Q=\\frac{0.208({D}_{o}^{2}-{D}_{i}^{2})S }{{D}_{o}^{0.119}}{(\\frac{1.0136Y}{{D}_{o}cos\\beta
    }-0.0067)^{1.311}}{\\omega }^{0.822}$$ (6) where \\(\\omega\\) is the screw rotation
    speed in rad/s. Based on the aforementioned equation, straightforward flow equations
    for AST1, AST5, and AST10 were established. Consequently, the canal flow with
    the ASTs was simulated using the HEC-RAS open channel flow simulation software
    by incorporating these straightforward equations into its advanced rule-based
    boundary conditions. It should be noted that, in this research, the rotation speed
    was used as a calibration parameter to match the flow from ASTs with those of
    WLRs. 2.4 Operation Optimization In Step 4, we then depart from traditional operations,
    where water is distributed under steady-state conditions with a fixed discharge,
    and employ HEC-RAS to simulate the unsteady flow with variable discharges of online
    gates under both traditional and AST installation conditions. The penultimate
    step employs fuzzy SARSA learning artificial intelligence to identify and apply
    optimal operational instructions in an online and offline environment, respectively.
    This step involves an automated coupling of HEC-RAS and MATLAB to streamline the
    interactions between the two platforms. In traditional canals such as EACN, current
    operations are grounded on a steady flow basis. However, when the canal experiences
    unsteady flow, water distribution must be accommodated according to these varying
    flow conditions. To model such unsteady flow within the canal system, irrespective
    of whether it features WLRs or ASTs, we used the HEC-RAS hydrodynamic model, which
    simulates unsteady flow using continuity and momentum equations defined as Eqs.
    (7) and (8), respectively. $$\\partial A/\\partial t+\\partial Q/\\partial x=0$$
    (7) $$\\partial Q/\\partial t+\\partial ({Q}^{2}/A)/\\partial x+gA(\\partial y/\\partial
    x-{S}_{0}+{S}_{f})=0$$ (8) where \\(A\\) is the wetted area in m2, \\({S}_{0}\\)
    is the slope of the canal, \\({S}_{f}\\) is a representative friction slope between
    two cross-sections, calculated using the Manning equation, \\(t\\) is time in
    seconds, and \\(x\\) is the length in meters. It should be noted that ASTs are
    defined as boundary conditions in HEC-RAS 5.0.7 through the application of a rule-based
    operation. The fuzzy sarsa learning artificial intelligence, used to optimize
    the canal operation in this research, uses a fuzzy inference system (FIS) as a
    function approximator to determine the most effective function that maps inputs
    to outputs. The FIS incorporates a fuzzifier to transform crisp inputs into fuzzy
    values, an inference engine for calculations using predefined rules based on system
    behavior, and a defuzzifier to translate the fuzzy value back into a crisp value.
    Each rule Ri in the fuzzy rule set is defined by Eq. (9). $${\\mathrm{R}}_{\\mathrm{i}}\\!:\\;\\mathrm{If}\\;{\\mathrm{x}}_{1}\\;\\mathrm{is}\\;{\\mathrm{L}}_{i1}\\;\\mathrm{and}\\dots\\;
    \\mathrm{and}\\;{\\mathrm{x}}_{n}\\;\\mathrm{is}\\;{\\mathrm{L}}_{in},\\;\\mathrm{then}\\;
    ({a}_{i1}\\;\\mathrm{with\\;value}\\; {Q}^{i1})\\;\\mathrm{or}\\dots \\mathrm{or}
    \\;({\\alpha }_{im}\\;\\mathrm{with\\;value}\\;{Q}^{im})$$ (9) Here, vector s = x1 × ··· × xn
    contains input values mapping to the rules, Li = Li1 × · · · × Lin represents
    the fuzzy sets of rule i, m denotes the number of candidate actions for the i-th
    rule, aij is the j-th candidate action (1 ≤ j ≤ m) of the i-th rule, and the weight
    Qij stands for the value of action j in rule i. A Q-function matrix with 2n × m
    dimensions is learned during the SARSA process. This process observes state St,
    applies action At, receives reward Rt+1, observes next state St+1, and applies
    next action At+1 in sequence in each time step t, defined by Eq. (10). $$Q=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}{Q}^{11}&
    \\cdots & {Q}^{1m}\\\\ \\vdots & {Q}^{ij}& \\vdots \\\\ {Q}^{R1}& \\cdots & {Q}^{Rm}\\end{array}\\right]
    i=1 .. R ,\\;\\, j=1 . . m$$ (10) Initially, the Q-function matrix is set to zero.
    As the learning process continues, the state vector is mapped to the antecedent
    part of the fuzzy system, resulting in a normalized membership degree of rule
    i (\\({\\mu }_{i}\\)). The probability of choosing action j in rule i is computed
    using the Softmax action selection, defined by Eq. (11). $$p(a_{ij} ) = e^{{\\frac{{\\mu_{i}
    Q^{ij} }}{{0.99\\delta_{k - 1} }}}} /\\sum\\limits_{j = 1}^{m} {e^{{\\frac{{\\mu_{i}
    Q^{ij} }}{{0.99\\delta_{k - 1} }}}} }$$ (11) where \\(\\delta\\) is a temperature
    parameter with an initial value of 30 and \\(k\\) is the iteration number. A lower
    temperature and a higher \\(Q\\) of action increase the probability of selecting
    the considered action. The action with the higher probability is denoted by \\(a_{{ii^{
    + } }}\\). The final action \\(a_{k}\\) and the update of the \\(Q\\)-function,
    which is the objective function that should be maximized, in step k can be simply
    computed by Eqs. (12) and (13), respectively. $$a_{k} = \\sum\\limits_{i = 1}^{R}
    {\\mu_{i} .a_{{ii^{ + } }} }$$ (12) $${Q}_{k}^{ij}={Q}_{k-1}^{ij}+ \\left\\{\\begin{array}{c}\\frac{{\\beta
    }_{k-1}}{1.017}\\times (\\frac{1}{\\left|{Y}_{s}-{Y}_{k}\\right|+1}+0.009 \\displaystyle\\sum_{i=1}^{R}{\\mu
    }_{i}.{Q}_{k-1}^{i{i}^{+}}-\\sum_{i=1}^{R}{\\mu }_{i}.{Q}_{k-2}^{i{i}^{+}})\\\\
    0 \\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad\\qquad otherwise\\end{array} \\right.\\;\\;if\\;j={i}^{+}$$
    (13) where \\(\\beta\\) is the learning rate that initially has a value of 0.9
    (for \\(\\beta =0\\), no learning takes place), \\({Y}_{s}\\) is setpoint, \\({Y}_{k}\\)
    is water depth in step k. Equation (13) is the objective function that we aim
    to maximize, taking into account the difference between the water level in the
    inline gate and the corresponding setpoint. The maximum and minimum values of
    gate openings are the maximization problem constraints. Finally, let us have a
    closer look at the optimization methodology deployed in our study. Central to
    our approach is the utilization of SARSA learning, an on-policy reinforcement
    learning method, where the objective is to optimize the Q-function, representing
    the expected rewards for actions taken in given states. This Q-function essentially
    determines the quality of actions leading to maximizing the anticipated rewards.
    The iterative process of updating the Q-function matrix ensures that the best
    actions are progressively chosen as learning advances. The entire learning and
    optimization process was executed using MATLAB. In particular, the Q-function
    optimization was achieved through a combination of native MATLAB functions and
    custom-coded scripts. These tools not only ensured the accuracy of our optimization
    approach but also provided a platform for efficient troubleshooting, iterative
    adjustments, and model validation. 2.5 Operation, Environmental, and Economic
    Appraisal In the current operation of EACN, gate adjustments are made based on
    the expertise of the operator. This individual receives water demand information
    of the online gates from the water authority, travels along the canal from upstream
    to downstream, and regulates the inline and online gates based on his/her knowledge
    and experience. An average error of ± 10% is unintentionally incorporated by the
    operator when operating the gates (Urrestarazu et al. 2010). Due to the lack of
    reliable recorded data in traditional canals, the appropriate gate openings corresponding
    to water demands were calculated based on the steady-state flow condition. Then,
    random errors ranging between -10% and 10% were added to these calculated gate
    openings. This method was identified as Alternative 1 (A1), which reflects traditional
    operation under the canal’s current circumstances. In Alternative 2 (A2), AST1,
    AST5, and AST10 were installed instead of WLR1, WLR5, and WLR10, respectively,
    and the canal operation continued as before. It should be noted that there’s no
    operational necessity for ASTs. Finally, Alternative 3 (A3) involved the determination
    of optimal canal operation using Fuzzy Sarsa learning artificial intelligence
    while replacing WLRs with ASTs. This method, considered an intelligent operation,
    modernizes the canal with both structural (ASTs) and nonstructural (Fuzzy Sarsa
    learning artificial intelligence) methods. The performance indicators used to
    evaluate water level variations included the maximum absolute depth error (MAE),
    which quantifies the maximum deviation of water depth \\(Y\\) from corresponding
    setpoint \\({Y}_{s}\\), and the integral absolute depth error (IAE), which measures
    the average discrepancy of water depth from the corresponding setpoint (Clemmens
    et al. 1998). These water depth data were obtained at every \\(\\Delta t\\) second
    of the total simulation time \\(T_{dur}\\) from HEC-RAS. The evaluation of water
    distribution accuracy was done using the indicators suggested by Molden and Gates
    (1990), which comprise adequacy, efficiency, equity, and dependability computed
    using the number of online gates \\(n\\), delivered flow \\(Q_{d}\\), requested
    flow \\(Q_{r}\\), coefficient of spatial variation of discharge \\(Cv_{n}\\),
    and coefficient of temporal variation of flow \\(Cv_{T}\\). From an environmental
    perspective, the replacement of WLRs with ASTs in this study appears to be advantageous,
    given that the new structure does not impede water conveyance and distribution
    efficiency, nor does it result in carbon dioxide emissions or environmental concerns.
    An analysis of environmental impact focused on CO2 emission reduction. The total
    annual mitigated CO2, denoted by \\({\\varnothing }_{CO2}\\) in kg, was calculated
    using a methodology proposed by Khanmohammadi and Khanmohammadi (2019), as Eq.
    (14). $${\\varnothing }_{CO2}={\\psi }_{CO2}.E$$ (14) where \\({\\psi }_{CO2}\\)
    is the carbon dioxide emission coefficient of the global network and is equal
    to 0.7 kg CO2/kWh (0.7 kg of carbon dioxide per kWh generated), and \\(E\\) is
    the total annual power generated (kWh). The annual carbon credit, \\({Z}_{CO2}\\)
    in $/kg, is calculated by Eq. (15). $${Z}_{CO2}={z}_{CO2}.{\\varnothing }_{CO2}$$
    (15) where \\({z}_{CO2}\\) is carbon credit, which is 0.014 $/kg in Iran (Soltani
    et al. 2020). This carbon credit acts as a source of revenue in this research
    study. In the economic analysis of the deployed ASTs, the key metrics used were
    the payback period (PB) and the net present value (NPV). The PB is the time frame
    required for an investment to generate enough net revenue to recoup the initial
    cash investment. It is defined by Eq. (16). $$PB=I/CF , CF=er-ex$$ (16) where
    \\(I\\) is the investment cost, \\(CF\\) is the average annual cash flow, \\(er\\)
    and \\(ex\\) respectively represent the cash inflow and cash outflow. An investment
    is considered more appealing if it has a shorter PB. NPV calculates the difference
    between the present values of projected cash flows and invested cash over a specific
    period. This metric indicates the project’s added value and is useful in assessing
    the profitability of the AST project investment. The NPV is defined by Eq. (17).
    $$NPV=\\sum_{p=0}^{w}{CF}_{p}/{(1+i)}^{p}$$ (17) where \\({CF}_{p}\\) represents
    the net cash inflow minus outflows for a given period \\(p\\), \\(i\\) is a potential
    return from an investment (considered as 5% in this research), and \\(p\\) is
    the number of periods. In this research, an initial investment cost of 2151 $/kW,
    a maintenance cost comprising 6% of the initial investment cost for the installed
    ASTs, and an electricity cost of 0.17 $/kW were considered, taking into account
    the average prices for household and business users in European countries (Rokicki
    et al. 2021). The modernized canal network was evaluated based on these environmental
    and economic parameters, with all utilized formulas summarized in Table 2. Table
    2 Operational, environmental, and economical performance assessment criteria Full
    size table 3 Results and Discussion 3.1 Water Demands In the area under study,
    the maximum and average annual hydro-module for the cropping pattern was calculated
    to be 1.29 l.s−1.ha−1 and 0.6 l.s−1.ha−1, respectively, which is in line with
    Alejo and Alejandro (2022), who reported a maximum and average annual hydro-module
    of 1.26 l.s−1.ha−1 and 0.86 l.s−1.ha−1, respectively. The peak daily CWR, the
    highest inflow, and the highest online gate water demand were found to be 18 mm/day,
    3347 l/s, and 0.249 l/s, respectively. The obtained flows were used to simulate
    the canal and find the operation strategies. 3.2 Designed Archimedes Screw Turbines
    The specifications of the ASTs designed for the selected locations are detailed
    in Table 3. Utilizing these specifications and Eq. (6), the flow passing equations
    through AST1, AST5, and AST10 were determined as Eqs. (18)–(20). Table 3 The designed
    specifications of the Archimedes screw turbines for the considered locations Full
    size table $$Q={2.153}^{*}{({0.43}^{*}Y-0.0067)}^{1.311}{^{*}{\\omega }^{0.822}}$$
    (18) $$Q={1.028}^{*}{({0.56}^{*}Y-0.0067)}^{1.311}{^{*}{\\omega }^{0.822}}$$ (19)
    $$Q={0.229}^{*}{({0.94}^{*}Y-0.0067)}^{1.311}{^{*}{\\omega }^{0.822}}$$ (20) As
    mentioned before, the canal width at both WLR1 and WLR5 is 1.5 m. Referring to
    Table 3, the outer diameters of the designed ASTs at these chosen locations are
    2.55 m and 1.97 m, respectively. These diameters are marginally larger than the
    respective canal width, implying that minor civil work is needed to install the
    ASTs. In the case of AST1, there is a need to expand the canal width. For AST10,
    with an outer diameter of 1.17 m, it closely aligns with the current canal width.
    The ASTs were calibrated with rotation speed serving as the calibration parameter.
    The goal was to ensure the flow passing through the ASTs equaled the desired flow
    and the upstream water depth matched the design head. To this end, the water depth
    upstream of inline gates should be fixed at setpoints. As the flow varies daily,
    the respective rotation speed for each daily flow can be conveniently calculated
    using Eqs. (18)–(20). For example, the associated rotation speeds for AST1, AST5,
    and AST10 under design flows of 2.926, 1.610, and 0.48 m3/s are 2.8, 2.9, and
    3.3 rad/s, respectively. 3.3 Operation Assessment and Optimization The performance
    criteria for water distribution, namely efficiency and adequacy, are depicted
    in Fig. 6 for the examined alternatives A1 and A2. As shown, the efficiency of
    the online gates varies between 0.7 to 1 in both A1 and A2, indicating satisfactory
    performance in some gates, while others demonstrate only fair performance according
    to desirability given at column 4 in Table 2. This suggests that the installation
    of ASTs does not detrimentally impact canal operation performance. However, in
    both alternatives, most of the online gates receive more water than demanded.
    In contrast, in alternative A3, efficiency significantly improved across all online
    gates due to the optimization model used, with values nearing 1, except for online
    gate 2 which was 0.864. This signifies that all gates exhibit good performance.
    Fig. 6 Efficiency and Adequacy obtained for the examined alternatives of A1-A3
    Full size image As for adequacy, the indicator fluctuates from 0.645 to 1 in A1
    and from 0.685 to 1 in A2, showing little improvement following the installation
    of ASTs. This slight improvement in adequacy demonstrates that ASTs do not compromise
    canal performance. Instead, they slightly enhance the performance. Still, most
    of the online gates receive less water than needed. In A3, the adequacy approaches
    the ideal value, indicating good performance with a minimum adequacy of 0.981.
    Thus, a negligible water deficit is present when implementing an intelligent operation
    to allocate water optimally. Notice that both surplus and deficit water inflict
    damage on the plants, and surplus water also causes land waterlogging. In Shahverdi
    et al. (2020), where “good” water delivery performance indicators of MPA were
    obtained (between 0.93 and 1). Note that the results of this paper are more accurate
    since MPA is very close to 1. The same holds for the simulations published by
    Shahverdi et al. (2016), where the minimum MPA indicator was 0.947, again worse
    than the 0.981 obtained in the current research. Figure 7a displays the efficiency
    and adequacy indicators at the canal level. As shown, the indicators in A1 and
    A2 are similar, while they closely approach 1 in A3. The equity and dependability
    indicators are depicted in Fig. 7b. In A3, the water distribution is more equitable
    than other alternatives. The equity is good in A3 and fair in A1 and A2. Dependability
    shows good results across all alternatives. Fig. 7 a Efficiency and adequacy,
    b Equity and dependability in the canal under examined alternatives Full size
    image Concerning water level fluctuations, these variations are smaller with AST1,
    AST5, and AST10 compared to the corresponding fluctuations with WLR1, WLR5, and
    WLR10, as shown in Fig. 8. Figure 9 presents the water depth performance indicators
    for three replaced inline gates. Fig. 8 Water level variations under alternatives
    A1-A2 Full size image Fig. 9 Maximum and integral absolute errors of the dropped
    water level regulators and installed Archimedes screw turbines in the examined
    alternatives Full size image Substantial water depth variations occur for all
    inline gates in alternative A1 due to the inefficient operation of the gates.
    Consequently, MAE for WLR1, WLR5, and WLR10 were recorded at 7.6%, 18.1%, and
    14.1%, respectively. IAE was also considerable at 7.4%, 16.2%, and 8%, respectively.
    Identical water depth variations and indicators were observed for the other inline
    gates when comparing Alternatives A1 and A2. However, a noteworthy improvement
    was seen in Alternative A2, since MAEs reduced to 4.8%, 1.1%, and 0.4%, and IAEs
    reached 1.6%, 1.1%, and 0.2%. This improvement in A2 can be attributed to the
    fact that ASTs behave like weirs, allowing water level fluctuations to pass over
    the crest faster than through gates. As a result, both the maximum and average
    water depth deviations are reduced. For alternative A3, these differences are
    virtually non-existent, resulting in the water depth aligning closely with the
    setpoint and exhibiting negligible deviations. This leads to more efficient performance
    and lowers the costs associated with canal lining maintenance and repair, which
    could arise due to significant water level fluctuations. Notice that the water
    depth variations in A3 are not depicted in Fig. 8 due to their insignificance.
    With Alternative A3, the water depth variations and performance indicators were
    considerably reduced, and MAEs and IAEs reached below 0.2% and 0.01%, respectively.
    3.4 Environmental and Economic Analyses Table 4 presents the results of the environmental
    analysis associated with the installation of ASTs in EACN. The annual energy (column
    4) was calculated based on the operation of the system over a span of four months.
    This calculation assumed that water flows through the EACN only during the four
    specific months of February, March, June, and July each year. Table 4 Environmental
    analyses of ASTs installation in EACN Full size table With the installation of
    ASTs, EACN produces annual energies of 121,666 kWh, 87,964 kWh, and 9,378 kWh
    for AST1, AST5, and AST10, respectively. This energy could be fed into the national
    grid, thereby preventing the production of 153,306 kg CO2 and yielding an annual
    carbon credit of $2,146. These results indicate that the installation of ASTs
    significantly reduces carbon dioxide emissions and increases the amount of carbon
    credit earned substantially. According to Dhakal et al. (2018), the cost of installing
    an AST in an existing irrigation canal encompasses three main expenses: civil
    work, electromechanical components, and the turbine with its associated accessories.
    They account for 18%, 27%, and 55%, respectively, used in this research too. By
    assuming an investment cost of $2151 per kW, an electricity price of 0.17 $/kWh,
    an efficiency of 80%, and four months of AST operation, the detailed investment
    cost and economic criteria are given in Table 5. Table 5 A detailed initial cost
    and investment in EACN as an existing irrigation canal Full size table As demonstrated
    and discussed earlier, replacing inline gates with ASTs offers benefits in terms
    of canal operation, environmental impact, and financial considerations. Therefore,
    it is advisable to consider ASTs as a viable option for use in canal networks.
    Note that civil works include the intake, weir and protection works, headrace
    canal, water trough support, powerhouse, machine foundation, tailrace canal, and
    transportation. Civil works constitute a small portion of the total cost as there
    is no need for new infrastructure in an existing irrigation canal - only minor
    modifications are necessary. Electromechanical components, which comprise the
    generator and its accessories, transformer and switchyards, installation and testing
    commissioning, spare tools, training, manuals, and other documents, account for
    27% of the total cost of an irrigation canal. The turbine and its accessories
    incur the most significant expense, making up 55% of the total cost. Overall,
    the turbine installation is cost-effective according to the results obtained.
    As shown in Fig. 2, due to the canal being at a higher level compared to the lands
    on the left side, it can deliver water to these areas using gravitational force.
    However, lands on the right side are elevated and could potentially be developed
    for cultivation by using the water saved either through gravity-fed irrigation
    using pumps or through pressurized systems. In both cases, the required energy
    could be supplied by the electricity generated by the ASTs. There is also another
    potential use for the energy within EACN - it could either be sold directly to
    the public grid, or used to supply electricity to nearby residential areas. As
    shown in Fig. 2 and detailed in Table 6, there are cities and villages around
    the studied canal. Specifically, there is one city near WLR1 or AST1, four villages
    close to WLR5 or AST5, and three villages near WLR10 or AST10. Table 6 Operational
    performance assessment criteria Full size table Based on the Energy Balance Sheets
    (2019), the per capita electricity consumption for each household subscriber in
    Iran in 2019 was about 1059 kWh, whereas the global average stood at 182 kWh.
    The total power generated in this research amounts to 219,009 kWh, which is sufficient
    to cater to a residential area with a population over 1200 persons. The energy
    generated by AST5 could potentially be transported to either the village of Mundoni,
    situated 2.3 km from the energy source, allowing for 97% of its energy requirements
    to be supplied, or the village of Kaydan, which is located 0.23 km from the energy
    source, thereby fulfilling 71% of its energy needs. It should be emphasized that
    the holistic framework developed in this research has allowed for more efficient
    management of agricultural water, as the water delivery indicators have come close
    to their desired values. Additionally, this approach has enabled the generation
    of clean energy that is not only economical but also has a positive environmental
    impact. 4 Conclusion In this research, a holistic framework was developed which
    applies the principles of energy generation and the integration of intelligent
    operational strategies. Further, we conducted comprehensive economic and environmental
    evaluations. We calculated the crop water requirements and the water demand for
    online gates. We designed ASTs to replace inline gates that harbored substantial
    hydraulic energy, and developed equations to assess the water flow through these
    ASTs. We integrated HEC-RAS with MATLAB for an automated operation and utilized
    an artificial intelligence model for intelligent operation determination. Following
    this, we assessed these operations using performance indicators and conducted
    subsequent economic and environmental analyses. Performance indicators used in
    our study revealed that the canal efficiency witnessed a remarkable improvement,
    transitioning from merely good or fair to excellent when shifting from conventional
    operations to intelligent ones with the introduction of ASTs. Our findings also
    indicated substantial enhancements in water delivery efficacy and sufficiency.
    Notably, the deployment of ASTs led to an annual energy generation of 219,009
    kWh, curtailing CO2 emissions by 153,306 kg and yielding $2,146 in annual carbon
    credits. The framework illustrated a promising payback period of 5.4 years, showcasing
    its potential to simultaneously address water and energy challenges. Every research
    venture inevitably comes with its set of constraints, and our study is not exempted.
    One significant limitation is our distinct emphasis on the Eastern Aghili Canal
    Network. This focus potentially restricts the direct applicability of our results
    to other canal systems with different attributes. Moreover, while the amalgamation
    of Archimedes screw turbines and fuzzy sarsa learning has produced encouraging
    results, potential barriers concerning infrastructure compatibility, costs, and
    ongoing maintenance cannot be overlooked when considering real-world applications.
    Furthermore, our method’s reliance on artificial intelligence presupposes the
    availability of a substantial dataset for precise training and validation, a condition
    that might not always be met. The suggested deployment of Archimedes screw turbines
    could also entail hefty infrastructural amendments, posing challenges in regions
    constrained by financial or logistical barriers. The potential of Archimedes screw
    turbines, particularly in conjunction with artificial intelligence, warrants further
    exploration in diverse contexts. Future studies might consider broadening the
    geographical scope to include canal networks with varying characteristics to understand
    the scalability and adaptability of the proposed framework. Additionally, more
    in-depth examinations of the real-world logistical and financial implications
    of integrating ASTs into existing infrastructures would provide invaluable insights.
    As AI continues to evolve, so will its application in such contexts; therefore,
    continuous investigation into newer models, potentially offering more accurate
    results with lesser data, could prove beneficial. Finally, a comparative study
    examining the performance of ASTs against other renewable energy sources within
    canal systems might offer a clearer picture of their relative benefits and drawbacks.

  description: Poplar short rotation coppice (SRC) systems are important for biomass
    production and for short-to medium-term carbon (C) sequestration, contributing
    to a low-carbon bioeconomy and thus helping to mitigate global warming. The productivity
    and profitability of these plantations are, however, challenged under restrictive
    irrigation associated with climate change. This study compares the above- and
    below-ground C sequestration potential and economic viability of a 12-year plantation
    cycle (4 rotations of 3 years each) under Mediterranean conditions with optimum
    irrigation (T1) and 50% irrigation reduction (T2), analysing other promising biomass
    uses in the form of bioproducts. A total of 138 trees of the highly productive
    hybrid (‘AF2’) in a SRC-trial were sampled monthly (first rotation). Additionally,
    data from an extensive poplar plantation network (30 sites) was used to complete
    data for the plantation cycle. The average C content for above- and below-ground
    biomass was 17.04 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 (T1), falling by 24% in T2. The net present value
    (NPV) in T1 (6461 € ha−1) was 52% lower under T2 conditions. Extra payments for
    C sequestration increased the NPV to 8023 for T1 and 4331 € ha−1 for T2. Roots
    represent an important C storage in the soil, accumulating 29.9 Mg C ha−1 (T1)
    and 22.8 Mg C ha−1 (T2) by the end of the cycle in our study. The mitigation potential
    is strongly fortified when the share of bioproducts in biomass end-use increases.
    Assuming a distribution of 50% bioenergy and 50% bioproducts, emission were reduced
    between −114 Mg CO2eq ha−1 (T1) and −88 Mg CO2eq ha−1 (T2) compared to BAU until
    end of the century. This scenario plays a crucial sink-effect role by storing
    C contained in biomass, which is not immediately released into the atmosphere.

    under Mediterranean conditions with optimum irrigation (T1) and 50% irrigation
    reduction (T2), analysing other promising biomass uses in the form of bioproducts.
    A total of 138 trees of the highly productive hybrid (‘AF2’) in a SRC-trial were
    sampled monthly (first rotation). Additionally, data from an extensive poplar
    plantation network (30 sites) was used to complete data for the plantation cycle.
    The average C content for above- and below-ground biomass was 17.04 Mg C ha−1
    yr−1 (T1), falling by 24% in T2. The net present value (NPV) in T1 (6461 € ha−1)
    was 52% lower under T2 conditions. Extra payments for C sequestration increased
    the NPV to 8023 for T1 and 4331 € ha−1 for T2. Roots represent an important C
    storage in the soil, accumulating 29.9 Mg C ha−1 (T1) and 22.8 Mg C ha−1 (T2)
    by the end of the cycle in our study. The mitigation potential is strongly fortified
    when the share of bioproducts in biomass end-use increases. Assuming a distribution
    of 50% bioenergy and 50% bioproducts, emission were reduced between −114 Mg CO2eq
    ha−1 (T1) and −88 Mg CO2eq ha−1 (T2) compared to BAU until end of the century.
    This scenario plays a crucial sink-effect role by storing C contained in biomass,
    which is not immediately released into the atmosphere. Previous article in issue

    such as plantations for biomass production have been proposed as key elements
    in the mitigation of global warming by sequestering CO2 in woody biomass and in
    the soil (Grafton et al., 2021) while also generating co-benefits such as landscape
    diversity, reduction of soil erosion and nutrient leaching, increased biodiversity,
    phytoremediation or floodplain management (Haughton et al., 2016; Henri and Johnson,
    2005; Oliveira, 2019). In rural areas, they can promote employment and thus contribute
    to smart green growth (Scarlat et al., 2015). At global scale there are two broad
    types of forest-based carbon sequestration projects: i) afforestation (often with
    fast-growing species) and/or reforestation, and ii) forest conservation (Grafton
    et al., 2021). Short rotation plantations have much higher growth rates than regular
    forests and are seen as the most effective short to medium term carbon sequestration
    tool (Bastin et al., 2019; Grafton et al., 2021). They provide a source of raw
    material for bioenergy and/or bioproducts (Herold et al., 2021), thus helping
    to meet renewable energy targets while increasing soil carbon content on agricultural
    land in the short term (within the first 10 years) (Grafton et al., 2021), therefore
    contributing to a low-carbon bioeconomy (Grafton et al., 2021; Oliveira et al.,
    2020; Pawson et al., 2013). Poplar short rotation coppice (SRC) systems achieve
    high productivity in a short period of time (Oliveira et al., 2020), storing a
    large amount of carbon (C) in the different biomass fractions (Berhongaray et
    al., 2017). The Populus genus posesses various traits that make it suitable for
    the production of biomass under a wide range of environmental conditions (Dickmann
    et al., 2002). Poplar SRC systems under Mediterranean conditions are particularly
    productive, although irrigation is often required. Despite the high productivity
    and the great potential of poplar SRC under Mediterranean conditions to contribute
    to a low-carbon bioeconomy, the pressure of climate change means that it is of
    increasing importance to take water scarcity into consideration. Productivity
    may be seriously limited by water deficit during the growing seasons (González-González
    et al., 2017), irrigation generally being a necessary requirement to ensure the
    survival of poplar plantations, particularly under Mediterranean conditions (Padrón
    and Orensanz García, 1987). However, as climate change progresses, water limitation
    and the need for irrigation is also becoming a concern in climatic zones which
    are currently not water limited (Coyle and Coleman, 2005; Dimitriou et al., 2009;
    Schweier and Becker, 2013; Yan et al., 2016). In this context, it is crucial to
    evaluate the impact of water restriction on the productivity of this land-use
    system, especially under the predominantly water-limited Mediterranean conditions.
    Plantation owners need to evaluate the impact on the profitability of their investment
    and the associated C stock potential in order to make reasoned business decisions.
    If the total C sequestration potential of a plantation is to be adequately determined,
    it is necessary to take into account not only the commercial fraction, but also
    the roots and leaves. Belowground biomass plays an important role in carbon sequestration,
    although scarce studies have focused on quantifying its contribution (Oliveira
    et al., 2018). An economic assessment of poplar SRC systems is therefore crucial
    to complement ecological impact analyses. Most publications, however, have only
    considered income from chip biomass, (Fuertes et al., 2021; Laina et al., 2022;
    San Miguel et al., 2015; Schweier and Becker, 2013; Testa et al., 2014), with
    fewer studies including carbon payments (Díaz-Balteiro and Romero, 2003; Shooshtarian,
    2015). The results of these studies vary considerably and present a high degree
    of uncertainty due to differences in site conditions, the genotypes selected according
    to productivity, cultural operations applied, land rental costs, different discount
    rates used, market prices for chip biomass and availability of public subsidies
    (Fuertes et al., 2021; Hauk et al., 2014; Laina et al., 2022). In particular,
    it is important to include extra payments for carbon sequestration in the calculation
    of poplar SRC plantation investment. In Spain for instance, the first mandates
    became available in 2014, which award a market price for the sequestered carbon
    dioxide in tree plantations, excluding plantations with a rotation of less than
    8 years (Boletín Oficial Del Estado, 2014; MITERD, 2019). Payments for carbon
    sequestration therefore represent potential additional income, which will influence
    the economic viability of poplar SRC plantations and may increase their attractiveness
    from the perspective of landowners and investors. Addressing economic uncertainties
    associated with discount rates, biomass and carbon market prices, as well as ecological
    uncertainties related to possible future climate change, such as water restrictions,
    is thus crucial to increase awareness of the potential of poplar SRC systems to
    contribute to a low-carbon bioeconomy. However, the climate change mitigation
    potential is not limited to the actual carbon sequestered in the plantation and
    use as a renewable bioenergy source. The conversion of lignocellulosic biomass
    into high-value bioproducts provides a promising alternative to petroleum as a
    renewable source of carbon, providing extra revenue from the biomass and extending
    the carbon sequestration potential of these systems. The EU''s Green Deal policies
    are likely to enhance demand for biomass, either in the form of renewable bioenergy
    or bio-based products to replace fossil products (Herold et al., 2021). The use
    of carbon farming practices in agriculture and forestry can enhance carbon storage
    sustainably and create a new business model for farmers and foresters (Commission,
    2022). Poplar has high cellulose content (42–49%), low amounts of ash and extractives
    (0.6–2.7 and 1.4–3.6%, respectively), and moderate lignin and hemicellulose contents
    (21–29 and 16–23%, respectively), which make it a desirable feedstock for bio-based
    products (Ibarra et al., 2017; own unpublished data, n. d.; Sannigrahi et al.,
    2010). Through this study, we aim to quantify the biomass production and C sequestration
    potential of a poplar SRC plantation under regular- and water-limited conditions
    and to further assess the economic impact. Therefore, we used an irrigation-restriction
    experiment as well as an extensive dataset from a network of irrigated poplar
    SRC plots covering the entire range of cultivation in Spain. The objectives of
    this work are: i) To quantify the productivity and accumulated carbon in above
    and below-ground biomass in poplar SCR plantations with business-as-usual (BAU)
    management, under conventional irrigation regime (T1 - irrigated to field capacity
    (FC)) and under irrigation reduction (T2 – to 50% FC). ii) To evaluate the impact
    of irrigation regimes T1 and T2 on the profitability of business-as-usual (BAU)
    and the potential economic benefit of extra payments for carbon sequestration
    (BAU + C). iii) To address the uncertainty of price variability in chip biomass
    and in sequestered carbon, as well as variability in discount rates for both studied
    scenarios (BAU and BAU + C) and under irrigation regimes T1 and T2. iv) To investigate
    alternative biomass uses in long-lived bioproducts in order to compare their climate
    mitigation potential with conventional short-lived bioenergy end-use. Overall,
    we aim to provide policy decision makers and owners with an ecological-economic
    assessment of the potential of poplar short rotation plantations to contribute
    to a low-carbon bioeconomy under water-limited conditions. 2. Material and methods
    2.1. Study design Our study considers standard SRC poplar plantations under Mediterranean
    conditions with a 12-year plantation cycle, comprising 4 rotations of 3 years
    each (Sixto et al., 2010). For the first rotation (single-shoot) we used detailed
    experimental data from a SRC plantation (SRC-trial) and for successive rotations
    (multi-shoots), the data used in this work came from the Poplar Plot Network (PPN)
    dataset. The PPN comprises 350 plots in 98 trials located at 30 different sites
    under Mediterranean conditions Sixto et al. (2015, 2013). A summary of the climatic
    conditions of all sites used in this study can be found in Supplementary material,
    Table S1. 2.1.1. SRC-trial The SRC-trial was established in 2018 central Spain
    at a density of 10,000 trees ha−1 (2 m × 0.5 m) using the ‘AF2′ genotype (Populus
    × canadensis Mönch). This genotype is widely planted for the production of chip
    biomass in the Mediterranean area (Pannacci et al., 2009; Sabatti et al., 2014)
    due to its high productivity and adaptability to various environmental conditions
    (Sixto et al., 2015). Under restrictive water conditions, this genotype had previously
    showed significantly higher IWUE values along the rotation (Fuertes et al., 2022).
    These values were indicative of the capacity of the leaf to regulate photosynthesis
    and stomatal conductance and therefore the suitability of the genotype for adaptation
    to restrictive water conditions endured over time. The study site (40° 27′ 27''''
    N; 3° 45′ 01'''' W) is at an elevation of 592 m a.s.l, with an annual mean temperature
    of 14.66 °C. The soil has a sandy loam texture with a pH of 8.6 and 0.86% organic
    matter. The SRC-trial was established manually using hardwood cuttings of 25 cm
    in length and two irrigation regimes (T1 and T2) were defined. T1 was irrigated
    to field capacity and served as the optimum regime as applied under business-as-usual
    management. T2 was irrigated to 50% of the field capacity. Each regime (T1 and
    T2) consisted of five single rows with 295 trees, including inner and outer border
    rows to minimize border effects, ensuring that each subsample has its own edge.
    A drip irrigation system was used from May to October every year during the entire
    rotation. Moisture in both plots was monitored using moisture sensors (SM200 Delta-T).
    Weed competition was prevented over all three years. Fertilization was not applied.
    2.1.2. PPN trial The PPN comprises 350 plots in 98 trials located at 30 different
    sites under Mediterranean conditions (Sixto et al., 2013, 2015). The PPN exhibits
    edaphic variability typical of irrigated areas in Spain, with pH levels ranging
    from 5.09 to 9.82 and organic material percentages ranging from 0.03 to 4.59%.
    Regarding climate, there is considerable macro and micro climatic variability
    within the network, although overall, it can be classified under Mediterranean
    climatic conditions (see Table S1 in Supplementary material). Both the establishment
    and management of the plantation are similar to those described for the SRC-trial,
    encompassing in this case a total of 3 consecutive rotations at some of the test
    sites. 2.2. Biomass estimation 2.2.1. Above-ground biomass Every month, on the
    21st ± 3 days, during the 3 growing seasons of the rotation, 3 trees per water
    regime were harvested, measured and destructively-sampled from April to November
    of 2018 until 2020, to obtain the above-ground Ws (kg tree−1) biomass per tree
    and water regime. In total, 138 out of 590 sampled trees were harvested at the
    end of the first rotation. While the above-ground woody biomass data for the 1st
    rotation was collected from the intensive field experiment (SRC-trial), for the
    2nd and 3rd rotations the above-ground woody biomass values were modelled based
    on the experimental production average increment found in those plots where data
    for at least 2 successive rotations (with the similar planting density) were available
    in the PPN (Fuertes et al., 2021). The resulting increments were applied for both
    irrigation regimes (T1 and T2). Since no experimental data from the PPN dataset
    were available for the last rotation, the production of the 4th rotation was calculated
    using the average growth rate trend (Fuertes et al., 2021). The modelled productivity
    in this study is in line with that cited in the literature by other authors, with
    similar productivity trends among rotations (Štochlová et al., 2019), although
    different values might be due to different climatic conditions, clones used and/or
    management practices. 2.2.2. Below-ground biomass In the SRC-trial, the frequency
    of below-ground biomass sampling Wr (kg tree−1) was limited to every other month
    during the three years of the rotation, accounting for the increasing complexity
    of the root-extraction procedure. As a result, 72 trees were sampled for above-
    and below-ground biomass in the first rotation under both water regimes (T1 and
    T2). For the below-ground biomass, roots were extracted using a backhoe excavator.
    The soil extracts containing the sampled roots were cleaned and dried in a forced
    air oven at 60 °C to constant dry mass. Dry root biomass was determined, using
    a balance (EU-C 7500PQ), to an accuracy of 0.1 g. Broken root tips were measured
    to estimate the remaining root biomass in the soil and the stumps were separated
    from the roots. A degree of root loss during the extraction cannot be completely
    avoided, hence we used the allometric relationship between the broken tip diameter
    and the remaining root biomass in the soil developed by Oliveira et al. (2018).
    Total below-ground biomass (Wr in kg tree−1) was determined from the sum of the
    stump, the extracted roots and the remaining root biomass estimated from the diameter
    of the broken tip. So, the 1st rotation data was collected from the SRC-trial.
    For the 3rd rotation, the below-ground biomass values for both regimes were estimated
    using the observed root:shoot ratio values found in those PPN plots within the
    same planting density. In cases where there were multiple shoots due to coppicing,
    all shoots from the same stool were considered together in the calculation of
    the root:shoot ratio. Since no experimental root biomass data for the same planting
    density was available for the 2nd and 4th rotation, these data were estimated
    based on rotation-time changes in the below-ground biomass. We predicted the theoretical
    value for below-ground yield per rotation (every 3 years) and water regime (T1
    and T2) trends using the best equation to fit our experimental data. A non-linear
    allometric relationship Eq. (1) was fitted using nonlinear least squares to approximate
    the observed response per water regime and rotation, using the statistical programme
    R (R Core Team, 2019). (1) Where (Mg ha−1) is the below-ground biomass, t is time
    (years) and a and b are fitting parameters. The equations considered achieved
    convergence and all estimate parameters a and b per irrigation regimes (T1 and
    T2) as well as goodness-of-fit statistics are shown in Table 1. Table 1. Parameter

    Quantification of carbon sequestration To determine above and below-ground concentrations
    of C (%) the SRC trial was used. The different fractions from each harvested tree
    per month and water regime (T1 and T2) were dried in a forced air oven at 60 °C
    to constant dry mass then weighed using a balance (EU-C 7500PQ) with an accuracy
    of 0.1 g. Carbon was determined through dry combustion analysis using an automated
    analyser (LECO; mod CN-2000, St joseph MI, USA). The concentrations of the different
    elements were calculated on a dry mass basis and expressed as mg g−1 of dry mass.
    2.4. Economic impact analyses 2.4.1. Irrigation regime evaluation To evaluate
    the economic impact of irrigation regimes T1 and T2 of the two considered scenarios
    (BAU and BAU + C), all cultural operation costs for well-managed poplar SRC plantations
    under Mediterranean conditions were taken from Fuertes et al. (2021). All average
    costs, including the cost of the agricultural supplies (e.g., herbicide, fuel,
    fertilizer, etc.) were measured before taxes. To assess the profitability from
    harvested biomass we calculated the Net Present Value (NPV) according to Eq. (2)
    and Land Expectation Value (LEV) according to Eq. (3). The chip biomass price
    assumed in this study was 88 € t−1 (odt) at the farm gate in accordance with the
    actual market and pricing obtained from the sector (Fuertes et al., 2021). A sensitivity
    analysis was carried out to investigate the impact of variation in chip biomass
    prices. (2) Where NPV is the Net Present Value (€ ha−1), t is time (years), n
    is lifetime of the plantation (years), i is the discount rate and cash flow is
    the revenue (R) minus costs (C) for each year (€ ha−1). Hauk et al. (2014) showed
    that the discount rates in 37 SRC studies in Europe varied from 3 to 7%. We assumed
    a real discount rate of 5% based on previous studies (Diaz-Balteiro and Rodriguez,
    2006; Hauk et al., 2014). To account for this variability, we additionally conducted
    a sensitivity analysis for the discount rate. (3) Where LEV is the Land Expectation
    Value (€ ha−1), NPV is the Net Present Value (€ ha−1), t is time (years) and i
    is the discount rate. We used the LEV to find the economically optimum rotation
    length and to analyse the impact of the different irrigation regimes. The LEV
    represents the value of all future costs and revenues assuming that the rotation
    will be replicated an infinite number of times in the future (Díaz-Balteiro et
    al., 2014), according to Eq. (3). 2.4.2. Carbon benefits For the economic analysis
    of BAU + C we also calculated revenues from C payments. A reference price of 10
    € for each tonne of carbon per hectare captured was used (Diaz-Balteiro and Rodriguez,
    2006; Nölte et al., 2018). A sensitivity analysis was carried out to investigate
    the impact of variation in carbon sale prices. To analyse the economic and environmental
    implication of the root-extraction practice in the context of carbon benefits,
    we used the average cost of root extraction practice of 81 € t−1 (odt) from Spinelli
    et al. (2005). The costs include root extraction, cleaning, loading and transportation
    (over a 20 km distance). For the revenue from root biomass, we considered the
    stump mass found in this study, which at the time of the first rotation harvest
    was 33% and 26% of the total root biomass for irrigation regimes T1 and T2 respectively.
    For in-situ stump grinding cost, we assumed 450 € ha−1, referring to an operation
    which smashes the stumps and incorporates the woody debris into the soil, restoring
    the area for the next crops (Laina et al., 2022). 2.4.3. Analyses of uncertainty
    in the socio-economic framework Different discount rates ranging from 0% to 13%,
    biomass prices with a range from 80 to 140 € t−1 (odt) and carbon prices with
    a range from 10 to 30 € t−1 were tested in order to analyse the influence of this
    parameter on NPV under the two irrigation regimes (T1 and T2). This analysis allows
    these factors to be varied from the perspective of decision-makers in order to
    obtain information on the profitability of investments based on Eq. (2). 2.5.
    Life cycle analyses of carbon emission 2.5.1. Carbon stored in biomass-derived
    products In our BAU scenario, 100% of chip biomass is used for bioenergy. We then
    analysed other promising potential future uses of chip biomass as bioproducts
    (BP) that would increase the efficiency of carbon sequestration in poplar SRC
    plantations. We thus assumed, in a second scenario, the end-use of lignocellulosic
    biomass as 50% bioenergy use and 50% bioproducts (50% BP). Fig. 1 gives an overview
    of the most promising bioproducts which are derived from the three primary lignocellulosic
    biomass components and which could replace petroleum-derived products in the future.
    Research and development on most of the bioproducts obtained from lignocellulosic
    biomass are, however, at their initial stage for commercial level production due
    to the challenges of high-energy consumption, investment cost, and process efficiency.
    Other bioproducts, such as dissolving pulp that is spun into textile fibres from
    high purity cellulose, furfural which is a valuable platform chemical from hemicellulose,
    carbon foams, battery anodes from lignin, and bio-based plastic from cellulose
    and lignin, can be introduced directly into current markets (Adler et al., 2022;
    Alonso et al., 2017; European Bioplastics, 2018; Motagamwala et al., 2018). Download

    Overview of possible bioproducts to replace petroleum-derived products, made from
    the main components of lignocellulosic biomass. The composition of the different
    fractions (%) of the hybrid poplar “AF2” (odt) have been taken from our own unpublished
    data and from the literature (Ibarra et al., 2017). Basal tree samples from the
    studied poplar plantation at harvest time (first rotation) under both irrigation
    regimes T1: optimum regime, irrigated to field capacity (FC); T2: Reduced irrigation,
    50% of FC. After screening the literature on the most promising potential bioproducts
    currently available (Fig. 1), we chose the bio-based plastic polyethylene furanoate
    (PEF) for our scenario of alternative end-uses of poplar-SRC-derived biomass.
    PEF is a 100% bio-based polymer, fully recyclable and can easily be disposed of
    in the established recycling streams (Bioplastics, 2017). It posesses improved
    material properties of high commercial interest (Motagamwala et al., 2018; Rosenboom
    et al., 2018) and holds great potential to replace fossil-based polyethylene terephthalate
    (PET) - the latter being one of the world''s most dominant polymers on the market
    with a production of more than 50 Mt yr−1 (European Bioplastics, 2018; Rosenboom
    et al., 2018). Furthermore, it can be used for the production of packaging (rigid
    and flexible), textiles, films and other everyday items, hence is considered a
    promising renewable resource-based bioplastic (European Bioplastics, 2018; Jong
    et al., 2022). Plastic products are highly variable in terms of material properties
    as well as in their lifespan, which can range from one up to 50 years of potential
    service life (Plastics Europe, 2019). Therefore, we conducted a life-cycle carbon
    emission analysis of one plantation cycle (12 years) in order to gain a conservative
    general overview of the potential to sequester C in bioproducts. Through the example
    of PEF we illustrate just one promising example of how lignocelullosic biomass
    can be used to produce bioproducts which can sequester C in the mid-to long-term,
    thereby contributing to a low-carbon economy. 2.5.2. Conditions and assumptions
    for life cycle analyses of carbon emission A number of factors and limitations
    were taken into consideration for this study: i) Land conversion emissions were
    zero because no primary forest or land use change was involved. ii) Above-ground
    biomass decomposition was zero because there was no woody debris left after each
    harvest. iii) We assumed that 100% of the above biomass was used to produce electricity.
    iv) Emissions associated with operational activity (transportation of cuttings,
    soil preparation, weeding, planting, irrigation, harvesting, transport to a power
    plant and conversion to electricity) were considered and values were taken from
    Djomo et al. (2019). v) We considered two scenarios: BAU (where 100% of above
    biomass is used for bioenergy) and 50%-BP (where 50% of above biomass is used
    to bioenergy and 50% is used to produce the bio-plastic product PEF). The 50%-BP
    scenario takes into account two end-of-life options: recycling and incineration
    without energy recovery. As a result, we conducted three different tests per water
    regime T1 and T2: - Test-1: BAU (Business-as-usual, 100% lignocellulosic biomass
    as bioenergy). - Test-2: 50% BP-Recycling, (50% lignocellulosic biomass as bioenergy
    50% bioproduct. End-of-life: recycling). - Test-3: 50% BP-Incineration, (50% lignocellulosic
    biomass as bioenergy 50% bioproduct. End-of-life: Incineration without energy
    recovery). There are several sources of uncertainty to consider in this section
    of the study. Firstly, the lifespan of different PEF bio-plastic product categories
    varies considerably. Secondly, the rates of plastic incineration and recycling
    (Geyer et al., 2017). In this study we assumed lifespans of 15 years for the bioproducts,
    considering full recyclability or incineration without energy recovery as end-of-life
    options. We have used a conservative estimate of 20 kg of biomass feedstock required
    for the production of 1 kg of PEF, consistent with the findings of Bishop et al.
    (2022). Additionally, we considered a value of with 5.26 kg CO2 per kg of PEF
    produced, based on the research by Gerritse (2019). However, it is important to
    note that the biomass sources and methodologies employed in these previous studies
    differ from those used in our study due to the limited existing research on the
    impact of PEF, despite the growing interest in the topic. For this analysis we
    used the Bern model, which is the state-of-the-art global carbon cycle model (Levasseur
    et al., 2010). This model has been adopted by the IPCC for climate projections
    and calculation of the GWP for several GHGs (Forster et al., 2007). Calculations
    for carbon accounting are prone to double counting because of the complexity introduced
    by multiple variables (CICES, 2018). We verified all variables for an accurate
    carbon accounting and to prevent double counting in the calculations (Benítez-Ponce
    et al., 2018; Mbow et al., 2013). 2.6. Statistical analyses To evaluate the goodness-of-fit
    of the models, we used the proportion of variance explained by the models (pseudo
    coefficient of determination, pse-R2) and the root of mean square error (RMSE).

    observed and the predicted values of the dependent variable (Ryan, 2008), is the

    The effect of water regimes T1 and T2 on the different variables over the three
    growing seasons was analysed using analysis of variance ANOVA (Generalized Linear
    Model procedure, GLM). Prior to the ANOVA, when normality was not fulfilled, data
    were transformed using the Box-Cox procedure. All the analyses and graphing were
    performed using the R program (R Core Team, 2019) and the level of significance
    was set to p-value <0.05 for all the analyses. 3. Results and discussion 3.1.
    Experimental results for above and below-ground biomass during the first rotation
    In the establishment year, above-ground biomass increased monthly in both irrigation
    regimes. T2 reduced productivity by half (54%, p-value = 0.052) although this
    was not significant due to the large variability of the young plantation as a
    whole during the year of establishment. In contrast, in the following two years
    of the rotation, the reduced water regime T2 caused a significant decrease in
    the above-ground biomass (p-value = 0.0012 and p-value <0.0001 for years 2 and
    3, respectively). This 50% water restriction resulted in a 23% reduction in productivity
    at the end of the first rotation (Table 2). Table 2. Above-ground biomass (Mg
    ha−1) and below-ground biomass (Mg ha−1) at the end of the different growing seasons

    irrigation, 50% of FC. Different number of * show significant differences between
    water regimes for the same year. Several authors have found that water scarcity
    leads to a reduction in productivity during the growing seasons (Cañete-Salinas
    et al., 2019; Dimitriou et al., 2009; González-González et al., 2017). The increasing
    limitation of water for irrigation as climate change advances is likely to not
    only be an issue under Mediterranean conditions, but also in other climate zones
    which are not yet suffering water limitations. Short rotation poplar plantations
    are highly productive within a short timeframe – even on marginal agricultural
    sites (Schweier et al., 2017) - but irrigation is essential to achieve high productivity
    and to ensure the survival of trees under Mediterranean conditions, as well as
    in other regions (Padrón and Orensanz García, 1987; Schweier and Becker, 2013;
    Yan et al., 2016). The 23% reduction in productivity of above-ground biomass at
    the end of the first rotation (3 years) was lower in comparison with the results
    reported by González-González et al. (2017) for plants growing under similar climatic
    conditions but poorer soil (less organic matter) and double the planting density,
    which probably increased competition. The overall loss in productivity of the
    below-ground biomass was found to be 41.2% at the end of the first rotation (9.45
    Mg ha−1 year−1 (odt) (T1) and 5.56 Mg ha−1 year−1 (odt) (T2), Table 2), with non-significant
    differences in below-ground productivity per year between the different water
    regimes T1 and T2 (p-value = 0.094, p-value = 0.957 and p-value = 0.376 for years
    1, 2 and 3, respectively), probably due to the low number of values and high variability
    found. 3.2. Above and below-ground biomass for one complete plantation cycle At
    the end of the lifecycle of the poplar plantation (12 years), the total harvested
    above-ground biomass was 343.89 and 264.79 Mg ha−1 (odt) for T1 and T2 respectively,
    while the accumulated below-ground biomass was 63.75 Mg ha−1 and 48.64 Mg ha−1
    for T1 and T2 respectively (Fig. 2a and b). The root:shoot ratios increased; ranging
    from 0.23 to 0.89 over the course of the 4 rotations. After the first rotation,
    the root system is well established, which is reflected in the increment in above-ground
    biomass of 37% and 36% in the second and third rotations, respectively. In the
    4th rotation, the exhaustion of the stumps eventually reduced the above-ground
    productivity. In this regard, these results are in line with those cited in the
    literature by other authors of similar productivity trends in the consecutive
    rotations (Schiberna et al., 2021; Štochlová et al., 2019). Download : Download

    (odt) per ha. 3.3. Above and below-ground carbon stocks 3.3.1. Fractions of C
    concentrations (%) in above and below-ground biomass The concentrations of C (%)
    in the above-ground biomass fraction scarcely varied over the whole first rotation
    cycle, ranging from 48 to 51% for regime T1 and from 47 to 51% for regime T2 (Fig.
    2, c). In the below-ground biomass fraction, C concentration was slightly lower
    than in the above-ground biomass, ranging from 43 to 48% for regime T1 and from
    45 to 47% for regime T2 (Fig. 2, c). The below-ground concentration of C is consistent
    with other studies (Fang et al., 2007; Oliveira et al., 2018). In Oliveira et
    al., the root concentration of C varied from 45.95 to 46.30% for three different
    poplar genotypes (‘AF2’, ‘I-214’ and ‘Monviso’) growing under similar Mediterranean
    conditions. The average C (%) at harvest time was 51% in the above-ground biomass
    and 47% for the below-ground biomass for both T1 and T2. These percentages were
    then used for further economic analyses of potential C payments. 3.3.2. C sequestration
    potential in above and below-ground biomass The optimum irrigation regime (T1),
    shows an above-ground C content from 35.9 to 50.7 Mg C ha−1 depending on the productivity
    of the different rotations, making a total above-ground C content potential at
    the end of the plantation cycle of 174.0 Mg C ha−1. The reduced irrigation regime
    (T2) resulted in a 23% reduction in above-ground C content. With the development
    of the root system over the lifespan of the poplar plantation, the below-ground
    C content increased from 7.9 to 29.8 Mg C ha−1 for T1. This increase was 26% lower
    for T2. The average yearly below-ground C content was 2.5 and 1.9 Mg C ha−1 yr−1
    for T1 and T2. These values were higher than those reported in the literature:
    0.85–1.5 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 (Fang et al., 2007) for 4-year rotation length and lower
    density plantations (500–1111 trees ha−1). Under Mediterranean conditions, with
    same plant density and the same rotation length as in this study, although with
    lower above and below-ground productivity, average yearly below-ground C content
    ranged from 0.89 to 0.91 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 (Oliveira et al., 2018). These differences
    may be due to the high yields found in our site conditions, even under water restrictions.
    Accounting for the entire above- and below-ground woody biomass, the average C
    content potential for the whole plantation cycle found in this study was 17.0
    and 13.3 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 for the different irrigation regimes T1 and T2, respectively.
    In addition, if leaf biomass is taken into account, C content increases by 2.2
    and 1.4 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 for T1 and T2, respectively (Fuertes et al., 2022). In
    any case, where only the woody biomass is considered, the average absorption of
    CO2equivalent(eq) per tree was 0.0063 Mg CO2eq per year in T1 and 0.0049 in T2.
    Poplar plantations with a rotation length of less than 8 years are not included
    in the C payment projects in Spain (MITERD, 2019). Currently, the Spanish Environmental
    Ministry calculates the CO2eq absorption rate for a plantation based on the species
    and rotation length, with 30 years being the minimum time period of the project.
    This time period includes all cuttings per rotation. The landowners must therefore
    replant the poplar plantation after each cycle to ensure the minimum total time
    period is met. The estimation of the total plantation absorption (CO2eq ha−1)
    at the end of the entire time period will be calculated from the estimated average
    absorption in each rotation (MITERD, 2019). In the case of poplar SRC plantations,
    due to their capacity for rapid growth over a short period of time, the absorption
    of CO2eq per tree, even in year 3, already plays an active role in C sequestration,
    the amount sequestered being on average 190 and 146 CO2eq ha−1 per rotation (3
    years) for the different irrigation regimes T1 and T2, respectively. According
    to figures from the Spanish Ministry for the Environment (2019), CO2eq absorption
    values per tree are similar to those of poplar plantations aimed at veneer production,
    which are normally managed with a rotation length of 13 years and a density of
    400 trees ha−1 (Garnica et al., 2018), reaching 44 CO2eq ha−1 per rotation. Today,
    these latter, traditional plantation systems produce both traditional roundwood
    up to a diameter of 8 cm (82.9%) as well as chip biomass from the tops and branches
    (17.1%) in the same supply system (Laina et al., 2022). In the context of climate
    change, poplar SRC systems can play an important role in absorbing CO2 and reducing
    pressure on natural forests. As a result of the increased demands for lignocellulosic-based
    bioproducts, the C absorbed by these plantations is stored for even longer in
    the bioproducts derived from them, increasing still further the potential of poplar
    SRC plantations to mitigate climate change. Therefore, these plantations should
    play a more prominent role in strategies and projects aimed at C sequestration.
    3.4. Economic evaluation of revenues from biomass (BAU) and additional revenues
    from potential carbon payments (BAU + C) We calculated the NPV from the accumulated
    discounted cash flow for the full plantation cycle (i = 5%). In the business-as-usual
    scenario with optimal irrigation (T1), the NPV was 6461 € ha−1. The productivity
    loss of 23% due to irrigation reduction decreased the NPV by half (Fig. 3 and
    Table 4). Download : Download high-res image (580KB) Download : Download full-size

    regimes T1 (Irrigated to field capacity) and T2 (Irrigated to 50% field capacity).
    The applied interest rate (i) was 5%. The considered establishment costs were
    for land rental, irrigation, and cultural operations. Table 3. Below and above-ground

    C for carbon sequestration (BAU + C) was assumed, the NPV value increased to 8024€
    ha−1 and to 4330€ ha−1 for regime T1 and T2, respectively. The effect of including
    the payment for carbon sequestration diversifies the plantation incomes, introducing
    an annual payment which contributes to recovering the investment one year earlier
    in both irrigation regimes (T1 and T2), thus making poplar plantations economically
    more attractive. We used the LEV to analyse the effect of irrigation and C payments
    on the optimum economical rotation length. The optimum LEV value between the studied
    scenarios, BAU and BAU + C, was not affected as a consequence of introducing a
    carbon payment of 10 € Mg−1 C. However, regime T1 achieved an optimum LEV one
    year earlier (year 10) than the reduced irrigation regime T2, the optimum LEV
    being 14,803 and 18,376 € ha−1 for the BAU and BAU + C scenarios, respectively,

    (LEV) and the economically optimum rotation length for two irrigation regimes:
    T1 (Irrigated to field capacity) and T2 (Irrigated to 50% field capacity) in two
    scenarios: a) Business-as-usual (BAU) and BAU plus additional payments for carbon
    sequestration (BAU + C). The interest rate (i) applied was 5%. The establishment
    costs considered included land rental, irrigation, and cultural operations. Negative
    values below −4000 € are not displayed for greater clarity. In the reduced irrigation
    regime T2, the optimum LEV was reached in year 11 with 7112 and 9819 € ha−1 for
    the BAU and BAU + C scenarios, respectively. This was 48% lower in the former
    scenario and 53% lower in the latter compared to our optimum regime T1. The experimental
    irrigation restriction therefore not only had a negative impact on productivity,
    but also a notable impact on the profitability of our poplar plantation. Moreover,
    the decrease in carbon fixation had an additional negative impact on the climate
    change mitigation potential of the plantation. 3.5. Economic and environmental
    implications of the root-extraction practice The below-ground biomass is an important
    fraction of the total biomass pool of the plantation, accounting for 19% and 21%
    of the total tree biomass at the end cycle for T1 and T2, respectively. Root extraction,
    despite the high costs, remains an attractive option for landowners to increase
    their revenue from the plantations and/or to clear their fields (Spinelli et al.,
    2005). However, roots are also an important source of carbon storage in the soil,
    which at the end of the plantation cycle in our study amounted to 29.9 Mg C ha−1
    and 22.8 Mg C ha−1 for T1 and T2 respectively. We compared the economic impact
    of two root management procedures at the end of the plantation cycle under the
    BAU scenario, both of which end with cleared fields. One technique is that of
    root extraction, where the roots are removed with an excavator and the biomass
    is sold. Under another technique, that of grinding, the roots are ground, but
    are incorporated into the soil and thus remain in the field. There is an important
    difference between the two techniques in terms of climate change mitigation, since
    the C content of the roots in the latter case, (grinding) is incorporated into
    the soil. The costs of the root extraction were 1704 € ha−1 for T1 and 1025 €
    ha−1 for T2. The additional revenue from extraction and sale of the root biomass
    increased the NPV by 4.96% for T1 and 6.92% for T2 compared with the grinding
    method. We used the market price of 88 € t−1 (odt), as for the above-ground biomass,
    although the lower biomass quality would probably mean the price would be slightly
    lower. By assuming a payment for C within the framework of climate change mitigation,
    sustainable management of the plantation is a prerequisite, which precludes the
    root extraction practice given the present fragility of soil ecosystems (Bellassen
    et al., 2022). We consider that the SRC plantation system should not receive any
    additional payments for C sequestration when the root extraction practice is applied,
    but that the practice of incorporating the ground roots into the soil should be
    economically incentivized. However, recent legislation in Spain, within the Common
    Agricultural Policy, entitles the onwers of woody crops to receive a subsidy when
    pruning residues are crushed and left on the ground as mulch to promote more sustainable
    soil management practices. To our knowledge, this legislation does not explicitly
    prohibit extraction and sale of the root biomass in SRC plantations (Ministerio
    de Agricultura, 2022). We suggest that this policy should be extended to SRC plantations
    to promote the practice of stump grinding at the end of the rotation cycle. Based
    on this assumption, if we compare the BAU + C scenario with the BAU, introducing
    payment for the root biomass, the root extraction practice is no longer competitive.
    This finding is supported by the results of our study when additional C payments
    were included (BAU + C): The LEV or NPV of the BAU scenario fall below the BAU
    + C scenario. The break-even point at which the practice of root extraction would
    cease was a minimum C price of 2 and 1.7 € Mg C ha−1 for T1 and T2, respectively.
    A recent Forest Research report by the European Climate Foundation on the Carbon
    Impacts of Biomass highlighted the positive impact of forest bioenergy initiatives
    where these are explicitly associated with afforestation activities, while supplies
    of forest bioenergy from stumps, including roots, are strongly disfavoured (Matthews
    et al., 2018). This is supported by the recent European Green Deal proposal, aimed
    at promoting sustainable carbon farming solutions which contribute to carbon storage
    in soils (Commission, 2022). A payment scheme within a national policy framework
    to sequester C should thus preclude the root extraction practice given the fragility
    of the soil ecosystems and their important role in climate change mitigation (Bellassen
    et al., 2022). In short, we have shown that poplar SRC plantations have a high
    C sequestration rate and the potential to further improve their C stocks in the
    soils through the slow decomposition of remaining stumps and roots while at the
    same time providing long-term sources of nutrients for the plantation (Alam et
    al., 2013). A recent study of a poplar SRC plantations in Slovakia revealed that
    the potential soil organic carbon (SOC) increased on average by 29% during the
    20 years of the plantation cycle, considering 5 rotations (Fürtner et al., 2022),
    highlighting the importance of taking the environmental benefits of the plantation
    into account. A carbon certification scheme can thus contribute to improving the
    climate change mitigation potential and help us move towards a low carbon bioeconomy
    by including economic incentives for the incorporation of woody biomass from roots
    and stumps into soils. 3.6. Addressing uncertainty in our socio-economic framework
    through sensitivity analyses Most landowners willing to invest in poplar SRC plantations
    are accustomed to making decisions under conditions of considerable uncertainty.
    We therefore aimed to provide a practical approach to address this uncertainty,
    helping decision-makers to determine possible economic returns on their investment.
    We combined different discount rates (from 1 to 13%), chip biomass (from 80 to
    140 € Mg−1) - and carbon prices based on the productivity of the irrigation regimes
    T1 and T2 and their carbon sequestration potential (Fig. 2 and Table 3). The estimated
    NPV value is presented in Fig. 5. Two major sources of uncertainty under the BAU
    scenario are the income from chip-biomass and the discount rate applied. Additional
    payment for C sequestration can increase the NPV. We therefore analysed the increment
    levels to be added to BAU based on three carbon prices (10, 20 and 30 € Mg−1)
    for the same range of discount rates. Download : Download high-res image (850KB)

    rates, biomass and carbon market prices in two different irrigation regimes T1
    (Irrigated to FC) and T2 (Irrigated to 50% FC). FC: field capacity and considering
    two scenarios: BAU (Business-as-usual) and BAU + Carbon (Business-as-usual considering
    the Carbon payment for ecosystem services). The red dots show our case study:
    T1 (solid circle) and T2 (crossed circle). The establishment costs considered
    included land rental, irrigation, and cultural operations. The red dots in Fig.
    5 show the studied regimes (T1 and T2), providing a sense of the wide variation
    in NPV as regards market prices and the final discount rate applied in the project.
    According to the assumptions our study and the observed productivity under the
    two water regimes applied (T1 and T2), the break-even point was reached in the
    BAU scenario when the chip biomass price exceeded 62.36 € Mg−1 (odt) for T1 and
    71.08 € Mg−1 (odt) for T2, respectively. When accounting the additional payment
    for C sequestration of 10 € Mg−1 C (BAU + C), the break-even point was lower:
    56.57 € Mg−1 (odt) for T1 and 65.61 € Mg−1 (odt) for T2, respectively. There is
    only one scenario in which profitability falls into negative figures, which is
    when irrigation is restricted (T2), with a very low biomass price (80 €), when
    no additional C payments are included and when the discount rate reaches 0.09%
    (Fig. 5), highlighting the profitability of poplar SRC plantations even under
    the worst-case scenario proposed. Chip biomass is generally the only source of
    income while additional payments for C sequestration are usually not taken into
    account for poplar SRC systems. If the latter were to be implemented, total income
    would increase and poplar plantations would become more attractive to investors.
    Fig. 5 enables the NPV value to be calculated for a 12-year plantation cycle under
    Mediterranean conditions with different irrigation regimes, and thus facilitate
    decision-making based on the benefits that can be obtained depending on the demands
    of the market. 3.7. Analysis of the climate mitigation potential of alternative
    biomass uses Wood-based products can contribute to climate change mitigation by
    prolonging the storage of carbon in the anthroposphere (Aryapratama and Pauliuk,
    2022). The impact of carbon flow on net emissions according to the different studied
    tests (BAU, 50% BP-Recycling and 50% BP-Incineration) and for both irrigation
    regimes (T1 and T2) is shown in Fig. 6. Download : Download high-res image (562KB)

    timeframe considering above-ground biomass of a poplar plantation cycle of 12
    years per irrigation regime, T1 (Irrigated to FC) and T2 (Irrigated to 50% FC)
    including three tests: BAU (business-as-usual, 100% lignocellulosic biomass as
    bioenergy); 50% BP-Recycling, (50% lignocellulosic biomass as bioenergy 50% bioproduct
    with EoL recycling) and 50% BP-incineration (50% lignocellulosic biomass as bioenergy
    50% bioproduct with EoL incineration. FC: field capacity. EoL: end-of-life. Vertical
    black line shows the end of the plantation cycle. Both BAU tests in the different
    irrigation regimes display a close-to-zero net emission balance. With 50% of the
    biomass being used for bioproducts, the initial emissions dropped dramatically,
    reaching the minimum peak in year 12 with −209.91 and −162.15 Mg CO2eq ha−1 for
    T1 and T2, respectively. Plantation growth during these years contributed to this
    decline due to the high poplar plantation sequestration rates. The bioproducts,
    therefore, play a crucial role in storing the C contained in biomass, which is
    not immediately released into the atmosphere. Emission were reduced between −114
    Mg CO2eq ha−1 (T1) and −88 Mg CO2eq ha−1 (T2) compared to BAU until end of the
    century for the both end of life studied (50% BP-Recycling and 50% BP-incineration).
    A slight increase in emissions occurs after the plantation cycle in year 12 since
    there are no regrowth effects. This increase is particularly notable in the scenario
    where the final destination is incineration, highlighting the significance of
    recycling, despite the relatively small amount of kg PEF considered in this study.
    A recent publication by Adler et al. (2022) addresses lignin-first biorefining
    of poplar plantations to produce textile fibers, with 100% of the harvested biomass
    being used to produce this bioproduct. This study highlights a new value chain
    to reduce the environmental footprint of textiles, chemicals, and biofuels. Other
    studies have emphasized the importance of plantations as feedstocks of lignocellulosic
    biomass to produce bioproducts providing benefits in terms of climate mitigation,
    ecosystem enhancement, and wider bioeconomy initiatives (Bishop et al., 2022;
    Pires et al., 2019; Reshmy et al., 2021; Shrestha et al., 2021). Global net emissions
    ought to be reduced at an annual rate of around 7% between 2020 and 2030 to be
    able to limit global warming to 1.5° (Christensen and Olhoff, 2019). Wood-based
    products can contribute to climate change mitigation by prolonging the storage
    of carbon in the anthroposphere (Aryapratama and Pauliuk, 2022). Besides C storage,
    the replacement of fossil-fuel based products with bioproducts will increase the
    global warming mitigation potential, was although this aspect was not considered
    in this study. 4. Conclusions The above and below-ground C stocks of a standard
    poplar SRC system under Mediterranean conditions and 12-year plantation length
    (4 rotations of 3 years each) play an active role in mitigating global warming
    from the third year of cultivation, both under optimal (17.04 Mg C ha−1 yr−1)
    and restrictive irrigation (13.28 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) regimes. This is due to the
    rapid growth rates achieved in a short period of time. Poplar SRC systems also
    have a positive impact on soils due to the high amount of C accumulated in the
    below-ground fraction (63.75 Mg ha−1 and 48.64 Mg ha−1 for T1 and T2 respectively),
    contributing to increased soil C content at the end of the plantation cycle under
    an appropriate management regime. The profitability of these plantations is affected
    by the introduction of an extra payment for C sequestration, thus diversifying
    the income from the plantation, allowing the initial investment to be recovered
    one year earlier in both irrigation regimes (T1 and T2), thus making poplar plantations
    more attractive to investors. The experimental water (irrigation) restriction
    not only had a negative impact on productivity, which, from the perspective of
    climate change mitigation, means less C sequestered, but also a notable impact
    on the profitability of our poplar plantation. However, these planting systems
    were still found to be profitable under this scheme. Wood-based products contribute
    to climate change mitigation by prolonging C storage in the anthroposphere. This
    alternative end-use of lignocellulosic biomass-based bioproducts makes SRC poplar
    plantations an even more attractive proposition as part of the development of
    the bioeconomy, adding greater value to these plantations and providing longer
    C storage capacity. This study provides concrete evidence, in environmental and
    socioeconomic terms, of the need to further our knowledge of the multifaceted
    benefits of poplar SRC systems, even under conditions of water restriction in
    the context of climate change. It is therefore crucial to address the existing
    economic and ecological uncertainties and increase awareness of the potential
    of poplar SRC systems to contribute to a low-carbon bioeconomy. CRediT authorship

    concern to identify processes that potentially cause global environmental change
    (Lambin et al. 2003; Lambin and Geist, 2008; Wood et al. 2004). This, indeed has
    been a prime focus in contemporary scientific inquiry and has been amply highlighted
    in multiple international conventions. With the advent of human civilization,
    man is constantly engaged in changing landscapes to improve the quality of his
    life (Adger et al. 2003). One of the most significant manifestations of his actions
    resulted in the development of agriculture which ensured vital provisions such
    as food, feed, fibre and medicinal products (Lambin and Meyfroidt 2010; Liu et
    al. 2010). Agriculture is the most dominant force of land transformation on the
    earth’s surface and is widely acknowledged as the biggest threat to a healthy
    environment although its products enable us all, both rural and urban dwellers
    alike to live (Xie et al. 2020; Alexandratos and Bruinsma 2012; Costanza et al.
    2013; Agyemang 2012). As such, policymakers often seek scientific information
    about the fundamental causes that need remedial action (Turner et al. 1994). However,
    agricultural land-use change is multi-faceted. The causes range from direct physical
    processes such as climate change and irrigational expansion to those related to
    socio-cultural, economic, and physiological perspectives of societies (Liu et
    al. 2010). With time, more agricultural land was brought to human use than before
    and already cultivable land is subjected to agricultural intensification to increase
    the resource use efficiency of agricultural systems (Lambin and Meyfroidt 2011).
    The agriculture cropland has witnessed an increase from ~ 3 to 4 million km2 in
    1700 AD to ~ 15 to 18 million km2 in 1990 AD (Richards 1990; Ramankutty and Foley
    1999; Goldewijk 2001). Other studies have recorded similar observational trends
    with respect to agricultural expansion (for example, Billington et al. 1996; Flint
    and Richards 1991; Mollicone et al. 2003; Lepers et al. 2005). Such drastic land
    use land cover changes have put the sustainability of the planet at stake (Himiyama
    2020). The current research focus more on the adoption of different methodological
    approaches to understand both biophysical and anthropogenic factors responsible
    for agricultural land-use changes across global regions. Identifying driving forces
    of land-use change and predicting future trends requires a strong commitment to
    methodological pluralism along with a critical interpretation of social and environmental
    data (Msofe et al. 2019; Norgaard 1989) While methods such as remote sensing provide
    information about the land-use trends, understanding underlying causes require
    multitude approach to explore complicated processes related to land resource use
    (Serra et al. 2008). As a matter of fact, the drivers of land-use change vary
    across geographical locations and therefore, it is better to analyze them at a
    micro-scale with perceivable land-use manifestations and impacts (Van et al. 2013).
    The surface of the earth is constantly being changed in order to meet the rising
    demands of human progress and existence. With the growth of farming activities,
    the Land-use land-cover (LULC) process has significantly increased, resulting
    in the destruction of natural ecosystems. Many challenges relating to the environment
    are being caused in the study region as a result of dramatic changes in LULC that
    have been seen in Kashmir Himalayas and are escalating at a significant rate as
    well (Shafiq et al. 2017; Ahmed et al. 2022). These alterations might be linked
    to factors like population expansion, modified agricultural techniques, and, specifically,
    the installation of several development projects during the preceding twenty years
    (Ahmed et al. 2022). During the last few decades, Kashmir valley too has witnessed
    land-use transformations, especially due to climate change, urbanization, and
    population growth (Fazal and Amin 2013). Land use/ land cover change in Kashmir
    valley is pervasive and is the result of combined effects of climate change and
    changing demography, affecting the hydrology thus affecting various sectors of
    the economy (Showqi et al. 2014). The haphazard and unplanned urbanization process
    in and around prime urban centers and rural-urban fringe has encroached into agricultural
    lands leading to land degradation (Naqshbandi et al. 2016; Nengroo et al. 2017).
    Population growth, urbanization, and economic viability associated with horticultural
    crops are cited as the main drivers of land use land cover changes at the catchment
    level (Malik and Bhat 2014; Ganaie et al. 2014). The underlying causes of agricultural
    land-use changes around the study area are fragmented and are associated with
    a multitude of factors ranging from climatic to psycho-related factors such as
    food preferences and farmer satisfaction (Rasool et al. 2018). In spite of the
    land-scarce environment, a considerable part of the Kashmir valley is still used
    for agricultural activities (Lone et al. 2021). However, the valley of Kashmir
    is witnessing constant agricultural land-use changes owing to changing environmental
    parameters and different developmental trajectories in the last few decades (Ahmed
    et al. 2022; Rafiq et al. 2018; Ganaie et al. 2017). This includes climate change,
    urbanization, horticultural specialization on account of profit maximization etc.
    The different land use categories for the year 2020 are shown in Fig. 1. The results
    of this research work will prove helpful for the following reasons- (1) The outcomes
    of this study will be critical in developing effective policies and interventions
    to manage and mitigate the negative impacts of land use and land cover change.
    Without an understanding of the driving forces behind these changes, it is difficult
    to develop sustainable land management strategies that balance the needs of the
    environment, society, and the economy. (2) The identification of drivers of agricultural
    land use change can help us anticipate and plan for future changes in land use
    patterns. This is particularly important given the increasing pressure on land
    resources due to factors such as population growth, urbanization, and climate
    change. (3) Furthermore, by identifying the drivers of land use and land cover
    change, we can develop strategies to promote sustainable land use practices, protect
    ecosystems and biodiversity, and enhance resilience to future changes. In short,
    the identification of drivers of land use and land cover change is critical for
    promoting sustainable development and ensuring the long-term health and well-being
    of the planet and its inhabitants. (4) Besides the outcomes of this study will
    help the different departments such as Agriculture Department, Horticulture Department,
    Department of Planning etc. for the formulation of plans and strategies linked
    to sustainable agriculture and other welfare measures for the society. The interesting
    part of the study would be how far the methodological pluralism followed in the
    study is replicated in the other regions with similar agro-ecological and socio-economic
    context. Fig. 1 Source Satellite data 2020 Location & land use/cover map of Kashmir
    valley for the year 2020. Full size image 2 Materials and methods 2.1 Mixed method
    approach and confidence reporting Drivers of agricultural land-use change are
    multi-faceted and are related to ecological and societal conditions and their
    interaction over space and time (Anwar et al. 2022; Alijani et al. 2020). Therefore,
    it is evident that a single individual method may lack appropriate methodological
    linkages to integrate qualitative and quantitative layers of data that often require
    comparison and confidence analysis (Sarfo et al. 2022; Zhai. 2020). As such, it
    becomes imperative to use multiple methods that could possibly contribute towards
    development of integrative assessment to identify evolving nature of driving forces
    of agricultural land use change through time and across spatial scales (Jiang,
    2013; Nightingale 2003; Rocheleau 1995). Following Tashakkori and Teddlie (2021)
    and Kleemann et al. (2017), this work adopted mixed-method approach comprising
    our methods with qualitative and quantitative narratives that could easily be
    compared in confidence level analysis (Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Mixed method approach and
    confidence reporting used in the study Full size image Expert interviews were
    used to gather opinion about the relevant agricultural land-use drivers and it
    proved to be similar to Delphi approach. Questionnaire survey was further conducted
    to record the level of significance through weighted average index. Finally, statistical
    model was used to incorporate field data, obtained at farm-household level, to
    determine whether there is an association between possible drivers and perceived
    land use change outcomes. The methodology related to confidence level analysis
    is plagiarised from Kleemann et al. 2017 which was based on Jacobs et al. (2015)
    and Mastrandrea et al. (2011) for the IPCC fifth assessment report and the Millennium
    Ecosystem Assessment (MA 2005). The methodology for checking the level of confidence
    of findings of expert interviews, questionnaires, statistical methods and literature
    is presented in Table 1. Table 1 Level of confidence Vs evidence Full size table
    The level of agreement is the manifestation of consistency related to findings
    by the amount of information that is found in the respective methods employed
    in the study. Similarly, level of evidence is defined by the number of methods
    providing information about the driver. Following Klenmann et al. 2017, there
    is robust evidence when all four methods provide the information, medium evidence
    if at least two methods provide information and limited evidence if only one method
    provides the conclusive information. For the authenticity and creditability of
    findings, five confidence levels of very high, high, medium, low and very low
    were employed. The catalogue of combinations between evidence levels and agreement
    has been adopted from Kleemann et al. 2017 (Table 2). Table 2 Level of agreement
    for multiple methods used in the study Full size table 2.2 Expert interviews Expert
    interview is one of the most reliable sources of obtaining information about the
    anthropogenic issues such as changing agricultural land-use dynamics (Dabović
    et al. 2021). The advantage of expert interviews lies in the fact that the information
    acquired is much broader and deeper than the other research procedures and importantly,
    opinions are taken from respondents whose competence can’t be questioned. However,
    the process of expert selection is the most crucial factor (Gordon 1994; Yousuf
    2007) and the outcome is as good as the quality of the expert itself. Importantly,
    the determination of a required number of experts to be taken for the present
    study and their right choice was most tedious. The extensive literature survey
    explicitly demonstrated that the best outcomes are achieved when the number of
    experts is limited to 15–16 as has been the case with numerous expert surveys
    such as brainstorming or the Delphi technique (Kuo and chen, 2008). Coming to
    the identification of the experts, it was a pre-requisite that they are affiliated
    to different scientific or research institutions and have tremendous understanding
    of agricultural land-use dynamics in and around the Kashmir valley. The multidisciplinary
    character of the topic necessitated the selection of specialists from fields ranging
    from pure agricultural sciences to economics and sociology. To add more relevance
    and creditability of expert interviews, agricultural operators were also included
    to achieve a balanced group and increasingly permit flow of direct field knowledge
    in the identification of agricultural land-use drivers. Interviews were completely
    recorded using electrical devices and later on translated into the text. The text
    analysis was based on the ground theory (Glaser and Strauss 2017) where each text
    segment is combined to form a specific view point. 2.3 Questionnaire method A
    total of 31 potential agricultural land use drivers were identified through interviews
    and literature review method. They were subsequently classified under two main
    categories i.e., direct and indirect drivers and incorporated into Likert-scale
    questionnaire to quantify the significance of each driving force associated with
    agricultural land-use change in the research area. The 5-point Likert scale was
    used with anchors ranging from very strong influence (5) to no influence (1).
    The questionnaire was sent by e-mail to all the respondents. To ensure reliability
    and consistency of the results, Cronbach’s alpha was employed to check the authenticity
    of the data obtained. The Cronbach’s alpha of 0.70 was used as a critical value
    of proper reliability of the questionnaire (Taber 2018; Tavakol and Dennick 2011).
    2.4 Literature review method A priori information was needed to have a general
    understanding about the processes that drive agricultural land-use change in the
    valley. This, indeed, required a broader investigation into the external and internal
    forces that integrate to influence the land resource use. In this regard academic
    databases and search engines such as Science direct, Google scholar, Scirus, Mendeley,
    Sci-hub, Scholar one, Web of science, Scopus as well as cross references of the
    cited papers. Agricultural drivers, land use, causes of land-use, spatial driver
    component, mixed method approach, and modelling of land-use were keywords used
    for browsing. Inclusion criteria focused only on studies published between 2000
    and 2020 that were undertaken around the study area. However, the studies related
    to agricultural driver component in the Kashmir valley are rarely available. Furthermore,
    the publications were either concerned with the magnitude of land-use and land
    cover changes in the valley or dealing with a specific driver component. The lack
    of studies related to agricultural driver component in the study area prompted
    to include few studies from global perspective that were critical for comprehensive
    understanding of external forces that drive land use/land cover changes. The authors
    have adopted different methodological approaches to arrive at conclusion and draw
    suitable inferences. 2.5 Multi-nominal regression model While examining agricultural
    land-use changes in mountainous landscapes such as those of South Kashmir, the
    generation and analysis of spatial data at farm-household level is vital for comprehensive
    understanding of underlying factors that affect agricultural land-use dynamics.
    Therefore, it was important to generate the spatial data from the field to incorporate
    ground realities in the driver analysis. This resulted in a field survey in which
    120 farmers were administered through structured questionnaire, with an aim to
    explore association between the derived spatial driver data and agricultural land
    use change outcome using multi-nominal regression model. Multinomial regression
    is a type of statistical model used to analyze the relationships between multiple
    categorical independent variables and a categorical dependent variable with three
    or more categories. It is a type of logistic regression that is used when the
    dependent variable is not binary. The model estimates the probability of each
    category of the dependent variable based on the values of the independent variables.
    Although, elasticity coefficients are easily derived from multi-nominal regression
    model, but these results are hard to interpret. Therefore, we convert coefficients
    into Odds ratios for their easily interpretation. Odds ratio (OR) values of more
    than 1 represents the positive effect while as value of less than 1 represents
    the negative effect provided that the odds ratio is statistically significant.
    A p-value of 0.1 was used to consider a statistically significant level of association.
    As a matter of fact, that most of the spatial variables represented the demographic
    characteristics of sampled farmers, it was, therefore, necessary to check problem
    of co-linearity among them prior to performing the multi nominal regression model.
    Pearson’s correlation and variance inflation factor (VIF) to calculate correlation
    between the spatial explanatory variables, and used rule of thumb to eliminate
    those spatial explanatory variables whose correlation was more than 0.70 or VIF
    greater than 1.0. To analyze the drivers of each land use outcome, we performed
    our analysis in SPSS 16.0 and developed multinomial logit regressions. The multinomial
    model estimates the probability of each land-use outcome from a given base land
    use. The general form of model equation follows: $$\\varvec{f}\\left(\\varvec{k},\\varvec{i}\\right)={\\varvec{B}}_{0,\\varvec{k}}+
    {\\varvec{B}}_{1,{\\varvec{k}}^{\\varvec{X}}\\varvec{k}}+\\dots + {\\varvec{B}}_{\\varvec{m},{\\varvec{k}}^{\\varvec{X}}\\varvec{k}}+
    {\\varvec{e}}_{\\varvec{i}}$$ Where \\(\\varvec{f}\\left(\\varvec{k},\\varvec{i}\\right)\\)
    is the predicted probability that observation i has the outcome k, \\({\\varvec{B}}_{0,\\varvec{k}}\\)
    is an outcome-specific intercept, \\({\\varvec{B}}_{1,{\\varvec{k}}^{\\varvec{X}}\\varvec{k}}+\\dots
    + {\\varvec{B}}_{\\varvec{m},{\\varvec{k}}^{\\varvec{X}}\\varvec{k}}\\) the effect
    of coefficient of independent variable B1to Bm, and ei is an observation specific
    error term. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Linking drivers of agricultural land-use
    classes using multi-nominal regression model Table 3 presents the statistic estimating
    the magnitude of association between the independent variables on the agricultural
    land-use classes, where odds ratios (ORs) with 90% level of confidence are used
    to measure the effects. Multi-collinearity was checked using a correlation and
    variance inflation factor (VIF). Table 3 Statistical relationship between agricultural
    land use and other variables Full size table Agricultural land use conversions
    from paddy to apple, agricultural land to built-up and almond/saffron/maize to
    apple are taken as a reference category with respect to land use change outcome.
    The results reveal that variables such as improved irrigational facilities, land
    holding size, temperature variability, rainfall variability, extreme weather events,
    economic viability, population growth, credit availability, access to information,
    family labour, road connectivity, governing laws are the main drivers that significantly
    affect paddy conversion to apple orchards although with varying levels of confidence.
    The p-values for most of the variables were found to be much lesser than 0.05,
    meaning the effect of these variables is effectively pronounced. Importantly,
    odds ratios for most cases were greater than 1, signifying positive effect of
    selected drivers in the model. Rest of the factors were found statistically insignificant
    and cannot be further commented upon. The phenomenal increase of apple plantation
    at the expense of food grain crops in the entire physiographic realms of Kashmir
    Valley is a major concern that deserves a rational debate in the context of changing
    socio-ecological parameters. Paddy to apple conversion is driven by both internal
    as well as external factors. Currently, farmers in the valley have shifted their
    mind-set towards more remunerative crops which reducing area under paddy (Ganaie
    et al. 2014). The inclination towards cash crops such as apple is directed to
    achieve two essential objectives called double benefits. This includes creation
    of alternative source of income and allocating land to best economical use to
    fetch higher dividends. Ideally, the drier climatic regime since 1990’s in the
    entire Kashmir valley have prompted farmers to implement self-adopted adaptations
    to adjust their agricultural land use to changing climate and apple plantation
    has been the most effective land-use response (Lone et al. 2020). As a matter
    of fact, apple orchards incur huge initial and establishment costs and therefore,
    financial position of a farmer largely determines paddy conversion to apple plantation
    and as such, the positive and significant odds ratio for family income is justified.
    The increasing apple plantation is also positively correlated with land-holding
    size since large holdings are more viable than smaller ones. With shrinking land
    availability for individual households, the viability of farm lands gets affected
    and this may be linked to negative Odds for land-holding size factor to built-up.
    Generally, the study area experienced a trend towards “more apple trees fetch
    more income”. These coping strategies are very vital to understand in the context
    of smallholder farming and indeed, have been practiced in other parts of world
    with more or less similar ecological and socio-economic scenario (Kassa et al.
    2017; Kindu et al. 2015; Berihun et al. 2019). The absence of any consolidated
    land use policy has also played a vital role in speeding the already unabated
    apple plantation expansion in the valley. The agricultural and technological advance
    like credit availability, road connectivity, access to information, and extension
    services have also positively contributed towards intensification of respective
    agricultural land use trend. Coming to the agricultural land conversion to built-up,
    land holding size, income and population growth were found statistically significant
    at p < 0.01. 3.2 Results of expert interviews and literature review Expert interviews
    Expert interviews confirm that population growth is an important driver of agricultural
    land use change. The impact of population growth is direct on the available land
    resources with varied significance. In fact, experts opine that unprecedented
    growth in population has cornered agriculture immensely and induced dichotomous
    ramifications on the available cultivable land in the study area. On the one hand,
    the most precious land especially in flood plains has been permanently lost to
    accommodate growing population and on the other, there is ever-increasing pressure
    on the shrinking agricultural land to support increasing population. One of the
    disastrous effects, according to experts, has been decreasing land holdings which
    has reduced to mere 0.62 ha/household, affecting the economic viability of agricultural
    operations and food security. The expert opinion corroborates with the government
    data which clearly indicates decreasing land holding size responsible for non-viability
    of farm lands in Kashmir valley. This situation is precarious in entire Himalayan
    states of India, which often have led abandonment of farm lands, farmers out-migration,
    ghost villages, pursuing off-farm activities etc. Coming to other direct drivers,
    both urban sprawl and road connectivity have gained notoriety of being significant
    drivers of land-use change and has been accepted by 75% and 68.75% experts respectively.
    Surprisingly, agricultural intensification as a driver was backed by only 56.25%
    experts that seemingly appear bit unexpected (Table 4). In the physical category
    of direct drivers, pedagogical factors were not found to be more consistent as
    soil fertility and soil type were agreed only by 31.25% and 50% experts. The experts
    argued that farmers allocate their cultivable land on the basis of landform characteristics
    and therefore, often lack information about the physico-chemical parameters of
    soil. However, among climatic category, all the variables were highly agreed as
    direct causes of ALUC (Agriculture land use change). Nevertheless, climate change
    implications on LULC changes were confirmed by numerous studies conducted on Himalayan
    agriculture. It is believed that climate change provided inertia to ALUC in the
    region during 1990’s which later on were driven and intensified by economic forces
    especially profit maximization. Implicitly the influence of driving forces change
    over time and their impact illustrates that they are more responsive to the local
    context changes. Physiographical or more topographical features were found to
    be highly consistent as 62.50% experts agreed that Agri-horticultural systems
    in the Valley have evolved on the basis of landform characteristics. According
    to one of the experts “karewa means apple and Almond, Foothill means maize and
    walnut, and Floodplain means rice and vegetables”. In context of indirect drivers,
    demographic characteristics like farm experience and age were accepted by more
    than 81% experts as underlying determinants of agricultural land-use change. The
    higher agreement among the experts can be justified by the fact that since a farmer
    is central to land-use decisions, his/her characteristics are more likely to determine
    the rationale, direction, and magnitude of land use change pattern. Level of education
    and labour force was, however, were considered as moderate drivers. This may be
    partly justified that economic forces in the region are strong enough to negate
    the influence of education and other demographic attributes on land use decision.
    Table 4 Agricultural Drivers in the Study Area Full size table Land holding size,
    again is found to be highly consistent on account of its landscape significance
    and its alteration in spatio-temporal context changes the land availability equation
    for competing food grain and cash crops. Number of operational land holdings adds
    multiple options of land allocation and therefore, increase the likelihood of
    land-use change. Technological factors were moderately agreed except science and
    research. Lack of institution strength to implement public policies impedes effective
    use of technology adoption and agricultural innovations. Literature review The
    literature review suggested population growth as a primary cause of agricultural
    land use changes in the region. Alam et al. (2020) and Ahmed et al. (2022) see
    a correlation between population and urbanization process and underpinned that
    population growth often absorbs the most fertile agricultural land such as river
    valleys and plains. However, urbanization was mentioned by only five authors as
    most of the research publications were focusing on particular subject matter.
    Nevertheless, literature suggests that built-up, population growth and urbanization
    have clear links with rising food security problem as domestic food production
    has offset considerably in the recent past. Showqi et al. (2014) signifies land-use
    change as a result of complex relationship between the hydrological variables
    and changing demographic characteristics at the watershed scale. The climatic
    related indicators like temperature variability (71.43%), rainfall variability
    (78.57%), and extreme weather events (64.29%) were considered important bio-physical
    drivers with high agreement. Coming to the direct infrastructural variables, both
    improved irrigational facilities and road connectivity were considered with moderate
    agreement. Topographical characteristics were considered with moderate agreement
    (31.25%), although authors such as Najmuddin et al. (2017) and Palchowdhuri and
    Roy (2018) highlighted the landform characteristics as potential determinants
    of agricultural land-use. Each crop has its unique set of requirements that a
    land unit must inherent to support crop growth and development (Prakash 2003).
    Demographic characteristics of farmers like Age, farm experience, and family labour
    were considered with medium agreement (28.8%) while political factors such as
    agricultural schemes, agricultural subsidies, and governing laws were agreed by
    only 21.43% authors. Barring number of operational land holding, more nuanced
    demographic attributes like level of education and land holding size were considered
    important drivers of ALUC in the study area. Similar results were found for indirect
    economic drivers that include income, economic viability and agricultural marketing.
    This confirms that the economic forces are at large in the study area and often
    determine the land use decisions. Most of the authors support the view that farmers
    at household level have shifted from their customary crops to cash crops as part
    of the self-adaptation strategy to combat climate change and adjust their farming
    systems to changing socio-economic conditions of the study area. The role of technological
    factors in land-use decisions like access to information, extension services,
    credit availability, and science and research were considered with moderate agreement
    (28.8-35.71%). Despite this, technological interventions in agriculture are seen
    as a breakthrough that has reoriented traditional agriculture into a commercial
    one. Access to credit is still a moderate limiting factor and if monetary flow
    is directed towards small-farmers, changes in land-use may be drastic and most
    probably market-oriented. Similarly, the effect of extension services has been
    availed by more influential and educated farmers only. 3.3 Relevance of drivers
    in agricultural land-use change Table 5 contains the results of questionnaire
    method that employed Likert scale to capture relevance of proximate and underlying
    drivers of agricultural land use changes in the research area. Based on the analysis
    of driver perception score and mean driver index, population growth, temperature
    variability, rainfall variability, extreme weather events, land holding size,
    farm experience, economic viability, income and extension services are the top
    most influential factors in determining agricultural land use changes. Again,
    location specific factors like land holding size, farm experience and income were
    perceived as significant to extremely significant by all the respondents. The
    climatic change driven factors were also found relevant and are manifested in
    their mean diver index of above 2.50. The edaphic factors seem to be less relevant
    and the findings are not consistent enough to support higher levels of agreement.
    The findings for technological factors, except extension servicers, indicate moderate
    agreement. The use of Likert questionnaire provides an impression that the relevance
    of location specific factors is critical in the determination of land resource
    decisions at farm-scale and their identification becomes a necessity in the context
    agricultural land resource management and planning. Moreover, quantifying farmer
    perceptions will go a long way in understanding the intensity of causal chain
    between drivers and agricultural land use decisions in the region. Table 5 Relationship
    between Drivers of Agricultural Land use Change & Other Factors Full size table
    The Mixed method approach clearly identified population growth as a most significant
    anthropogenic driver of ALUC with very high level of confidence (Table 5). Each
    method contributed enough evidences for population growth in terms of its relevance,
    magnitude, and consequences in agricultural land use decisions. In fact, population
    growth was seen as a factor that has a direct link with urbanization, and land
    holding size. Among the bio-physical drivers, the findings for climatic variables
    and extreme weather events were consistent within each method and literature confirms
    that change in climate tends to be very sensitive parameter for different crops
    in Kashmir valley due to its proneness to socio-ecological vulnerabilities. One
    of the findings emerging from literature expressed that changing climate have
    enhanced horticultural suitability of mountains and hills in Kashmir valley. In
    nutshell, the effects of climate change, and land use/land cover are reciprocal.
    The mixed-method approach does not recognize soil type and soil fertility as most
    important drivers of agricultural land-use. Improved irrigational facilities and
    road connectivity were considered with very high confidence level. Improved irrigational
    facilities meant more land suitable for cultivation for crops while road connectivity
    enhances market accessibility. Expert opinion considers road connectivity along
    with market orientation of farming as a factor that has enhanced farmer’s interface
    with market functions. Improved crop varieties were accepted with medium level
    of confidence. The field data analysis and questionnaire method didn’t provide
    any substantial support and therefore, this becomes evident that factors like
    these have to do more with the food and livelihood security than driving the ALUC
    in the study area. Among the location specific factors, land holding size was
    approved by each method with higher degree of agreement and confidence (Table
    6). The discordance of literature review for land holding size was due to the
    fact that it was not the subject matter of many research publications. However,
    multinomial logistic regression model correlates it with land-use changes from
    paddy to apple, agricultural land to built-up, and almond/saffron to apple with
    high level of significance (p < 0.001). The direct field data obtained from farmers
    at household level adds empirical evidences that land holding size is increasingly
    proving to be central to land use change in the region. Similarly, farm experience
    bears very high level of confidence in the mixed-method approach. However, Odds
    ratio of < 1 for age factor of farmers in one of the agricultural land-use conversion
    classes contradicts the above assumption. Nevertheless, we have fragmented evidences
    for age of farmers and thus, the creditability of this demographic variable as
    a driver of change is questioned. We also have limited evidence for level of education
    and this qualifies them under low agreement of confidence. Regarding family labour
    at least three methods provided evidence. Table 6 Comparison of various methods
    of agricultural land use change drivers in Kashmir Valley Full size table The
    issue of economic viability has up-scaled economy into apple farming and there
    are consistent results from each method that label it as a primary cause of horticultural
    expansion in the region with very high level of confidence. The Odds ratio positively
    correlates it with precision farming where commercial crops are more prioritized
    under changing climate and socio-economic possibilities. Experts with social science
    and economics background opined that poverty in the past used to be measured in
    terms of food security but now it is defined with respect to overall economic
    well-being of a farmer. However, opting for lucrative agricultural enterprise
    needs financial support and therefore, farmers with better family income are more
    likely to invest in crop diversification. The table depicting level of confidence
    indicates very high score for family income as both qualitative and quantitative
    data analysis support robust evidence with higher degree of agreement for the
    family income in driving agricultural land-use systems. Multi-nominal regression
    model doesn’t recognize any significant correlation between agricultural marketing
    and consequent agricultural land-use conversion outcomes. The relevance of Likert
    questionnaire for agricultural marketing indicated moderate consistency while
    expert opinion regarded it as an effective innovation tool used by new age farmers
    to commercialize their agricultural produce. In other words, experts underpinned
    that farmers are now aware about the market prices of each agri-horticultural
    commodity and their fluctuations over time. This facilitates them in “what to
    produce” and “how much to produce?”. Among the indirect technological drivers,
    extension services were viewed with moderate agreement by expert and literature
    method. The results for other indirect technological drivers indicate medium level
    of confidence. Although, interviewed experts mentioned access to information with
    high agreement but empirical evidences from field data and other methods didn’t
    substantiate them to high agreement. Credit availability, and science and research
    were characterized by mix of results which consequently assigned them under moderate
    score. One of the unexpected outcomes of the present study was associated with
    indirect political drivers which were characterized by low level of confidence.
    In the wake of the climate change, it was anticipated by the government that the
    whole Himalayan states might face food grain shortage and in response various
    schemes like Public Distribution System, Mahatma Gandhi National and Rural Employment
    Guarantee Act MGNREGA, and Integrated Child development Scheme (ICDS) were introduced
    from time to time to enhance carrying capacity and resilience of smallholder farmers
    in the region. This significantly reduced agro-biodiversity of the region and
    induced changes towards commercialization of fruit growing crops. The use of field
    data indicates association of agricultural land use conversion to paddy with p < 0.05.
    However, it was found statistically insignificant with the other land use outcomes.
    It would be interesting to explore the association of Government schemes/subsidies
    on agricultural land use conversions at large representative samples. 4 Conclusion
    The mixed-method approach adopts methodological pluralism to comprehend drivers
    of change in agricultural land use systems in the valley of Kashmir. The internal
    design of the methodological set-up fills the lacuna associated with a particular
    method that needs to be addressed while reaching a consensus. For example, the
    application of multinomial logistic regression method didn’t have the provision
    of including every anticipated spatial variable in the driver analysis. However,
    this was compensated by the use of expert survey which enables us to fill the
    data gaps. Similarly, the expert survey provided only qualitative assessment of
    the driver analysis which was ultimately substantiated by the quantitative analysis
    of the field data by the use of multi-nominal logistic regression model. All the
    methods point out the agricultural transformation on account of economic and other
    considerations, urban sprawl and road connectivity as the major drivers of agricultural
    land use in the study area. Besides, the soil properties, technological changes,
    climatic variations etc. also impact the land use change. The factors leading
    to the drastic change in land use must be checked to save agricultural land for
    sustainable agriculture in the region. Overall, the use of multiple methods brought
    condensed yet transparent analysis of spatial drivers that explored the various
    horizons of physical and socio-economic dimensions. The confidence table further
    adds reliability to our results and there is additional need to assess drivers
    with moderate to low confidence level score. Data availability This manuscript

  description: Irrigation is widely considered a potential means to improve agricultural
    productivity, nutrition, and income, as farmers can carry out farming and production
    year-round. However, the feasibility of irrigation technologies is highly dependent
    on the long-term economic return farmers achieve. Solar-based irrigation could
    address the challenges of underinvestment in irrigation within Africa. Evidence
    on the economic viability of the adopted solar pumps such as MajiPump is very
    scant and focused on ex post evaluation. This study evaluated the income and nutritional
    feasibility of solar-powered irrigation using the MajiPump in sub-humid Ethiopian
    highlands using the farm simulation (FARMSIM) model and compared it with the manual
    pulley system. Results from the FARMSIM model show that farmers’ adoption of Maji
    solar pump technology to grow vegetables is economically feasible with financial
    support such as credit or loan for initial and capital investment to acquire the
    pump. The average profit under the solar MajiPump, drip irrigation, and conservation
    agriculture was 3.6 times higher than that of the baseline scenario. While the
    pulley technology provides the same amount of irrigation water to grow vegetables,
    its feasibility is limited due to high labor costs and time, estimated to be more
    than seven times the baseline. The simulation results show that the alternative
    scenarios’ nutrition level has improved relative to other scenarios and met the
    minimum daily average nutrition requirement level for proteins, iron, and vitamin
    A but fell short in fat, calcium, and calories. The results suggest that farmers
    who adopt improved small-scale irrigation technologies (solar MajiPump and drip
    system) have a higher potential to increase production and income from irrigated
    crops and improve their nutrition if part of the income generated is used to purchase
    supplemental food for their nutrition.

    food security in recent years, the number of people affected by food insecurity
    increased when conflicts and pandemics rose [1]. The reasons for this include
    the agricultural industry being traditionally subsistent and rainfed, suffering
    from rainfall variability and frequent drought [2,3]. Consequently, crop failures
    are unavoidable, and food shortage often turns into food insecurity, affecting
    the livelihoods of many farmers, especially in Africa [4,5]. With such complexities,
    donors and researchers advocate expanding irrigation and agriculture technologies
    to produce more foods to increase income and nutrition. If sustainably intensified,
    agriculture in Africa could significantly contribute to food and nutritional security
    and play an indispensable role in building a healthy society [6]. By 2030, the
    projection of this food insecurity could likely decrease from 35% to 22% for sub-Saharan
    Africa, assuming the production continues to improve [7]. One approach is the
    expansion of small-scale irrigation with nutrition-sensitive crop production,
    which has been regarded as a promising approach to ensuring food and livelihood
    security under climate change and population growth [6,8]. Various studies, such
    as Xie et al. [9] and Passarelli et al. [10], indicated that small-scale irrigation
    could boost crop yield and income benefits by at least 50%, where most of the
    income goes to smallholders. Water availability for irrigation is, however, a
    limiting factor in Africa, and only 6% of all agricultural land is under irrigation
    [11]. Similarly, in Ethiopia, only about 4 to 5% of the potential arable land
    is under irrigation, while over 6 million hectares are suitable for irrigation
    [3]. The primary causes for the limited national irrigation coverage include a
    lack of water storage, inadequate conveyance structures, limited access to technology,
    a limited energy source to pump water, limited options for gravity-fed systems,
    and fewer enabling settings for credit and finance. [3,12]. Moreover, surface
    water is usually considered the major source of existing irrigation systems in
    Africa. Still, these sources need lots of investment [13], and are affected easily
    by climate and other changes that lead to low flow during the dry period [14]
    and water quality degradation. Worqlul et al. [3] and Gowing et al. [15] indicated
    that groundwater could be an alternative freshwater source for irrigation; however,
    groundwater use is mostly limited to the domestic water supply. The restricted
    use of groundwater for irrigation is due to technology constraints, which entail
    new development, operational costs (including energy), and a lack of understanding
    of the resource dynamics [15]. Recent studies have shown a reasonable amount of
    groundwater storage in Ethiopia that can be used for irrigated agriculture [16].
    Tilahun et al. [17] showed shallow groundwater’s potential to increase food security
    at least during the first three months in a sloping aquifer. However, this can
    extend to 6 to 8 months in valley bottom aquifers. To tap this potential from
    shallow groundwater and benefit farmers, access to efficient and cost-effective
    water-lifting technology is a major enabling factor [18]. As access to electricity
    appears less available for the rural community [19], manual and fuel-based water-lifting
    technologies are preferred by smallholder farmers. Limited access to fuel, high
    operation (fuel), and maintenance costs are becoming barriers to the use of motor
    pumps (diesel or petrol), in addition to their adverse effect on the environment
    [18]. On the other hand, using manual technologies such as pulley or rope and
    washer water-lifting technologies for irrigation from shallow groundwater sources
    is labor-intensive, putting more burdens on women and children [20,21]. The labor
    productivity of such technologies is also low [22]. Thus, high production costs
    may reduce the margin of farmers’ benefit. Several studies suggested using solar-powered
    pumps as an alternative and sustainable irrigation technology, increasing labor
    and water productivity and environmental sustainability [23,24]. However, few
    scientific studies have evaluated the economic, nutritional, and technical feasibility
    and environmental sustainability of solar pumps or other water-lifting technologies
    in Ethiopia [25,26,27]. The utilization of solar pumps for irrigation presents
    a range of potential environmental impacts, offering both positive and negative
    consequences. On the positive side, these pumps significantly enhance water use
    efficiency in agricultural practices [28]. By harnessing renewable solar energy,
    they minimize reliance on fossil fuels, reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated
    with traditional fuel-based pumps [24]. However, if not managed sustainably, an
    increased dependency on groundwater for irrigation poses the risk of more groundwater
    use and depletion [9,24]. Over-extraction of groundwater for irrigation purposes
    could lead to a decline in the water table, potentially resulting in long-term
    environmental and socio-economic implications. Furthermore, the use of solar pumps
    may exacerbate soil salinity concerns. Hence, while solar pumps offer a renewable
    and environmentally friendly alternative, their implementation requires careful
    management with temporal variability and spatial availability information to mitigate
    adverse environmental effects. Risk and uncertainty in agricultural enterprises
    must be accounted for in a comprehensive economic and nutritional analysis of
    water-lifting technologies. Schmitter et al. [28] found high profits related to
    solar pumps for irrigation. In contrast, Bizimana and Richardson [29] found lower
    benefits from the solar pump than the pulley and motor pumps due to higher initial
    investment costs and low flow rates. For nutritional benefits, both studies have
    shown a positive effect on household nutrition and food security. Thus, a comprehensive
    potential evaluation of solar pumps’ economic and nutritional benefits is required
    to promote their extensive adoption in Ethiopia. This study focuses on the new
    solar MajiPump as a case study in Ethiopia. MajiPump is a submersible photovoltaic
    solar pump that lifts water from ponds and shallow groundwater wells. The pump
    is powered by direct solar power generated from a 24-volt, 200-watt monocrystalline
    solar panel and delivered to its brushless DC motor via an electric cable. The
    open flow capacity of the pump is 36 L per minute. The pumping system comprises
    only three major components: a solar panel, a float switch connected to the pump,
    and a solar MajiPump. As a result of these design features and fewer parts, the
    operation is simple and almost maintenance-free. Because there is no battery,
    the pumping system costs will be less, and it becomes environmentally friendly
    since there is no disposal of battery chemicals. During the sunshine hour, the
    pump will pump and store water in a water tank lifted 1.5 m from the ground to
    create a head for the irrigation system. Assefa et al. [30] evaluated the water-lifting
    and discharge capacity of the MajiPump under different environmental and agroecological
    conditions. They worked well with a maximum of 19 m depth of water level for the
    shallow groundwater. Unlike prior research, this study seeks to comprehensively
    assess the economic and nutritional advantages of applying solar pumps with drip
    and conservation agriculture, particularly within its use in irrigation for vegetable
    farming. While previous studies have examined aspects of general water-lifting
    technologies, including solar pumps, little existing research in the literature
    specifically delves into a comprehensive evaluation of a specific solar pump when
    integrated with conservation agriculture and drip system for their economic and
    nutritional benefits. Therefore, the main aim of this study is to evaluate the
    impacts of adopting agricultural technologies, mainly the solar MajiPump, drip
    irrigation system, and conservation agriculture practice, to grow irrigated vegetables
    on household nutrition and farm profitability in Dengeshita, Ethiopia. It addresses
    a notable research gap and advocates for the widespread adoption of sustainable
    agricultural practices in developing nations, taking these cases from Ethiopia.
    2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Study Area The experimental study was conducted
    in the northern Ethiopia highland sub-humid area, mainly in one of the three small-scale
    irrigation intervention sites from the Appropriate Scale Mechanization Consortium
    (ASMC) of the Sustainable Intensification Innovation Lab of Feed the Future program.
    The three sites were Dengeshita (36.85° E, 11.32° N), Affesa (36.83° E, 11.25°
    N), and Alefa (37.06° E, 10.62° N) kebeles. These kebeles are the intervention
    areas to pilot the solar MajiPump irrigation technology in Amhara regional state,
    Ethiopia (Figure 1). For this study, we selected Dengeshita, which had both the
    solar Maji pump and pulley water-lifting technologies interventions. The 57 km2
    Dengishta kebele or village is located within the Blue Nile Basin of the Lake
    Tana area and drains to the Gilgel Abay River. The mean annual rainfall is 1745
    mm, with 90% from May to October. The elevation of the site ranges from 2036 to
    2400 m. The shallow groundwater has a potential of dry period irrigation with
    a 20% of annual rainfall being a recharge [31]. Figure 1. Study sites in the sub-humid
    Ethiopia (top left), Lake Tana watershed with the lake (bottom left) and Dengeshita
    watershed (right). The predominant farming system in the study region is crop–livestock
    farming, with rainfed production covering 65 percent and irrigation covering only
    1 percent. Thirty-two percent (32%) of the watershed is covered by grassland and
    eucalyptus trees. Farm households’ livelihood relies on producing cereals and
    high-value cash crops in rainy and dry seasons. The dominant rainfed crops are
    maize, millets, barley, wheat, and teff [30], whereas onion, garlic, potato, cabbage,
    pepper, tomato, and potato are the dominant irrigated vegetables [32] during the
    dry period from October to May. Most farm households raise cattle, small ruminants,
    apiculture, and poultry. Livestock is raised to meet draught power requirements,
    produce milk, and breed replacement to generate income. The areas are endowed
    with shallow groundwater wells and open surface water (i.e., rivers) that offer
    an opportunity for irrigation if small-scale irrigation technologies such as mechanical
    or solar-powered pumps and water application systems are adopted in the region.
    Fertilizer use in Dengeshita was documented during an assessment survey in 2017
    by the Bahir Dar University in collaboration with Feed the Future Innovation Lab
    for Small-Scale Irrigation (ILSSI). Rainfed crops are fertilized in divided doses
    using di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), urea, and organic compost fertilizers. The
    first application consisting of DAP and compost occurred when crops were planted
    at the beginning of the rainy season in May or early June. The second application
    of urea was in July. The average applied P fertilizers from all sources was 27.4
    kg P ha−1, and N fertilizer was 76 kg N ha−1. 2.2. Data Collection In the first
    stage, the Dangila district was selected purposely based on the existence of irrigation
    technology. In the second stage, information from the agricultural office of the
    selected district was used to select one kebele (small unit of administration
    unit under a district). The kebele is called Dengeshita, located 80 km south of
    Bahir Dar. The watershed (Figure 1) is also named after the kebele name. Ten farmers
    with solar photovoltaic MajiPump technology and drip irrigation adopters were
    applying small-scale irrigation in this kebele. Finally, a proportional random
    sampling technique was employed to select 50 representative farm households not
    using the solar Majipump and drip technology. The primary data were collected
    through field experiments from 10 treated (MajiPump technology adopter) farm households
    among 60 farm households surveyed in Dengeshita. The survey was conducted in February
    2019 to obtain data on agricultural inputs, agricultural productions, and socio-economic
    conditions of households as part of the ASMC program. Primary data for both baseline
    and alternative scenarios (use of solar MajiPump and pulley technologies) input
    were collected from 60 selected farm households. The primary data on farm input
    information relating to crop, livestock, liability, investment in solar photovoltaic
    MajiPump water-lifting technology, input use, yield, price of inputs and products,
    crop pattern, and operating cost were drawn from the selected representative farm
    households in February 2020. A summary of inputs and technology procurement costs
    and crop of production for Dengeshita is found in Appendix A. The baseline input
    information was complemented by a household survey collected by IFPRI in 2017
    under the ILSSI project. The results from this survey show that about 15% of plots
    surveyed are irrigated, 6% of households obtain water using a diesel pump, and
    80% use a hand bucket and hose. In this study, secondary data from governmental
    and non-governmental organizations and expert opinion were considered for historical
    data, mainly for the price of inputs and outputs. The price of the agricultural
    product was the farmgate price that the farmer sold their product to the first
    economic agent. The market value of crops produced by farmers using command technology
    was used to calculate the benefit. Official interest rate and the discount rate
    from the national bank of Ethiopia were used for calculating interest cost and
    discounting factor. 2.3. Modelling Methods and Procedures 2.3.1. FARMSIM Model
    Description FARMSIM is a Monte Carlo farm-level simulation model that concurrently
    evaluates a baseline and an alternative technology for a farm. The model is programmed
    in Microsoft® Excel and uses the Simetar add-in program to include risk and estimate
    parameters for price and yield distributions, simulate random variables, estimate
    probability distributions for key output variables (KOVs), and rank technologies
    [29]. FARMSIM is set up to recursively simulate a five-year planning horizon for
    a varied agricultural and livestock farm, repeating the simulation for 500 iterations.
    To simulate each loop, a new sample of random values is drawn. The resultant simulated
    values for each KOV define the empirical probability distributions for the baseline
    and alternative farming scenarios. The probability distributions for the baseline
    and alternative technologies are compared so that the decision-makers can graphically
    understand the likely consequences of implementing alternative technologies. The
    FARMSIM model has four major components: crop, livestock, nutritional, and financial.
    The model predicts the production and consumption of up to 15 crops based on locally
    produced and consumed crops. The model estimates annual productivity and herd
    dynamics across a five-year planning horizon for cattle, oxen, chickens, sheep,
    goats, and swine. The livestock section, particularly the cattle group, is extremely
    thorough. It considers the various age and gender cohorts along the value chain.
    It evaluates animal and animal source product output, consumption, and sale due
    to improved animal production methods. To account for risk, the model simulates
    yield parameter distribution and stochastic price, estimates key output variables
    (KOVs) distribution over five years, and ranks alternative technologies [29].
    The FARMSIM model compares simulated values of KOVs of alternative scenarios technology
    or intervention with the baseline scenario to assess the technology’s possible
    economic and nutritional impacts (e.g., solar MajiPump). FARMSIM uses similar
    equations to model the baseline and alternative farming technology scenarios;
    the variation in the outcome (e.g., profit, family income, and nutrition) is exclusively
    attributable to technology and their anticipated yield distributions. 2.3.2. Economic
    Analysis Over the five-year time horizon, economic analysis of FARMSIM model results
    focuses on key output variables (KOVs) such as annual net cash farm income (or
    profit), benefit–cost ratio (BCR), internal rate of return on investment (IRR),
    and net present value (NPV) of technology. Revenue and costs are separately computed
    to estimate the net economic benefit or net cash farm income (NCFI). Revenue was
    calculated as a product of farm products (crop and livestock) and their corresponding
    market price. Then, total costs were estimated as a composite of variable and
    fixed costs. These costs comprise costs of input such as labor, fertilizer, chemical,
    weeding, land preparation, harvesting, irrigation, and other costs. The net present
    value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and benefit–cost ratio (BCR) are the
    major metrics used to evaluate the profitability of SSI technologies that require
    capital investment in the form of water pumping equipment (solar MajiPump), irrigation
    tools, and water storage facilities. The difference between the discounted value
    of farm benefits and cost over five years was used to calculate the net present
    value at the farm household level. The IRR is the discount rate that results in
    a zero NPV. If the IRR of a project surpasses the cost of capital (i.e., the return
    on capital invested elsewhere), it is accepted. The project is not advised if
    the IRR is less than the cost of capital. The BCR is the ratio of the present
    value of the benefits to the present value of the costs. If this ratio is greater
    than one, the project is recommended. 2.3.3. Nutrition Analysis The nutrition
    study assesses changes in nutrition self-sufficiency in daily calorie, vitamin
    A, protein, iron, calcium, and fat consumption. It compares them to the daily
    minimum need per adult equivalent to identify nutrient shortfall or surplus [29].
    Total calories, protein, fat, calcium, iron, and vitamin A available to the farm
    family were computed by multiplying the total kilogram of produced and purchased
    crops for consumption and donated food by their respective nutrient weight. Similarly,
    the nutrition from livestock was determined using the nutrient value of the family’s
    animal intake, which includes cattle, oxen, milk, butter, poultry, eggs, mutton,
    and lamb. The total nutrition level of the household was calculated by adding
    up food consumption (crop and livestock), including donated food, and comparing
    it to the FAO daily minimum necessary standard for adult equivalent [33,34,35].
    Graphical and analytical tools were used to represent financial and nutrition
    outcomes and rank the risky alternative scenarios. The estimated results were
    represented using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) and stoplight chart
    to accurately reveal the probable outcome compared to a single estimation point.
    CDF graph represents the cumulative density of the given outcome, and the further
    to the right the CDF graph is from the origin, the higher the performance. The
    stoplight chart graphs depict the probabilities of each scenario/technology being
    less than a lower cut-off value (the lowest mean) and greater than an upper cut-off
    value (the highest mean). The probabilities of the economic indicator of each
    technology exceeding the uppercut-off value are presented numerically and assigned
    the green color. The yellow segments represent the probability that values fall
    between the lower and upper cut-off values, and the red represents the probability
    that the values are below the lower cut-off. To simulate the key output variables
    (KOVs), the FARMSIM model uses various equations to compare the impacts of the
    technology. Equations used to compute the KOVs of this study are detailed in Bizimana
    and Richardson [29]. 2.4. Baseline and Alternative Scenarios Several scenarios,
    including a baseline and alternative farming systems, were simulated for five
    years using the FARMSIM model to analyze the impact of solar MajiPump water-lifting
    technology on income and nutrition in Ethiopia’s sub-humid area [29]. FARMISM
    considers changes in crop and livestock production, crop and livestock mix, cost
    of technology and related inputs, farm product prices, annual family food consumption
    and food purchase, and animal feed requirement when modeling technology’s economic
    and nutritional impacts. The scenarios were solely selected based on the experimental
    trials and interventions conducted under the ASCM project mentioned above, which
    mainly included the use of the solar Maji pump, drip irrigation and tillage practices
    in Dengeshita. The scenario analysis looks at how water-lifting technology (pulley
    and solar MajiPump) and fertilizer applications affect crop irrigation, production,
    and consumption at the household level. Given that groundwater from wells is used
    for irrigation in Dengeshita, two distinct water-lifting technologies, a pulley–bucket–tank
    and solar MajiPump systems, were assessed for capacity and affordability. For
    the alternative scenarios, optimal fertilizer applications during field interventions
    are evaluated, whereas existing fertilizer rates from the baseline survey are
    used for this study’s baseline analysis. Three major cereal crops (maize, teff,
    and millet) consistent with the cropping system in Dengeshita and grown during
    the rainy season were considered in this study. In addition to cereal crops, onion
    and pepper were analyzed in the model (Appendix A). There is no yield difference
    in cereals between the baseline and alternative scenarios as the input technology
    (e.g., fertilizer, chemicals) and the management practices are the same for rainfed
    agriculture. From the survey conducted in 2017 by the Bahir Dar University in
    collaboration with the Innovation Lab for Small Scale Irrigation (ILSSI), phosphorus
    fertilizers from all sources (i.e., DAP and compost) were 27.4 kg P ha−1 and nitrogen
    fertilizers from UREA, DAP, and compost were 76 kg N ha−1. According to the survey,
    most homes used conserved seeds from the previous harvest for the following planting
    season, and chemical use was limited. In addition, the volume of farm labor recruiting
    was comparable under the baseline scenario for cereals. However, more hired labor
    was contemplated in the alternate scenarios, particularly for irrigation activities.
    The irrigated crops grown during the dry season consist mainly of onion and pepper
    under conservation agriculture (CA) and conventional tillage (CT) practices. The
    difference between the baseline and alternative scenarios is due to the application
    of conservation agriculture and conventional tillage with combined Maji solar
    pump and drip technologies. Assefa et al. [33] showed how CA treatments save labor
    and water compared to conventional tillage by smallholder farmers in the Dengeshita
    area. Farmers irrigated vegetables with a watering can for the first 1.5 years
    and drip irrigation for the remaining years. Based on the local farmer practices,
    urea (46-0-0) fertilizer was applied at 200 kg ha−1 in both CA and CT treatments.
    Local grass (Pennisetum macrourum Trin) was harvested before seed development
    and dried before utilizing it as a mulch on the CA plots. Throughout the experiment,
    the dried grass was applied at 4 Mg ha−1 as mulch cover twice per cropping period
    (i.e., 8 Mg ha−1 year−1). Livestock (i.e., cow) manure was applied on five occasions
    in both CA and CT at a rate of 5 Mg ha−1. Onion was harvested from February to
    March, and pepper from July to August. Crop residues from both management systems
    were not removed. The difference between the baseline and alternatives was mainly
    the technology used to lift water, such as pulley and solar pump, mulch application
    through CA, and drip used to apply water. Improvement under alternative scenarios
    was due to increased irrigation yields, reduced labor costs, and water saving.
    The following is a short description of the four scenarios under study. The baseline
    scenario relates to crop cultivation (mainly grains) in the rainy season (or rain-fed
    agricultural system) and the use of conventional tillage and minimum irrigation
    when needed in the dry season for vegetables. Alternative scenarios include: (1)
    irrigation of crops (vegetables of onion and pepper) using MajiPump and drip in
    addition to growing rain-fed crops, all under conventional tillage, with optimal
    fertilizers application; (2) irrigation of crops (vegetables of onion and pepper)
    using MajiPump and drip in addition to growing rain-fed crops, all under conservation
    agriculture with optimal fertilizers application; and (3) irrigation of crops
    (vegetables of onion and pepper) using the pulley system in addition to growing
    rain-fed crops, all under conventional tillage with optimal fertilizers application.
    The first alternative scenario is referred to as Alt.1_MP_CT, the second as Alt.2_MP_CA,
    and the third as Alt.3_P_CT. 2.5. Assumptions To consider the potential of adopting
    new technology, we first assumed that alternative irrigation methods had been
    fully implemented, as evidenced by field trials of MajiPumps by intervention farmers
    in Dengeshita [30]. According to the ASMC project’s household survey, over 90%
    of the selected homes (intervention and non-intervention) used fertilizers and
    pesticides. Nonetheless, 56% of them used enhanced seeds. To ensure sustainability,
    the cost of capital for irrigation technologies (solar MajiPump and pulley) was
    projected to be paid through a microfinance loan. It was incorporated into the
    model as a liability (loan). The project, on the other hand, furnished the pumps
    for testing. In FARMSIM, the adoption rate refers to the percentage of land or
    animals under new farming or livestock techniques that a home or community (kebele)
    has embraced. Second, because the farmer’s profit is mostly determined by the
    amount of crop and livestock goods sold at markets, the farmer’s access to markets
    is critical. In this study, crop and livestock markets were considered open and
    competitive, with no distortions where the supply and demand determine market
    prices. However, the five-year economic prediction assumed that the market selling
    price in each of the five years would equal the average selling price of year
    one for each crop sold, which would be the best guess if no anticipated prices
    were known. Third, based on preliminary profitability and food item purchase schedule
    simulations, households in alternative scenarios one and two (Alt.1 and Alt.2)
    related to the use of MajiPump have allocated up to 40% of their net profit that
    is available to purchase supplemental foodstuffs such as potatoes, chicken, beef,
    and butter to improve nutrition. Households in alternative scenario three (Alt.3)
    associated with the pulley spent up to 70% of their profit on the same supplemental
    food item. In comparison, households could only afford a quarter (40%) of the
    supplemental food under the baseline scenario. Animal-source foods were targeted
    because of their low consumption, as revealed by the baseline survey, while potatoes
    assisted in increasing vitamin A intake. No milk purchase is recorded, but about
    65% of on-farm milk production is processed into butter; 20% is sold, while only
    15% is consumed at home. Last, we assumed a discount rate of 10% for the five
    forecasting years to account for the time value of money and kept it at the same
    level as the inflation rate. 3. Results and Discussions 3.1. Economic Impacts
    This study used several economic indicators such as net present value, net cash
    farm income (profit), ending cash, and benefit–cost ratio to assess the impacts
    of adopting small-scale irrigation technology and tillage practices in Dengeshita.
    The NPV simulation findings in Dengeshita show a positive NPV value for all scenarios,
    demonstrating the potential benefits of investing in SSI technologies such as
    solar MajiPump and tillage practices (Table 1). The use of MajiPump irrigation
    technology to lift water, complemented by drip irrigation in Dengeshita, provided
    higher NPV values for farmers relative to baseline with limited irrigation technology
    and the use of a pulley as an irrigation system. The MajiPump alternative scenario
    (Alt.2) under the conservation agriculture farming technique had the highest NPV
    value due to better production yields and vegetable sales. The baseline scenario
    had a lower NPV value due to low crop yields, vegetable sales, and high production
    costs (labor and input). However, there is no significant difference in NPV values
    between the alternative scenarios or between the alternative and baseline scenarios.
    Table 1. Economic impacts of the SSI technologies in Dengeshita. The simulated
    annual net cash farm income (NCFI), which represents economic profit at the household
    level, shows that in year three, the average profit under alternative scenarios
    (Alt.1, Alt.2, and Alt.3) is 1.8 to 3.6 times higher than that of the baseline
    scenario, with a percentage increase in profit ranging from 81 to 262% (Table
    1). Alternative scenarios one and two (Alt.1 and Alt.2), associated with the MajiPumps
    and drip irrigation under conventional tillage and conservation agriculture practices,
    yielded the highest yearly average profit. The profit value for the baseline scenario
    was the lowest, followed by the alternative scenario associated with the pulley
    and drip irrigation system (Alt.3). The net cash income (profit) distribution,
    on the other hand, indicated a one percent likelihood of having a profit (NCFI)
    equal to or less than zero (loss) for Alt.1 and Alt.2 (MajiPump scenarios) and
    a 21% probability of having a profit (NCFI) equal to or less than zero for the
    baseline and Alt.3 scenarios (pulley system) (Figure 2). The cumulative distribution
    function (CDF) graphs and simulated profit values reveal that the profit loss
    ranges from 0 to ETB 12,230, with the baseline and pulley scenarios resulting
    in the greatest losses. Although the profit associated with MajiPump and drip
    irrigation technologies is higher than the baseline and pulley system, the distribution
    results also highlight the risk associated with improved production and water-lifting
    technologies (such as MajiPump) costs involved in the SSI technologies investment.
    High-income variability and de facto risk were noted, owing mostly to a large
    range in yields and price figures (minimum and maximum) and ox-earned income,
    which resulted in high variability in receipts and profits. The pulley system’s
    low-profit value was mostly due to the manual pulley technology’s high labor cost
    and low efficiency. Figure 2. Cumulative distribution of net cash farm income
    per family in Dengeshita. The stoplight chart graph option can also compare and
    rate scenario performance. The chart summarizes the likelihood that the baseline
    and risky alternative scenarios will be less than (in red) or more than (in green)
    a lower target value. The chance of each scenario falling between the two targets
    is shown in yellow in the table [29]. Stoplight makes ranking scenarios easier
    by presenting a table of probabilities and a graph depicting the possibilities
    of each range. In this study, the NCFI (profit) stoplight chart predicts the probability
    of NCFI being less than ETB 0 (red), larger than ETB 20,000 (green), and between
    the two target values (yellow) in year three of the five years. The graph shows
    that the baseline and alternative scenario three (Alt.3) associated with the pulley
    system have a 21 and 23% probability of having the NCFI less than ETB 0 (loss).
    The alternative scenarios associated with Maji pump and drip irrigation systems
    under CA and CT practices (Alt.1 and Alt.2) have a 1 and 2% probability of incurring
    a loss (Figure 3). Additionally, alternative scenarios associated with MajiPump
    and drip system have a 30 and 34% chance of having their NCFI or profit higher
    than ETB 20,000 in year three. That probability is 2% for the baseline and 14%
    for the pulley system. The low performance of the baseline and Alt.3 associated
    with the pulley system is linked to high production costs and low profits. Although
    higher production and sale of vegetables due to irrigation were made under Alt.3
    (pulley), the profit was offset by high production costs, especially those related
    to labor. For example, irrigation labor costs for growing vegetables were 7 to
    10 times higher under the pulley system than the average labor costs in the baseline
    scenario. Labor costs for Alt.1 and Alt.2 under MajiPump and drip systems were
    significantly reduced (10 times lower than the baseline scenario), allowing for
    the allocation of the profit to other uses such as supplemental food purchases.
    Figure 3. Probability of net cash income less than 0 (red), greater than ETB 20,000
    (green) and in-between (yellow) per-family in Dengeshita kebele. To determine
    whether the benefits outweigh the investment costs or enterprise feasibility,
    a cost–benefit analysis (CBA) is performed, which employs two NPV-related metrics:
    the benefit–cost ratio (BCR) and the internal rate of return (IRR). The two measures
    provide information on the profitability and return on investment of a new business
    or enterprise, in this case, an investment in small-scale irrigation technology
    (SSI) like MajiPump, fertilizers, and drip irrigation. Furthermore, the cost–benefit
    analysis shows the probability distribution of the BCR from the FARMSIM simulation
    results (Figure 4). Figure 4. Cumulative distribution of the benefit–cost ratio
    for alternative scenarios. The results indicate, on average, BCR values greater
    than one (feasible) for alternative scenarios associated with MajiPumps and drip
    irrigation (Alt.1 and Alt.2) and BCR values less than one (not feasible) for the
    alternative scenario associated with the pulley and drip irrigation system (Table
    1 above). Average BCR values equal to or greater than one (threshold value) indicate
    break-even or profitability of the investment under alternative scenarios associated
    with using MajiPumps and drip irrigation systems compared to the baseline. However,
    an examination of the full distribution of the BCR values reveals that the BCR
    simulated values have approximately 17% and 34% probability for Alt.1 and Alt.2
    associated with the MajiPump to fall below their threshold value of one, indicating
    a negative return on investment or loss (Figure 4). For the pulley system scenario
    (Alt.3), the chance of a negative return on investment (non-feasibility) is 85
    percent. The pulley system option is less feasible, mainly due to high investment
    costs in irrigation labor, which is 100 times higher than the labor costs under
    the Maji solar pump and takes up between 66% and 71% of the total input and production
    costs of onion and peppers. While labor costs may be the main reason for the low
    feasibility of adopting a pulley system, costs of investment in tools such as
    the MajiPump are also a factor in low BCR values as these figures are measured
    in the present value difference between the baseline and the alternative technology
    costs. Although high investment costs (operational and capital) are recorded under
    alternative scenarios associated with technology and labor, revenues from the
    production and sale of irrigated vegetables (accounting for 80% of all revenues)
    have increased the overall profitability. 3.2. Simulation of Nutrition Impacts
    We evaluate nutrition indicators, in this case, nutrients, and compare them to
    daily minimum requirements per adult equivalent (AE) to determine adequacy in
    calories, proteins, fat, calcium, iron, and vitamin A intake available to the
    household. In the analysis, farm families consume food grown on the farm and/or
    purchased at the market for nutritional requirements. A preliminary analysis of
    food items consumed by the household in Dengeshita kebele was carried out using
    household survey data collected in 2015 and 2017 in Ethiopia (The data were collected
    through a collaborative research project between the Innovation Lab for Small-scale
    Irrigation (ILSSI) at Texas A & M University and the Sustainable Intensification
    Innovation Lab at Kansas State University to evaluate the implications of sustainable
    intensification of crop and livestock production systems (SIPS) on human nutrition
    in northern Ethiopia). Using a household diet diversity score (HDDS) technique
    based on a basic count of food groups [36], survey findings reveal a cereal-centered
    diet with a significant lack of animal-source products such as meat, eggs, milk,
    and seafood intake. For example, 0 to 2% of questioned households said they ate
    fresh meat, organic meat, eggs, and fish, but 98 to 100% said they ate cereals/grains
    (see Appendix C). Only households in alternate scenarios might utilize up to 70%
    of their profit to purchase food for nutrition enhancement, with a preference
    for food of animal origin based on the quantity of profit available and nutrition
    demands. However, the profit level only allowed households to buy potatoes, poultry,
    meat, and butter from markets. In the model, households under the baseline scenario
    did not have enough net cash to purchase the same amount of supplemental foods
    as those under the alternative scenarios. Only 40% of the same amount of food
    purchased under the alternative scenario was afforded under the baseline scenario,
    leading to some nutrients, such as vitamin A deficiency. The crops farmed and
    consumed by the family in Dengeshita kebele were mostly maize, teff, millet, peppers,
    onions, and lentils, to which moderate purchases of teff, millet, onions, potatoes,
    and butter were added. Milk, butter, eggs, chicken, sheep, and beef produced and
    consumed by the household on the farm were also included in the analysis for all
    scenarios. Because of moderate crop production gains due to farming technologies,
    simulated amounts of nutrition variables (calories, proteins, fat, calcium, iron,
    and vitamin A) available to farm families did not differ significantly between
    the alternative and baseline scenarios. The main technological variation between
    the sampled households is the usage of solar irrigation MajiPump and agricultural
    practice (e.g., CA versus CT), while other agricultural technologies (use of fertilizers,
    seeds) are consistent throughout the households. On the other hand, purchases
    account for considerably larger changes in increased food availability and consumption
    under alternative scenarios compared to the baseline scenario. According to the
    simulation results, the volume of milk sought and consumed by families in Dengeshita
    kebele, for example, increased by 50% in all possible scenarios associated with
    MajiPumps, drip irrigation, and pulley systems. Similar increases in the amount
    requested and consumed by farm families were reported for chicken (87%), beef
    (44%), teff (111%), butter (142%), and potatoes (154%), which might be attributed,
    in part, to purchase. Notably, increased yield and production from enhanced irrigation
    technologies resulted in high increases (six times) in the number of vegetables
    (peppers and onions) accessible for eating at home under alternative scenarios
    compared to the baseline. The simulation results for each nutrient in this study
    are explained below (Table 2). One of the primary assumptions in nutrition simulation
    states that the fraction of crops consumed by the family and reported in the household
    survey would be consistent for all crops in the baseline and alternative scenarios
    unless there is a need to increase the fraction consumed. However, compared to
    the baseline and pulley situations, the increase in food products and nutrients
    accessible for consumption at home was primarily due to purchases made under improved
    alternative farming technologies and practice scenarios connected with MajiPumps.
    The affordability of purchasing supplemental foods under the baseline scenario
    was very constrained by the lack of cash, while the purchase exhausted almost
    all the cash reserves or profits under the pulley system. The change in available
    nutrients from the baseline to alternative scenarios one and two (Alt.2) related
    to MajiPump and Alt.3, related to the pulley, shows higher food production and
    purchase increases in the alternative than the baseline. However, increases in
    the pulley system are slightly lower than those in the MajiPump system, highlighting
    the benefits of adopting the MajiPump and conservation agriculture alternative
    compared to the pulley system and conventional agriculture. Table 2. Nutrition
    impacts for SSI technologies in Dengeshita. Calorie intake: The calorie simulation
    results for a representative household in Dengeshita kebele reveal, on average,
    available daily intake of 1838 and 2000 calories for the baseline and alternative
    scenarios, respectively (Table 2 and Figure 5). These intakes fall short of the
    global average’s daily minimal need of 2353 calories per adult equivalent (AE)
    [33]. Farm families in both the baseline and alternative scenarios have insufficient
    calorie consumption. According to the simulation results, households in both the
    baseline and alternative scenarios have a 70–80% chance of consuming fewer calories
    than the recommended minimum of 2353 kcal/AE/day. Figure 5. Cumulative distribution
    of calorie intake (kcal) per AE per day in Dengeshita. The low-calorie intake
    may be related to a comparatively low consumption fraction of cereal-based food
    crops grown on the farm, such as maize and millet. Although maize is the largest
    source of calories for a typical Dengeshita household, accounting for 67% on average,
    its consumption portion in a home is about 51%. Protein intake: The protein intake
    simulation results show that, on average, a representative household has 42 and
    47 g/AE of protein intake available under the baseline and alternative scenarios,
    which meet and exceed the daily minimum requirement of 41 g/AE (Table 2 and Appendix
    D.1). However, simulation findings reveal a more comprehensive picture of the
    distribution, with households under baseline and alternative scenarios having
    between 24 and 56% risk of falling below the minimal protein requirement per adult
    (AE) daily (See Appendix D.1). Fat intake: Fat intake simulation results show
    a significant deficit in fat, with a likelihood ranging from 79 to 94% for families
    falling below the minimum required under both the baseline and alternative scenarios
    (Table 2 and Figure 6). Although there is an improvement in fat intake between
    the baseline and alternative scenarios in relation to MajiPump and pulley use,
    their respective averages of 32, 42, and 37 g are still less than the daily minimum
    fat requirement average of 51 g for an adult. The improvement and increase in
    available fat intake from the baseline to the alternative scenarios is around
    40%, with butter and beef consumption accounting for 56% of the available fat.
    Figure 6. Cumulative distribution of fat intake (g) per AE per day in Dengeshita.
    Calcium intake: Both the baseline and alternative scenarios show a significant
    deficiency in calcium intake (Table 2). The average calcium intake per AE per
    day for the baseline and the three alternative scenarios (Alt.1, 2, and 3) is
    0.12 and 0.20 g, respectively, falling short of the daily minimum requirements
    of one gram per AE. The whole calcium intake distribution revealed that, although
    being in deficit, the best-performing scenarios (Alt.1 and Alt.2) are alternative
    scenarios related to the MajiPump and drip irrigation use (Figure 7). Teff, maize,
    onion, and milk products are the top contributors to calcium intake. Figure 7.
    Cumulative distribution of calcium intake (g) per AE per day in Dengeshita. The
    large and consistent gap in calcium intake in the current study reflects the existing
    concern regarding low calcium intake observed in developing countries (vs. developed
    countries) due to low animal product access and consumption (FAO, 2001b [34]).
    Moreover, due to a mismatch between the calcium intake data and the relatively
    high intake requirements, a revised US/Canada Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)
    recommends replacing the recommended daily allowance (RDA) with the acceptable
    intake (AI) of calcium. Another concern related to calcium requirements is the
    wide difference between gender and age, making it difficult to find an acceptable
    average requirement. Iron intake: Based on the minimum requirements, the simulation
    results indicate that in 90% of the cases, households in Dengeshita kebele obtain
    more than the required minimum levels of iron, with between 1 and 10% likelihood
    of falling below the minimum amount required across scenarios (Appendix D.2).
    The average iron intake available per AE per day for all scenarios, estimated
    at 0.013 g, is 45% more than the daily minimum requirement of 0.009 g per AE (Table
    2). Moreover, there was a slight improvement in iron available between the baseline
    and the alternative scenarios associated with using the MajiPump, which averaged
    0.14 g. Note that about 64% of available iron for the household comes from maize
    consumption. Vitamin A intake: The simulation results for available vitamin A
    intake, expressed regarding retinol activity equivalent (RAE), indicate adequate
    to surplus vitamin A intake levels for alternative scenarios associated with using
    MajiPump and drip irrigation systems (Table 2). However, the results for the baseline
    scenario show a deficit, while those associated with the pulley system are slightly
    above the minimum required (600 µg RAE). The average levels of vitamin A intake
    for the baseline and alternative scenarios with MajiPump were 340 µg RAE and 1014
    µg RAE, respectively. The full distribution of available vitamin A intake shows
    that there is between 55 and 80 percent chance for households under the baseline
    and pulley system scenarios to fall below the minimum required vitamin A while
    that probability stands between 25 and 36 percent for alternative scenarios associated
    with the use of MajiPump (Appendix D.3). 3.3. Impacts of Technologies on Nutrition
    Generally, the nutrition simulation results show that the food products consumed
    by families in the baseline and alternative scenarios meet the minimum daily requirements
    only for available proteins and iron intake (and vitamin A to some extent), while
    available calories, fat, and calcium are in deficit (Table 2). An unusual deficit
    in calories is observed for all the scenarios. Maize consumption lead the supply
    of calories to farm families by contributing between 63 and 71% of the total available
    calorie intake. However, this amount is insufficient to cover the nutritional
    deficits in calories. To close the calorie gap and reach the minimum daily requirements,
    increasing the consumption of butter and cereals produced on the farm or purchasing
    at the market to supplement farm production and consumption is recommended. For
    example, the allocation of financial resources to purchase onions under the alternative
    scenarios, as reported in the baseline survey, could be used to purchase supplemental
    millet and butter to increase available calorie intake. Large deficits in calcium
    are observed, with averages ranging from 0.12 to 0.21 g per day per adult equivalent
    (AE) and are below the one-gram daily minimum required per adult. A close look
    at calcium intake probability distribution from simulated values indicates no
    chance or probability for the available calcium to exceed the minimum required.
    Two previous nutrition simulation studies in Ethiopia have also shown a consistent
    deficiency in calcium, probably due to the relatively high level of the minimum
    requirements and a diet low in calcium [37]. Calcium deficiency can be caused
    by one of two factors. First, there is the issue of low consumption of calcium-rich
    foods (in comparison to industrialized countries) [38]. Low milk, cheese animal
    products, and egg consumption in underdeveloped nations, whether through production
    or purchase, may have resulted in low accessible calcium intake in this study.
    It is worth noting that teff, maize, onion, and milk consumption contributed around
    70% of the total available calcium intake. Milk is at the top of the list, accounting
    for approximately 32 percent. Second, the acceptable level of minimum necessary
    calcium intake for nutrition analysis is still being debated. The present threshold
    of one gram looks to be somewhat higher than what a human body would ordinarily
    require. The other reason could be the wide range of calcium requirements between
    gender and age, making it difficult to find an acceptable average requirement.
    Increasing the consumption of dairy products such as milk, cheese, and eggs can
    significantly improve the available calcium intake and cut down the current deficits
    [38,39]. In this study, households under Alt.1 and Alt.2 associated with MajiPump,
    which has enough additional income from profits, can afford to increase the quantity
    of supplemental animal source foods through purchase to cut the nutrition deficit
    in calcium. Deficits are also observed for fat in the baseline and all alternative
    scenarios, with major fat deficiencies associated with the baseline and alternative
    scenario under the pulley system. In contrast, relatively low deficiencies are
    observed under alternative scenarios associated with MajiPump and drip irrigation
    systems. Although the simulated fat intake available for farm families increased
    between 132 and 140% in alternative scenarios compared to the baseline, to cut
    the fat deficits significantly and improve family nutrition in Dengeshita kebele,
    there is a need to mainly increase the consumption of butter and beef but also
    chicken and mutton. The simulated nutritional results in fat intake show a 35%
    increase in available fat under the MajiPump scenario compared to 16% under the
    pulley, all compared to the baseline (Table 2 above). The results also indicate
    that these increases came mainly from family purchases, contributing between 50
    and 85% of additional consumed quantities in beef and butter. 3.4. Impacts of
    Technologies in Sub-Saharan Africa The adoption and appropriate use of improved
    irrigation technologies contributed to an increase in the quantity and variety
    of crops produced at the household level, mainly due to dry season crop production.
    The simulated total cultivated area in Dengeshita for dry season crops (onions
    and pepper) increased, on average, eight times compared to the baseline scenario.
    The land area increase, combined with improved productivity (yield) from using
    fertilizers and other agricultural management practices such as conservation agriculture,
    led to increased food production and consumption in alternative scenarios. For
    example, the quantity of onions and peppers available for consumption at the household
    level in alternative scenarios associated with using the MajiPump, increased seven
    to eight times from the baseline. The quantity of onions and pepper available
    for sale increased 11 to 14 times in alternative scenarios associated with MajiPump
    compared to the baseline and the pulley scenarios, leading to an increase in potential
    revenues. A study on the impacts of small-scale irrigation on household dietary
    diversity in Ethiopia and Tanzania showed that potential pathways to food diversity
    and better nutrition were most likely through increased income rather than directly
    through production [40,41]. A similar outcome in a study in Sub-Saharan Africa
    indicates that irrigation systems improved the consumption of food products of
    animal origin and nutrition due to potential increases in income and improved
    livestock productivity from feeds [37,41]. The simulated nutritional results indicate
    a consistent increase in available nutrient intake between the main alternative
    scenarios (under MajiPump and pulley) and the baseline scenario, with noticeable
    nutritional improvement under the MajiPump alternative scenario. The alternative
    scenarios (Alt.1 and Alt.2) under the MajiPump and drip irrigation systems had
    the most impact on nutrition, followed by the pulley system, partly due to increased
    crop production and income from improved irrigation methods and conservation agriculture
    practices. Using improved technologies such as solar pumps and drip irrigation
    alongside conservation agriculture practices has significantly reduced labor costs
    compared to using a pulley system or a bucket for irrigation in the baseline scenario.
    4. Conclusions and Recommendations This study aimed to assess the effects of improved
    agricultural technologies (solar pump, drip irrigation system, and conservation
    agriculture practices) to grow irrigated vegetables on household nutrition and
    farm profitability in Dengeshita kebele, Amhara region of Ethiopia. A baseline
    scenario using existing practices (fertilizer and irrigation system) was compared
    to three alternative scenarios using solar Maji Pumps, drip irrigation, a pulley
    system, and conservation agriculture. Households in the alternative and improved
    irrigation technologies scenarios associated with the MajiPump and drip irrigation
    systems earned more than those in the baseline and pulley systems. Although the
    expenses of purchasing the solar MajiPump and drip system increased for the initial
    expenditure, simulation results show a return over time due to improved production
    and sale. However, credit or financial help to support the initial and capital
    investment and the credit payback over five years was critical to farmers’ success
    under the MajiPump alternative scenario. Higher labor costs, which were not financed,
    were one of the causes of overall low performance and profit for the pulley and
    drip irrigation systems. One of the key impacts of profit was the opportunity
    for households to purchase additional foodstuffs, especially animal sources food
    for family nutrition. This study achieved increased vegetable yield and total
    production for consumption and market income generation through improved small-scale
    irrigation technologies such as solar MajiPump in conjunction with conservation
    agriculture practices. The simulation results demonstrate the viability and profitability
    of these businesses in comparison to the baseline scenario or present practices.
    Policymakers should prioritize facilitating access to financial support and credit
    options to assist smallholder farmers in acquiring and sustaining these technologies,
    as demonstrated by their positive long-term return on investment. As a result,
    adopting enhanced irrigation technology (MajiPump) and conservation agriculture,
    which minimize labor time and cost while improving vegetable yield, has a strong
    potential to improve environmental and nutritional wellbeing. Author Contributions

    In their natural state, peatlands continuously sequester CO2 from the atmosphere
    (Evans et al., 2017) and are, at least in their early life, significant carbon
    (C) sinks (Belyea and Clymo, 2001). They provide a diverse range of ecosystem
    services as part of their natural functioning, including regulating services such
    as climate regulation via C sequestration and storage, water regulation and water
    purification (Bonn et al., 2016, Grzybowski and Glińska-Lewczuk, 2020), and they
    are also important for biodiversity. In general, however, utilising peatlands
    for direct economic return generally involves drainage practices to allow for
    their conversion to productive uses such as food and fibre or use of peat as a
    fuel or growing medium production (Dinesen et al., 2021). These activities all
    lead to rapid, substantial and ongoing loss of soil organic C, CO2 emissions and
    other greenhouse gases (GHGs; notably N2O from fertilised organic soils), land-subsidence,
    and to the degradation of other ecosystem services (Evans et al., 2019, Page and
    Baird, 2016, Parish et al., 2008). Globally the drainage of lowland peat for farming
    and other provisioning services is estimated to have affected 12 % of global peatlands
    (Dinesen et al., 2021), transforming them from long-term C sinks into C sources,
    which have been estimated to contribute between 2 % and 5 % of all anthropogenic
    GHG emissions (Evans et al., 2019, Joosten, 2009, Leifeld and Menichetti, 2018).
    In the UK, 53 % of the total peatland GHG emissions are from lowland peatlands
    drained for agriculture (Brown et al., 2023), despite these areas only occupying
    6 % of the total peat area in the UK. In the context of agricultural land, agricultural
    drained peat has the highest GHG emissions per unit area of any other agricultural
    land-use in the UK (Evans et al., 2017). The large-scale drainage of UK lowland
    peat areas began in the 17th century with the development of engineered drainage
    systems in Eastern England, most extensively in the Fenlands of East Anglia (Thompson,
    1957). Subsequently, peatland drainage has extended to many other areas including
    the Somerset Levels, Norfolk and Suffolk Broads and the Lancashire Mosslands (Natural
    England, 2010). Similar large-scale drainage of peatlands for agriculture and
    forestry has occurred across much of Europe including the Netherlands, Germany
    and Fennoscandia, as well as in parts of North America and (more recently, but
    on a very large scale) across Southeast Asia (Page and Baird, 2016). Drained peatlands
    will continue to be a hotspot of GHG emissions of global importance unless action
    is taken (Parish et al., 2008, Tubiello et al., 2016, Wüst-Galley et al., 2020).
    Agreeing that urgent action is required to reduce GHG emissions globally has led
    to the development of agreements such as the Paris Agreement (United Nations /
    Framework Convention on Climate Change, 2015), whilst the Ramsar Convention on
    Wetlands agreement is more targeted with the aim to protect, sustainably manage
    and restore, peatlands (Ramsar, 2018). In just 200 years since the 18th century,
    the UK has lost 84 % of the fertile peat topsoil in East Anglia, with <1 % of
    the original 4000 km2 continuing to support wetland habitat, and the remainder
    in danger of being lost in just 30–60 years (Adaptation Sub-Committee, 2013, DEFRA,
    2018a, Mulholland et al., 2020) Consequently, the UK’s first collaborative Peatland
    Strategy (Bain et al., 2011, DEFRA, 2018a) was developed to capture and embed,
    for the long term, a shared vision for UK peatlands. This strategy aims to shift
    the management of drained peatlands under intensive production, to farming practices
    which deliver wetter ways to farm. In 2020, the UK Department for Environment,
    Food and Rural Affairs, which has oversight of farming activities in England,
    established a Lowland Agricultural Peat Task Force with a remit to identify options
    for better management of lowland peatlands to safeguard productive agriculture
    while contributing to delivering the government’s 2050 Net Zero target. Increasing
    pressures to meet existing policy agreements has led to a variety of mitigation
    measures being identified as potential measures to reduce GHG emissions on agricultural
    lowland peat, such as; paludiculture, (i.e. wetland-based farming; (Gaudig et
    al., 2017, Mulholland et al., 2020, Schlattmann and Rode, 2019), higher water
    table management within existing farming systems (Freeman et al., 2022, Kløve
    et al., 2017, Rhymes et al., 2022, Taft, 2014), rewetting and peat restoration
    (Liu et al., 2020, Renou-Wilson et al., 2019) and the use of ‘regenerative farming’
    measures (e.g. reduced tillage, fertiliser management and cover crops; Wen et
    al., 2021). Despite identified mitigation measures, the evidence base upon which
    to make strategic management decisions to reduce emissions remains limited (Freeman
    et al., 2022, Taft, 2014, Taft et al., 2018) because the practicalities and economic
    impacts of adopting these measures are still unclear. Furthermore, the adoption
    of these mitigation measures is contingent upon farmer perceptions of the relative
    practicality of implementation (Jones et al., 2013, Taft, 2014). If farmers are
    to adopt mitigation measures it is imperative that they are (i) practical, (ii)
    economic, (iii) legally compliant, (iv) acceptable to retailers, and (iv) acceptable
    to the general public. Previous studies on farm-scale adoption of GHG mitigation
    strategies (Jones et al., 2013, Taft, 2014) found disagreement between what was
    deemed effective (expert opinion) and what was considered practical (farmer opinion).
    With this study we used two linked Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) surveys: one to assess
    practicality and economic cost of different mitigation measures, and the other
    to assess the efficacy of different mitigation measures. We took this approach
    to expand from the 2-dimensional (i.e., practicality vs effectiveness) analysis
    approach used in previous studies (Jones et al., 2013, Taft, 2014) to allow for
    a multi-dimensional one. This allows for a more holistic understanding of mitigation
    strategy uptake to aid in new policy decisions that can foster higher mitigation
    measure and technology adoption. 2. Methodology 2.1. Shortlisting mitigation measures
    An initial list of 73 candidate mitigation measures were identified from relevant
    peer-reviewed papers and grey literature (Table S1). The 73 mitigation measures
    were reduced to 50 (Table S2) by removing any identified in a previous study as
    being slightly or not effective (Taft, 2014). The list of mitigation measures
    was further shortened to a manageable 30 by a panel of 13 scientific experts,
    identified on the basis of authorship of relevant papers relating to the reduction
    of GHG emissions from agriculture on lowland peat. The panel was asked to evaluate
    each measure in terms of its potential to reduce GHG emissions on agricultural
    lowland peat at the farm level. The classification options were “very effective”,
    “quite effective”, “slightly effective”, “not effective” or “don’t know”. Using
    methodology adapted from previous studies (Jones et al., 2013, Taft, 2014), responses
    were scored with values of “3”, “2”, “1”, “−1″, and “0” respectively, and summed
    for each mitigation measure. The 30 most effective mitigation measures identified
    by the panel of experts (Table 1) were grouped by the following mitigation types:
    restoration (two measures); paludiculture (six measures); water management (eight
    measures); crop management (three measures); nutrient management (four measures);
    regenerative management (four measures); farm machinery usage (two measures) and
    miscellaneous (one measures). These mitigation measures were subsequently used
    to populate the Best Worst Scaling (BWS) surveys. Table 1. Shortlisted mitigation

    1.0 2.2. Best-Worst scaling BWS is an extension of the paired comparisons approach;
    where participants are presented with a predetermined number of choice sets of
    five candidate items (in this study, these items represent individual mitigation
    measures) and are asked to choose the two items within each set that they consider
    the ‘best’ and ‘worst’ (Finn and Louviere, 1992). Best Worst Scaling methods were
    chosen because they have; 1) a greater discrimination between elements compared
    to alternative ranking techniques such as the Likert Scale; 2) reduced intellectual
    burden than ranking multiple elements simultaneously; and 3) provision of more
    information than other methods when the respondent is indifferent or dislikes
    both options. These Best Worst Scaling methods have been used previously in agricultural
    GHG emission mitigation studies in the UK (Glenk et al., 2014, Jones et al., 2013)
    and Australia (Dumbrell et al., 2016) – with the latter exploring preferences
    to adoption of carbon farming practices via an online BWS survey. 2.3. Survey
    designs Two surveys were developed with targeted questions for either expert respondents,
    chosen for their expertise in GHG emissions from agricultural lowland peat, or
    farmer/landowner respondents who farm on all/some peatland soil. Each survey consisted
    of eighteen choice sets with five mitigation measures within each. Experts (n
    = 27) were asked to indicate which GHG mitigation measures within a choice set
    they perceived as the “most effective” and “least effective” for reducing emissions.
    Whilst, farmers and landowners (n = 123), were asked to indicate which mitigation
    measures they perceived as “most practical” or “least practical” to implement
    along with which measures had “most economic cost” and “least economic cost “to
    the business. Optimum survey designs were developed using Sawtooth SSI Web 7,
    version 7.0.10 software (Sawtooth Software Inc., Orem, UT, USA), where randomised
    choice sets based on a 1000 choice set iterations ensured that each mitigation
    appeared an equal number of times across the eighteen survey choice sets (Sawtooth
    Software, 2020). This ensures a balanced and efficient design to reduce respondent
    fatigue. Multiple variations of the optimal survey design were used in the online
    survey to vary the position of mitigation measures within each choice set with
    a combination of measures across respondents to help minimise context bias (Sawtooth
    Software, 2020, Taft, 2014). An example of a BWS choice set is provided in Fig.

    Fig. 1. Example of a ''practicality’ Best-Worst Scaling choice set. Respondents
    were invited to check one, mutually exclusive, radio button in each column, corresponding
    to their opinion on the ‘most practical’ and ‘least practical’ option respectively
    within each set. 2.4. Data collection Study protocols were reviewed and approved
    by the Ethics Committee of Bangor University (Approval number: COESE2020JDA01A)
    and DEFRA Survey Control. All respondents were informed that data collection was
    anonymous and that they were free to stop participation at any time. Participants
    also provided informed consent prior to completing the surveys. Experts with knowledge
    of GHG mitigation measures were recruited from academia, government and environmental
    NGOs. To reduce bias, experts involved in shortlisting were not directly invited
    to participate in the online survey. Expert surveys were completed online between
    September and December 2020. Farmers and landowners were recruited through engagement
    with the National Farmers Union (NFU), who distributed a link to the survey to
    their members farming on lowland peat soils, and through other stakeholder contact
    lists. Data were collected between 01 December and 24 December 2020. Demographic
    data collected from experts included gender, age, and type of organisation and
    for farmers and landowners, gender, age, enterprise (horticulture, vegetable,
    fruit, ornamentals, arable and other), farm size, area of peat (ha), farmer peat
    area (ha) and ownership/tenancy. 2.5. Analysis 2.5.1. Hierarchical bayes multinomial
    logit and extensions Mitigation measure effectiveness scores (experts perceptions),
    practicality and scores (farmer and/or land owner perceptions) were estimated
    using a choice model based on random utility theory, modelled using multinomial
    logit (MNL; Sawtooth Software, 2020). This method borrows information across the
    distribution of responses to stabilise and calculate each respondent''s score
    for each mitigation measure. Under the logit rule, the probability of choosing
    the ith item as best (or most important) from a set containing i through j items
    is equal to: Pi = eUi / Σ e Uij where eUi means to take the antilog of the utility
    for item i. and the probability of choosing the ith item as worst (or least important)
    is equal to: Pi = e-Ui / Σ e -Uij where e-Ui means to take the antilog of negative
    the utility for item i. For further details of the workings of the multinomial
    logit model and individual level score estimation see Cross et al. (2012), Finn
    and Louviere (1992) and Sawtooth Software (2020). The effectiveness, practicality
    and economic scores were rescaled to sum to 100 across all mitigation measures,
    placing the scores on a ratio scale and aiding interpretation. Based on individual
    scores, individual fit statistics, which are a measure of internal consistency
    indicating the reliability of a respondent''s answers, were calculated with the
    Sawtooth SSI Web 7, version 7.0.10 software (Sawtooth Software Inc., Orem, UT,
    USA). Any respondent whose fit statistic was less than 25 % was removed from further
    analysis as their responses were considered unreliable (2 farmers). 2.5.2. Statistical
    analysis Farmer demographic data were used to assess whether the distribution
    of individual respondent practicality scores differed significantly between subgroups
    of respondents. Kruskal–Wallis tests with Dunn–Bonferroni post hoc tests (Jones
    et al., 2013) were conducted to compare the distribution of individual respondent
    scores between subgroups of interest, for example gender, age and farm type. Epsilon
    square (ε2) was used to indicate how strong the demographic groups influence practicality
    and economic scores. An epsilon square of 0 would mean no differences (and no
    influence), while one of 1 would indicate a full dependency. (Tomczak and Tomczak,
    2014). All statistical tests were performed using SPSS 27 (IBM Corp., Armonk,
    NY, USA). 3. Results 3.1. Survey demographics Twenty-seven experts (∼40 % of those
    contacted) completed the effectiveness BWS survey (Table 2). The farmer survey
    consisted of two separate BWS sections, a practicality and an economic section.
    A total of 143 respondents (22 % of those contacted) completed the practicality
    section but only 123 of those farmers went on to complete the economic section.
    This was reduced to 141 and 121 respectively as 2 farmers were removed because
    their fit statistic was lower than 25 %. Respondents came from different geographic
    locations (the Fens, Humberhead Levels, the North West, North East and Somerset
    Levels; Figs. 2 and 3) and demographic backgrounds (Table 3). Table 2. Demographics

    mean expert rescaled scores for the 30 mitigation measures obtained via the hierarchical
    Bayes estimation described in Section 2.4.1, were ranked on a scale of effectiveness
    (Fig. 4). The scores were zero-centred so that the y-axis represented the overall
    mean effectiveness score of the 30 mitigation measures. Measures to the left of
    the x-axis received below average effectiveness scores and measure to the right
    of the x-axis achieved above average effectiveness scores. Download : Download

    estimates of the effectiveness scores across all experts for the 30 shortlisted
    mitigation measures. The error bars represent 95 % confidence intervals of the
    mean scores. Values represent n = 27. The scores were rescaled to sum 100 across
    all the mitigation measures to aid interpretation. Nine measures received scores
    that were significantly above the mean (i.e. their confidence intervals (CI) do
    not overlap the zero-centre; Fig. 4). Mitigation measure 3: Restore cropland to
    native wetland vegetation, in the restoration category, was deemed the most effective
    measure for reducing overall GHG emissions, with a score of 6.24 ± 0.29. The second
    most effective, also in the in the restoration category was mitigation measure
    14: Restore/create peatland vegetation with a score of 5.89 ± 0.52. The other
    effective measures were in the paludiculture category (9: Produce biomass (Sphagnum
    moss) for restoration or as a raw material, with a score of 3.41 ± 1.25; 8: Establish
    wetland species such as rushes, sedges and wetland grasses for the production
    of animal litter, with a score of 3.09 ± 1.16 and 5: Produce food/fodder crops
    on high water table peatland, with a score of 2.95 ± 1.05); water management (2:
    Raise average water levels, with a score of 3.45 ± 1.01; 1: Block ditches to raise
    water levels, with a score of 3.52 ± 0.99 and 16: Establish infrastructure to
    support dynamic water management, with a score of 1.89 ± 0.99) and crop management
    categories (12: Cultivate cover crops (e.g., rye) in combination with a raised
    water table, with a score of 1.23 ± 1.17). The mitigation measure deemed least
    effective was measure 23: Use more fuel-efficient machinery and equipment (farm
    machinery usage category), with a score of −3.16 ± 0.12. The CIs around the mean
    scores indicate some uncertainty and/or disagreement associated with the effectiveness
    of the mitigation measures. The CIs were lower in the top and bottom two effective
    and ineffective mitigation measures indicating a good level of consensus between
    the experts in determining effectiveness. CIs are higher in the mid-range mitigation

    of these measures. 3.3. Farmer practicality scores The estimated mean rescaled
    farmer scores for the 30 mitigation measures were ranked on a scale of practicality
    (Fig. 5). Again, the scores were zero-centred so that the y-axis represents the
    mean practicality score of the 30. Eleven measures had practicality scores significantly
    more than the overall mean. Four of the 11 mitigation measures deemed practical
    to implement are related to nutrient management (24: Conduct soil and crop nutrient
    testing and management planning, with a score of 4.41 ± 0.39 and 19: Improve timing
    of nitrogen fertiliser application, with a score of 4.04 ± 0.36 and 15: Reduce
    nitrogen fertiliser dose, with a score of 3.43 ± 0.38 and 29: Increase reliance
    on nitrogen-fixing crops (legumes), with a score of 1.85 ± 0.40). Download : Download

    all the mitigation measures to aid interpretation. The other practical mitigation
    measures were in the regenerative management category (21: Install buffer zones,
    with a score of 3.89 ± 0.36, 28: Reduce tillage, with a score of 3.62 ± 0.40,
    20: Eliminate Tillage, with a score of 0.78 ± 0.56 and 26: Avoid or shorten bare
    fallow periods, with a score of 3.40 ± 0.39); farm machinery usage (27: Minimise
    avoidable use of farm machinery, with a score of 3.67 ± 0.44 and 23: Use more
    fuel-efficient machinery and equipment, with a score of 3.46 ± 0.41) and water
    management (25: Optimise irrigation system efficiency to keep soil moist but not
    saturated, with a score of 0.62 ± 0.53). The mitigation measure deemed least practical
    was 9: Produce biomass (Sphagnum moss) for restoration or as a raw material (paludiculture),
    with a score of −2.64 ± 0.16. The CIs were reasonably consistent across all mean
    scores and smaller than those associated with the mean expert effectiveness scores
    indicating a higher level of consensus between the farmers in determining levels
    of practicality. 3.4. Farmer economic scores The estimated mean rescaled farmer
    scores for the 30 mitigation measures were ranked on a scale of the economic cost
    (does not decipher between implementation costs or economic impact on profits)
    of implementing GHG mitigation strategies on the farm (Fig. 6). Again, the scores
    have been zero-centred so that the y-axis represents the mean economic score of

    100 across all thee mitigation measures to aid interpretation. Eleven measures
    had economic scores significantly more than the overall mean, meaning they would
    have the least economic cost to the farm if implemented. The mitigation measure
    having the least economic cost to the farm was 24: Conduct soil and crop nutrient
    testing and management planning, with a score of −4.39 ± 0.39. The three other
    nutrient management measures were also deemed to have low economic cost (19: Improve
    timing of nitrogen fertiliser application, with a score of 3.89 ± 0.40; 15: Reduce
    nitrogen fertiliser dose, with a score of 2.48 ± 0.50 and 29: Increase reliance
    on nitrogen-fixing crops (legumes), with a score of 2.30 ± 0.44). Other categories
    with mitigation measures having a low economic cost include: farm machinery usage
    (23: Use more fuel-efficient machinery and equipment, with a score of 4.20 ± 0.40
    and 27: Minimise avoidable use of farm machinery, with a score of 4.02 ± 0.41);
    regenerative management (28: Reduce tillage, with a score of 3.62 ± 0.39; 20:
    Eliminate tillage (i.e. zero-till), with a score of 1.59 ± 0.57; 21: Install buffer
    zones between fields and watercourses, and within fields, to catch leached nutrients
    and soil organic carbon, with a score of 2.66 ± 0.48 and 26: Avoid or shorten
    bare fallow periods, with a score of 2.76 ± 0.40) and water management (25: Optimise
    irrigation system efficiency to keep soil moist but not saturated, with a score
    of 1.01 ± 0.61). The mitigation measure with the lowest mean score indicating
    the highest economic cost was 1: Fill/block ditches to create conditions suitable
    for peatland plants (water management), with a score of −2.90 ± 0.19. The CIs
    were reasonably consistent across all mean scores and smaller than those associated
    with the mean expert effectiveness scores indicating a higher level of consensus
    between the farmers in determining levels of economic cost. 3.5. Effectiveness

    measures, categorised by mitigation type. 3.6. Heterogeneity in farmer responses
    3.6.1. Frequency distributions of respondent scores The degree of consensus between
    individual respondents can be inferred from the distributions of individuals’
    mean scores. In Section 3.5 we show there are no occurrences where mitigation
    measures are considered to be both effective and practical, or effective with
    low economic cost. There are however 11 mitigation measures assessed by farmers
    to be practical to implement with low economic cost to the farm. To assess variation
    in farmers’ perceptions of practicality and economic cost for each of the mitigation
    measures featured in the upper right quadrant of the economic-practicality space
    (Fig. 9), the number of respondents were plotted against the practicality/economic
    score they ascribed to the mitigation measure (Fig. S1 a-j). The profile of the
    frequency distributions of individual level practicality scores for each mitigation
    measure reveals the degree of agreement amongst farmers, where a positive skew
    indicates high agreement and a negative skew high disagreement. There was a particularly
    high level of consensus amongst farmers on mitigation measure 24 (Conduct soil
    and crop nutrient testing and management planning); mitigation measure 19 (Improve
    timing of nitrogen fertiliser application); mitigation measure 27 (Minimise avoidable
    use of farm machinery); mitigation measure 23(Use more fuel-efficient machinery
    and equipment); mitigation measure 28 (Reduce tillage) and mitigation measure
    21 (Install buffer zones) for both practicality and economic cost (Fig S1. a-f).
    Similarly, there was high agreement for practicality on mitigation measure 26
    (Avoid or shorten bare fallow periods) and mitigation measure 15 (Reduce nitrogen
    fertiliser dose). On economic costs for these mitigation measures the scores were
    more widely distributed (Fig. S1 g-h) suggesting a weaker agreement amongst farmers
    but still some level of agreement. Similarly we observed this for both practicality
    and economic cost for mitigation measure 29 (Increase reliance on nitrogen-fixing
    crops) (Fig. S1 i). Despite above-average mean scores on mitigation measure 20
    (Eliminate tillage (i.e. zero-till)) and mitigation measure 25 (Optimise irrigation
    system efficiency to keep soil moist but not saturated), individual-level scores
    indicate higher levels of disagreement between farmers on the practicality and
    economic cost of these mitigation measures. (Fig S1 j-k). 3.6.2. Comparison of
    scores between subgroups In a further assessment of heterogeneity in farmer perceptions
    of effectiveness, practicality and economic cost, the distribution of scores between
    subgroups of both experts and farmers, based upon demographic data (Table 4),
    were compared and discussed in the discussion. No significant differences were
    found between subgroups of experts (p > 0.05) but significant differences were
    found between some farmer subgroups in both practicality and economic scores.

    size (between 500 + ha and 200–499 ha farms and 200 – 499 ha and 100 – 199 ha
    farms total peat (between 200 and 499 ha and <100 ha of peat); depth of peat (between
    >60 cm peat and those who were unsure) and age, (between those aged 35 – 44 and
    those > 55) were significant factors in the scores for practicality on some mitigation
    measures (Table 4; supplementary material 1.1). 3.6.2.2. Economic scores Kruskal-Wallis
    tests with post-hoc test using Dunn''s test with Bonferroni correction showed
    gender (between male and female farmers); farm type (between Mixed arable/horticulture
    and other farm types and other horticulture and other farm types) and location
    (between the Fens and the North East and the Fens and the North West) (mitigation
    measure 17, p < 0.01, medians, 0.30/1.62) were significant factors in the scores
    for economic cost on some mitigation measures (Table 4; supplementary material
    1.2). 4. Discussion 4.1. Comparing effectiveness, practicality and economic cost
    The two mitigation measures ranked as being the most effective at reducing GHG
    emissions were both in the restoration category, namely, 3: Restore cropland to
    native wetland vegetation and 14: Restore/create peatland vegetation. The expert
    panel in this study ranked the mitigation measures on their individual effectiveness
    at reducing GHG emissions at a farm scale. These rankings are consistent with
    other studies which show that to completely halt CO2 emissions from agriculturally
    utilised peatlands, it would be necessary to either fully restore them to wetland
    ecosystems or adopt wetter farming mitigation measures such as those associated
    with paludiculture (Evans et al., 2019). Drained and cultivated fen peats represent
    some of the world’s most productive soils (Taft et al., 2018), therefore, the
    potential socio-economic consequences of rewetting are much higher than on less
    productive upland agricultural soils (Freeman et al., 2022, Mulholland et al.,
    2020). The low farmer scores for practicality and economic cost indicate that
    farmers deem these C emission mitigation measures to be impractical to implement
    and costly. Low practicality and negative economic cost scores were also assigned
    to the other 7 mitigation measures ranked most effective at reducing GHG emissions:
    paludiculture (9: Produce biomass (Sphagnum moss) for restoration or as a raw
    material; 8: Establish wetland species such as rushes, sedges and wetland grasses
    for the production of animal litter and 5: Produce food/fodder crops on high water
    table peatland); water management (2: Raise average water levels and 1: Block
    ditches to raise water levels) and crop management (12: Cultivate cover crops
    (e.g., rye) in combination with a raised water table). In contrast, the 4 mitigation
    measures ranked most practical to implement with the least economic cost (24:
    Conduct soil and crop nutrient testing and management planning; 19: Improve timing
    of nitrogen fertiliser application; 15: Reduce nitrogen fertiliser dose and 29:
    Increase reliance on nitrogen-fixing crops (legumes)) are all in the nutrient
    management category and all have low scores for effectiveness. A comparison between
    effectiveness scores and practicality and economic cost scores found no mitigation
    measures to be ranked both effective and practical, or effective with low economic
    cost highlighting the difficulties faced by policy makers looking to meet Net
    Zero carbon targets through the re-wetting of 25 % of lowland peat by 2050 (Committee
    on Climate Change UK, 2020). Whilst water management and paludiculture mitigation
    measures may be effective at reducing GHG emissions, they face several implementation
    barriers. These include; high upfront costs for implementation; high opportunity
    costs associated with lost agricultural production; a perceived need to keep land
    permanently drained for flood management; and a lack of knowledge and skills among
    farmers and landowners to use and manage land differently (e.g. shifting from
    conventional crops to ''wet-farming''; Committee on Climate Change UK, 2020).
    Furthermore, their implementation has the potential to impact UK food production,
    which could result in the ‘off-shoring’ of GHG emissions; unless this is offset
    by increased UK production on mineral soils (Evans et al., 2019). Truly ‘sustainable’
    agricultural management may be unachievable on highly productive lowland soils
    (Wijedasa et al., 2016) but there are mitigation measures, which, if implemented,
    could reduce GHG emissions below their current levels. Changes in farm management
    practices that minimise soil disturbance, and/or changes in crop selection (particularly
    to enable higher water tables to be maintained) will reduce CO2 emissions, yet
    only these will only be marginal without implementing higher water table management,
    whilst measures that limit the use of nitrogen fertilisers are likely to reduce
    N2O emissions with significant benefits for total GHG emissions (Leppelt et al.,
    2014, Lin et al., 2022). Here we show several mitigation measures ranked by farmers
    as being both practical to implement and having a low economic cost to the farm.
    These include all 4 of the nutrient management mitigation measures; both of the
    farm machinery usage measures; all four of the regenerative management measures,
    and measure 25: Optimise irrigation system efficiency to keep soil moist but not
    saturated (water management). Individually, these mitigation measure scored low
    for effectiveness and cannot be expected to halt C loss from cultivated peatlands.
    On the other hand, a combination of reduced soil disturbance, improved nutrient
    management and use of legumes, optimisation of irrigation systems and more efficient
    fossil fuel usage would be expected to make some contribution to reducing overall
    GHG emissions from current levels, however, again these savings are marginal without
    wetter farming practices. 4.2. Heterogeneity in expert and farmer responses The
    mitigation measures ranked most effective by experts in the BWS survey are comparable
    with those scored by the expert panel who short-listed the initial mitigation
    measure list to the 30 used in the survey (Section 2.2). The actual rankings may
    differ slightly, but mitigation measures identified during shortlisting as most
    effective, are also ranked most effective in the BWS survey, showing a high level
    of agreement between the panel and the respondents to the survey. In the farmer
    surveys, analysis of the distribution of individual level scores for the 11 mitigation
    measures ranked as practical with a low economic cost, showed a high level of
    consensus across all of the mitigation measures with the exception of mitigation
    measure 20: Eliminate tillage (i.e. zero-till) and mitigation measure 25: Optimise
    irrigation system efficiency to keep soil moist but not saturated, where there
    is more disparity in responses. The UK’s exit from the European Union and the
    Common Agricultural policy has seen a reduced emphasis on direct subsidies (e.g.,
    land hectare, and a move towards a ‘public money for public goods’ approach via
    the introduction of an Environmental Land Management Scheme (ELMS) in England
    (DEFRA, 2018b). This fundamental change to agricultural policy is expected to
    see farm business income drop across all farming sectors (AHDB, 2019) but there
    may be opportunities to replace some of this income loss with public goods payments
    through ELMS (DEFRA, 2018b). On the other hand, as farm income decreases, farmers
    may be reluctant to take significant amounts of land out of production, especially
    to deliver mitigation measures involving re-wetting and restoration of native
    wetland species, which they deem to be impractical or to have a high economic
    costs to the farm business. The level of agreement between farmers on the 11 mitigation
    measures ranked high for both practicality and low economic costs means that farmers
    will be more likely to implement these mitigation measures, should they be available
    through ELMS, but based on the expert consultation undertaken these mitigation
    measures are expected to offer limited mitigation of ongoing C loss from agricultural
    peat. 4.3. Comparisons of scores between subgroups Our analysis showed no significant
    differences (p > 0.05) between expert subgroups in ranking scores for effectiveness.
    They did show some significant differences between the farmer subgroups in some
    rankings for practicality and economic cost. However, it was clear from the analysis
    that the majority of the water management, and all of the paludiculture mitigation
    measures, were consistently ranked as being impractical, and with a high negative
    economic cost on the farm business. The only clear divergence in views was in
    relation to the conversion of cropland to grassland (mitigation measure 17), with
    respondents from Northwest England (where grassland is extensive, alongside areas
    of arable and horticulture) responding more positively than farmers in the Fens
    of Eastern England, where cropland agriculture dominates. While this suggests
    some potential to mitigate emissions via changes in land-use, it should also be
    noted that there is a risk that reduced CO2 emissions resulting from higher water
    levels under grassland versus cropland could be offset by higher N2O and CH4 emissions
    in the presence of ruminant livestock (e.g. Wen et al., 2021). Apart from this
    notable divergence in attitudes to grassland agriculture, the lack of significant
    difference between the subgroups across most of the mitigation measures, is indicative
    of a high level of consensus among different farmer groups. Although this study
    has clearly highlighted key issues and challenges associated with mitigating GHG
    emissions and C loss from lowland peatland, we acknowledge the limitations of
    the study. Firstly, it would have been beneficial to survey a larger number of
    land managers to reduce the uncertainty associated with the choice of different
    mitigation measures. Secondly, we could have included other regions of the UK,
    and Europe, where cultivated peat soils occur to gain better geographical coverage.
    Thirdly, after deployment, the efficacy of each mitigation measure is expected
    to change over time in terms of its C mitigation potential (i.e. short- vs. long-term
    C gains), however, we set no time boundary for respondents. In this study, we
    also did not ask respondents to include the secondary impacts of each mitigation
    measure beyond the farm boundary (e.g. use of paludiculture products), however,
    clearly this is of importance in the overall deployment of alternative land uses.
    In future studies it would therefore be good to benchmark each of the mitigation
    measures by undertaking a full life cycle and economic assessment. Our study may
    have included some bias associated with the final choice of mitigation measures
    due to the expertise of the expert panel. In addition, we did not include potential
    future, but unproven, technologies (e.g., use of novel genetically engineered
    plants with high waterlogging tolerance or C storage potential) or consider the
    impact of future climate change scenarios or policy interventions which might
    affect the long-term viability of some mitigation options. 5. Conclusions Although
    drained agricultural lowland peat landscapes are deeply unsustainable, they are
    highly productive landscapes which make significant contributions towards food
    security. Mitigation measures aimed at increasing soil wetness were widely viewed
    as essential to reducing carbon emissions and carbon losses from lowland peat
    by experts whilst these measures were consistently viewed negatively by farmers
    (particularly when associated with cessation of food production). Reconciling
    the divergence between views through the development of policy and finance mechanisms
    to support wetter modes of farming, without leading to overall loss of income
    or food production, represents a major ongoing challenge not only in the UK, but
    across many countries in Europe, Southeast Asia and beyond. Addressing this challenge
    is essential if countries are to meet their Net Zero targets, and if the substantial
    fraction of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions generated by drained
    peatlands is to be reduced. Funding This study was funded by the UK Department

  description: Current drought conditions in the US Southwest, linked to the inherent

    make guar production an attractive option in that region. This study includes
    new US guar cultivation experimental field data to analyze the economic costs
    and environmental impacts of growing guar and transforming it into guar gum using
    comprehensive techno-economic and life cycle assessments. Additionally, an uncertainty
    analysis was included to better understand the feasibility and risks associated
    with growing guar in the US Southwest. Results show that the minimum selling price
    of guar gum is 2.71 $/kg guar gum, with a 90% confidence interval (CI) around
    the mean ranging from 1.18 to 3.87 $/kg guar gum. Agricultural expenses represent
    85% of the costs. Rent payments and irrigation represent the largest contributors
    to the guar gum minimum selling price. Net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are
    estimated at 1.87 kg CO2/kg gum, with a 90% CI ranging from 0.89 to 2.81 kg CO2/kg
    guar gum. Irrigation is the main contributor to GHG emissions. The large spread
    in the results is explained by guar yield being the most important variable to
    compute minimum selling price and GHG emissions, and by the high variability in
    guar yields across different sites.

    1. Introduction The US Southwest has been experiencing major drought conditions
    since 2000, with widespread impacts on regional water supply, food and energy
    production, environmental health, and recreational use. The periods under extreme
    and exceptional drought conditions have been reoccurring and prolonged over the
    last two decades, inducing extensive crop and pasture losses and shortages of
    water (NIDIS, 2022). Farming is a major economic activity in the US Southwest
    and the current drought conditions and dwindling water resources in the Colorado
    and Rio Grande basins as well as in the underground aquifers pose serious risks
    to the sustainability of the farming sector in the arid and semiarid regions.
    The National Integrated Drought Information System (NIDIS) estimated that in June
    2022, over 1 million hectares of hay and over 1.5 million heads of cattle are
    experiencing drought conditions in Colorado and Rio Grande basins (NIDIS, 2022).
    Switching from water-intensive crops to more drought-resistant, desert adopted
    crops can alleviate part of the water stress and bring alternative, sustainable
    economic options to the region. Guar (Cyamopsis tetragonoloba L.) is a drought
    and heat tolerant crop native to India and Pakistan, grown in arid environments
    and in marginal soils. Guar belongs to the legume family and the endosperm of
    its seeds contains galactomannans, which have outstanding thickening properties
    when mixed with fluids. Guar gum, the finely ground endosperm, is used in a variety
    of applications, including the food, textile, paper, pharmaceutical, and oil and
    gas industries. More recently, the oil and gas industry started using it for hydraulic
    fracturing (Bhatt et al., 2016, Gresta et al., 2014, Kuravadi et al., 2013) and
    the US has become the number one importer of guar gum in the world (FBI, 2021).
    Traditionally, the US has met most of its guar gum demand with imports from Asia,
    but due to increased use, the instability of world guar production (USDA, 2014),
    and supply-chain disruptions, there is a need to increase domestic supply. The
    drought-resilient characteristic of guar combined with current US market needs
    makes it a strong candidate for a new alternative agricultural crop in the US
    Southwest (Abidi et al., 2015). Previous research has demonstrated suitable conditions
    for growing guar in the US, (Alexander et al., 1988, Imel, 2015, Singla et al.,
    2016a, Singla et al., 2016b, Stafford and McMichael, 1991) and a comprehensive
    analysis of guar farming showed promising results for the conditions in the Mediterranean
    region (Gresta et al., 2014). However, a thorough economic and environmental analysis
    of guar cultivation and guar gum processing was still missing for the US. Summers
    et al. (2021) provided the first comprehensive economic and environmental assessment
    of US guar farming and guar gum manufacturing. An integrated engineering process
    model combining agriculture, transportation, and processing modules was developed
    to understand each of the processes from seed to gum. A minimum selling price
    of $1.44 per kilogram of guar gum was found to be necessary to recover capital
    and operational costs. That price is higher than the 5-year average US import
    price of guar gum, 0.99 $/kg. GHG emissions were found to be 2.67 kg CO2/kg guar
    gum. Guar cultivation was found to be responsible for over 75% of the guar gum
    minimum selling price and total GHG emissions, especially due to the economic
    and environmental impacts of irrigation. However, the results from Summers et
    al. (2021) were based on limited experimental data from one field, and the uncertainty
    around the estimates was not assessed. There exists a need to better understand
    the economics and environmental impact of US-based guar production. This work
    integrates experimental data with stochastic modeling to advance the previous
    work by Summers et al. (2021). Specifically, new field data from five experimental
    plots, refined assumptions, new and updated inputs, and uncertainty analysis using
    Monte Carlo (MC) simulations were performed to better understand the probability
    of economic success and environmental impact. 2. Methods The work presented in
    this study builds on the engineering process model and sustainability infrastructure
    presented by Summers et al. (2021). In summary, a high-resolution model was developed
    to capture the material and energy needs involved in guar cultivation and guar
    gum processing. The three modules (agricultural, transportation, and processing)
    were coupled with techno-economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA)
    to determine the economic and environmental impacts of the adoption of a guar
    gum industry in the US Southwest. The reader is referred to that paper for a complete
    description of the model. The main additions and changes with respect to that
    model are outlined in the following sections. The objective of this study is to
    provide an update on US-grown and processed guar gum minimum selling price and
    its carbon footprint. 3. Agricultural process model Agricultural inventory data
    was obtained from experimental plots cultivated in Arizona and New Mexico (US).
    Field trials tested the guar yield response to varying rates of nitrogen (N) and
    phosphorus (P) applications, irrigation amount, and germplasm type. Fertilizer
    tests were performed in four experimental plots with Kinman line. N fertilizer
    (urea) was applied at 0, 25, and 50 kg/ha rates simultaneously with P fertilizer
    (triple superphosphate) at 0, 25, and 50 kg P2O5/ha rates at planting. Results
    showed no significant yield benefits from fertilizers applied to guar under the
    study conditions. Hence, the average fertilization rates proposed in this study
    (Table 1) are lower than those presented in Summers et al. (2021), set at 6.74
    kg N/ha and 22.5 kg P2O5/ha. Table 1. Summary of guar field trials, covering the

    Germplasm tests were performed in three experimental plots. Results shown in Table
    1 represent the average of the different lines tested: Kinman, Santa Cruz, Lewis,
    and Matador. Irrigation tests were performed in Clovis, NM, varying from 150 to
    325 mm. Again, no correlation was found between irrigation water and yield in
    that location. The average yield was 1425 kg/ha, with a standard deviation of
    749 kg/ha. This average yield is higher than that reported by Summers et al. (2021),
    largely due to the high yields obtained in Tucson, whose data was not part of
    the previous study. The large spread in the results was due to a combination of
    differences in weather, soil type, and harvesting method used (harvesting by hand
    captures more seeds than harvesting with a plot combine but has low applicability
    to large-scale farming) between the sites. The structure of the transportation
    logistics process model and the downstream processing model remained unchanged
    from Summers et al. (2021) and only some minor modifications were added. Tables
    SI-1 and SI-2 in the supplementary information (SI) shows the final values used
    for each variable of the model. 4. Economic analysis 4.1. Agriculture Taking the
    economic analysis of Summers et al. (2021) as a starting point, some modifications
    were added to better reflect farming conditions. More specifically, the model
    presents these new additions: 1) a capital cost recovery method to calculate machinery
    costs at a 6% return of investment (ROI), 2) updated commodity and fertilizer
    prices, 3) a 10% discount rate (up from 6% to be more in line with the processing
    module), and 4) an annual cash land payment of $375 per hectare as an opportunity
    cost for the land. This latter addition is key because it covers family living
    withdrawals, income taxes, and management, previously excluded. Some other minor
    changes regarding machinery use, labor hours, and property taxes were included.
    5. Environmental analysis 5.1. Agriculture Nitrous oxide (N2O) field emissions
    from N-fertilizer application were calculated based on Tier 1 emission factors
    from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (De Klein et al., 2006). Both
    direct and indirect emissions due to N volatilization were included. Direct emissions
    were calculated considering that 1% of the total N applied was converted to N2O
    (kg N2O-N/kg N applied). Indirect emissions were calculated considering that 1%
    of the N applied is volatilized as NH3 and NOx and that their emission factor
    is 0.1 kg N2O-N/(kg NH3 + kg NOx), as detailed in De Klein et al. (2006). CO2
    emissions from urea application were calculated using the same reference, assuming
    that all the carbon content of the fertilizer is fully oxidized. Emission factors
    were updated using ecoinvent 3.7.1. and TRACI. 5.2. Processing Electricity emissions
    were updated using the eGRID 2020 Western Electricity Coordination Council grid
    mix (EPA, 2022). Natural gas GHG combustion emissions were updated using the methodology
    and values presented in the Compilation of Air Pollutant Emissions Factors (AP-42)
    (EPA, 1995). Upstream emissions related to the production, processing and transmission
    of natural gas up to the point of consumption were calculated based on two sources:
    fugitive CH4 emissions from Alvarez et al. (2018) and other GHG emissions from
    Weber and Clavin (2012). 6. Uncertainty analysis Probability distributions have
    been assigned to each variable of the model to understand the possible outcomes.
    The distributions assigned to each variable are shown in Tables SI-1 and SI-2
    of the SI. A Monte Carlo analysis using 10,000 iterations was performed with the
    Microsoft Excel plug-in @Risk. The only variable for which there was experimental
    data to build a probability distribution from was guar seed yield at the field
    level. The 14 data points (Table 1) were fitted to a pareto distribution, which
    minimized the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The AIC was 209. The rest of
    the probability distributions were built using literature data and the authors’
    estimates. The implications of these assumptions are discussed in the results
    section. 7. Results 7.1. Economic results Total costs of guar gum production amount
    to 3.45 $/kg (Fig. 1). The guar gum minimum selling price is reduced to 2.71 $/kg
    when the benefit of selling the coproduct as animal feed is included in the assessment.
    Growing guar represents the largest share of guar gum total costs, accounting
    for 85% of the costs. Rent payments represent the largest contributor, at 1.10
    $/kg, to guar gum minimum selling price, followed by irrigation costs (0.57 $/kg).
    Together, they contribute to roughly 62% of guar gum minimum selling price. Capital
    (0.36 $/kg), land preparation (0.32 $/kg), harvest (0.19 $/kg), plant protectants
    (0.08 $/kg), fertilizers (0.06 $/kg), and other agricultural expenses (0.24 $/kg)
    compose the remaining agricultural expenses. The rest of the costs are distributed
    between processing (14%) and transportation (1%). Labor (0.22 $/kg) and capital
    (0.13 $/kg) costs are the main components of total processing costs, followed
    by other processing costs (0.08 $/kg), natural gas and electricity (0.03 $/kg
    each). Download : Download high-res image (171KB) Download : Download full-size

    net production costs and the error bars, the 90% confidence interval around net
    production costs. The uncertainty analysis reveals a large spread in possible
    guar gum minimum selling price, with a standard deviation of 0.94 $/kg. The limits
    of the distribution are generated when low-probability and extreme occurrences
    combine. For example, a low yield of 845 kg/ha (as reported in the Clovis (NM)
    experimental plot in 2019), combined with pre-planting fertilizer rates of 10 kg N/ha
    and 20 kg P2O5/ha and 470 mm of irrigation generate a minimum selling price of
    4.57 $/kg guar gum. A maximum of 4.72 $/kg guar gum is obtained by adding the
    most unfavorable values for the rest of the variables of the model. Conversely,
    the most favorable combination of yield, fertilization, and irrigation lowers
    the minimum selling price to 0.55 $/kg guar gum, and further down to 0.23 $/kg
    guar gum when the most favorable values of the rest of the inputs are considered.

    Guar yield is the variable that introduces the highest variance in the model (Fig.
    3). The guar seed yield distribution defined in this study, based on two years
    of field data, can alone make guar gum minimum selling price range 1.18 – 3.87
    $/kg for the upper (2950 kg/ha) and lower (863 kg/ha) 90% bounds of the guar seed
    yield distribution, respectively. The coproduct selling price (mean of 0.31 $/kg
    with 90% CI ranging 0.17–0.51 $/kg) is the second largest contributor to model
    variance, being able to change the guar gum minimum selling price between 2.23
    and 3.01 $/kg for the values defined by the distribution. Rent payments and the
    endosperm fraction have a large impact on guar gum minimum selling price as well,
    fluctuating the minimum selling price between 2.34 and 3.09 $/kg for the former
    and between 2.42 and 3.12 $/kg for the latter. The rest of the variables of the
    model, as defined with their uncertainty distributions, have a more limited impact
    on total costs, modifying the minimum selling price within a ± 0.20 $/kg range.

    Fig. 3. Impact of input variability on guar gum minimum selling price. 8. Environmental
    analysis Total, unallocated GHG emissions of guar gum are 2.52 kg CO2/kg guar
    gum. Net GHG emissions of guar gum (economic allocation factor for guar gum is
    74%) amount to 1.87 kg CO2/kg guar gum, being the difference with respect to total
    GHG emissions allocated to guar meal. GHG emissions are distributed between growing
    guar (1.55 kg CO2/kg guar gum), transportation to the processing facility (0.01 kg
    CO2/kg guar gum), and processing the gum (0.31 kg CO2/kg guar gum), Fig. 4. The
    largest contributor to GHG emissions is irrigation (0.88 kg CO2/kg guar gum),
    followed by land preparation (0.38 kg CO2/kg guar gum), and harvesting (0.20 kg
    CO2/kg guar gum). Soil emissions from fertilizer application are minimal because
    of the low amount of fertilizers used. If system expansion was considered instead
    of economic allocation for co-product crediting, net GHG emissions would be 0.91 kg
    CO2/kg guar gum. The large credit received, − 1.61 kg CO2/kg guar gum, is the
    result of guar meal displacing standard animal feed, whose farming and processing
    is more GHG intensive than guar meal. Download : Download high-res image (124KB)

    The white square shows the net GHG emissions and the error bars, the 90% confidence
    interval around net GHG emissions. As observed with the guar gum minimum selling
    price, there is a large spread in the carbon footprint of guar gum (Fig. 5). The
    standard deviation is 0.58 kg CO2/kg guar gum and the 90% confidence interval
    around the mean ranges between 0.89 and 2.81 kg CO2/kg guar gum. Indeed, variability
    in guar seed yield (90% CI ranging 863–2950 kg/ha) can result in a carbon footprint
    within the range of 0.91 – 2.48 kg CO2/kg guar gum, and the economic allocation
    factor (which depends on the co-product selling price) can make the carbon footprint
    range between 1.53 and 2.15 kg CO2/kg guar gum (Fig. 6) for the distribution defined
    in this study. Irrigation emissions also introduce uncertainty in the model. It
    is worth noting that the distribution for the irrigation emission factor defined
    is built around the Ecoinvent 3.7.1 emission factor, which considers a mix of
    electricity and diesel to obtain the emissions. If renewable energy alone was
    used to power the irrigation system, the guar gum carbon footprint would be 0.99 kg
    CO2/kg guar gum. Hence, special attention should be paid to irrigation emissions
    when determining the carbon footprint of a specific guar field. The rest of the
    model variables have a limited impact on the final carbon footprint, not inducing
    variability outside ± 0.20 kg CO2/kg guar gum. Download : Download high-res image

    9. Difference between deterministic and probabilistic results There are noticeable
    differences between the deterministic and the probabilistic results of this study.
    As explained above, yield is the most important variable of the model. Because
    the relationship between yield and guar gum minimum selling price is not linear,
    the minimum selling price of the average yield (2.08 $/kg, red dot in Fig. 7)
    is different from the average minimum selling price considering each field trial
    yield (2.65 $/kg, black dot in Fig. 7) or each MC simulation individually. This
    explains the large difference between the deterministic guar gum minimum selling
    price of 2.08 $/kg and the 2.71 $/kg value presented earlier in the results section
    of this study. For illustrative purposes, only field trial yields have been included
    in Fig. 7, and not all the MC simulation points that make up the 2.71 $/kg result.
    The same applies to the guar gum carbon footprint. A deterministic analysis (considering
    only the average seed yield) generates a guar gum carbon footprint of 1.61 kg
    CO2/kg guar gum (red triangle in Fig. 7), while our study reveals a larger footprint,
    1.87 kg CO2/kg guar gum (black triangle in Fig. 7) when all the possible values
    for yield and other variables are considered during the MC simulation. Download

    10. Comparison with previous studies Summers et al. (2021) presented a guar gum
    minimum selling price of 1.44 $/kg, as opposed to the value of 2.71 $/kg shown
    in this study. There are two main reasons that explain this difference. First,
    as mentioned in the section about the differences between deterministic and probabilistic
    studies, the minimum selling price from the average yield is not the same as the
    average minimum selling price of different yields, which the MC simulation provides.
    The deterministic guar gum minimum selling price from this study is 2.08 $/kg
    and that is the value that should be used for comparisons with previous literature,
    based on average yields. Secondly, the annual cash rent payments were included
    in this study as a novelty. If they were excluded, a guar gum minimum selling
    price of 1.22 $/kg would be obtained, lower than the 1.44 $/kg reported in the
    aforementioned study. This difference is largely explained by a higher average
    yield reported in this study (1425 kg/ha vs 1024 kg/ha) and the rest of the modifications
    explained in the methods section. The net carbon footprint presented in this study,
    1.87 kg CO2/kg guar gum, is lower than the carbon footprint presented by Summers
    et al. (2021), estimated at 2.67 kg CO2/kg guar gum. The carbon footprint relative
    to the average guar yield is even lower, at 1.61 kg CO2/kg guar gum. The main
    reason for this difference is an update in the irrigation emission factor used.
    Summers et al. (2021) adapted generic irrigation energy and material flows from
    Ecoinvent 3.4 to obtain an irrigation emission factor, while in our study, the
    Ecoinvent 3.7.1 sprinkler irrigation factor was used (0.36 kg CO2/m3 vs 0.17 kg
    CO2/m3, respectively). This makes irrigation emissions go down from 2.40 to 1.10 kg
    CO2/kg guar gum when irrigation amounts are combined with their emission factors.
    In addition to this, the higher average guar seed yield, and the lower fertilization
    rates considered in this study explain most of the remaining differences between
    the carbon footprint presented in this study and those reported by Summers et
    al. (2021). Guar agricultural production costs presented in this study (1240 $/ha
    considering a 30% yield from guar seed to guar gum and the average guar seed production)
    are lower than those presented in Gresta et al. (2014), estimated at 2897 - 3315
    $/ha for their case studies. The reasons for this difference were already reported
    by Summers et al. (2021), namely lower fertilization, irrigation, and seeding
    rates. These same factors explain the lower GHG emissions per ha of guar calculated
    in this study, 910 kg CO2/ha, compared to those of Gresta et al. (2014), estimated
    at 3000 kg CO2/ha. 11. Discussion Compared to the pre-Covid 19 pandemic 5-year
    average US import price of guar gum, 0.99 $/kg, guar cultivation and gum manufacturing
    would not be cost-competitive with imports. Ceteris paribus, price parity would
    be reached for guar seed yields of more than 2600 kg/ha, which were obtained in
    the experimental field in Tucson for two consecutive years. Further work should
    examine the specific agronomic conditions that can lead to similar high yields
    of guar at other locations like in the Arizona sites. Also, given current supply-chain
    disruptions, slightly higher guar gum domestic production costs could still be
    interesting from a security standpoint. Uncertainty distributions were created
    around every input of the model using field trial data when available and literature
    values and expert judgment in their absence. The uncertainty distributions were
    designed to cover most of the likely values each variable can take. However, some
    possible values might exceed the bounds defined. The impact of these occurrences
    is not thought to be significant for most of the variables of the model. As shown
    in Fig. 3, Fig. 6, only a small set of variables induces large variability in
    model outputs, the most relevant one being yield, whose uncertainty distribution
    was built using field data. For the rest of the significant contributors to the
    minimum selling price and carbon footprint, the most extreme situations have been
    described throughout the paper and their impact on final results shown, namely,
    the inability to use the guar meal co-product, excluding rent payments, and having
    renewable energy-powered irrigation systems. 12. Conclusions Current drought conditions
    in the US Southwest, low water demand of guar and the increased demand for guar
    gum, can make growing guar an attractive option in that region. In this study,
    we presented new experimental field data and updated model assumptions that were
    used in a re- assessment of economic and environmental impacts of guar cultivation
    and processing into gum. Additionally, an uncertainty analysis based on Monte
    Carlo simulations was run to estimate the range of possible outcomes. Results
    showed that the minimum selling price of guar gum cultivated and processed in
    the US Southwest is 2.71 $/kg with a 90% confidence interval of 1.18–3.87 $/kg.
    The large spread of the results was explained by the guar yield variability, which
    has a strong impact on the model output. This minimum selling price is higher
    than guar gum imports to the US thereby making locally produced guar gum non-competitive.
    Achieving higher guar yields is crucial to making domestic guar gum competitive
    with imports. Agricultural expenses, dominated by rent payments and irrigation,
    represent 85% of the costs. The impact of the processing is limited (14%) and
    that of transportation is minimal (1%). Total GHG emissions from guar gum manufacturing
    amount to 2.52 kg CO2/kg. Net GHG emissions after economically allocating emissions
    to guar meal sold as animal feed are 1.87 kg CO2/kg, with a 90% confidence interval
    ranging from 0.89 to 2.81 kg CO2/kg guar gum. As observed with the guar gum minimum
    selling price, guar yield is the variable that introduces the largest uncertainty
    in the model and the agricultural part represents 85% of the GHG emissions, with
    irrigation alone responsible for 40% of the total carbon footprint. CRediT authorship

  description: Water resource management should be conducted from a multidisciplinary
    perspective. In this sense, the objective of this work is to analyze, from the
    perspective of the circular economy, the technical–economic feasibility of implementing
    different alternatives for the regeneration of wastewater for its subsequent reuse
    in industrial and sports companies located in Bogotá, Colombia. The development
    of the methodology is carried out through the method of economic cost–benefit
    analysis (ACB) and the technique of net present value (NPV). These methodologies
    facilitate decision making based on the economic feasibility of recovering the
    initial investment costs and the operating costs during the useful life of the
    WWTP. Establishing the cost and price of reclaimed water is essential to the efficient
    management of water resources; so far, the studies carried out only focus on the
    economic viability of the internal costs of the system, while the private impacts
    and the externalities are excluded and relegated to unsubstantiated statements
    about the advantages of water reuse. The economic feasibility incorporating the
    analysis of externalities presents a total profit that ranges between 6.52 EUR/m3
    for the industrial sector and 2503 EUR/m3 for the irrigation of golf courses.
    This analysis demonstrates the technical and economic feasibility of carrying
    out a circular economy where the water already used returns as a new source of
    supply.

    Notes Abstract Water resource management should be conducted from a multidisciplinary
    perspective. In this sense, the objective of this work is to analyze, from the
    perspective of the circular economy, the technical–economic feasibility of implementing
    different alternatives for the regeneration of wastewater for its subsequent reuse
    in industrial and sports companies located in Bogotá, Colombia. The development
    of the methodology is carried out through the method of economic cost–benefit
    analysis (ACB) and the technique of net present value (NPV). These methodologies
    facilitate decision making based on the economic feasibility of recovering the
    initial investment costs and the operating costs during the useful life of the
    WWTP. Establishing the cost and price of reclaimed water is essential to the efficient
    management of water resources; so far, the studies carried out only focus on the
    economic viability of the internal costs of the system, while the private impacts
    and the externalities are excluded and relegated to unsubstantiated statements
    about the advantages of water reuse. The economic feasibility incorporating the
    analysis of externalities presents a total profit that ranges between 6.52 EUR/m3
    for the industrial sector and 2503 EUR/m3 for the irrigation of golf courses.
    This analysis demonstrates the technical and economic feasibility of carrying
    out a circular economy where the water already used returns as a new source of
    supply. Keywords: circular economy; externalities; opportunity costs; reuse of
    treated wastewater; supply and demand of reclaimed water 1. Introduction The “El
    Salitre” treatment plant is in the city of Bogotá, and it is the one in charge
    of treating the wastewater from the north of the town, with a current load capacity
    equivalent to 2 million people. The WWTP begins with a pretreatment followed by
    a primary treatment of settling tanks that are subsequently dumped into the Bogotá
    River. Due to the scarcity of water that is occurring, and the pollution generated
    by the bodies of water, a proposal is made that allows decisions to be made for
    a process of efficient regeneration and reuse of water. Resolution 1096 of 2000
    of the Republic of Colombia emerged as a mandatory regulatory instrument within
    the territory to provide treatment to wastewater and include it again for reuse.
    The purpose of this study is to analyze technically and economically the feasibility
    of implementing an alternative that allows the recovery of the costs of water
    regeneration and reuse, obtaining private economic profit from the commercialization
    of this resource. In addition, the evaluation allows the analysis and evaluation
    of the externalities of the system, such as the decrease in contamination generated
    by surface water bodies. The companies selected to supply them with reclaimed
    water are characterized by having processes with high water consumption and their
    proximity to the WWTP “El Salitre”. Considering this framework, the marginal costs
    of producing reclaimed water versus obtaining it from a conventional source and
    its total profits are established. 1.1. Wastewater Treatment and Reuse Currently,
    the “El Salitre” treatment plant has a process that begins with a pre-treatment
    that allows the removal of those bulky and fine solids as well as removing sand,
    fats, and oils; this is organized so that it does not affect the other subsequent
    processes. The primary treatment is a sedimentation process that removes up to
    40% of DBO5 and 60% of total suspended solids (TSS). With this process, the effluent
    obtained is still of low quality to be reused in the different potential uses
    that exist. For this reason, the proposal is to analyze the use of a secondary
    treatment that involves a biological treatment process, either (1) activated sludge
    or (2) trickling filters; in both cases, these processes are accompanied by a
    settler. The secondary treatment achieves up to 95% removal of DBO5 and suspended
    solids. To increase the quality of the regenerated water, two tertiary treatments
    are proposed through disinfection: (1) disinfection via chlorine or (2) UV radiation.
    1.2. The Circular Economy as a Solution to the Problem of Scarcity The existence
    of water as a non-renewable resource opens the door to the development of different
    techniques that make it possible to extend the useful life of this resource; even
    though water is a basic necessity for all living beings, it is wasted and contaminated
    indiscriminately, due to the industrial, commercial, agricultural, and residential
    activities carried out by man [1]. Many countries are seeing the need to adopt
    new strategies that allow them to make posthumous use of wastewater, both domestic
    and industrial, and studies have shown that the reuse of this is one of the most
    economical and efficient alternatives [2]. This reuse is essential for those areas
    that are arid, semi-arid, or that simply do not have a large quantity of the water
    resource. In the same way, it manages to solve pollution problems and allows an
    increase in the availability of a resource without the need to over-exploit the
    conventional sources (surface or underground waters). The reclaiming of treated
    wastewater should be considered as a new source of unconventional resources, whose
    management must be included in the comprehensive planning of water resources,
    considering economic, social, and environmental issues [3,4]. Reclaimed water
    can be used in traditional processes that do not require high quality, releasing
    volumes of better quality for other and more demanding uses [5]. Currently, many
    cities are presenting limitations on the use of drinking water, which is why they
    have chosen to use systems that allow the reuse of wastewater that is subjected
    to different types of processes, which adapt its quality depending on what it
    will be used for. The circular economy concept is related to the efficient use
    of natural resources, thus seeking to develop two fundamental aspects: smart growth,
    which becomes inclusive and sustainable economically, socially, and environmentally.
    In this way, it is achieved that the behavior of exploitation and use of water
    is not linear; on the contrary, the life cycle is closed, making it a constant
    resource and maintaining it as long as possible [6]. The behavior of the circular
    economy revolves around the relationship that exists between the reclaimed water
    market and potential end users. This is based on the promotion of sustainable
    practices and the efficient use that should be made of water resources. This type
    of economic model not only ensures that the economy grows but at the same time
    allows for a reduction in the indiscriminate exploitation of water basins and
    aquifers, for which reason a linear model that generates pollution and does not
    allow for a fulfilling helpful life is not followed for this resource [7]. The
    transition that is made from the linear to the circular model is to encourage
    the most efficient use of water innovation, with economic incentives for those
    who could be potential end users; likewise, it improves the capacity of an economy
    to manage the demands of the growing imbalance between the supply and demand of
    water [8]. 1.3. Economic Aspects of the Circular Model From the economic perspective
    of applying the concept of circular economy, the reuse of wastewater is presented
    as a “win-to-win” relationship [9,10]. The specific purpose of the circular economy
    is to create a behavior that closes the cycles of the resources and extends their
    useful life by adapting their quality for future use. When talking about reuse,
    a sustainable alternative is provided to avoid overexploitation of watersheds
    or aquifers; unfortunately, as these resources are cheap, society will continue
    to overexploit the resource, causing constant waste without foreseeing it for
    the future. The fact that water is consecrated as a vital right implies that it
    is often free, or the price paid is very little; this is questioned, as there
    are more and more economic charges associated with exploitation. Therefore the
    economic convenience is reflected in the investment of infrastructure for regeneration
    plants. This implies evaluating associated costs incurred for investment, operation,
    and maintenance as well as the construction of networks for distribution to different
    end users [11]. Once these costs are available, the minimum sale price of reclaimed
    water must be established, which must guarantee the recovery of the costs incurred
    and generate an economic profit. Generally, the costs of wastewater regeneration
    vary depending on the final use, whether for potable use or not, as well as whether
    it includes aspects of quality, supply, and quantity requirements [12,13]. Generally,
    purchasing reclaimed water is better for potential end users since they are not
    only encouraged by discounts on the rates they currently pay, but they also benefit
    from a continuous supply due to the amount of water released. Water and wastewater
    management is one of the biggest challenges for the CE as many kinds of industries
    depend on water [14], and limited access to clean water resources can limit both
    production capacity and profits. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Definition of Scope
    Study Table 1 shows the main characteristics of the city of Bogotá. Currently,
    economic activities represent 23.6% of the primary sector, secondary 40%, and
    tertiary 36.3%. It is important to note that, in Bogotá, the impact on the consumption
    of water resources by industry is quite high, and agriculture is the same. Therefore,
    the reclaimed water supply will be focused on this area. Table 1. General aspects
    of Bogotá. (Own elaboration from the cited sources.) Table 2 stipulates the water
    flows demanded and the alternatives of the possible users that would make the
    reuse of the reclaimed water, always starting from the quality characteristics
    stipulated by the Colombian legal framework. Table 2. Alternatives for companies
    to reuse treated water. (Own elaboration from the cited sources.) The wastewater
    generated in the city of Bogotá is currently treated in a primary treatment system
    within the “El Salitre” plant (currently under expansion and will begin operations
    in mid-2021); from this effluent, a proposal of different alternatives that are
    adapted to the already existing infrastructure was developed. The criteria stipulated
    to be able to use reclaimed water are established by Resolution 1207/2014 of the
    Colombian government [21]. The exclusive use of reclaimed water can only be used
    for agricultural, industrial, or recreational use. Likewise, it starts from the
    guidelines recommended by the World Health Organization [22], demanding the elimination
    of any pathogen that may directly or indirectly harm human beings. Table 3 shows
    in detail the information previously mentioned. Table 3. Quality criteria for
    reuse alternatives. Source: [21]. The expansion and optimization of the Wastewater
    Treatment Plant, PTAR Salitre Phase II, includes the following process: activated
    sludge followed by a secondary decanter to increase the efficiency of discharge
    quality; with these new treatment units, an approximate elimination will be achieved
    of SS (60–99%), BOD (60–99%), Total Coliforms (60–99%), and Nutrients (10–55%).
    Regarding tertiary treatment (Asano, 2007), a filtration process with disinfection
    is proposed, and this allows a high quality of the final effluent, achieving removal
    of SS (>99%), BOD (>99%), Total Coliforms (>99.9%), and Nutrients (>90%). Through
    interviews and consultations with experts [23,24,25] the costs incurred for construction,
    operation, and maintenance were established. On the other hand, the externalities
    that could impact the project were identified, either positive (income or benefit)
    or negative (expense or disadvantage), and likewise, the opportunity cost is included,
    which refers to the cost generated by investing the funds destined for the plant
    in another activity that generates greater profitability. In this case, an investment
    analysis was made of the total cost of carrying out the project in the purchase
    of government bonds, which raises a gain of 6.72% over 10 years. 2.2. Economic
    Analysis The economic analysis starts with establishing, analyzing, quantifying,
    and monetarily evaluating the impacts of the project for a given area. This analysis
    is because the cost that is being incurred is real, which means the project manages
    to make the treatment of wastewater at a minimum cost. Said identification starts
    from those already existing impacts in the “El Salitre” treatment plant and those
    derived from carrying out the treatment based on the advantages and costs of investment,
    operation, and maintenance. This also allows for the comparison of the marginal
    costs of producing reclaimed water versus the cost of obtaining a quantity of
    water from another source of supply. The valuation methodology analyzes the economic
    behavior of the treatment plant, this includes all the private costs and profits
    that are measurable in financial terms; therefore, the total profits are maximized,
    using private profits as a starting point, taking into account positive or negative
    externalities and opportunity costs [26,27]. The objective function is determined
    as follows (see Equation (1)): P T = ∑ n n=0 [( RAV n ∗ S V n ) − ( IC n + CO
    M n + FC n + T n ) + ( PE n − NE n )− OC n ] (1) where PT = Total Profit; RAV
    = Annual Volume of Regenerated Water; SV = Sale Price of reclaimed water; IC =
    Investment Cost; FC = Financial Costs; T = Tax; PE = Positive Externalities; NE
    = Negative Externalities; OC = Opportunity Costs; COM = Cost of Operation and
    Maintenance; and n = Year. 2.3. Aggregation of Costs and Incomes The private costs
    obtained in Table 4 and Table 5 refer to the costs of each of the processes where
    the selection was based on a cost-efficiency analysis, and from this analysis,
    the selected technology was activated sludge followed by a tertiary treatment
    of disinfection and UV rays due to its high level of efficiency in pollutant removal.
    Table 4. Investment, operation, maintenance, and water regeneration costs per
    m3 for selected water line options. Table 5. Final cost of sludge treatment (own
    elaboration). The private costs obtained in Table 4 and Table 5 refer to the costs
    of each of the processes. The selection was based on a cost-efficiency analysis,
    and from this analysis, the selected technology was activated sludge followed
    by a tertiary treatment of disinfection and UV rays due to its high level of efficiency
    in pollutant removal. With the information presented in Table 4 and Table 5, the
    minimum sale price (MSP) of reclaimed water is calculated, and this price guarantees
    the recovery of the expected costs and profits, and this investment must be made
    under the net present value criterion, which indicates the profitability of the
    project. Therefore, the (MSP) is calculated from the net cash flow (Equation (2)),
    when the net present value is equal to zero (see Equation (3)). NCF=MSP–C–T (2)
    where NCF = Net cash flow; C = Costs; MSP = Minimum sale price; and T = Tax. NPV=−IC+
    ∑ n 0 NCF n (1+i) n =0 (3) where NPV = Net Present Value; i = discount rate; IC
    = Investment Cost; n = annual discount; and FNE = net cash flow. The following
    assumptions for economic analysis are made for the technical and fiscal characteristics:
    Project lifespan: 20 years; Tax depression 5.5%; There is a 19% tax lien; Inflation
    and uncertainty are not considered since the analysis is for one year (it is a
    static analysis); Opportunity costs are calculated from interest rates of 6.72%
    on state bonds. The construction of networks for the distribution of reclaimed
    water to end users depends on the distance from the treatment plant and is stipulated
    in Table 6. Table 6. Total investment cost in distribution networks and distribution
    cost of end users of reclaimed water. In Table 7, the results of the total costs
    obtained for each of the companies are presented. As can be seen, in the case
    of Sellopack, a distribution cost of 0.0336 EUR/m3, is added to the minimum price
    of sale of 1.3886 EUR/m3 (this cost is the result of the sum of the MSP for water
    treatment, 1.2282 EUR/m3, and the MSP for sludge treatment, 0.1604 EUR/m3), meaning
    that the treatment and distribution of reclaimed water for this company is at
    1.3922 EUR/m3; currently, they pay 6.39 EUR/m3 for conventional supply. Table
    7. Total cost of producing and distributing reclaimed water. However, with bilateral
    agreements, it would be possible to establish a discount equivalent to 15% on
    the price they currently pay; this indicates that they have to pay 5.43 EUR/m3,
    which is reflected in Table 8. Table 8. Sale price of reclaimed water with a 15%
    discount. Table 9 establishes the private profits generated by the wastewater
    regeneration process; these are based not only on the profit obtained by end users
    but also by the company providing the service, “Acueducto de Bogotá”. Table 9.
    Private profits. On the other hand, there are the costs of private profits that
    are not only generated for the provider company Acueducto de Bogotá but also for
    end users that not only have a discount percentage but also positions them as
    environmental and sustainable companies. 2.4. Total Profit Now, from these costs,
    the total profit is calculated, which is also based on generating a maximization
    based on private profits, the economic valuation of negative and positive externalities,
    and the opportunity cost (Equation (4)). This allows us to validate the economic
    decision making for the regeneration of residual water and its subsequent reuse,
    and this decision is given by the entity in charge, which is Acueducto de Bogotá.
    P T = P P + P E –OC (4) where PT = Total Profit (Total Income − Total Costs);
    PP = Private Profit (Private income - Private costs); PE = Profit from Externalities
    (Income externalities − Costs externalities); and OC = Opportunity Costs. 3. Results
    and Discussion As can be seen in Table 10, the quantification and assessment of
    the impacts generated by the implementation of the proposal allow us to determine
    that the total profit obtained by each of the companies varies in favor of distance
    factors and costs for the sale of m3 of reclaimed water for each of the established
    sectors. In the four companies, the feasibility of implementation is determined
    due to the recovery of the investment and exploitation and maintenance costs,
    but it also shows the greatest difference between the probable maximum income
    and the minimum sale price. By the above, the sectors that generate the greatest
    profit are those with industrial characteristics, with a profit oscillating among
    6.52 EUR/m3 of reclaimed and distributed water, in the case of the agriculture
    sector a lower profit is presented due to being subsidized by the state. Table
    10. Analysis of the economic quantification of the externalities of the project.
    The results obtained allow us to open the change path from a linear economy based
    on extraction, adaptation, distribution, use, and discharge to a circular economy
    that materializes in repeatedly using water, managing to establish the dynamics
    of the natural cycle. This achieves a balance between the efficacy of the different
    treatment systems, their economic viability, and their impact as sustainable behavior
    on a large scale. As can be seen in Table 9, it can be stated that the profits
    represent a gain of approximately 4.04 EUR/m3 for the industrial sector and 1.70
    EUR/m3 for the sports sector. This indicates that not only the cost incurred by
    regeneration is recovered but also that profits were obtained. The four selected
    companies are feasible as end users, obtaining a maximum profit for them, ranging
    from 0.96 EUR/m3 and 2.24 EUR/m3 for the irrigation of golf courses. Despite not
    having quantified all externalities due to the lack of information, the model
    shows that since they are only positive externalities, their calculation would
    only increase the profitability of the proposed project, so the viability will
    not be affected. The model provides an appropriate tool for the planning and management
    of water resources. 4. Conclusions The water sector in Bogotá, Colombia is in
    a transitional phase with unique opportunities for water reuse to be implemented
    on a large scale as a sustainable practice within a framework of integrated water
    management. Water is crucial for economic development since it interacts with
    all the sectors. The circular economy has become a fundamental model for environmental
    management, especially in the water sector. The main approach is based mainly
    on the fact that water reuse can spread the water already used, increasing the
    availability of water resources. Consequently, reclaimed water can be used in
    traditional processes that do not require high quality, releasing volumes of better
    quality for other and more demanding uses [5,40]. The main contribution made by
    this study is the analysis of the economic viability of the proposed alternative,
    generating lines of support for decision making. This described methodology makes
    it possible to ensure that the investment of costs allows for obtaining a maximization
    of total profits. Likewise, a series of externalities are evaluated to be able
    to identify, quantify, and value economically their impact on implementation.
    The minimum sale price is determined under the net present value (NPV) criterion;
    the selection of the four companies presents a maximization of total profit for
    the industrial sector of 5.43 EUR/m3 and companies in the special sector of 4.15
    EUR/m3. For this reason, the proposed alternative and the selection of possible
    end users show the feasibility of the implementation. For these companies, the
    economic profit will be presented at a low price for reclaimed water with a constant
    supply instead of paying for the conventional source, which is more expensive
    and is subjected to supply cuts due to dry seasons. This alternative must follow
    the quality standards that are legally required to guarantee the safety of the
    reuse of reclaimed water implemented in a circular economy context; in addition,
    this work provides a scientific contribution that should facilitate a comprehensive
    evaluation of costs and benefits. For future research, it is recommended to address
    limitations that were not taken into account in the development of this methodology,
    such as the analysis of the selected technologies and determining their reliability,
    performance, robustness, and resilience; in the economic part, it is recommended
    to evaluate the price difference in the price of fresh water vs. reclaimed water,
    since the difference is not notable, making treated and reclaimed water not competitive
    enough; and in the social part, it is necessary to face challenges for public
    acceptance of the use of treated and reclaimed water in connection with the industrial,
    agricultural, or recreational sectors, thus achieving a successful exchange of
    resources. Author Contributions M.A.U.V.: prepared the article including conceptualization,

  description: This study focused on assessing the extent of pollution in both flowing
    and non-flowing surface water within the Matjhabeng mining area of South Africa,
    with particular emphasis on the substantial impact of gold mine tailings. A comprehensive
    analysis of physical water-quality attributes, including potentially toxic elements
    (PTEs), and relevant pollution risk indices was undertaken. To comprehensively
    elucidate the potential risks to aquatic organisms and human health, a risk assessment
    framework predicated upon the source–pathway–receptor model was developed. Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA) was employed as a multivariate statistical tool to discern
    the potential origins of PTE contamination within the environment. The results
    substantiate pronounced pollution manifestations within the surface water milieu
    of the Matjhabeng mining area. Specifically, concentrations of critical PTEs,
    such as arsenic, cobalt, copper, iron, selenium, and zinc, exhibited transgressions
    of the regulatory thresholds stipulated by both the South African Department of
    Water Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) and the Canadian Council of the Ministers of
    the Environment (CCME). Additionally, concentrations of the aforementioned elements
    exceeded the stipulated DWAF guidelines for irrigation water usage. Pollution
    indices, encompassing the Single-Factor Pollution Index and the Nemerow Integrated
    Pollution Index, discerned moderate contamination stemming from As, while remarkably
    elevated pollution levels were identified for selenium. PCA elucidated 94.5% of
    the aggregate variance, revealing cobalt, copper, nickel, and zinc as coalescing
    within PC1, indicative of a common anthropogenic provenance that is conceivably
    linked to historical gold mine tailings. PC2 exhibited an aggregation of chromium,
    iron, and lead, reaffirming this shared anthropogenic etiology. The third PCA
    component was characterized by selenium, followed by arsenic and magnesium in
    the fourth. The resultant PTE contamination underscores a profound ecological
    and public health risk, impacting both the aquatic ecosystems and the local community
    within the precincts of the Matjhabeng Local Municipality (MLM) area, with consequential
    amplification of susceptibilities to deleterious health consequences. Urgent and
    concerted interventions are imperative to ameliorate the emergent decline in surface-water
    quality within the MLM locale. The adoption of nature-based remediation paradigms
    holds promise for efficaciously elevating water quality, ameliorating community
    health, and underpinning the long-term economic viability of the region.

    natural resource, water is indispensable for the survival of all living organisms
    on the planet. Additionally, surface water plays a crucial role in facilitating
    various human activities, such as agriculture, industry, mining, and recreation,
    and is a key driver of economic development [1,2]. However, in recent times, there
    has been growing concern over the pollution of surface water due to the proliferation
    of anthropogenic activities in the vicinity of these water sources. These activities
    include industrial and mining operations, wastewater treatment plants, abattoirs,
    and breweries, as well as agricultural practices, such as crop farming, livestock
    farming, and game farming [1,2]. While certain natural phenomena such as volcanic
    eruptions or evaporation may contribute to water pollution, the majority of water
    pollution is caused by human activities that take place on land [3]. Mining activities
    such as mine tailings are identified as the most significant sources of surface-water
    contamination in the vicinity of mining operations [4,5,6]. Surface-water contamination
    from mining activities can result from both point and diffuse sources of pollution.
    Point source pollution occurs when mining effluent is discharged into surface-
    water bodies through pipes or drains. On the other hand, mine tailing contaminants
    can be transmitted into surface water through wind, rainwater runoff, infiltration,
    the percolation of rainwater into soil and rocks, as well as groundwater flow
    [7,8,9,10,11]. Additionally, if a tailings dam leaks or collapses it could result
    in the release of contaminants from mine tailings into surface water [10,12,13,14,15,16,17,18].
    Furthermore, the contaminants from polluted surface water may also leach into
    nearby soils and groundwater [18,19,20]. The pollution of surface water has far-reaching
    consequences, including threats to aquatic ecosystems, adverse socio-economic
    impacts, and detrimental effects on human health when communities are exposed
    to contaminated water [21]. Moreover, the persistence of contaminants in the environment
    exacerbates the overall deterioration of ecosystems and communities [22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36].
    Potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in surface water, due to their non-biodegradable
    properties, can accumulate over time in specific body tissues of aquatic organisms,
    leading to significant threats to ecosystems [37]. These PTEs can then move from
    one trophic level to the next in the food chain, increasing as they are passed
    from a lower to a higher trophic level [38,39]. The use of surface water contaminated
    with PTEs for domestic purposes, recreational activities, and the irrigation of
    crops is a major health risk for communities [40]. Water pollution from mine tailing
    contamination has become a global issue, affecting various countries in Asia,
    Australia, Africa, and the United States [10,12,13,14,15,16,17,18]. For instance,
    in Mongolia in northern China, high concentrations of arsenic (As) and mercury
    (Hg) were found in rivers near a gold mine [41]. Similarly, in the Gold Ridge
    mine of Guadalcanal towards the south of Australia, river courses and sediments
    were contaminated with high levels of As, which were about ten times higher than
    the recommended levels in the area [40]. In African countries such as Kenya and
    Cameroon, mining activities in abandoned mining areas have resulted in high concentrations
    of arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), and lead
    (Pb) which exceeded the recommended limits in surface water [19,42,43]. These
    findings underscore the importance of addressing the issue of mine tailing contamination
    to protect the environment and human health. The risk of surface-water pollution
    to aquatic organisms and human health can be evaluated using the source–pathway–receptor
    (SPR) model, which serves as a risk assessment framework [44]. Originally developed
    in the natural sciences, the SPR model describes the movement of pollutants from
    a specific source to a potential receptor via a transport pathway or route [45,46,47].
    One of the key advantages of the SPR model is its flexibility and simplicity,
    which allows for the identification of the various components and their relationships
    within a complex system [47]. As a result, control options can be implemented
    to remediate pollution and mitigate the associated health risks to the community,
    thereby developing effective emergency procedures. This study focused on the anthropogenic
    sources of surface-water pollution, with particular emphasis on the pressing issue
    of mine tailings and mining-related contamination, to comprehensively evaluate
    the potential risks of PTE pollution of surface water on aquatic ecosystems and
    human health by using a risk assessment framework based on the innovative SPR
    model proposed in this study (Figure 1). Figure 1. Risk assessment framework developed
    by applying the source–pathway–receptor model. The risk assessment framework employed
    in this study was established through the application of the SPR model. The framework
    comprehensively examines the interplay of sources, pathways, and receptors of
    PTE pollution. Sources of contamination include various sectors, such as mining,
    industries, and agriculture, that release pollutants into the environment. The
    pathways through which these pollutants travel can be either point sources characterized
    by direct discharge into surface water bodies, or diffuse sources, which involve
    pollutants spreading through soil, groundwater, or the atmosphere. The ultimate
    receptors of concern are aquatic ecosystems and human health, both of which can
    be significantly impacted by PTE pollution. This framework offers a structured
    and comprehensive way to understand and assess the potential risks associated
    with contaminated surface water, considering the intricate relationships among
    sources, pathways, and receptors. The objective of this research was to determine
    the potential risk of PTE pollution in surface water and its implications for
    aquatic organisms and human health using a risk assessment framework, based upon
    the SPR model proposed in this study within the case study mining area of the
    Matjhabeng Local Municipality (MLM). The extent of pollution risk in surface water
    was further assessed by analyzing indicators of pollution such as pH, temperature,
    electrical conductivity, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and measuring PTEs, such
    as As, calcium (Ca), Cd, cobalt (Co), Cr, copper (Cu), Fe, magnesium (Mg), nickel
    (Ni), Pb, Se, and zinc (Zn), as well pollution risk indices, including the Single-Factor
    Pollution Index (PI) and Nemerow Integrated Pollution Index (NIPI). By integrating
    the SPR framework, this study sought to suggest effective control measures to
    safeguard aquatic ecosystems and community well-being, offering actionable insights
    to stakeholders for targeted pollution management and sustainable water practices.
    Addressing contamination is critical, not only for ecological equilibrium but
    also for community health and economic prosperity. Remediation measures, such
    as nature-based solutions and wetland systems, hold promise for preserving water
    quality and mitigating the risks posed by contaminated water. 2. Materials and
    Methods 2.1. Study Area and Sample Collection The case study area under consideration
    encompasses the MLM region, which is situated in the Lejweleputswa District Municipality.
    The area is characterized by a diverse range of land uses, including ongoing and
    historical gold mining activities, agricultural pursuits, as well as rural residential
    and light industrial development. It is geographically located in the northeastern
    region of the Free State province, South Africa. The MLM is approximately 250 km
    south of the city of Johannesburg in the Gauteng province and 140 km northeast
    of Bloemfontein, the provincial capital of the Free State province. The MLM region
    of South Africa is home to some of the country’s largest and most significant
    legacy gold fields. While several gold mines in the area have ceased operations,
    the majority of the active mines are owned and managed by Harmony Gold. Notable
    gold mines in the MLM area include St Helena, Phakisa, Masimong no. 5, and President
    Steyn no. 4. The extensive gold mining in these regions has resulted in significant
    areas of gold mine tailings, with many of these tailings situated in close proximity
    to both human settlements and surface water bodies in the region. Among the surface
    water bodies in the MLM case study area are the Sand River, the largest water
    catchment in the area, and the Vet River, which flows through the MLM area. Other
    surface water bodies in the region include Flamingo Pan, Flamingo Lake, Witpan,
    and Rietspruit Dam. These water bodies are all exposed to contaminants from gold
    mine tailings, which can be transported via runoff water during rainfall events
    and subsurface seepage into surface water bodies. However, certain dams in the
    area serve as mine water and seepage-containment facilities, acting as reservoir
    impoundments for both treated and untreated mine effluents from local mines. For
    this study, a total of fifteen sampling sites were selected across six towns within
    the MLM area, namely Allanridge, Bronville, Hennenman, Odendaalsrus, Virginia,
    and Welkom. Additionally, parts of the town of Bultfontein, situated outside the
    borders of the MLM area, were also included in the study. The selection of sampling
    sites was informed by various factors, including the presence or absence of legacy
    and active mines, mine tailing facilities, the distance from legacy and active
    mine tailings, anthropogenic activities such as industries and agriculture, and
    the direction of prevailing winds in the area. The prevailing wind direction,
    which signifies the most dominant surface wind with the highest speed in the MLM
    area, blows from north-north-east to the south-south-west direction. The prevailing
    wind direction in relation to the mine tailings (based on the weather statistics
    for Welkom Airport from 2018 [48]) was considered in this study since the wind
    is a transport partway for the transfer of PTEs from the mine tailings into surface
    water bodies. Seven sampling sites, labeled S1 to S7, were situated in close proximity
    to legacy and active gold mines and tailing facilities within the town of Welkom
    in the MLM area. Three sampling sites, S8 to S10, were located approximately 5–7 km
    beyond the area, with several legacy and active gold mines and tailing facilities
    in the region of the Virginia town. An additional three sampling sites, S11 to
    S13, were situated approximately 30–37 km beyond the area with numerous legacy
    and active gold mines and tailing facilities, covering parts of Welkom and Bultfontein.
    Sampling sites S1 to S7, as well as S8 to S10, were selected in the downstream
    direction of the prevailing wind, which blows from a north-northeast direction
    and inclines in a south-southwest direction. These sites have many legacy and
    active gold mines and tailing facilities in the MLM area. The prevailing wind
    direction and wind speeds were determined from statistics at Welkom Airport [48].
    To determine if the Matjhabeng mining and tailing area was the main source of
    surface-water pollution in the MLM area, two control sites were selected in the
    upstream wind direction. Sampling site S14 was located in Hennenman town region,
    approximately 10–12 km east of the area with many legacy and active mines and
    tailing facilities in the MLM area. Similarly, sampling site S15 was located about
    10–12 km north of the area with many legacy and active mines and mine tailing
    facilities in the MLM area. Figure 2 represents the case study area of the MLM,
    including the location of the control and sampling sites. Figure 2. Study area
    of Matjhabeng Local Municipal area, showing the 15 surface-water sampling sites.
    2.2. Applying the SPR Model to the Sampling Sites in the MLM Area as a Risk Assessment
    Framework to Assess the Potential Risk of Pollution on Aquatic Organisms and Human
    Health Utilizing the SPR model, the sampling sites within the Matjhabeng mining
    area were analyzed, revealing the presence of both lentic and stagnant surface
    water bodies and lotic and flowing water systems. While lentic systems at S1,
    S2, and S5 were found to be polluted from point sources, the pollution footprint
    origin of the remaining sampling sites was primarily from diffuse point sources,
    including residential, industrial, agricultural, and mining activities. Contamination
    pathways for the natural environment involve the transfer of PTEs in surface and
    seepage water, rainfall runoff from different anthropogenic activities, as well
    as a possible aerial dispersion, which could be envisaged from the dominant wind
    direction in the area. Human activities that exposed the communities in the MLM
    area to PTE pollution involve recreational pursuits, spiritual practices, crop
    irrigation, and fishing for sustenance. By applying the SPR model as a risk framework,
    Table 1 illustrates the movement of pollutants from a specific source to a potential
    receptor of environmental pollution through conducting pathways or transport modes.
    This information informed the pollution risk to aquatic ecosystems and human health.
    Table 1. Applying the source–pathway–receptor model as a risk assessment framework
    to the sampling sites of the Matjhabeng mining area. 2.3. Water Sampling and Water
    Property Management Water samples were collected following the sampling procedure
    outlined by the Water Research Commission of South Africa [49]. Surface water
    from a dam, lake, river, stream, or pan at each sampling site was collected for
    the summer and winter seasons in 2018 for laboratory measurement of twelve PTEs,
    namely As, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mg, Ni, Pb, Se, and Zn, which were chosen because
    of their association with gold mine tailing ores [50]. During the collection of
    the water samples, protective clothing, such as gloves and boots, were worn as
    a precaution against exposure to dangerous water pollutants that may cause diseases.
    Surface-water samples were collected using one-liter plastic bottles that were
    rinsed with deionized water. In cases where access to surface water at a sampling
    site was challenging, a bucket was used, which was rinsed with distilled water
    and lowered into the water to collect the sample. The clearly labeled sampling
    bottles were then transported on ice in a cooler box to the water laboratory at
    the Central University of Technology and were refrigerated at 4 °C until analysis.
    The physical and chemical properties of water were measured in order to assess
    the quality of surface water at each of the 15 sampling sites. Physical properties,
    such as pH, temperature, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO),
    and turbidity or total dissolved solids (TDS), were measured on site at each sampling
    site. The following calibrated instruments were used, namely a battery-operated
    Hach HQd (BEP-M Series) conductivity meter and a Hach 2100Q (EPA), 0-1000 NTU
    turbidity meter, following standard analytical procedures of the instruments.
    The 12 PTEs were measured using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy
    (ICP-OES). The water samples were digested with 70% nitric acid using open vessel
    digestion, following a modified method from Kisten et al. [51]. The digested samples
    were filtered and diluted to 25 mL with double-distilled water and then stored
    in the refrigerator for the PTE analysis. Triplicates of the digestion procedure
    were conducted to ensure the reliability of the results. The measurement of PTEs
    was carried out at the School of Chemistry and Physics at the Westville campus
    of the University of Kwa-Zulu Natal. 3. Data Analysis 3.1. Statistical Analysis
    of Water Quality Measurements The measurements of surface-water quality were examined
    and processed using the statistical software SPSS Statistics Version 21.0 [52].
    Descriptive statistics, including maximum, minimum, means, and standard deviations,
    were calculated for the physical water-quality measurements, and the percentage
    compliance to the water quality limits was also determined. Student’s t tests
    were run on the concentrations of the surface-water quality measurements at a
    95% confidence interval to examine any seasonal differences between the measurements
    obtained for summer and winter. Moreover, to determine whether these PTEs originated
    from the same environmental source, a principal component analysis (PCA) was done
    to compare the concentrations of the measured PTEs in surface water and their
    compositional relationship. This analytical approach reduces complex measurements
    and presents them in a simplified manner by extracting new variables, referred
    to as principal components, from previous variables such as metal concentrations
    and site [53]. To assess the degree of compliance, the physical water-quality
    measurements were compared with the water quality limits for the protection of
    aquatic organisms and human health as set by the Canadian Council of the Ministers
    of the Environment (CCME) [54]. However, since there are currently no surface-water
    quality guidelines in South Africa that encompass the majority of physical water-quality
    limits to safeguard aquatic organisms in streams, the limits set by the Aquatic
    Water Quality for Urban Streams (AWQUS) [55] were utilized for comparison purposes
    for the physical properties measured in this study. Furthermore, the PTE measurements
    were compared with the water quality limits established by the CCME [54], as well
    as the South African Water Quality Guidelines developed by the Department of Water
    Affairs and Forestry (DWAF) for the protection of aquatic organisms and irrigation
    water use [56,57]. 3.2. Pollution Indices The PI and NIPI were used to assess
    the level of water pollution by PTEs in the study area. These indices provide
    an indication of whether surface-water contamination by PTEs is due to natural
    processes or anthropogenic activities [58]. The PI measures the pollution of individual
    PTEs in water at each sampling site, while the NIPI determines the total pollution
    of a given PTE across all sampling sites [59,60]. The PI for each PTE was determined
    using the following formula according to Zhao et al. [60]: 𝑃 𝑖 = 𝐶𝑖 𝑆𝑖 (1) where
    Pi is the Single-Factor Pollution Index, Ci is the mean concentration of the PTEs
    in the water sample and Si is the background concentration of the PTEs in the
    earth’s crust. PI was classified as follows: non-pollution (Pi < 1), low level
    of pollution (1 > Pi < 2), moderate level of pollution (2 ≥ Pi < 3), strong level
    of pollution (3 ≥ Pi < 5), and very strong level of pollution (Pi ≤ 5) [61]. The
    NIPI, on the other hand, was expressed using Equation (2) [59]: 𝑁𝐼𝑃𝐼= 𝑃 2 𝑖𝑀𝑎𝑥
    + 𝑃 2 𝑖𝐴𝑣𝑒 − − − − − − − − − − √ 2 (2) where NIPI is the Nemerow Integrated Pollution
    Index at location I, 𝑃 2 𝑖𝑀𝑎𝑥 denotes the maximum PI value, and Pi Ave represents
    the average values of the PI of each PTE. NIPI can be classified according to
    five environmental quality categories, which include clean level (NIPI ≤ 0.7),
    precaution level (0.7 < NIPI ≤ 1.0), light pollution level (1.0 < NIPI ≤ 2.0),
    moderate level (2.0 < NIPI ≤ 3.0), and heavy pollution level (NIPI > 3.0) [61].
    3.3. Determination of Quality Assurance and Quality Control To ensure the reliability
    of the measured surface-water quality results, quality assurance procedures were
    implemented. Prior to taking on-site measurements of water quality properties,
    all instruments were calibrated, including the Hach 2100Q turbidity meter and
    Hach HQd handheld meter probes for dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, and electrical conductivity.
    Glassware was cleaned with double-distilled water throughout the study and analytical-grade
    reagents were used. Instrument readings were corrected using reagent blank determinations.
    To validate the analytical procedure, standard certified reference materials were
    used, specifically White Clover (BCR-402) from the Community Bureau of Reference
    of the Commission of the European Communities. All measurements were conducted
    in triplicate (n = 3). 4. Results 4.1. Physical Water-Quality Properties The physical
    water-quality measurements were compared with the CCME [54] and AWQUS limits [55].
    The pH results showed that sampling sites S3 and S5 were non-compliant for both
    the summer and winter seasons, whereas sites S4, S11, and S15 were non-compliant
    only for the winter season (Table 2). Regarding the EC measurements, 47% of the
    sampling sites were non-compliant with both CCME [54] and AWQUS limits [55]. Notably,
    the EC measurements at eleven sampling sites were substantially higher in the
    winter season than in the summer season, which may be explained by an increase
    in nutrient rich ions, such as phosphates, nitrates and chloride that were carried
    into surface water by flooding from excessive rain on the day of water sampling
    from mine tailings, agricultural fields, and from leaked sewage pipes, which in
    turn increased dissolved ions in the water. Table 2. Results of the physical water-quality
    properties of surface water for summer and winter. Dissolved oxygen (DO) measurements
    were non-compliant with both limits at 53% of the sampling sites in summer and
    33% of the sampling sites in winter. Furthermore, 27% of the sampling sites displayed
    temperature measurements that were non-compliant with the AWQUS limits [55]. In
    contrast, all measurements of turbidity were non-compliant with the AWQUS limits
    [55], except for site S5 in the winter season. Furthermore, the physical water-quality
    properties for the surface-water samples were analyzed using Student’s t tests
    to determine the presence of any seasonal effects. The results revealed highly
    significant differences (p ≤ 0.05) between the two sampling seasons for pH, temperature,
    and EC variables. The p value, test statistics (t), and confidence limits for
    the five surface-water quality properties are also provided. 4.2. Potential Toxic
    Elements Among the 12 measured PTEs, Cd, Cr, and Pb concentrations in the surface
    water were below the detection limits of the ICP-OES. Ni was detected in only
    one water sample collected at site S4. However, when compared with the water quality
    limits for the protection of aquatic organisms of CCME [54], As and Co showed
    high levels of non-compliance during the summer season, with a 73% non-compliance
    for As and a 93% non-compliance for Co (Table 3). For the winter season, Co was
    detected at site S5, which also exceeded the CCME [54] water quality limits. As
    showed 33% non-compliance during the summer season when compared with the aquatic
    water-quality limits of the DWAF [56]. For Cu, 33% of the water samples showed
    non-compliance during the summer season with both CCME [54] and DWAF [57] limits.
    In contrast, Cu measurements for the winter season revealed 100% non-compliance
    with DWAF [56] limits. All Se measurements were non-compliant with DWAF [56] limits
    during both seasons. For Fe, 20% of the water samples collected from various sites
    showed non-compliance with CCME [54] limits during the summer season, while 60%
    were non-compliant for the winter season. Zn was only detected at sampling site
    S5, which exceeded the CCME [54] aquatic water-quality limit during the summer
    season, while during the winter season, 53% of the Zn measurements exceeded the
    CCME [54] limits. However, when the PTE measurements above the ICP-OES limits
    were compared with the limits of the DWAF [57] water quality guidelines for irrigation,
    As, Co, Cu, and Se showed exceptionally high levels of non-compliance, with 100%
    non-compliance for both seasons. Similarly, measurements for Fe exceeded the DWAF
    [57] water quality limits at 20% of the sampling sites for the summer season and
    40% of the sites for the winter season. For Zn, only one site (S5) exceeded the
    DWAF [57] limits during the summer season, while measurements at three sites (S5,
    S7, S14) exceeded the DWAF [57] limits during the winter season. Table 3. Results
    of the mean concentrations (mg kg−1) of potentially harmful elements for the surface-water
    samples for the 15 sampling sites for summer and winter. A statistical analysis
    was performed on the PTE measurements for the summer and winter seasons using
    Student’s t tests to determine if there were any significant differences between
    the two seasons. The results showed highly significant differences (p ≤ 0.05)
    between the two sampling seasons for As, Cd, Pb, Cr, Cu, Fe, Se, and Mg (Table
    4). Table 4. Results of the Student’s t tests for seasonal variation in the potentially
    harmful elements of the surface-water samples. 4.3. Sources of Contamination of
    Potentially Toxic Elements in Surface Water A multivariate PCA was performed on
    the measurable PTEs to investigate whether the detected PTEs in surface water
    originated from a common source. Only measurements taken during the summer season
    were included in the PCA because only a few measurements were detectable in the
    winter season using ICP-OES. The results of the multivariate PCA revealed four
    primary principal components (PCs) with eigenvalues greater than or equal to one,
    accounting for 91.47% of the total variance (Table 5). The loading had to be at
    least 0.6 to be included in a PC. Table 5. Results of the principal component
    loading for the measurements of potentially toxic elements in surface water. PC1
    and PC2 were the most significant contributors to the total variance, accounting
    for almost 70% of the total variance. These PTEs could indicate the highest contamination
    level in the study area. PC1 showed high loadings for Co, Cu, Ni, and Zn, indicating
    they may have originated from the same source. Similarly, the high loadings of
    Pb, Cr, and Fe in PC2 may suggest that they share a common source of origin. PC3
    had high loadings of Se, while As and Mg were found in PC4. The separation of
    As and Mg in PC4 suggests that they may have come from different sources in the
    environment. Figure 3 shows the scatter plots exhibiting the principal component
    loadings for the 12 PTE measurements acquired from surface water. These scatter
    plots align with the outcomes of the multivariate PCA. The illustration unveils
    the presence of four principal components, the first and second of which are encompassed
    by a circular region. The outcome of the PCA revealed the existence of four primary
    principal components, which collectively suggest disparate origins for the PTEs
    detected within the environmental context. Notably, the clustering of PTEs within
    either PC1 or PC2 may infer a common provenance for these elements, potentially
    traceable to historical and ongoing gold mining activities, including legacy mines
    and associated tailings. Figure 3. Principal component scatter plot in rotated
    space of the twelve potential harmful elements measured in surface water during
    the summer season, with the PTEs in PC1 and PC2 showing clusters. 4.4. Pollution
    Indices The results of the PI analysis revealed fluctuations in pollution levels
    for the four detectable PTEs across the various surface-water sampling sites,
    as shown in Figure 4. To compute the pollution risk indices, only measurements
    taken during the summer were used since only a few measurements were detectable
    in the winter. The PI outcomes for Co and Cu indicated that the concentrations
    of these PTEs were very low (Pi < 1) in 80% of the water samples, indicating a
    non-polluted state. However, in 20% of the water samples, a low level of pollution
    (1 > Pi < 2) was observed for Co, while less than 15% of the water samples demonstrated
    low to moderate pollution conditions by Cu (2 ≥ Pi < 3), with a single water sample
    revealing moderate pollution (2 ≥ Pi < 3). Figure 4. Single-Factor Pollution Index
    and Numerow Integrated Pollution Index of the level of pollution by the different
    PTEs for the different surface-water sampling sites for the summer season. Regarding
    As, the SFPI results exhibited that 40% of the water samples had no form of anthropogenic
    interference (Pi < 1). Nonetheless, four of the water samples showed moderate
    pollution levels (2 ≥ Pi < 3), while two surface-water samples had a strong pollution
    condition (3 ≥ Pi < 5). Remarkably, one water sampling site had a very high level
    of As pollution (Pi ≥ 5). In contrast, the SFPI outcomes for Se showed a very
    strong level of pollution (Pi ≥ 5) in 80% of the water samples, suggesting a significant
    amount of Se pollution in the surface water, attributable to anthropogenic activities.
    The NIPI analysis revealed that the surface-water samples in the study area were
    subject to precautionary pollution levels by Co, with Cu displaying only light
    pollution levels and As exhibiting moderate pollution levels. However, Se demonstrated
    a heavy pollution level, indicating the highest degree of pollution in the surface-water
    samples within the MLM area. 5. Discussion The findings of this study demonstrate
    that PTEs have severely contaminated the surface water in the MLM area. The As,
    Co, Cu, Fe, Se, and Zn concentrations in surface water bodies were significantly
    higher than both the CCME [54] and the DWAF [57] aquatic water-quality limits
    at most of the sampling sites. Moreover, As, Co, Cu, Fe, Ni, Se, and Zn concentrations
    exceeded the DWAF [62] guidelines for irrigation water use at most of the sampling
    sites. These results are similar to other results obtained in the literature,
    in which a high concentration of As, Pb, Cd, Mn, Cr, and Fe, above the limits,
    were measured in surface water as a result of mining activities within the vicinity
    of the abandoned mining areas [19,42,43]. The results of the pollution risk indices
    further confirmed that As, Co, Cu, and Se have highly contaminated the surface
    water in the MLM area. According to a previous study by Dey et al. [63], the PI
    results also confirmed that the water of the Halda River in the south-eastern
    region of Bangladesh was highly contaminated by Cd, As, Pb, and Cu, while the
    NIPI results indicated that the river has been highly polluted. Anthropogenic
    sources, such as legacy and active gold mines and mine tailings, agricultural
    activities, effluents from wastewater treatment plants, light industrial activities,
    and local residential areas, may have contributed to the presence of these PTEs
    in the environment, as confirmed by the SPR model proposed in this study. The
    PCA outcomes revealed four prominent principal components, which imply distinct
    origins for the PTEs within the environment. However, the concentration of PTEs
    in either PC1 or PC2 could suggest a shared source for these elements, possibly
    stemming from legacy and current gold mining operations, including associated
    mines and tailings. However, most of the PTEs that exceeded the limits are typical
    contaminants associated with gold ores and gold mine tailings, as reported by
    previous studies [10,64,65]. Therefore, the legacy gold mine tailings and active
    mining activities in the area are likely the primary sources of pollution in the
    MLM area. The PCA results obtained in this study revealed closely similar results
    for PC1 and PC2 in a study conducted in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa [66]. This
    contamination of surface water bodies by PTEs poses a severe risk to aquatic organisms
    and the local community in the MLM area. The exposure to polluted water through
    the consumption of contaminated food crops and vegetables irrigated with polluted
    water, or from recreational activities, puts the community at a high risk of adverse
    health effects. The contamination of surface water by Se in the MLM area can potentially
    cause developmental deformities and mortality in the larval stages of certain
    aquatic organisms. Similarly, the high concentrations of As and Co detected in
    the surface water can cause severe toxicity to aquatic organisms due to their
    accumulation in the cells of these organisms, including liver and kidney cells
    [67,68]. Fish and other aquatic organisms that consume As may experience chronic
    and acute toxicity, including growth inhibition, immune system dysfunction, and
    death [67]. In addition to haem oxidation, blockage of inorganic Ca channels,
    cytotoxicity, and genotoxicity, chronic exposure to Co can also change enzyme
    activities in gills, the liver, and muscle tissues [69,70,71,72]. Fish and other
    aquatic organisms need the nutrients Fe, Cu, and Zn, which are essential nutrients
    for their growth, but high concentrations of Fe in the water, above the limits
    of the surface-water quality guidelines, can indirectly harm fish by creating
    conducive conditions for the growth of Fe bacteria on the gill surfaces of fish,
    which oxidizes ferrous Fe to ferric oxide. Increased ammonia in the blood plasma
    levels and damage to the kidney, liver, and spleen tissues can result from the
    presence of insoluble Fe on gill surfaces [72]. High levels of Cu that are absorbed
    by fish cells can impair metabolism and affect brain function as well as growth
    and reproduction [73]. Moreover, chronic exposure to Zn ions can be fatal for
    freshwater fish and aquatic organisms [68,74]. It is evident that the aquatic
    life in the MLM area is at serious risk from PTE contamination of surface water
    bodies. The accumulation of these pollutants in the cells of fish and other aquatic
    organisms can cause acute and chronic toxicity, immune system dysfunction, inhibition
    of growth and reproduction, and even death. Therefore, it is crucial to implement
    appropriate measures to mitigate PTE pollution in the MLM area to prevent further
    damage to aquatic life and protect the well-being of local communities, whose
    livelihoods depend on these water sources. In addition to the harmful effects
    of polluted water on aquatic organisms in the MLM area, the local community is
    also at risk of severe health consequences from the ingestion of As, Co, Cu, Fe,
    Ni, Se, and Zn in contaminated food crops and vegetables irrigated with polluted
    water, as well as from incidental ingestion during recreational activities. Long-term
    exposure to inorganic As in contaminated food crops can result in negative health
    effects like developmental problems, diabetes, pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular
    disease. Acute As poisoning symptoms include vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea
    [75]. Similarly, consuming Cu from contaminated food samples can result in metal
    fume fever, dermatitis, hair and skin discoloration, and respiratory tract illnesses
    [68]. Wilson’s and Menkes’ diseases, as well as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases,
    could all develop as a result of high Cu levels in food samples [76,77]. Excess
    intake of Co with dietary samples may cause gastrointestinal and endocrine disorders
    [78]. Furthermore, excessive amounts of Fe in the human body can damage tissues
    and cause disorders of Fe metabolism, such as Fe overload [79]. It is crucial
    to address the potential health risks associated with contaminated food crops
    in the MLM area to protect the health and well-being of the local community. 6.
    Conclusions This study proposed a risk assessment framework based on the SPR model
    to assess the potential threat of PTE pollution in surface water and its implications
    for aquatic organisms and human health. By applying the SPR model, it was found
    out that the sources of pollution in the MLM case study area included anthropogenic
    sources, such as legacy and active gold mines and mine tailings, agricultural
    activities, effluents from wastewater treatment plants, light industrial activities,
    and local residential areas. Pathways for contamination identified were surface
    and seepage water, rainfall runoff from different anthropogenic activities, as
    well as transport of PTE by wind-blown dust. Human activities that expose individuals
    to PTE pollution from water sources encompass recreational activities, spiritual
    practices, crop irrigation, and fishing for food. The findings underscore the
    alarming degradation of surface water in the MLM region. The majority of sampled
    sites exhibited extensive contamination levels of elements such as As, Co, Cu,
    Fe, Se, and Zn, surpassing the aquatic guideline limits. Moreover, As, Co, Cu,
    Fe, Ni, Se, and Zn concentrations surpassed the recommended irrigation water-use
    thresholds. Pollution indices confirmed moderate pollution from As, with particularly
    elevated levels for Se. This situation poses a considerable threat to both aquatic
    organisms and the local communities who rely on these water sources for various
    activities. To address this issue, local authorities must implement remediation
    measures. One potential approach involves employing cost-effective nature-based
    solutions, including floating treatment wetlands in dams, constructing wetlands,
    and restoring natural wetland systems in highly contaminated areas. These measures
    can aid in elevating the quality of surface water in the MLM region, thwarting
    further deterioration, and minimizing the potential risks posed by contaminated
    water to aquatic life and human health. Implementing such remediation measures
    extends beyond environmental and public health considerations; it also contributes
    to the long-term sustainability of the region’s economy. Given the integral role
    of the mining sector in the MLM area and South Africa, a healthy environment remains
    crucial for the continuous growth of this industry. Consequently, collaboration
    among all stakeholders becomes imperative to ensure the prompt and effective execution
    of these remediation strategies. Future research directions from this study should
    focus on a multifaceted approach to enhance our understanding of PTE pollution
    in surface water and its broader implications. Long-term monitoring efforts should
    be established to track pollution trends and assess the effectiveness of implemented
    remediation measures. Advanced techniques, such as isotopic fingerprinting and
    modeling, can be employed to accurately pinpoint pollution sources. Ecotoxicological
    studies must delve deeper into the impacts of PTE contamination on aquatic organisms
    across various trophic levels and life stages. Additionally, comprehensive human-health-risk
    assessments are needed to assess the potential health consequences of exposure
    to contaminated water sources, considering factors such as consumption patterns
    and the vulnerability of different demographic groups. Innovative and sustainable
    remediation methods should be explored, including hybrid engineered–natural solutions
    and the potential integration of phytoremediation. Moreover, community engagement
    and participatory approaches are essential to promote pollution awareness, behavior
    changes, and collaborative efforts for prevention and management. Evaluating the
    effectiveness of existing policies and regulatory frameworks in addressing PTE
    pollution and fostering adaptive strategies to climate change impacts on pollution
    dynamics, are crucial aspects. Comparative studies across similar regions can
    provide valuable insights into context-specific pollution patterns and inform
    tailored interventions. Overall, this multidisciplinary research agenda aims at
    guiding comprehensive strategies for mitigating PTE pollution, safeguarding aquatic
    ecosystems, and ensuring the health and well-being of local communities in the
    MLM region and beyond. Author Contributions G.B. was the principal researcher

  description: Plantain banana production in several western and central African countries
    needs improvement if it is to contribute to food safety and sovereignty. Plantain
    bananas are usually grown in intercropping systems with either annual crops or
    cocoa, with minimum chemical input use. Some plantain banana farmers have adopted
    monoculture systems with high plant densities and high levels of chemical inputs,
    emulating dessert banana production systems. This disregards the well-known negative
    impacts of such practices on human and environmental health. Can plantain banana
    production be intensified on a plot level, without increasing chemical inputs?
    In Ivory Coast, a producer set up several pesticide-free plots of plantain bananas.
    We took the opportunity to determine the feasibility and the agronomic and economic
    performances of three pesticide-free plantain-based cropping systems. Three plots
    are being studied on the same farm, all three with a highly productive monoculture,
    a high density of commercial and appreciated indigenous cultivars, a layout to
    facilitate cultural practices, irrigation to ensure a continuous market supply
    and a combination of organic and synthetic fertilizer use. The plots included
    no pesticide application, but a set of agroecological practices to limit biotic
    stresses, two different fertilization levels and three planting densities. The
    cropping systems description is ongoing and the economic and agronomic results
    are currently available from planting up to the first harvest. The next phase
    will be to set up an experiment with higher organic fertilizer levels to minimize
    chemical inputs and reduce production costs, and to confirm those observations.

  description: In the present paper an attempt has been made to examine the economic
    viability of sprinkler irrigation system in southern Haryana. The present study
    was conducted in the southern districts viz., Bhiwani and Rewari, selected on
    the basis of high rate of adoption of sprinkler irrigation system. For the selection
    of sample farmers, multistage random sampling technique was used. From each district
    two blocks were chosen purposively i.e., Tosham and Loharu in Bhiwani district
    and Khol at Rewari and Nahar in Rewari district. From each block, two villages
    were selected randomly. Further, 15 farmers were selected randomly from each village.
    Economic viability of sprinkler irrigation system was examined on the basis of
    the various indicators viz., NPV, IRR, B:C ratio and Payback period. Information
    regarding costs and returns of four major rabi crops viz., tomato, onion, wheat,
    mustard was taken from samples farmers for the year 2021-22. NPV, IRR, B:C ratio
    and payback period for sprinkler irrigation system was found out to be 384895.22,
    57.99, 3.30 and 3 years respectively. This shows that the investment on sprinkler
    irrigation system was sound and economically viable.

  description: This research investigated the best economically viable power source
    with the least environmental impact and socially acceptable for the maize crop.
    Maize is one of the key economic crops in Pakistan. Solar-, electric-, and diesel-powered
    drip irrigation systems (DIS) were considered for comparative study. We selected
    45 sites of maize crop to collect the data, with an area of 1–3 ha, from three
    divisions. For economic viability, the benefit:cost ratio, life cycle cost, and
    payback period were calculated, and CO2 emissions were calculated to assess the
    environmental impact. The SPSS model was used for one-way ANOVA followed by post
    hoc and chi-squared tests to check the significance level between all power sources.
    It was found that the B-C of electric power, solar, and diesel drip irrigation
    systems was 1.65, 1.52, and 1.44, respectively. Solar, diesel, and electricity
    power DIS have CO2 emissions of 0.02, 0.730, and 1.106 tons/ha, respectively.
    The research concludes that solar power and electric power are the best sources
    for the environment and economically, respectively. It is recommended that solar
    power DIS be subsidized, which will help to lower CO2 emissions and reduce the
    electricity shortfall in Pakistan.

    Reports Versions Notes Abstract This research investigated the best economically
    viable power source with the least environmental impact and socially acceptable
    for the maize crop. Maize is one of the key economic crops in Pakistan. Solar-,
    electric-, and diesel-powered drip irrigation systems (DIS) were considered for
    comparative study. We selected 45 sites of maize crop to collect the data, with
    an area of 1–3 ha, from three divisions. For economic viability, the benefit:cost
    ratio, life cycle cost, and payback period were calculated, and CO2 emissions
    were calculated to assess the environmental impact. The SPSS model was used for
    one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc and chi-squared tests to check the significance
    level between all power sources. It was found that the B-C of electric power,
    solar, and diesel drip irrigation systems was 1.65, 1.52, and 1.44, respectively.
    Solar, diesel, and electricity power DIS have CO2 emissions of 0.02, 0.730, and
    1.106 tons/ha, respectively. The research concludes that solar power and electric
    power are the best sources for the environment and economically, respectively.
    It is recommended that solar power DIS be subsidized, which will help to lower
    CO2 emissions and reduce the electricity shortfall in Pakistan. Keywords: benefit:cost

    alternate energy resources 1. Introduction Pakistan possesses one of the world’s
    largest irrigation infrastructures, with three major dams with design capacities
    of over 20 BCM (billion cubic meters), 23 barrages, headworks, and 45 main canals
    dominating an area of approximately 17 Mha (million hectares) [1]. Agriculture
    serves as the foundation of the economy in a country that uses more than 93% of
    its natural water resources [2]. Agribusiness is Pakistan’s most critical division
    and the foundation of the economy, whose efficiency relies upon various rural
    and common assets: 18.9% of Pakistan’s GDP is in the farming area, which utilizes
    42.3% of the labor [3]. However, there are a number of difficulties with this
    method. Water scarcity is considered one of the biggest challenges [1]. The Falkenmark
    indicator establishes a link between accessible water supply and the human population
    in water-stressed countries, and according to it, Pakistan has per capita water
    of less than 1700 m3. A nation whose per capita water accessibility drops below
    1000 m3 is classified as water-scarce. However, a country suffers absolute water
    scarcity when per capita water drops below 500 m3 [4]. In 1950, Pakistan had a
    per capita water accessibility of around 5000 m3. In 1990, Pakistan reached the
    water-stress limit, and in 2005, Pakistan reached the water-scarcity limit. If
    the current trend continues, this will reach the extreme water-scarcity threshold
    by 2025 [1]. The Water Resources Vulnerability Index (WRVT) [5] relates the yearly
    national availability of water to the total yearly consumption. The country is
    defined as being water-limited if yearly withdrawals are between 0 and 40% of
    the annual water supply. If it surpasses 40%, the region is deemed to be extremely
    water-stressed. Pakistan has a WRVT of around 77%. In 2004, the shortfall of water
    was 11%, which is estimated to increase to 31% by 2025 [6]. Because of water scarcity
    and population growth, there will be a food deficit of around 70 million tons
    by 2025 [7]. The performance level is less than 40% due to inadequate irrigation
    system management. For example, in 2001 the government of Pakistan reported that
    only 55 BCM of the 142 BCM of available water at canal headworks is consumed by
    crops [6]. The leftover 87 BCM (61%) is wasted during transportation and application
    in the field. Water lost because of seepage in regions underlain by groundwater
    sources is just a temporary loss since it may be retrieved when necessary. However,
    because power is consumed to pump this water, it represents an energy loss. This
    is a permanent loss in places underlain by salty groundwater since it cannot be
    utilized for irrigation or drinking and may cause waterlogging and salinity [1,8].
    Compared to India and California (1.5 kg/m3), Pakistan has relatively low water
    productivity (0.6 kg/m3) [9]. To address the problem of food security, water production
    should be increased by implementing various efficient irrigation techniques. In
    2002, Allah Bakhsh and Awan reported that Pakistan is located in a low precipitation
    area, with rainfall ranging from less than 100 mm in the lower Indus plains to
    much more than 750 mm in the northern areas, which is below crop water demands
    in various regions, such as 1400 mm in Balochistan (Turbat), 1280 mm in Punjab
    (Faisalabad), 900 mm in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (Parachinar) and 1487 mm in Sindh (Jacobabad)
    [10]. However, water-saving irrigation methods are required to meet agricultural
    water requirements. Modern irrigation systems are more important than any other
    public development in arid and semiarid climates [11,12]. Water is delivered practically
    directly to each plant via a pipe system, and the field area surrounding every
    plant is wet. Water is delivered to the plant on a low-tension and frequent basis,
    allowing for very high water usage efficiency [12]. Microirrigation systems are
    more advantageous and viable in locations where irrigation is ineffective or land
    reformation requires large sums of money [12]. Pakistan possesses one of the world’s
    biggest groundwater resources. The number of tube wells climbed from fewer than
    0.2 million in 1980 to 1.1 million in 2015 [13]. This is mostly owing to increasing
    crop productivity, which climbed from 67% to roughly 150% during the same time
    frame [14]. The government has not imposed any restrictions on the installation
    of agricultural tube wells, and growers have taken advantage of this availability
    to farm as much land as possible [15]. According to research studies, using the
    drip technique saves 40–70% of the water plus increases output by 10–100% for
    certain crops [16,17]. Diesel-powered pumps are often placed at modest depths
    of 20 to 40 ft. The average land size with diesel tube wells is below 5 ha, accounting
    for about 85% of the whole. According to current projections, diesel-powered tube
    wells emit roughly 5.025 million metric tons of CO2 each year [18]. Solar-powered
    drip irrigation is a reasonable alternative to diesel-powered tube wells, but
    widespread adoption in Pakistan has been fraught with difficulties [15]. Punjab
    is also Pakistan’s most inhabited province, and thus it will be useful to investigate
    the distribution of both diesel and electric pumps well throughout the region.
    In 2014, the Agriculture Department of Punjab reported that 87% of the tube wells
    are diesel-driven, with the remaining 13% being electrically operated [15,19].
    In 2012, Pakistan’s electricity mix comprised hydroelectric, thermal, and nuclear
    power facilities. Approximately 28.40% of electricity was generated by hydropower
    facilities, 67.82% by thermal power stations, and the remaining 3.78% by nuclear
    and renewable energy generation systems [20]. In 2014, Pakistan’s current capacity
    installed for the power grid supply was 23,644 MW. The state’s suppressed electricity
    requirement is 19,735 MW in the summer and 14,922 MW in the winter [21]. Despite
    the installation of almost 3000 MW in the previous five years, the supply had
    not really progressed to the point where it could meet the energy demand of the
    current connected load [21,22]. In May 2011, the Pakistan Electric Power Company
    reported an electrical deficit of around 7000 megawatts (MW) [23,24]. In 2012,
    Aafia Malik wrote that there was a 3000–5000 megawatt demand–supply mismatch,
    leading to a 4–12 h blackout in the country’s urban and rural areas [21,22]. Because
    of the extensive use of fossil fuels, the energy production industry contributes
    significantly to CO2eq emissions. The energy industry accounts for approximately
    76.1% of total CO2eq emissions in Pakistan [25]. Between 2007 and 2017, the market
    for petroleum products climbed at a rate of 4% each year. Overall petroleum consumption
    has been dropping since 2018 due to a reduction in the use of furnace oil in the
    power industry. As of 2019, transportation is the largest user of petroleum products,
    accounting for approximately 76.6%, followed by energy production, which accounts
    for approximately 14%, and industry, which accounts for approximately 7.6%, with
    the remainder being shared by residences, agricultural sectors, and other governmental
    agencies [26]. The primary obstacles to implementing an improved irrigation system
    in the country are the rise in fuel prices and the existing breakdown of power.
    Although many studies have been conducted on the use of solar power drip irrigation
    systems around the world, this invention is still in its early stages in Pakistan.
    This paper not only focuses on the economic analysis of solar-coupled high-efficiency
    irrigation systems with the comparison of diesel and electric power drip irrigation
    systems but also discusses the social adoption and environmental impacts of all
    power sources for drip irrigation systems. The objective is to evaluate and compare
    the economic viability of different power sources for drip irrigation systems
    in Punjab, assess the environmental impacts of different power sources for drip
    irrigation systems in Punjab, Pakistan and assess the social adoption of different
    power sources for drip irrigation systems in Punjab. The hypothesis of this study
    was that a solar system is an economically suitable energy system for drip irrigation
    in Pakistan. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Description of Study Area Previous
    research reported higher produce yield, lower weed yield, improved germination
    and water saving using drip irrigation [27,28,29]. Individual regions of Pakistan
    have different sorts and volumes of assets, for example, farmland, land, water,
    domesticated animals, horticultural credit, rural hardware, manure, and farmer
    specialists. Three divisions selected for this study: Faisalabad, Sahiwal, and
    Lahore (Figure 1). The coordinates for these areas are shown below in Figure 1.
    Figure 1. Location maps of Punjab. 2.2. Data Collection This section provides
    information on the required data to conduct the research study. All data for maize
    crops on drip irrigation systems with different power sources from Punjab were
    collected. Purposive sampling technique was used to collect and analyze the data.
    Sampling of Drip Irrigation System (DIS) Sites The baseline survey and impact
    assessment data collections for completed drip irrigation system sites were conducted.
    For this purpose, based on stratified sampling, 45 DIS sites were selected out
    of 139 sites installed by the Punjab government during the last five years. Data
    were gathered from across Punjab. The selection of sites was random to ensure
    the quality of the data as well as covering the whole sites. Figure 2. shows site
    selection dependent on drip irrigation-installed area between the limits of 1
    ha to 3 ha, 3 ha to 5 ha, and 5 ha to 7 ha, and further sites dependent on power
    sources on an equal basis as solar, diesel, and electricity. However, this study
    focused on small farms with area 1–3 ha and all sampling was done in the study
    area. Figure 2. Selection of HEIS site framework. Total HEIS in Punjab is further
    divided by farm size, such as large farm sizes ranging from 5–7 ha, medium 3–5
    ha, and small 1–3 ha, respectively. We checked the data availability and number
    of sites before the decision on area and then decided to evaluate all parameters
    within the limits of a small farm size, which is 1–3 ha. The selected sites in
    the Faisalabad, Lahore, and Sahiwal divisions were further arranged by their power
    source with an area limit of 1–3 ha. A sample size of 15 for each source was selected,
    for a total of 45 sites selected for the study. After the collection of data from
    the On Farm Water Management Department (OFWM), we compiled a list of farmers
    from each division: Faisalabad, Sahiwal, and Lahore. The interest of the farmer
    also changes with landholding capacity, that is, whether he is the owner of 100
    ha or 5 ha. While selecting the 45 sites, all the technical parameters were considered,
    such as area, soil type, cropping pattern, etc. Crop was the most important parameter.
    The selected crop was maize, and all the data were collected for maize only. Diesel
    engines are less efficient and lift water from smaller heads that vary from 6
    to 15 m. Diesel engines do not face transmission and distribution losses, whereas
    in the case of electric power irrigation systems, they face all these losses.
    DIS sites are cited in individual divisions, as 45% of the selected sites are
    situated in Sahiwal division and only 22% in Lahore, whereas the rest are in Faisalabad
    division. Most of the data regarding DIS sites and total cost incurred were collected
    from the On Farm Water Management office in Lahore, whereas the crop data, such
    as all inputs from sowing till harvesting, were collected from the farmer directly
    via an author survey. The output cost data Were also collected. A schematic from
    data collection to analysis is shown in Figure 3 below. Basically, the overall
    methodology can be categorized into two main parts: Data collection. Data analysis.
    Figure 3. Overall methodological framework. The methodology is further divided
    into steps, such as data collection and analysis while adopting the models or
    methods to get the results. 2.3. Economic Data 2.3.1. Crop Input and Output Data
    Nowadays, most of our farmers maintain records of crop input data as well as crop
    output data. This information expresses farm yield, which we need for economic
    analysis. As such, a primary farm survey is more useful and can be done easily.
    In this research, the primary data were collected from farmers for economic analysis
    and social adoptability. The whole dataset was collected for maize. 2.3.2. Environmental
    Data CO2 Emission In the IPCC guidelines, we calculated the emission factor of
    CO2 for all provinces of Pakistan. They have calculated values for CO2 emissions
    for diesel too. Both the values were taken and be used for the calculation of
    CO2 emissions at each HEIS site, whether an electric power or diesel power irrigation
    site. In the SEAP guidelines, the emission factor for CO2 from locally used solar
    power systems was calculated, which was used to calculate the emissions from the
    solar power drip irrigation system. Human activities release more than 29 billion
    tons of CO2 into the environment every year [30]. Pakistan is expending to over
    98% of nonrenewable (fossil-filled) vitality, which is contaminating the earth
    [31]. For screening greenhouse gases and air toxins over the sub-landmass, a few
    investigations connected with various practices, for example, satellite and ground-based
    remote detection and in situ estimations, have been conducted [32]. Plants also
    use CO2 to play an important role in the photosynthesis cycle and recover the
    water proficiency required by plants [33]. CO2 discharges contribute 74% of all
    CO2 production [34]. Strategy objectives include improving energy utilization
    and carbon sinks, as well as empowering manageable types of agriculture to combat
    climate change [35]. Social Adoption Data We considered the amount of drip irrigation
    acceptance of farmers by education. Data regarding social adoption for each source
    were collected from all the sites visited for economic data. We used a questionnaire-based
    survey to evaluate the farmer’s adoption and to know the basic reasons for the
    adoption of any source by the farmer. In terms of social data, we investigated
    farmer education, family size, farm operator education, total landholding, farmer
    interest, interaction with other farming communities, interaction with agriculture
    and the OFWM department, knowledge of the latest technologies, and so on. 2.4.
    Data Analysis The whole framework of data analysis for each of the objectives
    along with model and statistical analysis applied to determine significant differences
    is presented in Figure 3. 2.4.1. Economic Analysis Economic analysis is carried
    out to test the viability of any project or system. A detailed feasibility study
    is required before starting any project. The feasibility study not only speaks
    of the prestige of the project but also helps in determining the sequence of the
    project procedure [36]. The goal of this economic study was to find the most economically
    viable source of energy for the drip irrigation system. The following analysis
    was carried out to test the economic acceptability. 2.4.2. Benefit–Cost Analysis
    (BCA) Basically, this is the measurement of all possible profits and benefits
    from a project while taking into account the qualitative and quantitative factors.
    It is also called cost–benefit analysis or benefit:cost ratio (BCR). The BCR is
    calculated as the present value (PV) of benefits divided by the present value
    (PV) of costs [37]. BCR= ∑ T t=0 Bt (1+r) t ∑ T t=0 Ct (1+r) t (1) The current
    time is t = 0. If the benefit-to-cost ratio is greater than one, then the project
    is good and can be accepted. 2.4.3. Present Value (PV) The notion of present value
    asserts that an amount of cash currently is worth greater than the exact quantity
    in the future. It can be calculated by [38]: PV= pt (1+r) t (2) where PV is the
    present value of capital amount, pt is value of the future amount in time t, r
    is the discount rate and t is the year in which pt is realized. 2.4.4. Net Present
    Value (NPV) The difference between the current value of cashflow and withdrawals
    over a time period is known as net present value (NPV). The NPV is the present
    estimation of all projects’ net advantages. The estimation of net advantages in
    any period is basically the advantage less the expense [39]. It can be calculated
    by: NPV= ∑ T t=0 R t (1+r) t (3) where Rt is cash inflow–outflow at any time t
    and r is the discount rate. 2.4.5. Payback Period (PBP) The payback period is
    defined as the time it takes to recover the capital cost of a project [40]. It
    can be calculated by: PBP= Initial Investment Annual Operating cash inflow or
    PBP= Cost of Project Annual Cash flow (4) 2.4.6. Life Cycle Cost (LCC) For the
    adoption of a new system, the life cycle cost is a key point to consider when
    making initial investments. Life cycle cost is the representation of all costs
    over the life of the system. It is based on different parameters such as operation
    and maintenance costs, fuel costs, salvage costs, and the capital cost of the
    system. It can be calculated by [41]: LCC=CC+MC+FC+RC+SC (5) where CC = capital
    cost, MC = maintenance cost, FC = fuel cost, RC = replacement cost, and SC = salvage
    value. 2.4.7. Capital Cost The capital cost of the system was calculated using
    data provided by the On-Farm Water Management Department in Punjab, Pakistan.
    The total project cost was divided by the project area to calculate the capital
    cost for a one-hectare area. 2.4.8. Maintenance Cost The maintenance cost includes
    all kinds of repair and maintenance of the drip irrigation system, including the
    power source. It also consists of drip system parts and wear and tear of the power
    source. 2.4.9. Fuel Charges This comprises price of fuel in the case of a diesel-powered
    drip irrigation system as well as electricity usage (kWh) in the case of an electricity-powered
    drip irrigation system. It may also be considered a running cost. 2.4.10. Replacement
    Cost The replacement cost consists of the amount spent to replace any part of
    the system during the study. 2.4.11. Salvage Value This is basically the value
    of the whole drip irrigation system, including the power source, after the completion
    of the life of that concerned part or the study period, whichever is completed
    first. The formula for salvage value is as below [42]. Salvage Value=CC−(I × n)
    (6) where CC is capital cost, I is depreciation rate, and n is number of years.
    2.4.12. SPSS Model SPSS is a Windows program that can be used to enter information,
    perform analysis, and prepare tables and charts. It is generally used in the social
    sciences and in the business world. The SPSS Modeler is an IBM information examination
    and investigation program. It is used to manufacture prescient models and perform
    other logical assignments. It has a visual interface that enables users to use
    statistical and information mining calculations without programming. It is used
    by specialists for statistical examination. SPSS version 26 was used in this study.
    2.5. Statistical Analysis 2.5.1. One Way ANOVA One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
    was used to determine if there were statistically significant differences between
    the means of two or more independent (unrelated) groups. One-way ANOVA is often
    accompanied by a special test to check the differences between the two parameters
    that are significant and how significant. An independent variable has nominal
    levels or different ordered levels. One-way ANOVA was used for statistical analysis
    for both environmental and economic analysis, which was further enhanced by the
    post hoc Tukey HSD test. 2.5.2. Post Hoc Test ANOVA tests are performed only to
    confirm the differences between groups (i.e., a statistically significant one-way
    ANOVA result). A posteriori tests try to check the frequency of incorrect experiments
    (usually alpha = 0.05). A post hoc test is called an a posteriori test, that is,
    it is done after the ANOVA. 2.5.3. Environmental Analysis In this study of drip
    irrigation systems with different power sources, the most important factor is
    CO2 emissions. which was calculated in all cases where the farmer used a diesel
    engine, electricity, or solar as a power source for a drip irrigation system.
    2.5.4. Social Analysis This is a very simple analysis to find out the main reasons
    for the adoption of different power sources for drip irrigation systems. It was
    fully based on the farmers’ consent and was evaluated by a questionnaire while
    seeking the interest of the farmer on the basis of simple questions. Based on
    the farmer’s approach, whether he can afford it or not is easily approachable,
    as is his agricultural education and interest, interactions with the farming community,
    and so on, which was interpreted by using the SPSS model to run the chi-squared
    test and evaluate adaptation by the farming community in Punjab. 3. Results and
    Discussions 3.1. Economic Viability of Different Power Sources for Drip Irrigation
    System To determine which source for drip irrigation system is more viable, three
    parameters were considered: benefit–cost analysis, payback period, and life cycle
    cost. 3.2. Benefit–Cost Analysis of Different Power Sources for Drip Irrigation
    System The benefit:cost ratio for each power source was calculated by using Equation
    (1), where net present value was calculated by equation 3 for each source and
    site individually. All the benefit and expense costs were in US dollars. As shown
    in Table 1, electric power DIS with the highest B-C ratio of 1.65. Diesel power
    DIS had the lowest B-C ratio of 1.45 due to high operating costs, and the B-C
    ratio of solar power drip irrigation systems was 1.55, which was second only to
    electric power DIS, as shown in Figure 4. Figure 4. Benefit:cost ratio of different
    power sources for drip irrigation systems. Table 1. B-C ratio of different power
    sources for DIS. 3.2.1. One-Way ANOVA Reject the null hypothesis and accept the
    alternative hypothesis, which is that there is a significant difference between
    the benefit:cost ratio of different power sources. Table 2 shows that F = 11.215
    and p < 0.0001. Table 2. Results of One-Way ANOVA of B-C ratio for different power
    sources. To find the minimal difference between the means of B-C ratio for different
    power sources, we used a post hoc Tukey HSD test using the SPSS model. There is
    a significant difference between the B-C ratio of electricity and diesel, solar
    and diesel and a nonsignificant difference between the B-C ratio solar and electric
    power drip irrigation system, which shows that solar and electric power systems
    are much better than the diesel power DIS presented in Table 3. Table 3. Post
    hoc Tukey test for B-C ratio. 3.2.2. Cashflow Diagrams for All Power Sources Used
    for DIS Cashflow diagrams were constructed by calculating the means of all expenses
    as well as profit for all sites of each power source. It is easy to understand
    the range of every expense related to the system. Cashflows for all types of drip
    systems are presented in Figure 5, Figure 6 and Figure 7. Figure 5. Cashflow diagram
    for solar power drip irrigation system. Figure 6. Cashflow diagram for electric
    power drip irrigation system. Figure 7. Cashflow diagram for diesel power drip
    irrigation system. Cashflow Figure 7 describe all the system expenses, including
    salvage value, for each power source and maize crop production cycle, as well
    as gross benefits from a one-hectare area, which can be easily understood. 3.3.
    Payback Period of Different Power Sources for DIS The payback period for each
    of the 15 drip irrigation sites for each source was calculated by using Equation
    (4). The project with a payback period of 3 years is mostly considered the best
    project. Solar power DIS has the highest range of PBP, from 2 years to 7 years
    for different sites, with an average of 5.2 years, which is a very long duration
    for return of initial investment. Electricity has the lowest PBP, which ranges
    from 1 to 3 years with an average of 2 years. Electric power DIS has become the
    best power source with respect to PBP, as diesel power DIS sites also have a range
    of 1–4 years with an average of 2.5 years. Diesel power sources also have higher
    PBP than electric power DIS in Figure 8. Figure 8. PBP of different power sources
    for DIS. The average PBP as well as the variation to the average clearly shows
    that electric power DIS has the lowest PBP of 2 years compared to other power
    sources, as shown in Table 4. Table 4. PBP of different power sources for DIS.
    3.4. Life Cycle Cost Analysis of Different Power Sources for Drip Irrigation System
    The life cycle cost was calculated for each power source by using Equation (5)
    for each source. All the calculations are made for an area of one hectare of maize
    crop for a period of 15 years, where the lateral is replaced after 10 years and
    the diesel engine after 15 years. All the costs are in US dollars with a depreciation
    rate of 15%. The life cycle cost from 15 sites for each power source for DIS is
    shown, along with the standard deviation. Diesel power DIS has the highest LCC
    at 13,628.47, whereas solar power DIS has 12,994.67 and electricity power DIS
    the lowest LCC of 9414.63. Electric power DIS is the best power source for decisions
    based on LCC analysis. As shown in Figure 9, the life cycle cost of the diesel
    power drip irrigation system is higher than both the other power systems. It clearly
    shows that electric power drip irrigation systems have the lowest life cycle cost.
    Therefore, the best system we choose should have the lowest life cycle cost for
    the life period of 15 years. Figure 9 also shows the variation in LCC of solar
    power drip irrigation systems is much higher, which might be due to design parameters.
    Figure 9. Life cycle cost of different power sources for drip irrigation systems.
    Solar drip irrigation systems have the highest capital cost, which is approximately
    6000 more than the other two sources, whereas diesel and electric power sources
    have nearly equal capital costs. Figure 10 also shows that diesel has higher maintenance
    and fuel costs, whereas solar power DIS has zero fuel cost. In the end, there
    is a nonsignificant difference in the LCC of solar and diesel power drip irrigation
    systems. Even diesel has a higher LCC than solar, which shows the capital cost
    of solar takes 15 years to be equal to the diesel power source. Figure 10. LCC
    parameters for different power sources for DIS. According to the Ministry of Mines
    and Energy (2006), diesel engines need minor servicing four times a year for good-quality
    engines and two major services a year, minor services include oil and filter changes,
    whereas major services include decarbonization, oil change, and filter replacement
    by a skilled person. Furthermore, major and minor overhaul tasks require skilled
    people replacing crank shafts and drilling cylinders. Production Cost for DIS
    As shown in Table 5, the cost of production for maize was 0.21 USD/kg while using
    electric power DIS, which is a bit higher than diesel and solar power DIS, which
    were 0.173 USD/kg and 0.1729 USD/kg, respectively. By using an efficient irrigation
    system and limiting labor expenses, a progressive farmer in Bangladesh spends
    1419 USD to produce 7.85 tons/ha of maize with a benefit:cost ratio of 1.42. Therefore,
    it can be easily calculated that they produce 1 kg of maize at a cost of 0.19
    USD, which is almost the same as in Pakistan [43]. Table 5. Cost comparison of
    different power sources for DIS. The progressive farmers of Panchagarh, while
    using an efficient irrigation system, produce maize at a rate of 6.35 tons/ha.
    Because of intensive management practice, they consider it a good yield. He calculated
    the production cost to be 0.15 USD/kg, which is less than what I calculated using
    HEIS. The dribble water system spares about 38% of water and improves yield by
    up to 55% as compared to the surface water system [44]. Attainability examined
    of solar power irrigation systems to save pastures in the inward magnolia of China,
    which had decayed because of atmospheric changes and overgrazing. Conditions were
    produced for investigation of the prime irrigation sum to structure the groundwater-based
    solar irrigation framework [45]. The real development of HEIS technology in China,
    however, occurred during the 1990s, and the area under microirrigation technologies
    increased to about 1.46 Mha in 2000, which further increased to around 3.00 Mha
    in 2005 and 4.59 Mha in 2010 [46]. 3.5. Environmental Impact of Different Power
    Sources for DIS For environmental impact assessment, CO2 emissions were calculated
    for all power sources with the same sample and done by using emission factors
    for diesel and electricity via IPCC guidelines, and for solar power, the SEAP
    report was used for emission factor. Specifically, 74.1 (tco2/TJ), 0.613 (tco2/kW),
    and 0.02 (tco2/kW) [21]. The emission of CO2 emissions ton/ha for diesel is much
    higher than other power sources, and solar power has a nominal amount of CO2 ton/ha
    that is emitted for an area of one-hectare maize crop, as presented in Figure
    11. Figure 11. CO2 emissions from different power sources for DIS. From all the
    calculations and analysis, it was also calculated that diesel power DIS the diesel
    engine runs for 60.6 h to irrigate the maize crop and consumes about 323.40 L
    of diesel and emits 1.02 tons of CO2/ha into the air, whereas electric power DIS
    runs for 56.13 h and consumes 1008.27 KW of electricity and emits 0.73 tons of
    CO2/ha into the atmosphere, and solar power DIS consumes 1190.14 KW of electricity
    produced by solar and emits 0.02 tons of CO2 during the life of the maize crop
    on ha area. CO2 Emission Form Each Source for 1 kg Production of Maize Solar power
    DIS emits the least carbon dioxide, which is almost 0.0016 kg for the production
    of 1 kg of maize, whereas diesel power DIS emits 0.0848 kg, which is much higher
    than electricity and solar emits 0.0599 kg and 0.0016 kg, respectively, as presented
    in Figure 12. Figure 12. CO2 emission kg/kg of maize production with different
    power sources for DIS. 3.6. Social Adoption of Different Power Sources for Drip
    Irrigation System For social adoption, first the biodata of the farmer for each
    power source were collected, as given in the Table 6. Table 6. Variables of the
    study for social adoption. The biodata of the farmer regarding his adoption of
    a power source show that 20% of farmers using solar power DIS have one to four
    family members. They also show that the farmers using solar power DIS are postgraduate
    and about 93% and 53% employees in the government and private sector, respectively,
    as presented in Table 6. 3.6.1. Head of Family Education In sum, 93% of farmers
    with solar power DIS are postgraduates, with the remaining 7% being graduates.
    It is a much higher level of education than the farmers using diesel and electric
    power DIS. Farmers using electricity as a power source were also educated, with
    47% postgraduates and 53% graduates. Farmers using diesel power DIS are less educated,
    as only 13.4% are postgraduate, while 54.4% are graduates, and the rest are intermediate
    and metric, which is much less education than the farmers of solar power DIS and
    electric power DIS. 3.6.2. Total Land under Control It has been seen that farmers
    using solar power DIS have about 33% landholding of more than 55–80 ha, where
    farmers using electricity have only 20% in this range and diesel power DIS farmers
    have not even a single farmer in this range of landholding. On the other hand,
    among diesel and electric power DIS farmers, about 60% are under the limit of
    5–30 ha of landholding, which results in farmers using solar power DIS having
    more landholding capacity than DIS farmers using electricity and diesel as power
    sources. 3.6.3. Occupation of DIS Owner The occupation status for DIS farmers
    for each source shows clearly that farmers using solar power DIS are mostly employees
    in the government or private sector, which is about 53%, whereas in the other
    sources this is 20% for electricity and 33% for farmers of diesel power DIS, whereas
    53% of electric power DIS farmers have a business and 54% of diesel power DIS
    farmers only farm. This means that the farmers using solar power DIS are mostly
    employees and well educated, whereas farmers using electricity as a power source
    are mostly doing business and farmers using diesel power DIS are mostly doing
    farming. 3.6.4. Education of Farm Operators Farm operators using solar power DIS
    are much more educated, with about 60% of them being metric, whereas the operators
    using electric power DIS have only 33% metric education. On the other hand, this
    is only 6% for diesel power DIS. About 67% of operators using diesel power DIS
    are illiterate. All the farmers with drip irrigation systems without depending
    on a source are being subsidized by the government of Punjab. The farmers pay
    only 40% of the total cost for the whole system, except those using solar power
    DIS, who have paid an extra amount for the solar unit. This is also subsidized
    by the GOP, and the farmer pays only 20% of the total cost for the solar unit.
    The percentage of farmers wishing to adopt solar as a power source for drip irrigation
    systems at the next chance is 98%, whereas only 2% of farmers show willingness
    to adopt electric power DIS. These results show farmer interest and awareness
    of renewable energy. Farmers using solar power DIS are much more active in their
    farming community, interacting with departments, the latest media, or other agriculture-related
    technologies than farmers using electricity or diesel power drip irrigation. On
    the other hand, diesel power DIS farmers have fewer interactions with the farming
    community, departments, and agricultural development media. It is also shown that
    there is a significant difference between all power sources for interaction with
    agriculture and water management departments through different training. Such
    training gives information on the latest technologies and guides and trains farmers
    for their adoption and usage. The farmer has the capability and interest to adopt
    solar power DIS because it is the need of the future, in addition to them having
    just a one-time cost to pay. Most of the farmers who live in cities and visit
    their farms every couple of days were more interested in this technology because
    they wanted to reduce their daily running costs to avoid any misappropriation,
    especially in the case of diesel engines. The DIS farmer requires daily diesel
    expenses and is dependent on the operator, whereas, as in the case of solar power
    DIS, there is no need for daily expenses. The number of laborers working at the
    farm may also be reduced. Solar technology, on the other hand, is prohibitively
    expensive for farmers to afford without government subsidies. 4. Conclusions The
    B-C ratio of electricity power DIS is 1.65, which is higher than that of solar
    and diesel power DIS, which are 1.52 and 1.44, respectively. The LCC of diesel
    power sources is much higher than that of solar and electric power sources, and
    diesel has the lowest B-C ratio than of solar and electric power sources. DIS
    has the lowest LCC as well as the shortest payback period, which is 2 years, whereas
    diesel and solar have payback periods of 2.5 and 5.2 years, respectively. The
    production cost for maize is almost the same while using solar and electricity
    power DIS, i.e., 0.17 USD/kg of maize, where the high production cost is, i.e.,
    0.21 USD/kg while using diesel power DIS. Therefore, it can be easily concluded
    that electricity is the most viable source for DIS, but in the current energy
    scenario in Pakistan, electricity is not enough to meet the requirements of farmers.
    That is why we need to move to the second option, i.e., solar power DIS. It is
    much more costly, and farmers cannot afford this source. Diesel power DIS emits
    more CO2 into the atmosphere, 1.016 tons/ha for the maize crop, whereas electricity
    emits 0.732 tons and solar emits 0.02 tons. Solar emits very little CO2 when compared
    to other power sources. which suggests that the government should promote solar
    power DIS because it is more environmentally friendly than other power sources.
    Social benefits can also be increased by the adoption of solar energy for the
    operation of drip irrigation. The solar powered drip irrigation system was found
    to be a socially feasible option on account of its impressive social benefit-to-cost
    ratio. This confirms that the wide adoption of drip irrigation will generate enough
    social benefits to justify the subsidization of drip irrigation in the country.
    Farmers using solar power DIS are more educated and have more interaction with
    the farming community and agriculture departments also. Maximum employment in
    solar energy DIS was also discovered. Diesel power DIS farmers have the lowest
    literacy rate and very limited interaction with the farming community and agriculture
    departments. Approximately 98% of farmers who use DIS indicate a willingness to
    use solar power DIS for their next project. 5. Recommendations The government
    should take an initiative towards renewable energy, as it is environmentally friendly.
    Farmers also want to adopt it, but cannot because of the high capital cost. If
    the government subsidized solar as a power source for drip irrigation systems,
    more than 80% of farmers would switch to solar, which would also play a positive
    role in the electricity shortfall of the country, as we will save a lot of electricity
    from the agriculture sector by adopting solar as a power source. The solar power
    DIS should be used for high-value crops such as vegetables, maize, potatoes, and
    flowers for high economic returns, as the solar power drip irrigation system is
    a heavy investment indeed, which should return as soon as possible through cash
    crop adoption. Maintenance services should be provided by service and supply companies
    for at least five years, as the DIS payback period for solar power is at least
    five years. Drip irrigation system parts should be manufactured locally, and manufacturers
    should relax on extra taxes. It will lower the capital cost of solar power DIS,
    allowing farmers to easily adopt this system. Author Contributions Conceptualization,

  description: Implementation of rainwater harvesting systems (RHS) is an effective
    approach to tackle increasing water and energy shortages for sustainable urban
    development. However, water and energy saving executions of RHS are rarely explored
    together in cities. This study explores the water and energy saving and economic
    performances of RHS in the four cities (Islamabad, Lahore, Peshawar, and Khanpur)
    under different climate zones of Pakistan. Three water demands (lawn irrigation,
    toilet flushing, and their mixture) were evaluated. Results indicated that higher
    annual water savings of RHS were associated with larger tank-sizes and lesser
    water demands in humid region. Differently, higher annual energy savings of RHS
    were related to greater energy consumption for groundwater pumping and larger
    tank sizes. At Islamabad, a 20 m3 RHS can achieve 126 m3 of annual water savings
    and 80% time reliability for mixed water demand, but only 23 m3 of annual water
    savings and 10% time reliability at Khanpur. At Lahore, a 20 m3 RHS can attain
    119 kWh of annual energy savings for mixed water demand, but only 20 kWh at Khanpur.
    The economic viability of RHS was confirmed through adequately designed RHS at
    Islamabad, Lahore, and Peshawar, but except Khanpur due to its lower benefit-cost-ratio
    than 1.0.

    Highlights • Better water saving performance of RHS is related to larger tanks
    in humid regions. • Better energy saving of RHS is linked to larger tank and higher
    groundwater pumping. • Economic viability of RHS is obtained for its reasonable
    design based on BCR value. • Implementing RHS can noticeably reduce groundwater
    depletion in the studied cities. Abstract Implementation of rainwater harvesting
    systems (RHS) is an effective approach to tackle increasing water and energy shortages
    for sustainable urban development. However, water and energy saving executions
    of RHS are rarely explored together in cities. This study explores the water and
    energy saving and economic performances of RHS in the four cities (Islamabad,
    Lahore, Peshawar, and Khanpur) under different climate zones of Pakistan. Three
    water demands (lawn irrigation, toilet flushing, and their mixture) were evaluated.
    Results indicated that higher annual water savings of RHS were associated with
    larger tank-sizes and lesser water demands in humid region. Differently, higher
    annual energy savings of RHS were related to greater energy consumption for groundwater
    pumping and larger tank sizes. At Islamabad, a 20 m3 RHS can achieve 126 m3 of

    urban development 1. Introduction Along with environmental, socioeconomic, and
    climatic changes, urban water and energy supply systems are under massive stresses
    in many cities of the world (Moazeni & Khazaei, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Chiu
    et al., 2009). Moreover, due to rapidly growing population and urbanization, the
    demands for urban water and energy have dramatically increased in recent years
    (Raoufi & Gorji, 2021; Moazeni & Khazaei, 2020). As a result, a reliable supply
    of water and energy has become a critical and challenging issue in urban areas
    (Chiu et al., 2015). In this context, appropriate and effective measures should
    be taken to assure the sustainable supply of water and energy in urbanized areas,
    to support sustainable environmental, economic, and social developments in cities.
    Implementation of rainwater harvesting systems (RHS) is one of the most promising
    and effective measures to deal with worsening water and energy shortage in urbanized
    areas (Hume et al., 2022; de Sá Silva et al., 2022; Chui et al., 2015). RHS are
    used to accumulate and store rainwater from rooftops during rainfall events and
    conserve it in tanks to utilize as a substitute of tap water for non-potable or
    potable applications (Chen et al., 2022; Nachson et al., 2022; Ali et al., 2021,
    2020; Zhang et al., 2020). Rainwater harvesting may be a viable alternative in
    urbanized areas where water and energy supply is insufficient and thus expensive.
    Diverse techniques and modelling tools have been utilized for the design, optimization,
    and performance evaluation of RHS. They involve probabilistic analytical methods
    (Guo & Baetz, 2007), probability matrix-based non-parametric techniques (Basinger
    et al., 2010), dimensionless methods (Campisano & Modica, 2012), non-linear metaheuristic
    algorithms (Sample & Liu, 2014), linear programming methods (Okoye et al., 2015),
    and continuous simulation-based methods (Ali et al., 2020; Kim & Yoo, 2009). Among
    these approaches, long-term incessant simulations are often used as an important
    and effective approach to determine the optimal tank size for RHS (Wurthmann,
    2019; Jing et al., 2018). Many countries have investigated the water saving efficiency
    of RHS. A research conducted in different cities of Brazil reported that the potential
    efficiency of annual water savings of RHS changes from 12% to 79% (Ghisi et al.,
    2007). Abu-Zreig et al. (2013) reported that RHS could provide water savings of
    approximately 14.5 million m3 per year for domestic purposes in Jordan. Guizani
    (2016) stated that RHS could offer water savings of more than 7.5 m3/100 m2 per
    year in many cities of Saudi Arabia. Karim et al. (2015) revealed that annual
    water savings of RHS vary from 250 m3 to 550 m3 relying on catchment areas in
    Dhaka, Bangladesh. Jing et al., (2017) demonstrated that the water saving efficiency
    of a RHS changes from 2% to 20% in arid regions of China, depending on specific
    location and water demands. Ali et al., (2020) found that higher water saving
    efficiency of RHS could be attained with larger tank sizes and lower water demands.
    Furthermore, numerous studies have assessed the economic viability of RHS. Stec
    & Zelenˇáková (2019) analyzed the financial benefits of RHS in Europe and found
    that the RHS established at Košice dormitory is more financially feasible than
    that at Rzeszów dormitory. Tam et al. (2010) reported that RHS are financially
    considerable in several cities of Australia, such as Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane,
    Adelaide, Perth, Gold Coast, and Canberra. Jing et al. (2017) demonstrated that
    the economic feasibility of RHS could be gained in humid and semi-humid regions
    of China based on adequately planned RHS. Zuo et al. (2010) assessed 267 RHS in
    Beijing and found that 66.7% of the RHS can provide substantial monetary advantages.
    Water saving potential and economic viability of RHS significantly vary among
    cities, as they are fundamentally assessed by location conditions including climate
    condition, catchment area, and water demands (Shiguang & Yu, 2021; Ali et al.,
    2020; Sepehri et al., 2018; Jing et al., 2017; Tam et al., 2010). Although the
    water saving and economic executions of RHS have been investigated widely, the
    energy saving performance of RHS is rarely addressed together in urban areas to
    maximize the environmental and economic benefits of RHS, and to alleviate water
    and energy supply stresses simultaneously. Chiu et al. (2009) reported that RHS
    could be financially viable when water and energy savings are tackled jointly
    in hilly areas of Taipei city of Taiwan. Chiu et al. (2015) again assessed water
    and energy saving performances of RHS using a geographic information system (GIS)
    in the hilly area of a city and found that RHS approximately can annually conserve
    75.8 m3 of potable water and 138.6 kWh of energy per household. These studies
    considered only a small hilly area of a single city as a case study, where potable
    water was supplied via transportation. However, water and energy saving as well
    as economic performances of RHS have not been systematically investigated together
    in the flat areas of diverse cities under different scenarios (climatic conditions,
    water demands, tank sizes etc.), particularly where groundwater is the regular
    source of water supply associated with high energy consumption. To fill up above
    research gap, the main objective of this study is to systemically explore the
    water and energy saving as well as economic performances of RHS in the flat areas
    of four cities (Islamabad, Lahore, Peshawar, and Khanpur) of Pakistan under different
    climatic conditions and diverse water demands. A daily water balance model is
    adopted by incorporating daily rainfall data, tank sizes, rainfall loss factors,
    roof areas, and daily water requirement rates. The benefits and costs of RHS are
    compared to calculate the benefit-cost ratio, as an indicator to evaluate the
    economic feasibility of RHS in the four cities. Besides, three water demands (toilet
    flushing, lawn irrigation, and mixed water demands) are considered to explore
    the impacts of water demand scenarios and climate conditions on the water and
    energy conservation and economic benefits of RHS. The findings of this study will
    be valuable for residents and both water and energy officials for implementing
    RHS in cities, as a potential source of simultaneously reducing water and energy
    supply stresses for sustainable urban development. 2. Study area and data In this
    study, four cities in diverse climatic regions of Pakistan (Fig. 1) are chosen
    by applying the Köppen weather classifying system (Kottek et al., 2006). The selections
    of the four cities are threefold. First, Pakistan is currently facing serious
    water and energy shortage problems like many other developing countries because
    of industrialization, rapid population growth, and urbanization (Tao et al., 2022;
    Ali et al., 2020). Second, there lacks in-depth investigation on the water and
    energy saving and economic performances of RHS in Pakistan to assist residents
    and both water and energy officials for implementing RHS. Third, groundwater is
    the major source of water supply in the flat areas of the four cities (Kanwal
    et al., 2015; Ali, 2018; Adnan & Iqbal, 2014; Maqsoom et al., 2022), and anyone
    can freely pump groundwater water anytime (Ashraf et al., 2012). Consequently,
    the groundwater table continues to deplete in the studied cities. Hence, there
    is also an urgent need to reduce the pressure on the upper aquifers and search
    for more reliable water sources to support current water supply in the studied
    cities. Download : Download high-res image (2MB) Download : Download full-size

    “MAP” means mean annual precipitation at each city and it is estimated by using
    the rainfall data during 1980-2019. Among the four cities, Islamabad has a humid
    subtropical climate (Cfa). Khanpur has a warm desert climate (BWh). Lahore and
    Peshawar have a warm semi-arid climate (BSh). It is noted that the selected cities
    are mainly flat urban areas, with only a small part of hilly areas which are not
    considered in this study. Following previous studies (Ali et al., 2021, 2020),
    a single residential building for 4 people with a relatively flat rooftop area
    of 280 m2 and a lawn area of 80 m2 is chosen as a case study. It ought to be noticed
    that the rooftop areas and lawn areas are statistical values, and they vary among
    buildings for real cases. Rainwater generated from the rooftop is gathered and
    consumed for internal and external water usages after bypassing the first flush.
    Historical daily rainfall data during 1980-2019 for the four cities were attained
    from Climate Data Processing Centre, Pakistan Meteorological Department (http://www.pmd.gov.pk/cdpc/home.htm).
    Average annual rainfall values range from 138 mm in Khanpur to 1283 mm in Islamabad,
    as depicted in Table 1. Mean daily and monthly rainfall statistics in the four
    cities are displayed in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3, respectively. They indicate that the
    daily and monthly distribution patterns of rainfall vary substantially among the
    four cities. Table 1. Statistics of annual rainfall and climatic conditions of

    buildings depends on several parameters, including groundwater depth, volume of
    pumped water, and pump efficiency. For simplifying the calculation, this study
    inspected data from Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority (http://www.wapda.gov.pk)
    to attain the mean energy consumption (Eg) per unit for pumping groundwater (kWh/m3).
    The average value of energy consumption per 1 m3 for pumping groundwater ranges
    from 0.85 kWh to 1.30 kWh at the four cities, as shown in Table 2. Table 2. Average
    energy consumption per 1 m3 for pumping groundwater in the four cities considered
    in this study. City Energy (kWh /m3) Domestic unit price (Rupees/kWh) Islamabad
    0.90 20 Lahore 1.30 20 Peshawar 0.87 20 Khanpur 0.85 20 Three non-potable water
    demands are deemed, namely (1) toilet flushing, (2) lawn irrigation, and (3) mixed
    demands of them. The toilet flushing water demand per person per day is set as
    34L based on a previous study (Ali et al., 2020). For a single residential building,
    daily toilet flushing water demand is calculated as 4 people × 34L per person
    per day, that is, 0.136 m3/day. Lawn irrigation is influenced by diverse factors,
    including meteorological conditions, types of grass, and soil characteristics
    (Jing et al., 2017). For estimating lawn irrigation water demand, the mean reference
    evapotranspiration (denoted as ) of each month is estimated by employing the CROPWAT
    8.0 software for the four cities (Allen et al., 1998). The CLIMWAT 2.0 (Kiprop
    et al., 2015) is used to obtain the data inputs required for the CROPWAT 8.0.
    Providing mean reference evapotranspiration in each month, lawn irrigation water
    demand (ET) is estimated as (1) where ET is the irrigation water demand for a
    lawn (mm/day), and Kc is the coefficient of grass that is impacted by various
    components. In this study, Kc is set as 0.9 based on a previous study (Ali et
    al., 2020). The reference evapotranspiration and the irrigation water demand of
    each day, as well as the quota of irrigation for turfgrass lawn placed in the
    four cities, are presented in Tables 3 and 4. Table 3. Quota of lawn irrigation

    water balance model In this study, a daily water balance model is adopted. The
    model is built on the “yield after spillage” (YAS) release rule and the water
    balance equation (Zhang et al., 2020). In the model, after bypassing the first
    flush, the amount of rainwater ( , in m3) harvested from the contributing area
    is estimated as (2) where A is contributing area (m2); t is the day order; Ht
    is daily rainfall (mm); ψ is the runoff coefficient (dimensionless); δ is the
    volume of the first flush passed through the contributing area (mm). The amount
    of rainwater yield ( , in m3) is computed as (3) (4) where is the water demand
    of each day (m3); is the tank size (m3); is the amount of rainwater kept in the
    tank at the ending of the th day (m3). It was stated by previous studies that
    2 mm first flush (δ=2 mm) is generally conveyed aside from the rainwater storage
    components for improving harvested rainwater quality (Jing et al., 2017; Zhang
    et al., 2018; Yue et al., 2020). Commonly, a 10% deduction is employed to account
    for rainwater losses due to the spilling and evaporating of a rooftop RHS. Thus,
    the runoff coefficient is set as ψ=0.9 in this study. Note that the values of
    δ and ψ change with air quality, types of contributing areas, climate conditions,
    and storage units for real case studies. A conceptual framework of RHS is shown
    in Fig. 4, which also indicates the procedure of modelling. Download : Download

    framework of rainwater harvesting system (RHS) concerned in this study. 3.2. Water
    and energy saving performance indices of RHS Water saving performance of RHS is
    evaluated by 2 indices, i.e., annual water savings (WS, in m3/year) and time reliability
    (TR, in %) (Ali et al., 2020; Jing et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2018). Annual water
    savings of RHS is described as the total volume of rainwater supplied by the system
    per year (Shiguang & Yu, 2021; Rahman et al., 2012) and is expressed as (5) where
    n is the total number of daily rainfall records. Time reliability is the ratio
    of the number of days when water demand is met by collectible rainwater (Shiguang
    & Yu, 2021; Zhang et al., 2020; Rahman et al., 2012), and it can be calculated
    as (6) where N is the number of days in a year that the RHS may satisfy the water
    demand. The potential of annual energy savings (ES, in kWh/year) of a RHS can
    be derived from Eq. (5) as (7) where Eg is the energy consumption per m3 for pumping
    groundwater, with the parameter values shown in Table 2. 3.3. Financial feasibility
    analysis The benefit-cost ratio (BCR) is used to examine the financial feasibility
    of RHS by comparing the total profits (TB) and total costs (PV) of RHS (Ali et
    al., 2020). If the BCR of a RHS is greater (lesser) than 1.0, it is deemed profitable
    (unprofitable). The BCR is calculated as (8) with (9) (10) where B is the mean
    total economic benefits per year attained from RHS; d is the rebate rate and is
    considered as 10% here; m is the whole period of RHS; F is the fixed cost of RHS;
    C is the operating cost of RHS. As reported by Li et al. (2001), the whole duration
    of RHS might be deemed 30 years as a minimum period generally. Thus m=30 years
    is assumed. The profits and costs are shown in Pakistani currency, namely Rupees
    (Rs). Economic benefits of a RHS may include energy saving economic benefits (B1),
    national economic growth (B2), the reduction of societal calamity from low contaminant
    (B3), and the lessening of civic water discharge operating system and various
    other advantages (B4) (Ali et al., 2020; Zuo et al., 2010). The sum of economic
    benefits B is computed as (11) where Es is the energy saving benefits (Rs/kWh),
    and Vr is the collectible rainwater volume (m3); Pn is the operational investment
    of the metropolitan drainage system and supplementary advantages (Rs/m3); Ps is
    the diminishments in government revenue owing to the scarcity of water (Rs/m3);
    Pa is the controlling charges of sewerage (Rs/m3); α is the proportion of input
    and output of ecological control. Based on the case study (Ali et al., 2020),
    Pn= 8 Rs/m3, Ps= 100 Rs/m3, Pα= 10 Rs/m3, and α= 6 are set in this study. The
    investments of a RHS contain fixed initial assets cost and operational annual
    investment. The annual operational cost (C) involves management and maintenance
    (C1) and treatment of water (C2). All the cost values are shown in Table 5, which
    are based on a telephonic market survey and a previous study (Ali et al., 2020).
    As the water supply by RHS based on gravity is considered in this study (Severis
    et al., 2019; Shiguang & Yu, 2021), no costs of power consumption for RHS in this
    case. Table 5. Construction and maintenance investments of rainwater harvesting

    of RHS with different tank sizes in the four cities under three climate conditions
    and three water demand scenarios are estimated using Eq. (5), and the results
    are presented in Fig. 5. It is obvious from the results that in humid region,
    for lower water demands and with larger tank sizes, RHS can provide maximum annual
    water savings. Different variations in annual water savings of RHS can be seen
    in Fig. 5, which mainly rely on tank sizes, magnitude of local rainfall, climatic
    conditions, and water demands. For toilet flushing water demand, annual water
    savings increase rapidly when tank size ranges from 1 to 20 m3 (Fig. 5b); when
    tank size goes beyond 20 m3 at Islamabad, Lahore, and Peshawar (humid subtropical
    and warm semi-arid climate), annual water savings remain at a uniform threshold
    value of about 50 m3. The physical cause behind this phenomenon is that toilet
    flushing water demand is fully supplied by the RHS when tank size is about 20
    m3. Enlarging tank size beyond 20 m3 is not effective in terms of annual water
    savings of RHS for toilet flushing water demand at Islamabad, Lahore, and Peshawar.
    However, the annual water savings for toilet flushing water demand at Khanpur
    (warm desert climate) can increase to over 25 m3 as the tank size augments about
    40 m3 (Fig. 5b). Download : Download high-res image (675KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 5. Water savings of RHS for (a) lawn irrigation, (b) toilet
    flushing, and (c) mixed demand in the four cities. For lawn irrigation and mixed
    water demands, annual water savings of RHS increase from 6 m3 to 148 m3 when the
    tank size changes from 1 m3 to 40 m3 in the four cities (Fig. 5a and c). Islamabad
    has the highest annual water savings of RHS among the four cities, while Khanpur
    has the lowest for the three water demands and all tank sizes (Fig. 5). For example,
    40 m3 tank size located in Islamabad (humid subtropical climate) can achieve 148
    m3 annual water savings for mixed water demand, but only 27 m3 for Khanpur (warm
    desert climate) (Fig. 5c). The highest and lowest annual water savings of RHS
    at Islamabad and Khanpur are strongly related to the different average annual
    precipitation at the two cities (1283 mm for Islamabad and 138 mm for Khanpur).
    Theoretically, the same amount of groundwater can be conserved by implementing
    RHS per residential building each year, depending on the tank sizes, water demands,
    and availability of rainwater in the studied cities. As a result, groundwater
    depletion could be significantly reduced. Here, different tank sizes (1-40m3)
    were designed mainly to investigate their influences on the performance of RHS.
    For practical applications, the tank size must be ascertained based on the hydrologic
    condition, design codes and financial feasibility of RHS. 4.2. Time reliability
    of RHS The time reliability of RHS is evaluated using Eq. (6), and the results
    are shown in Fig. 6. It is found that the time reliability of RHS has approximately
    similar variations as annual water savings along with the increase of tank sizes.
    Higher time reliability of RHS is associated with larger tank sizes and lower
    water demands in humid region. For toilet flushing water demand, the time reliability
    of RHS is almost 100% when tank size is larger than 20 m3 at Islamabad, Lahore,
    and Peshawar (humid subtropical and warm semi-arid climate) (Fig. 6b). However,
    the time reliability for toilet flushing water demand at Khanpur (warm desert
    climate) can increase to above 50% as the tank size augments about 40 m3 (Fig.
    6b). Download : Download high-res image (696KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 6. Time reliability of RHS for (a) lawn irrigation, (b) toilet flushing,
    and (c) mixed demand in the four cities. For lawn irrigation and mixed water demands,
    the time reliability of RHS increases from 4% to 98% when the tank size changes
    from 1 m3 to 40 m3 in the four cities (Fig. 6a and c). Higher time reliability
    of RHS is achieved when the collectible rainwater is used for toilet flushing
    compared to lawn irrigation. The physical causes behind this phenomenon may be
    that water demand for toilet flushing is lower than that lawn irrigation. Islamabad
    has the highest time reliability of RHS among the four cities, while Khanpur has
    the lowest for the three water demands (Fig. 6). For instance, a 20 m3 tank size
    located in Islamabad (humid subtropical climate) can ensure 80% of days in a year
    for mixed water demands, whereas only 10% of days in a year at Khanpur (warm desert
    climate) (Fig. 6c). 4.3. Energy savings of RHS Fig. 7 shows the annual energy
    savings of RHS in the four cities under different tank sizes for three water demand
    scenarios. Results demonstrate that higher annual energy savings of RHS are associated
    with larger tank sizes and bigger energy consumption for pumping groundwater.
    Noticeable differences in the annual energy savings of RHS can be seen in Fig.
    7, which are not only dependent on energy consumption for groundwater pumping
    and tank sizes but also on water demands. For lawn irrigation and mixed water
    demands, annual energy savings of RHS increase from 5 kWh to 144 kWh when the
    tank size ranges from 1 m3 to 40 m3 in the four cities (Fig. 7a and c). Among
    them, Lahore has the highest annual energy savings of RHS, followed by Islamabad
    and Peshawar, while Khanpur has the lowest for three water demands (Fig. 7). For
    example, a 40 m3 tank size in Lahore (warm semi-arid climate) can achieve 144
    kWh annual energy savings for mixed water demand, but only 23 kWh for Khanpur
    (warm desert climate) (Fig. 7c). The highest and lowest annual energy savings
    of RHS at Lahore and Khanpur are closely associated with their different energy
    consumption for groundwater pumping (as shown in Table 2). Download : Download
    high-res image (680KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 7. Energy savings
    of RHS for (a) lawn irrigation, (b) toilet flushing, and (c) mixed demand in the
    four cities. For toilet flushing, annual energy savings of RHS enhance rapidly
    when tank size alters from 1 to 20 m3, and then keep at uniform threshold values
    about 64 kWh at Lahore, 45 kWh at Islamabad, and 42 kWh at Peshawar (Fig. 7b).
    It is explained that the water demand could be fully met by the system when tank
    size is about 20 m3, whose further increase cannot generate more benefits in terms
    of energy savings. While at Khanpur, annual energy savings of RHS for toilet flushing
    can go above 21 kWh when the tank size increases about 40 m3 (Fig. 7b). Note that
    climatic conditions may not control the energy saving execution of RHS in the
    studied cities, as the highest annual energy savings of RHS were obtained in the
    warm semi-arid climatic zone (i.e., Lahore) but not in the humid or warm desert
    climate zones. 4.4. Economic feasibility of RHS Financial evaluation is essential
    for reasonable design, planning, implementing and decision-making for RHS. By
    applying Eq. (8), the benefit-cost ratios (BCRs) of RHS are evaluated and the
    results are shown in Fig. 8. At Islamabad, Lahore, and Peshawar (humid subtropical
    and warm semi-arid climate), the BCRs of RHS augment to maximum values first and
    then decline with tank sizes varying from 1 to 40 m3. With reasonably adequate
    collectible rainwater at Islamabad, Lahore, and Peshawar, RHS with a small tank
    size can just offer weak profits. In contrast, a RHS with bigger tank size is
    allied with higher fixed costs and operating investments. Thus, RHS with very
    small or large tank sizes cannot give high BCRs. The highest values of BCRs recommend
    the optimal tank sizes of RHS at specific locations and for specific water demands.
    For example, as depicted in Fig. 8c, the optimal tank size of accumulating rainwater
    for combined demand of lawn irrigation and toilet flushing is about 5 m3, corresponding
    to the highest value (2.17) of the benefit-cost ratio. Download : Download high-res
    image (712KB) Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. Benefit-cost ratio of
    RHS for (a) lawn irrigation, (b) toilet flushing, and (c) mixed demand in the
    four cities. At Khanpur (warm desert climate), the BCRs of RHS reduce when the
    tank size escalates from 1 to 40 m3. Water and energy conservation as well as
    other environmental profits given by the RHS are relatively limited due to the
    arid climatic conditions. Consequently, BCRs will undoubtedly diminish with the
    increase of tank size, as the settled finance and functional investments of RHS
    rise along with the increase of tank sizes. In approximately all cases (different
    water demands and tank sizes) at Khanpur, the BCRs are lower than 1.0. It implies
    that adopting RHS may not be economically feasible in the warm desert climatic
    region. Nevertheless, rainwater is one of the most encouraging alternate sources
    of water in warm desert areas, and there is extended records of harvesting rainwater
    in these regions, although corresponding to high implementing costs (Hajani &
    Rahman, 2014; Ali et al., 2020; Jing et al., 2017; Mahmoud et al., 2016). There
    is a significant impact of water demand scenarios on the economic execution of
    RHS in both warm semi-arid and humid subtropical areas. It can be seen from Fig.
    8 that the RHS placed in a city with a similar tank size have lesser BCRs when
    collectible rainwater is supposed for toilet flushing compared to other water
    demands. For example, BCR is 0.87 for a 10 m3 RHS at Islamabad when collectible
    rainwater is consumed for toilet flushing (Fig. 8b), but it rises to 1.38 when
    used for lawn irrigation (Fig. 8a). The lower BCR of RHS for toilet flushing at
    Islamabad is due to its less water requirement, thus reducing the benefits achieved
    through RHS. 5. Discussion 5.1. Main contributions of this study This study mainly
    investigated the water and energy savings as well as economic performances of
    RHS in the four cities of Pakistan under different climatic zones. The results
    indicate that water saving performance of RHS primarily depends on the tank size,
    spatiotemporal variation of rainfall, and water demand scenarios. However, energy
    saving performance of RHS is mainly associated with energy consumption for pumping
    groundwater and tank sizes. The major influencing factors clarified in this study
    are coherent with those in many prior studies. For example, Chiu et al. (2015)
    reported that RHS can annually conserve 75.8 m3 of potable water and 138.6 kWh
    of energy per household, depending on tank size, local rainfall, water demands,
    catchment area, and local energy consumption. Shiguang & Yu (2021) assessed water
    saving performance of RHS under different climatic conditions in four cities of
    China and stated that water saving performance of RHS is dependent not only on
    tank sizes, roof area and rainfall, but also on water demand and climatic conditions.
    Overall, various factors, such as roof areas, amount of the first flush, amount
    of local rainfall, and climatic conditions, could jointly influence the amount
    of collectible rainwater, and further determine the different performances of
    RHS (Burszta-Adamiak & Spychalski, 2021; Kolavani & Kolavani, 2020; Şahin & Manioğlu,
    2019; Shadmehri Toosi et al., 2020; Litofsky & Jennings, 2014; Ali et al., 2020;
    Palla et al., 2012; Mehrabadi et al., 2013). The results also indicated that the
    economic viability of RHS at Lahore, Islamabad and Peshawar can be ensured when
    collectible rainwater is used for the three water demands. By searching for the
    highest value of BCR, the optimum tank size of RHS for specific water requirement
    can be inspected. However, the implementation of RHS at Khanpur is not economically
    feasible as the BCR is lesser than 1.0. To make RHS economically feasible at Khanpur,
    the government should provide subsidies to the residents considering overall socioeconomic
    and environmental benefits of RHS. As reported in previous studies (i.e., Shiguang
    & Yu, 2021; Stephan & Stephan 2017; Hajani & Rahman, 2014), the provision of subsidies
    by the government is also highly encouraged for warm desert areas to achieve economic
    feasibility of RHS. The same results are also obtained in Jing et al. (2017),
    which showed that economic viability of RHS may be obtained for reasonably intended
    RHS in cities with more rainfall rather than less rainfall. The economic feasibility
    of RHS relies on the steadiness among the fixed cost, operational and maintenance
    costs of RHS and other associated benefits (Guizani, 2016). This steadiness is
    a non-linear action of tank size, collectible rainwater, and actual rainwater
    demand for many purposes (Silva et al., 2015; Hashim et al., 2013; Bocanegra-Martínez
    et al., 2014). Assessing the impacts of these financial factors on the BCR over
    the total duration of RHS is needed to ascertain the optimal tank size. Similar
    to the BCR applied in this study, another indicator known as the payback period
    may also be employed to investigate the financial feasibility of RHS (Ali et al.,
    2020; Silva et al., 2015). 5.2. Uncertainties associated with the outputs of RHS
    The modelling outputs of RHS are mainly affected by three main sources of uncertainties
    associated with input data, model structure, and model parameters (Campisano et
    al., 2017; Montanari et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2020; Renard et al., 2010). Generally,
    two fundamental operating structures are used in hydrological models for evaluating
    RHS. They are yield before spillage (YBS) and yield after spillage (YAS) (Mitchell,
    2007; Liaw & Tsai 2004). It was reported by Jing et al. (2018) that the YAS algorithm
    tended to underestimate the execution of RHS, whereas the YBS algorithm overestimated.
    Mitchell (2007) recommended the YAS algorithm due to its conservative estimation
    of yield in preference to the YBS algorithm. The YAS algorithm has been adopted
    in numerous studies (Zhang et al., 2018; Silva et al., 2015; Yue et al., 2020).
    Therefore, a daily water balance model built on the YAS algorithm was adopted
    in this study, based on which the evaluation results of RHS can be reliable. Besides,
    the length and resolution of input daily rainfall and water demand data used also
    have a considerable effect on the evaluation results of RHS. More extended rainfall
    lengths offer higher precision in the simulation, as it denotes more suitable
    rainfall phenomena with the time (Sang et al., 2018). The World Meteorological
    Organization (WMO) recommends the length of rainfall data at least 30 years composed
    of a representative timeseries, called as “Climatology” (WMO, 1989). Previous
    studies proved that daily rainfall data is preferable to monthly rainfall records
    for the assessment and modelling of RHS (e.g., Imteaz et al., 2013; Wallace et
    al., 2015; Haque et al., 2016; Jing et al., 2017; Geraldi & Ghisi, 2018, 2019).
    Thus, the daily rainfall data with 40 years length (1980-2019), being longer than
    climatology (30 years), were used in this study to ensure the reliability of the
    results. However, the variations in patterns of rainfall and water demand (Koumoura
    et al., 2018; Lopes et al., 2017; Nápoles-Rivera et al., 2015) should be further
    considered to improve the modelling outputs of RHS. Catchment area is another
    factor which has potential influences on the execution of RHS. Fig. 9 demonstrates
    the impacts of catchment area (with a tank size of 5 m3 and for mixed water demand)
    on the water and energy savings as well as economic performances of RHS in the
    four cities. It shows that annual water and energy savings, time reliability,
    and benefit cost ratio of RHS augment with the catchment area. It means that a
    larger catchment area can generate more collectible rainwater, corresponding to
    more profits, which would be favourable for the implementation of RHS. Download

    Effects of catchment area on (a) water savings, (b) energy savings, (c) time reliability,
    and (d) economic performance of RHS in the four cities. As a result, this study
    was conducted in the consideration of present research gaps to examine the water
    and energy conservation and financial feasibility of RHS in Pakistan. Adopting
    RHS in residential buildings in the selected cities can conserve groundwater substantially,
    and thus groundwater depletion can be significantly reduced. Moreover, different
    catchment areas, water demand standards, numbers of inhabitants, and lawn areas
    of residential buildings in the cities can also be utilized in future research.
    In addition, many indirect profits like CO2 emission decrease, reducing water
    stress during peak hours, and storm runoff reduction should also be emphasized
    when planning to implement RHS in cities for sustainable urban development. 6.
    Conclusions A reliable supply of water and energy is not only becoming an urgent
    need but also a challenge for the sustainable development of cities around the
    world. In conventional practices, water conservation strategies rarely consider
    energy conservation together. Thereby, this study explored the water and energy
    conservation performances of RHS in the four cities of Pakistan under different
    climate conditions. Results indicated that the water and energy saving as well
    as economic performance of RHS varied significantly depending on many factors,
    including tank sizes, spatial variation of local rainfall, energy consumption
    for groundwater pumping, water demands, and climatic conditions. Overall, RHS
    are proven as not only a water conservation but also a novel and effective energy
    conservation approach to alleviate increasing water and energy shortage together
    in flat urban areas. Based on the benefit-cost ratio, the optimal tank size of
    a RHS for mixed water demand is 5 m3, which can provide 90 m3, 64 m3, and 57 m3
    of annual water savings, 57% 35%, and 34% time reliability, and 77 kWh, 83 kWh,
    and 50 kWh of annual energy savings at Islamabad, Lahore and Peshawar, respectively.
    Finally, it is suggested that the approach proposed in this study for exploring
    the performances of RHS has the potential for wide uses in other cities worldwide,
    to guide the reasonable implementation of RHS, and further to support the water
    and energy savings strategies as an important source of sustainable urban development.

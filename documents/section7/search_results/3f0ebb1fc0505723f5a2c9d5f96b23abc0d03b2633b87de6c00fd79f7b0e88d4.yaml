    rise in the population has immensely increased the pressure on the agriculture
    sector. With the advent of technology, this decade is witnessing a shift from
    conventional approaches to the most advanced ones. The Internet of Things (IoT)
    has transformed both the quality and quantity of the agriculture sector. Hybridization
    of species along with the real-time monitoring of the farms paved a way for resource
    optimization. Scientists, research institutions, academicians, and most nations
    across the globe are moving towards the practice and execution of collaborative
    projects to explore the horizon of this field for serving mankind. The tech industry
    is racing to provide more optimal solutions. Inclusion of IoT, along with cloud
    computing, big data analytics, and wireless sensor networks can provide sufficient
    scope to predict, process, and analyze the situations and improve the activities
    in the real-time scenario. The concept of heterogeneity and interoperability of
    the devices by providing flexible, scalable, and durable methods, models are also
    opening new domains in this field. Therefore, this paper contributes towards the
    recent IoT technologies in the agriculture sector, along with the development
    of hardware and software systems. The public and private sector projects and startup''s
    started all over the globe to provide smart and sustainable solutions in precision
    agriculture are also discussed. The current scenario, applications, research potential,
    limitations, and future aspects are briefly discussed. Based on the concepts of
    IoT a precision farming framework is also proposed in this article. A graphical

    term ‘Agriculture’ is inferred from the Latin words ‘Ager’ means ‘Land’ and ‘Culture’
    means ‘Cultivation’. It is the milestone field of human civilization and is one
    of the benchmark areas. This field is the withstander of the economies of various
    nations. According to the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations
    (FAO), more than 60% of the human population depends on agriculture for survival
    and around 12% of the total land area is under agricultural production [1]. Predicted
    by FAO, the global population will reach the mark of 8 billion people by the year
    2025 and 9.6 billion by the end of 2050 (FAO, 2009) [2]. The interpretation of
    this data shows that to tackle this population growth, an estimated increase of
    70% in food production must be achieved worldwide by 2050 [3]. Agriculture is
    also the second-largest greenhouse gas (GHG) emitter, because of fossil-based
    fertilizers, biomass, and machinery. In some of the developed and developing nations,
    the agriculture sector is the backbone of the economy. This field has a huge contribution
    in the growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of developing countries, in particular,
    some of them are listed in TABLE 1. TABLE 1 Nations Having Agriculture as a Major
    Part of Their GDP [4] In India, 53% of the population is dependent on the agriculture
    sector for employment and 61.5 % of the Indian population is primarily dependent
    on the agriculture sector for its livelihood [5]. Focusing on the market size,
    India is the second-largest fruit producer in the world. Based on certain data
    and statistics, the farming income in India is expected to double by 2022. Eyeing
    this change, there is an intra-state cluster development of certain states in
    terms of the agriculture sector. The various stats and numbers representing the
    impact of agriculture in the overall economic development of India as compared
    to other fields has been shown in Fig. 1. FIGURE 1. Contributions of various sectors
    in the Indian economy [6]. Show All At present, the demand is more than the supply
    generated and this curve will illustrate more unstable results in the coming years,
    due to increase in demand with population rise. To maintain the demand-supply
    curve, there will be enormous stress on the agricultural sector. Global warming
    and changing climatic conditions are also important factors to be taken into consideration.
    From the past decades, due to the increase in demand and pressure on the overall
    structure of the field, this area is witnessing the slow but progressive shift
    from traditional approaches to the most advanced technology-driven methods. The
    use of traditional approaches and conventional methods, as well as the changes
    in the environment, lay stress on the agricultural sector. Some of the challenges
    for the agricultural sector are given as follows: The use of traditional techniques
    of farming hinders the optimization of both cost and time. Depletion of the topsoil
    due to floods and winds resulting in the deposition of the pollutants, sediments,
    nitrates, and phosphates, result in causing the eutrophication and the runoff
    of the soil. Planting the same crop after each harvest makes the soil redundant
    of the essential nutrients. Water scarcity due to the climatic changes lowers
    the level of groundwater for irrigation, thereby disturbing the water cycle. Global
    climate changes due to the destruction of the tropical forests and the other vegetative
    species in agriculture result in the elevation of the carbon dioxide and other
    greenhouse gas levels. Lack of expertise in proper recognition of the particular
    plant species. There is no proper method to detect the disease at early stages,
    such that precautionary measures could be taken to prevent it. Therefore, because
    of these factors, the need for the creation of modern methods and intensification
    of the agricultural practices to use water, soil, minerals, and other resources
    efficiently becomes obligatory. The nature of the technology and devices is changing
    i.e. it never settles for any less. A lot of research papers addressing the challenges
    of agriculture in the IoT domain have been put forth. Constant developments and
    everlasting expectations from the existing technologies paves a great way for
    motivating academicians and researchers to set and attain new standards. During
    recent years, there has been a paradigm shift in the study and application of
    domains like IoT, cloud computing, machine learning, and big data, etc. Therefore,
    from the trends of these data sets, a constant need is felt to revisit the current
    standings and capacities of the new age IoT concepts. The modern-day requirements
    and the counteractive substitutes in the field of agriculture and changes exactly
    to the expectations based on the concepts of IoT must be addressed. The contribution
    of IoT in the agriculture field and certain gaps in resource utilization motivated
    us to perform a study that addresses current issues and applications of IoT in
    agriculture. Agriculture is expected to get immensely fortified by the advancement
    of technology especially by the domain IoT. Precision agriculture is the new term
    appended to the agriculture filed, with all the procedures being followed, addressed,
    and simulated in a tech-driven manner. Incorporation of the internet has started
    to revolutionize this field by associating devices together, now being identified
    as the Internet of Things. Coined in 1999 by a British visionary “Kevin Ashton”,
    Internet of Things is a consortium of devices connected [7]. The devices are associated
    with internet via Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Radio-frequency Identification
    (RIFD), Near Field Communication (NFC), Long Term Evolution (LTE), and other devices
    and communication technologies. This association helps the devices and the other
    objects transfer the information gathered to destined places all over the network.
    Precision agriculture, therefore, aims to optimize and improve agricultural processes
    to ensure optimum production with reliable, fast, and distributed dimensions thus
    providing growers a detailed overview of the ongoing scenarios in the cultivation
    stretches. This practice is followed to reduce energy consumption. The major areas
    where IoT can leave an everlasting impression are climate monitoring [8], data
    analytics [9], early disease detection [10], crop counting [11], smart irrigation
    [12], etc. With the spread of a network of devices, a communication channel can
    be established between the farmers, fields, and experts. By developing IoT based
    models, the field conditions can be monitored remotely on regular time intervals
    without any human intervention and after analyzing the data favorable and efficient
    decisions can be taken accordingly. This will help to ensure both field and market
    safety and security to the farmer. Also, with early monitoring of crops, disease
    detection can be done and thus preventive measures can be taken to save the crop
    beforehand. For producers it will also help in the analysis of consumer demands.
    Whether the product will be able to meet market expectations, thus creating an
    intelligent decision driven farming. An analysis of different existing articles
    addressing the research and development of precision agriculture is presented
    in TABLE 2. TABLE 2 Alaysis of Various Papers in the Field of Precison Agricuture
    for the Current Study In this article based on research gaps and findings obtained
    from articles analyzed below, a systematic survey is done. Therefore in this study,
    the most prominent problems of the agriculture sector, and solutions provided
    by modern systems are addressed and discussed in detail. The major contributions
    of this study are as follows: A comprehensive survey of the architectural, conceptual,
    and implementation details of IoT models adopted for Precision Agriculture has
    been carried out. Various IoT hardware platforms and other associated devices
    like sensors, accumulators, etc. along with their role in agriculture have been
    discussed in brief. Various IoT OS supported for Precision Agriculture have been
    discussed. The significance and key differences of MIoT in agriculture have been
    discussed along with related studies. Studies limited to a specific domain has
    been merged together for clear mapping of the domain. Sensors and their role in
    agriculture is discussed. Various projects/ start-up’s started all over the globe
    for tacking agricultural problems and providing intelligent and sustainable solutions
    to farmers have also been discussed. Functional concepts like limitations, improvements,
    future works and applications are discussed separately. The rest of the paper
    has been organized as in Section 2 various search and source methods used for
    the selections of relevant articles has been introduced, in Section 3 to get into
    the deep insight of the various concepts, theories, and devices related to the
    implementation of Internet of Things has been discussed, followed by Section 4
    which gives the various related studies concerning different applications of Internet
    of Things in Agriculture, findings like challenges, limitations, improvements,
    future work, etc. with a short description of our proposed work has been given
    in Section 5, and finally, at last, the article ends with a conclusion. Table
    3 gives the detailed nomenclature used throughout this article. TABLE 3 Nomenclature
    SECTION II. Sources and Search Methods The research methodology consists of going
    through articles based on the contribution of IoT and its related technologies
    for the advancement and development of the agriculture filed. For designing the
    overall structure of this article, the data and selected studies are chosen strictly
    based on a time frame. Most of the articles taken for study are sorted from 2015
    to 2020. This time frame is chosen to visualize and understand the current impact
    of IoT in the field. In TABLE 4, a summary of the resources from where the papers
    have been selected is presented. TABLE 4 Summary of the E-Reserves for Obtaining
    the Related Research Articles Given the objective of this article, research has
    been conducted thoroughly by examining the existing literature work related to
    the subject. For developing a firm foundation, the articles containing the origin
    of IoT, alongside current standings, recent trends, and technologies, were considered
    for a study concerning their contributions to the field of agriculture. By reviewing
    the existing literature, a sustainable framework has been developed to overcome
    the existing challenges in the field. The keywords mainly used to identify the
    literature included Precision Agriculture, Agriculture, Plant Monitoring, Internet
    of Things, Smart Agriculture, Smart Farming, Irrigation, Plant Pathology, Wireless
    Sensor Networks, etc. The eight-year trends of the different terminologies and
    their search significance over the years have been extracted from Google and are
    presented in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. FIGURE 2. Worldwide distribution of IoT of the
    past eight years [19]. Show All FIGURE 3. Precision Agriculture distribution worldwide
    of the past eight years [19]. Show All From the figures, it can be seen that the
    frequency of search or usage of these two terms is somewhat stable over the past
    eight years. An average, 80% of people talk and search about these topics for
    study and other related purposes, thus establishing the growing interest worldwide
    in this area. So for a better understanding, in the next section, the various
    terminologies related to the Internet of things concepts and devise have been
    discussed. SECTION III. Introduction to the Internet of Things (IoT) Concepts
    and Theories Inspired from the technology of the internet to connect the whole
    world, the Internet of Things constitutes of things possessing unique identities
    and are connected to the internet. A cosmos of sensors, actuators, appliances,
    and other devices connected with each over the internet, results in making the
    Internet of Things (IoT). The scope of IoT is not just limited to only connecting
    things but to allow them to communicate and exchange data. Based on the Electronic
    Devices and Network Annex-IEA-4E (EDNA), by 2020 the number of connected devices
    will rise to 50 billion, thus resulting in the generation of high revenue. IoT
    works in a layered manner depending upon the problem it is addressing. Therefore,
    it can be define that IoT possesses a layered architecture [20]. All these layers
    combined are called the IoT functional blocks. Apart from the functional blocks,
    various communication models that aid the smooth working of an IoT model are a
    request-response model, publish-subscribe, push-pull, and exclusive pair [20].
    Fig. 4 represents the reference architecture of IoT in agriculture and includes
    the following layers: device/physical layer, network layer, middleware layer,
    service layer, analytics layer, and end-user layer. The layered architecture includes
    all the hardware devices, facilities, equipment, internet, communication technologies,
    protocols, and data analytic algorithms. How the layers work along with each other
    is described below: Perception Layer: Also called physical or the device layer,
    this layer lies at the bottom of the architecture and constitutes of sensors,
    actuators, microcontrollers, gateways, routers, switches, hubs, etc. The main
    role of this layer is, how efficiently the sensing devices and the other equipment’s
    can work together to gather data. The microcontroller device acts as a controller
    as it performs all the networking ifunctionalities. The microcontroller also acts
    as a network regulating body as it regulates the networks, such that the sensors
    and other devices can collect data. The main aim of this layer is to capture data
    and transfer it to the other layer i.e., the higher abstraction layers. In terms
    of agriculture, the devices in the physical layer gather, soil, water, pH value,
    humidity, leaf wetness, and other data parameters. Also, the topology in which
    the devices are placed plays a major role in power consumption and efficient data
    collection in this layer. Network Layer: It comprises of internet and other communication
    technologies. The main aim of this layer is, how to achieve better communication
    in the platform. In terms of agriculture, the design of this layer plays an important
    role in a framework due to the selection of suitable communication technologies
    relevant to field size or the test bed size. LTE, CDMA, GSM, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, LoRa,
    NFC, UWB Bluetooth, and RIFD are some of the communication technologies used for
    agriculture purposes. ZigBee, LoRa, and NFC are the most used communication technologies
    employed depending upon the problem and the area to be addressed in the agro domain.
    NFC and Bluetooth are the most suitable for the greenhouses. Various protocols
    like HTTP, WWW, and SMTP serve for efficient communication in the agricultural
    scenarios. Middleware Layer: This layer in IoT architecture is accountable for
    device management, context awareness, interoperability, portability, and security-related
    responsibilities. In terms of agriculture scenarios, HYDRA, SMEPP act as best
    middleware due to their context-aware functionalities. Service Layer: Dealing
    with agricultural problems, cloud-assisted service layer in IoT layered architecture
    plays a prominent role in providing cloud storage and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
    To facilitate the function of sensing, actuation, and other activities, this layer
    focuses on some main areas or domains such as monitoring, detection, control,
    decision making, recognition, etc. The service layer offers services like device
    monitoring, control, discovery, and data publishing services. Analytics Layer:
    The layer is responsible for the processing and analysis of data. This layer works
    as a consortium of two steps- 1) Data ingestion, is the step that performs storage,
    cleansing, and streaming of data and the 2) Data analytics, which performs data
    reporting, mining, and learning. In the analytics layer various machine learning
    tools, data analytic algorithms are employed to give early predictive decisions
    for measuring the crop yield, crop growth, disease detection, etc. These decisions
    can enhance farm monitoring capacity. The predictive decisions can help in the
    design of better decision support systems. End-User Layer: Being the topmost layer
    of the model, it serves the consumer or the user. To provide the interface to
    the users to control and monitor their model, this layer allows them to view the
    system status, analyze or process the data. In agro models, the farmer is the
    end-user. This layer provides a user-friendly experience and platform to the farmers.
    The services or applications in this layer are designed based on the behavioral
    study and pattern analysis of the user. Various intelligent approaches and data
    analytic studies are employed to understand the behavior of the users, as they
    come with different needs and offer a lot of diversity. Social media, Cloud computing,
    Mobile messaging are the platforms used to provide services to users, experts,
    and industries. Through this layer, the whole IoT based platform can be monitored,
    controlled, and run. The services generated from this layer are mostly the link
    between the user and the systems/platforms. FIGURE 4. A layered ecosystem/architecture
    of Agro-IoT. Show All A. Multimedia Internet of Things (MIoT) in Agriculture Based
    on the working, nature of deployment, and the subject IoT concepts are used to
    address, traditional IoT is differentiated into various forms such as IoMT, MIoT,
    IIoT, etc. Without the inclusion of these concepts, IoT systems cannot successfully
    realize the concept of ubiquitous computing. In these paradigms, the interaction
    and cooperation between the heterogeneous devices is facilitated. Due to the increase
    in the number, diversity of devices and data with time, these concepts have become
    more functional and prominent to develop models and techniques for coming challenges
    and reflect the possibilities enabled in them. All these concepts have the same
    main character of availability, intelligence, and devices but they only differ
    in their due course of action i.e., their general usage. Being an allied branch
    or extension of IoT, MIoT, include smart objects that are usually resource-constrained,
    in terms of memory, energy, and processing power. Due to the progressive reduction
    in size and cost of production of these devices, MIoT models are expected to be
    developed and deployed on a large scale. Generally, the sensors of these models
    are usually designed to be battery operated or solar power operated. Due to the
    large data sensing and analysis, these devices require high computational power.
    Mostly, the multimedia data includes audio, video, and image data, which possess
    unstructured features and is difficult to transmit and analyze on a computationally
    scarce network and low bandwidth conditions. Multimedia data shows different behavior
    compared to the scalar data due to its computational complexity and network topology
    bottlenecks to the Quality of Service (QoS). A lot of work has been done in IoT
    and its allied fields to realize the concept of heterogeneous, low-level data
    transmission, and communication. In agricultural frameworks, the data is mostly
    in the visual form e.g., pest images, plant disease images, field images, etc.
    The characteristic difference in scalar and multimedia data is shown in Fig. 5.
    FIGURE 5. Key characteristic differences between IoT and MIoT data [25]. Show
    All Depending upon the various parameters there are key differences between IoT
    and MIoT and they are discussed as: The IoT systems work mostly on non-heterogeneous
    devices while the MIoT functions well in case of heterogeneity. IoT data is mostly
    scalar, however, MIoT considers the multimedia data. Traditional IoT networks
    does not take into consideration the concept QoS while transmission and communication
    whereas in case of MIoT, QoS and QoE play a major role as the prime parameters.
    IoT can function well over low bandwidth channels whereas MIoT networks are in
    demand of high bandwidth due to bulky data. Node operation is predefined in IoT
    whereas in MIoT the node operation is adaptive in nature. Various authors have
    worked on the implementation of concepts of MIoT for agriculture. Zhang et al.
    [21], worked on the concept of preserving the concept of data confidentiality
    while realizing the challenge of low-cost data acquisition. A measurement matrix
    under the control of chaos and random subsampling is employed to capture the ruptured
    image signals. Then these sampled sub-images are assembled to form a big master
    image and then encrypted based on android transform and single value diffusion.
    Correlation, histogram, keyspace, robustness, real-time, and entropy analysis
    are performed to understand and realize the concept of low-level transmission.
    Rani et al. [22], worked on the concept of bridging the gap between the scalar
    and multimedia data, and for this, they developed an IoMT cross-layer protocol.
    This protocol considered cross-communication between the physical, data link,
    and routing layers. The main objective of this work was to achieve energy-efficient
    communication with less computational time complexity. An optimal mathematical
    model was developed to study the cross-layer behavior in all the three layers,
    therefore selecting the efficient one. A comparative study was conducted on two
    parameters like delay and distance. Usman et al. [23], proposed a multilayer framework
    based on multilevel edge computing architecture to manage, and preserve the privacy
    of end devices from external attacks. Authors mainly focused on the three major
    challenges i.e., node management, privacy-preserving, and network protection.
    The proposed architecture is divided into three layers with the first layer comprising
    of underlying network partitioned into multiple clusters to manage end-devices
    and Level-One Edge Devices (LOEDs). In the second layer, the LOEDs apply an efficient
    aggregation technique to reduce the volumes of generated data and preserve the
    privacy of end-devices. Local differential privacy-based technique is applied
    to protect the privacy of sensitive information in aggregated data. In the last
    layer, the mobile sinks are registered with a level-two edge device via a handshaking
    mechanism to protect the underlying network from external threats. Floris and
    Atzori [24], addressed the issue of evaluation of Quality of Experience (QoE)
    for IoT applications where mostly multimedia data is involved. For designing a
    layered architecture, authors first tried to analyze the QoE parameters or factors
    with applications in the relevant scenarios. Then a layered multimedia IoT architecture
    was proposed for QoE analysis by combing each of the analytic and contributing
    factors. Zikria et al. [25], presented a brief overview of the MIoT along with
    its challenges, solutions and future opportunities. The authors discussed the
    data differences between the traditional IoT and MIoT, along with the role of
    communication technologies. The demand for realizing the dream of MIoT and its
    bottlenecks were also discussed. The challenge of data collection and its impact
    over the network traffic is also discussed along with the methodologies developed
    to solve it. Nauman et al. [26], presented a comprehensive survey on the multimedia
    internet of things. Authors discussed the existing role of MIoT in concern with
    various fields like medical, agriculture, automation, and industry, etc. The importance
    of QoE and QoS for multimedia transmission over IoT channels is also discussed.
    A better need for routing and Physical-Medium Access Control (PHY-MAC) protocols
    for M-IoT was also discussed. A potential discussion on open research issues related
    to multimedia communication in IoT was presented. Alsamhi et al. [27], presented
    a survey on the role of green IoT in greener and smart cities. The authors focused
    on how the environment pollution can be controlled along with other parameters
    for making living more sustainable and green with the aid of IoT concepts. AlSkaif
    et al. [28], presented a survey on the energy efficiency of MAC protocols in low
    data rate wireless multimedia sensors. The conflicting goals of WMSN were also
    discussed. Role and challenges of multimedia data were also discussed. A focused
    analysis was performed on network parameter constraints and what techniques are
    employed to solve them. A comparison of the energy consumption of MAC protocols
    in four selected application scenarios related to smart cities and environment
    monitoring was also presented. Libo et al. [29], worked on how with the use of
    multimedia data in the form of images can be employed to detect the plant diseases.
    Rape diseases were studied as a case study. Authors also discussed the challenges
    and bottlenecks faced for the transfer of multimedia data over low bandwidth channels.
    With machine intelligence, authors also proposed a diagnostic procedure via which
    the data can be transferred over wireless multimedia sensors networks. Psannis
    et al. [30], proposed a technique for the transfer of advanced media-based smart
    big data via intelligent systems. Authors in their work addressed the problem
    of the rapid rise of devices and heterogeneity. An encoding algorithm with HVEC
    standard for performance evaluation was proposed to transfer the data intelligently.
    B. Hardware Platforms for IoT The hardware platform for IoT comprises a set of
    compatible hardware capable of running certain software. The main components of
    a hardware platform are machine language, sensors, wireless devices, programs,
    and processors, protocols, etc. The processor in a hardware platform determines
    how much fast a framework can work. To design certain new methodologies in IoT,
    various hardware platforms supported are elaborated as: 1) Raspberry Pi It is
    a series of single-board computers developed in the UK by Raspberry foundation.
    There are various families of raspberry i.e., Raspberry Pi 1, Raspberry Pi 2,
    Raspberry Pi 3, Raspberry Pi Zero, Raspberry Pi 4. All these families have different
    models. The Broadcom processor is used in most of the boards. It acts more like
    a computer system and can do multitasking [31]. 2) Arduino Uno Developed by Arduino.cc,
    it is a microcontroller board and is based on the ATMega32 processor. Arduino
    Uno possessing a USB port is a very valuable addition to the family of microcontrollers.
    Various versions of Arduino like Arduino Uno, Arduino Due, Arduino Leonardo, and
    Arduino Mega are present in the market. Out of these the most common versions
    are Arduino Uno and Arduino Mega [32]. 3) Node MCU It is an open-source IoT platform.
    It generally refers to firmware rather than the development kits. It is a low-cost
    open-source kit/module developed for the ESP8266 Wi-Fi chip. It is developed in
    the Arduino IDE environment [33]. 4) Beaglebone Developed by Texas Instruments,
    it is a low-cost open-source single-board computer. Its size measures 75 by 75
    mm and possesses all the functionality of a basic computer. It requires 2W of
    power or a 5V separate power and can work smoothly without any cooling or sinks
    [34], [35]. 5) Banana Pi It is a low-cost credit-card-sized single-board computer
    developed by a Chinese company Shenzhen SINOVOIP Co. Ltd. The hardware design
    is hugely influenced by Raspberry Pi. It is compatible with Raspberry Pi boards
    as well. It can be developed both on Android and Linux [36]. The various hardware
    platforms of IoT with their functional specifications are given in TABLE 5. TABLE
    5 Hardware Platforms of IoT and Their Specifications C. IoT Operating System (IoT
    OS) for Agriculture IoT operating system (IoT OS) is an operating system designed
    to perform within the constraints particular to Internet of Things devices. IoT
    OS are designed and developed in such a way that it can function under the restrictions
    of memory, size, power and processing capability. The main aim of IoT OS is to
    enable successful data transfer over the network via internet. The IoT OS for
    a particular framework is not chosen at random. Certain parameters such as footprint,
    scalability, portability, modularity, connectivity, and reliability are taken
    into consideration. As per the requirement of agriculture, a huge number of devices
    are connected having different features and also the devices have to withstand
    the different environments, the OS then to be chosen must be scalable, cost-efficient,
    and reliable. Various studies have been put forward for the role of IoT OS in
    network management and overall communication. Javed et al. [37], provided a detailed
    reviewed comparison of the operating systems designed for IoT devices based on
    their architecture, scheduling methods, networking technologies, programming models,
    power, and memory management methods, along with other features required for IoT
    OS applications. Musaddiq et al. [38], studied the role of small IoTOS in powering
    the scarce network devices. Authors also put light on the energy consumption of
    these devices. A detailed discussion on IoT devices and resource management is
    provided and some state of art IoT OSs such as Contiki, TinyOS, and FreeRTOS are
    also investigated. Baccelli et al. [39], a comprehensive review of RIOT is provided.
    The key components highlighted in this study are the kernel, hardware abstraction,
    software modularity for various configurations. The authors also discussed the
    operational aspects like system boot-up, timers, power management, and networking
    along with the relevant APIs. Zikria et al. [40], proposed a study for the management,
    challenges, and opportunities of IoT OS in managing IoT systems. The authors discussed
    the issue of interoperability, protocol functionalities to support heterogeneous
    deployment scenarios. Supported hardware and future research trends are also discussed.
    Ain et al. [41], proposed an efficient and flexible decision-making system for
    maintaining user thermal comfort with the help of intelligent sensors. Fuzzy based
    approach along with RIOT OS was developed to tackle the problem of fluctuation
    and adjustment. Results show that the proposed approach can perform 28% better
    than the existing approaches in terms of energy efficiency. Stergiou et al. [42],
    studied the transfer of metadata in the IoT networks. Authors discussed the techniques
    and open tools such as CC analyzers and simulators which can provide intelligent
    metadata transfer over a network. The experimentation was performed on CloudSim
    and Cooja emulator of Contiki OS for the testing of a single network segment.
    From the experimentation, it was found that no duplicate packet transfer occurred
    which is a good sign for multimedia data transmission. The various IoT OS with
    their functional specifications are presented in TABLE 6. TABLE 6 IoT OS Platforms
    in Agriculture and Their Specifications D. Sensors and Their Role in Agriculture
    Sensors are the devices, modules, machines or subsystems capable of detecting
    the changes or events in the environment. They also send signals back to the receiver
    end. Mostly the sensors are used with other electronics. A sensors sensitivity
    usually indicates how much change in sensor output occurs with respect to the
    change in the input quantity measurements. Most sensors possess the linear transfer
    function. The sensitivity of a sensor is defined as the ratio between the output
    signal and the measured property. The resolution of a sensor is the smallest change
    it can detect in the quantity it is measuring. In the area of agriculture, demand
    of technological solutions with high aim in rising production and quality is increasing
    day by day. Also the solutions are required which provide optimal analysis and
    sustainable methods for the field development with reduced cost and time. To sustain
    such challenges, sensor- based technologies have proven to be of much help to
    tackle the above issues and challenges. Precision agriculture is an emerging area
    where sensor based technologies are playing a major role. Since the sensors are
    a major data collection agents, they play a dynamic role in agriculture. Also,
    it is very difficult to collect the data from an agricultural field due to the
    undulating field conditions that keep on changing over time. Sensors are selected
    or designed according the problem to be addressed or needs identified by the farmers.
    Agriculturalists generally use sensors to sense the soil conditions, humidity,
    crop conditions, minerals, pH value, water levels, and sunlight, etc. The nature
    and the characteristics of the component which needs to be sensed also plays a
    major role in the development of a sensing device. With the development of technology,
    machinery and easy-to-use microcontroller platforms, the usage of sensors has
    expanded beyond the traditional fields of measurement i.e., temperature, pressure
    and flow. However, the analog sensors such as potentiometers and force sensing
    resistors are still widely in use. Pajares et al. [54], discussed the sensors
    in agriculture and forestry. In the article, various related works of the sensors
    performed by different authors in the same domain were presented. The role and
    importance of the component or substance which needs to be sensed was discussed
    along with their characteristics and specifications. The major areas focused by
    authors were soil analysis, seed growth, weed detection, forest stands and reflectance,
    machinery for effective treatments, microorganisms, pest control, seedling breeding,
    growing, state of health, positioning, navigation, safety, detection and classification.
    Zhu et al. [55], showed that LIDAR, IMU, and Encoder (x2) can be used for designing
    a prototype vehicle for the agricultural domain. The authors also discussed how
    these sensors can be used for the development and usage of that prototype in case
    of undulating surfaces and rough terrains. A complete review of the wireless sensors
    and the network applications used in agriculture is provided. The authors also
    addressed the importance of sensors in the field of agriculture. Along with the
    sensors, the communication technologies that support sensor communications are
    also mentioned by Rehman et al. [56]. The sensors used in the medical and agricultural
    fields have also been discussed. In the case of the agricultural field, the various
    conditions and circumstances affecting the data collection from sensors are addressed.
    The various types of sensors and their platforms used by different authors in
    their work are also included by Chokkareddy et al. [57]. Plageras et al. [58],
    used efficient IoT based sensor and big data analytics for secure collection of
    data and communication over a channel. In the study, smart housing or building
    was taken as case study, and the secure data collection with the sensors was performed
    and analyzed. The behavior of various sensors for data collection in different
    scenarios in terms of IoT and cloud computing was studied by Stergiou et al. [59].
    The secure communication among devices was also studied along with performance
    bottlenecks and challenges. The various sensors and their use in agriculture is
    discussed below: 1) Level Sensors They measure the substance of liquid in a cast.
    The cast can be any agricultural field, pond, water tank, etc. They measure data
    in two methodologies 1) Point level measurements: indicate only whether the constituent
    or level measured is above or below the sensing point or threshold. 2) Continuous
    measurements: specific range measurements and exact substance amount determination
    are performed by these sensors. In agricultural fields, the water level sensors,
    humidity sensors, and moisture sensors are used to measure the water content levels
    in a field. The point level sensors are used when the water content in the cast
    i.e., soil or testbed is very less i.e. in dry and arid areas, whereas the continuous
    level sensors are feasible for semi-arid locations. Some of the ultrasonic level
    sensors are also used in water treatment plants. Blank et al. [60], designed a
    low-level senor based fusion application for agricultural machinery design. 2)
    Temperature Sensor Temperature sensors measure the temperature of the environment
    or surroundings. They are of different types i.e. thermistors, thermocouples,
    resistance temperature detectors, infrared sensors, semiconductor sensors. In
    agriculture they measure the temperature variants in a field. Mahan et al. [61]
    designed an optimal temperature based field monitoring system by using a low-cost
    infrared sensor. 3) Proximity Sensors Detect the presence of nearby objects without
    any physical intervention. The sensor works by emitting an electromagnetic beam
    in the field and looks for any alterations in the signal. These are mainly employed
    in agricultural cattle grazing, counting of fruits, etc. Kim et al. [62] used
    a capacitive proximity sensor to optimize the harvest yield of fields. 4) Infrared
    Sensors Senses the changes in the environment by emitting infrared rays. They
    work in two approaches i.e., active and passive. An active IR sensor can both
    emit and detect the radiations and constitute a light-emitting diode and a receiver.
    The passive IR sensors can only detect the radiation and possess only a LED. In
    agriculture field infrared sensors can be employed to detect the presence of rodents
    in the orchards, count the number of plants or trees in the field, capturing satellite
    images of the field. Allred et al. [63], used IR sensor-based satellite imagery
    to map the findings and results of UAV to chart agricultural drainage systems.
    5) Touch Sensors Also known as tactile sensors, work on sensing the touch. They
    are low-cost sensors. In the agriculture field they can be used for the detection
    of intrusions in the field. Depending on the target and the range, there are different
    types of sensors, the same are discussed in Fig. 6 and TABLE 7 below: TABLE 7

    is redefining the agriculture system and boosting farmers to work, is portrayed.
    Authors studied the recent developments of IoT and how it is helping in providing
    the solutions while designing an IoT system for agriculture, what strategies and
    policies need to be considered. The advanced agricultural practices such as greenhouses,
    vertical farming, hydroponic farming, and phenotyping are also explained. All
    the crop stages and potential challenges are also discussed. Farooq et al. [66],
    presented many aspects of IoT in agriculture. Authors discussed all the recent
    technologies associated with IoT along with big data analytics for the development
    of precision agriculture systems. Various network topologies, architectures, layers,
    and protocols are also presented. In context to the development of a smart farm,
    all the major components and relevant technologies were discussed. Also, the regulations,
    standardizations, and policies used by several countries to standardize IoT methods
    for agriculture have been discussed. Elijah et al. [67], gave an overview of IoT
    and data analytics technologies and practices in agriculture. The authors divided
    their study into four sections i.e., communication technology, internet, data
    storage, technology. The authors also provided an analysis and data on how the
    aforementioned sections can be employed for dealing with the diminishing agricultural
    resources. The pros and cons of various technologies such as cloud computing,
    WSN, radio frequency identification, middleware systems, etc. to their application
    in the agriculture field are also discussed. Studies on how these technologies
    can be used to develop an IoT ecosystem, with technical and business scenarios
    were also presented. Misra et al. [68], discussed the concepts and role of IoT,
    AI and big data in the field of agriculture. In the review, focus was laid on
    green- house monitoring, disease detection, usage UAV machines and drones agriculture
    and supply chain modernization, social media in food industry, food quality assessment
    and modernization for food traceability. Thakur et al. [69], reviewed articles
    of repute in the context of the employability of WSN in agriculture. The authors
    highlighted the different communication technologies and WSN technologies adopted
    for precision agriculture. The authors also discussed various sensors and their
    role in agriculture. The influence of various techniques for designing the models
    is also discussed at length. Damos [70], presented a review on the pest control
    in precision agriculture. The author discussed the various computer-aided technologies
    employed for forecasting and designing decision support systems. The challenges
    and constraints of designing the decision support system were highlighted. The
    most available and published data present online in terms of pest management was
    also discussed. A differentiation between the documented and existing decision
    support systems was highlighted. The advancement and role of the internet of things
    in precision agriculture along with the related areas where research is being
    conducted are discussed in this section. Literature including various approaches,
    techniques, and methodologies presented by the number of authors has been divided
    into different sections and are discussed as follows: A. IoT in Farm Management
    Farm management refers to the construction and implementation of decisions for
    obtaining the maximum production and profit via organizational operation of decisions.
    This area is most benefitted by automation and the implementation of new technological
    methods. With farm management agricultural practices are made informative by evaluation
    and comparison with the other developed approaches and methods. Diedrichs et al.
    [71], with the aid of machine learning and IoT sensing devices, predicted the
    occurrence of frost events. Authors designed their system based on three layers
    i.e., a group of internet-enabled devices for water data collection. The authors
    augmented the data using the synthetic minority oversampling technique due to
    its capability of reducing the occurrence of errors with the ML approaches. The
    humidity and temperature sensors were employed to collect data from five meteorological
    stations of the Mendoza Province of Argentina. For each station, the existing
    sensor data spanning from a period 2001 to 2016 was taken as a reference to collect
    the daily data. The data was divided into two sets i.e., locally available is
    the config-local and the one available globally is the config-all. Bayesian Networks
    were employed along with SMOTE and recursive portioning, to train the system.
    Jawad et al. [72], designed a wireless power transfer technology based on a drone
    charging system for smart agriculture. The authors used the concepts of magnetic
    resonator coupling and sleep/active modes of charge transfer system for designing
    the model. Authors mainly focused on how to charge wirelessly the drones and other
    equipment employed in agricultural field monitoring. The magnetic resonant coupling
    technique was considered due to its capability of high power transfer and efficiency.
    In the experimentation, authors found that the FSC coil with 150 coil turns in
    the transmitter circuit and the MTC comprising of 60 coil turns in the receiver
    (i.e. drone) accomplish the maximum transfer power and efficiency. For finding
    the accurate efficiency, the model was tested based on different load, and how
    to load misalignment changes the model behavior was also noted. Drone flight time
    was also taken into consideration and was estimated based on the adopted battery
    capacity and payload of the drone. Tseng et al. [73], proposed an intelligent
    IoT based platform for farm management. The authors took the data based on different
    plants i.e., beans, spinach, celery via sensors, and used 3D normalization on
    that data to extract the optimal/useful data. The average and variance were moved
    to obtain user data without making any visible changes in the actual data. Farmer’s
    behavior was analyzed for the application of pesticides and fertilizers. For the
    platform development SIM5320E, IoT Development Board is used along with the BH1750
    illumination sensor and BME280 temperature and moisture sensor. Bacco et al. [74],
    designed a model based on air-ground UAV communications for smart farming. Authors
    empirically and analytically developed a real test-bed implementation of IEEE
    802.15.4 based communication between unmanned aerial vehicle and ground sensors.
    The focus was laid on how to transfer data between sensors and other devices present
    on the ground in an optimized manner to ensure fewer transmission losses. From
    the experimentation, and result analysis authors found the Gilbert-Elliot model
    to be suitable to approximate the packet loss in the link at low transmission
    speeds. The authors used approximately 80,000 datasets from the testbed. Ahmed
    et al. [75], based on the concepts of fog computing and Wi-Fi-based long-distance
    networks proposed a system for smart monitoring. In comparison to the existing
    traditional models, a scalable and flexible model was designed for monitoring
    and controlling agro farms in rural areas. Authors introduced a WiLD network and
    fog computing in the existing WSN-based solutions to cover long ranges with fewer
    delays. A cross-layer based MAC and routing solution for sensing and actuating
    were proposed to reduce the network latency. Throughput, coverage range, and network
    latency of the network structure were analyzed. Liu et al. [76], by hybridizing
    the concepts of IoT, cloud computing, and data mining proposed an integrated framework
    for the agricultural field. China was considered as the territory to design and
    devise mechanisms to enhance modern agriculture as compared to the conventional
    one. Quality, safety, management, and pollution are were taken into consideration
    while designing the model. NoSql database, DynamoDB, relational database Oracle,
    and file object storage Amazon S3, were employed to provide the hybrid data storage
    design. Bai et al. [77], due to the issue of frequently changing environmental
    conditions addressed the issue of estimation and control in the greenhouse. The
    authors studied how to collaboratively deploy WSNs and actuator schemes for agriculture.
    Sensor nodes were used to conduct a local estimation with Kalman filters to enhance
    the stability and transmission of data ensuring energy optimization. Using the
    concepts of collective clustering and mutual effect, the actuator node based scheme
    is designed for the improvement of estimation speed and conversion accuracy. Parameter
    optimization is achieved through fuzzy neural networks along with the PID control
    algorithm. Jinbo et al. [78], performed research on developing a platform for
    the monitoring of a field with agricultural modernization. A system named DEMO
    was proposed by using the SpringMVC framework, MyBatis, Spring Data DynamoDB Stored
    Procedure, Paho, and other related technologies grounded on the J2EE platform.
    Open-source elements such as raspberry, IoT gateway integrated with the ZigBee
    module were used for the development of the platform and were chosen due to their
    stable and cost-efficient properties. The proposed system is capable of massive
    data processing and analysis for agricultural monitoring. RESTful interface service
    system developed on a cloud platform, ExtJs client technology, and WeChat were
    applied to develop the Demo system of an application layer. Mukherjee et al. [79],
    worked on the challenges of a decentralized and heterogeneous UAV swarm deployment.
    The work is focused on how to design and deploy a UAV in resource-constrained,
    harsh, and challenging environments. Swarm edge due to its heterogeneous nature
    and unequal data generation within its member’s results in under-utilization of
    the available computational resources. To solve this issue, the authors proposed
    a Nash bargaining-based weighted intra edge processing offload scheme which can
    reduce the problem of heavy processing in some swarm members. The proposed method
    achieves better scalability and reduced processing delays. Chen et al. [80], developed
    an IoT based inexpensive platform named ‘AgriTalk’ for precision soil farming.
    Turmeric plant was considered for cultivation and experiments were conducted to
    enhance its growth and production. Authors employed AgriTalk in developing several
    other IoT based models for the fields of Mountain Bao in Taiwan. For the study
    authors grew turmeric in three fields. The proposed model is capable of addressing
    dynamic changes in the field conditions for plants grown via in-soil cultivation.
    Automated devices like sensors, actuators with desired farming intelligence were
    employed to design the model. Manual delays for automatic control and switching
    over long distances were also addressed. From experim-entation it was found that
    the curcumin concentration in turmeric leaves after six months was elevated to
    6685.6 μM as compared to 72.1 μM thus witnessing a fivefold increase. Lopez et
    al. [81], proposed a smart system for estimation of soil parameters using an autonomous
    wireless sensor network. Phosphorus content in the soil was measured. For power
    optimization and maintaining a balance between change rate phenomena of soil throughout
    the day for phosphorous estimation, authors developed a dynamic power management
    approach. DPM was tested on both the circuit level and the system level. ANN was
    used to find the significant correlations between the soil parameters such as
    electrical conductivity, phosphorous, temperature, and humidity. Also, energy
    harvesting with the help of IoT and cloud services is proposed. Chen and Yang
    [82], provided a detailed analysis of how efficiently the systems can be developed
    for agriculture based on the techniques of data visualization, clustering, etc.
    The authors studied the significance of various parameters in the same environment
    and effects. For the promotion of efficient development of agriculture, the authors
    proved that data visualization and cluster analysis pave a way for finding the
    key technologies to be applied in modern agriculture. For time and cost optimization,
    functions such as sensing, monitoring, identification, transmission, and feedback
    can be realized using IOT platforms and they can serve as an impetus for intelligent
    agriculture. To test and develop their methodology, authors took the agriculture
    situation in the Jhinsa river basin which lies in the upper reaches of the Yangtze
    River as a testbed. This area has become the most abundant area of biological
    communities in Eurasia. For the study, the authors collected precipitation and
    temperature data. Since data was large, k-means clustering is used to analyze
    the data. Leng et al. [83], presented a study for the application of IoT in agricultural
    products supply chain management. Authors discussed in length what to take into
    consideration, while designing a structural model for the supply chain management.
    RIFD technology was considered as the key constituent for designing the model.
    Pereira et al. [84], based on the concepts of IoT developed an instrument capable
    of performing environment monitoring in a poultry farm. The authors focused on
    designing a cost efficient prototype for the poultry monitoring which provides
    affordable benefits compared to the commercial products available in the market.
    DHT22 sensors were used to collect air pressure and temperature details and CPU
    such as Wemos Mini D1with chipset ESP-8266EXwith standard Wi-Fi 2.4 Ghz connectivity
    were used to calibrate the whole model. Singh et al. [85], developed a cloud based
    autonomic system for delivering agriculture as a service via web and mobile based
    applications. For data collection IoT and other devices were used for communication
    and coordination. Fuzzy logic was used to automatically analyze agriculture. An
    architecture named Agri-info was developed to provide user services. Kolipaka
    [86], proposed a predictive analysis using cross media references for precision
    farming. Authors focused on the usage of sensors and MEMS integrated IoT for precision
    farming. The crop growth parameters such as soil state, water, weed state, crop
    quality and seed quality were also discussed. ML and big data approaches were
    applied to perform predictive analysis and thus finding method to provide optimal
    solutions to farmers. Further based upon the certain characteristics we have tabularized
    the major findings in TABLE 8. TABLE 8 Summary of Developed Methods for Farm Management
    B. IoT in Irrigation Irrigation is the method of application of controlled water
    to the farming fields, at needed intervals. Irrigation has been a constant area
    where a lot of energy, money, and labor is invested in the case of farming. Detection
    and knowledge of water level can reduce the cost of production by half. For increasing
    crop yield, smart irrigation management is essential. Various optimized and precise
    methods have been developed by various academicians. Klein et al. [96], with the
    help of satellite images, worked on the implementation of closed-loop irrigation.
    The authors designed a real-time water requirement system, which can optimize
    water delivery for 140 cells located in four hectares of land. Vegetative indexes
    were calculated for analyzing the total water consumption and how via loops this
    facility can be automated. Through this study and experimentation it was found
    that with the integration of closed-loop strategy and advanced water analysis,
    the overall water consumption efficiency can be improved. Alahi et al. [97], extended
    research to design and develop a smart nitrate monitoring system for the monitoring
    nitrate content in the surface and groundwater. The authors proposed a portable
    sensing system with the help of a planar inter-digital sensor, associated electronics,
    instrumentation, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy-based analysis. Through
    real-time monitoring and sending data directly to the IoT web server, the proposed
    system possesses the capacity to monitor the impact of industrial, urban, and
    agricultural activity on water content and quality. The system also ensures distributed
    monitoring. Daskalakis et al. [98], used leaf sensing technology instead of ground
    soil monitoring for knowing the plant water stress. The authors proposed a low
    cost and low power consumption leaf moisture sensing model by sensing the leaves
    with the new plant backscatter sensor node/tag. The developed tag collects the
    information from a leaf via analog and digital conversions and then the data is
    transferred via remote communication to a low-cost software-defined radio reader
    using monostatic backscatter architecture. The data collected from this node is
    then connected to the irrigation system. The proposed system is powered by a flexible
    solar panel. Jayalakshmi and Gomathi [99], proposed a sensor-cloud based precision
    agriculture for intelligent water management, to enhance crop production. For
    the model design, moisture and stress levels of different plant organs were considered
    along with the behavior vegetative and reproductive organs cell growth, and its
    effects on the water requirement were studied. The dimensionality reduction technique
    was employed to choose the optimal parameters. For the case study, the wheat plant
    was taken. The effect of soil temperature and water suction rate was studied in
    the case of the plant growth. The non-adsorbing testbed was prepared by exploding
    the sand grains at high temperatures. With the aid of WSN, it was monitored when
    the plant needs to be irrigated. Angelopoulos et al. [100], developed a small
    scale smart irrigation prototype for a strawberry greenhouse. The prototype possesses
    off the shelf hardware and software requirements and was tested on large farms
    having multiple crops to get a data gain. The reference architecture also targets
    edge data distribution. The model was tested in Greece and its performance was
    compared against the traditional existing strawberry greenhouse methods for irrigation.
    Compared to the cloud-based approaches, and their incompetence to handle network
    traffic, security challenges, and data sharing with the third party, this model
    is secure and reliable and can handle large datasets. Dominguez-Nino et al. [101],
    worked on how to integrate sensors for developing automated software tools to
    undertake the routine tasks and decision-making involved in scheduling irrigation.
    The authors also focused on the suitability of capacitance approach soil moisture
    sensors and how to automatically interpret them and providing feedback to the
    scheduling algorithm. The proposed approach was tested in the apple orchards located
    at the IRTA-Lleida Experimental Station in Mollerussa, Lleida, Spain. For the
    study, both the physiological and agronomic properties were taken into consideration
    while experimentation. Krishnan et al. [102], designed an automated irrigation
    method. The authors developed a fuzzy logic-based system for precision irrigation
    by using Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM) service to enable farmers
    to water the fields. Soil and temperature, humidity, and motor status parameters
    were monitored and taken for the study. For the efficiency evaluation of the system,
    a comparison was done between the proposed system, drip irrigation, and manual
    flooding. Harun et al. [103], designed an environment-friendly system named “Greenhouse
    Irrigation Management System” for precision irrigation in agriculture. Some critical
    environmental parameters such as soil moisture, pH, temperature, humidity are
    measured with the use of WSNs to make decisions. The sensors measure the data
    and based on certain threshold value result, the fields are irrigated. Olivo [104],
    focused on the problems associated with device growth and its effects on the control
    decisions. To address this issue, an architecture named “Rules Engine and Context
    Event Processor (RECEP)” is proposed for the dynamic processing of events originated
    in the context of IoT and PA. In this model the concept if optimization was used
    to optimize the resources to increase agricultural production. The experimental
    setup was set in a banana field located in Machala-Ecuador. The given model was
    designed for operating in low-cost infrastructures for both small and large producers.
    Marcelino et al. [105], based on the work and issues of small family farmers,
    proposed a low-cost system for control, monitoring, and automation of agricultural
    greenhouse. The proposed model was designed by prototyping Raspberry Pi and Arduino
    along with sensors. Temperature, humidity, and light sensors are used for the
    field data collection. The web human interface was developed for interaction between
    the system and the farmers. Koksal and Tekinerdogan [106], developed an automatic
    farm management information system capable of performing data acquisition, processing,
    monitoring, planning, and decision making and managing the farm fields. The authors
    tested their models on two case studies on smart farming in Turkey, one for smart
    wheat in Konya and other greenhouses in Antalya. The feature-driven domain analysis
    model is designed based on IoT reference architectures and data modeling approaches.
    The system was capable of performing all farming related functions, such as irrigation,
    crop monitoring, etc. Hate et al. [107], designed a vegetable traceability system
    with smart irrigation. The field parameters like soil moisture, humidity, water
    supply control, and temperature of particular farmland are monitored with sensors
    such as water level, humidity, soil moisture, and temperature sensors. With IoT,
    the cost is reduced and efficiency is improved. Agale and Gaikwad [108], focused
    on the problem of water reduction in farmlands. An IoT based automatic system
    is designed to collect, analyze, and monitor the real-time sensor data every 10
    seconds from soil and environment and provide irrigation solutions based on that.
    The parameters like temperature, humidity, soil moisture were considered for data
    collection. The proposed method achieved 92.24 % accuracy in water-saving strategy.
    Huan et al. [109], designed a system for monitoring of water in aquaculture ponds.
    To design the system authors used the concept of narrowband IoT (NB-IoT). The
    system used STM32L151C8 microcontroller, sensors and other devices for real time
    data collection and other services. The system was implemented and tested in ChangZhou,
    JiangSu Province, China and performed with low error rate. Vij et al. [110], developed
    a smart precision irrigation system based on the concepts of IoT and machine learning.
    The main aim of authors was to develop a computationally efficient and low cost
    system. Raspberry Pi and Arduino Mega 3 were used as microcontroller and other
    sensors were used to fabricate the system. Compared to the existing systems, the
    proposed system is computationally efficient. The various findings of this section
    have been tabularized in TABLE 9. TABLE 9 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods
    for Irrigation C. IoT in Crop Monitoring Crop monitoring is the process or method
    of observing the farm fields and crops for enhancing productivity and reducing
    cost. This can be performed with satellites, drones, sensors, and other methods.
    Vegetative indexes of an area can also play a major role in crop monitoring by
    providing the data related to the exact area of land under cultivation etc. With
    crop monitoring the estimated time of harvest can be predicted. de Souza et al.
    [118], proposed an integrated framework with the combination of hardware, software,
    middleware, and other equipment to monitor the testbed. The authors also recorded
    the testing of each equipment in the seed test labs. An IoT based system was developed
    where soil sensors provided the relevant information/data for the growth of seeds.
    Testing was performed in the Official Seed Analysis Laboratory (OSTL) of the Brazilian
    Agricultural Research Corporation. Rekha et al. [119], developed a WSN based framework
    for sensing agricultural characteristics and then provide decisions to the farmers.
    Based on the data collected, the model will provide decisions for irrigation and
    crop monitoring. For the case study, India was taken into consideration due to
    its large farming area and population dependence on agriculture. Groundnut farming
    was studied in this work. Becker Reshef et al. [120], proposed a remote sensing
    analysis based crop monitoring system for strengthening agricultural decisions
    and improving crop security. The authors named this model as “GEOGLAM” model which
    ensures the decision support of all the necessary steps for crop security and
    analysis. Kamath et al. [121], proposed a wireless sensor-based model for monitoring
    the growth of weeds in paddy crop. The authors performed a study on how Raspberry
    Pi and WSN can be modeled for precision agriculture. Raspberry Pi based model
    was deployed to monitor crop along with the integration of Bluetooth 4.0 to send
    signals from visual sensors to the base station. A solar cell battery was used
    to provide power to the system. At the remote station, the images of the crops
    were processed to extract the background and foreground objects. Classification
    between weeds and paddy crop was performed with SVM. Rao and Sridhar [122], Developed
    an automatic irrigation system by prototyping Raspberry Pi and other IoT devices
    to enhance crop productivity. A cloud-based data collection system supported by
    sensors used for data collection is employed to collect the field data. The data
    collected is sent to the base station and based on that data, the decisions are
    made. Parameters like humidity, soil temperature, and sunlight availability are
    measured. Geng et al. [123], for greenhouse environment monitoring proposed a
    four-layer IoT based mobile system. To design the system, the authors proposed
    integration of both Raspberry Pi and Arduino chip in the design where the former
    serves as the data server and later as the master chip for a mobile system. Fabrication
    of all the sensors, actuators, and other devices was done on a single board, thereby
    reducing the device’s physical distances for better performance due to serial
    communication. A dedicated communication protocol with CYC was designed to reduce
    transmission errors and data loss. Shadrin et al. [124], designed an intelligent
    agriculture IoT equipment to monitor the crop. The authors designed the system
    using the test case of monitoring the seed germination. The proposed model was
    fabricated with the integration of low power embedding wireless sensor nodes with
    artificial intelligence. CNN was used to train the model along with the collection
    of data via sensor nodes of the different stages of germinated seeds. A 3D clustering
    analysis was used to analyze the relationship between environmental factors and
    farmer issues. Uddin et al. [125], focused on developing a system for monitoring
    crops from the stage of seed germination to harvest. For this authors proposed
    a resource optimized fast health crop monitoring system. Saudi Arabian agriculture
    was taken into consideration as a case study. IoT and drones were harnessed to
    make an efficient agricultural monitoring system. Data collection methods were
    used to collect data from heterogeneous devices arranged in localized clusters.
    The system was designed to withstand a harsh environment with agility and feasibility.
    Feng et al. [126], proposed a crop growth and nutrition diagnostic system based
    on hyperspectral remote sensing. Color canopies obtained from images captured
    with satellites, UAV, and remote sensing were used to determine the index of yield.
    To determine the color canopy of plants, the color correlation was employed. Cen
    et al. [127], discussed the usage of UAV with dual image frame cameras to estimate
    the aboveground biomass and panicle biomass of rice. The authors conducted their
    study at different growth stages of the crop. The field investigations were made
    on the variations in typical vegetation indices. The accuracy of the model was
    obtained with the extraction of RGB images at two different stages. Random forest
    was employed to obtain AGB as well as the PB. Khan and Kumar [128], proposed a
    framework for the monitoring the crop field. To make their study reliable, the
    authors monitored weather in real-time to get an idea of how to provide an ambient
    condition to farm. Production increase techniques are also proposed for precision
    farming. To overcome the problems of delay in information transfer from the field
    to the farmer, the context-based agricultural mobile sink is designed in WSN.
    Thus the mobile sink node introduction improves the overall efficiency and energy
    consumption of the model. Frontward communication area (FCA) based route selection
    is proposed to reduce energy consumption and delay. Min and Kuang [129], designed
    a system for monitoring the rice crop field. The analysis of the growth of rice
    and rice duck in real-time is done by obtaining the data via the Internet of Things.
    Authors comprehensively viewed the rice and rice duck plant species and the ambient
    farm conditions required for their growth. Qiulan et al. [130], estimated the
    production of carbon from the crop growth. The authors provided a framework for
    the estimation of organic carbon compounds in the farmland soil. The wheat plant
    was taken as a test case in this study. The model provided the real monitoring
    of the farm for carbon production with the aid of IoT and other devices. The real-time
    data was collected from the Yanzhou District of Jining City, Shandong Province,
    China. Harun et al. [131], proposed an improved crop monitoring system based on
    IoT concepts. Brassica Chinensis is the plant taken for study and was subjected
    to four different light treatments such as pulse treatment, continuous treatment,
    high intensity, and artificial control for enhancing the plant growth. The authors
    also analyzed parameters such as leaf count, height, dry weight, and chlorophyll
    a and b. An intelligent embedded system was developed to monitor and capture real-time
    data. Alonso et al. [132], designed an intelligent edge IoT based platform for
    precision livestock and crop monitoring in a dairy farming scenario. In their
    study, authors used the concepts of AI, blockchain technology, edge computing
    and IoT concepts for designing the platform. The architecture named Global Edge
    Computing Architecture (GCEA) was tried and tested in real time in a dairy farm.
    Castellanos et al. [133], proposed a narrowband IoT (NB-IoT) system for collection
    of soil parameters to monitor the potato crop health and growth. A UAV aided network
    is used to support the purpose. The architecture proposed accessed the real filed
    scenario of a potato filed near Bogota, Columbia. The main achievement of this
    work was the energy harnessing due to optimal topology applied for the deployment
    of sensors across the field and thus making the battery last for 82 hours for
    above ground sensors and 77 months for the deep buried sensors. Shafi et al. [134],
    presented a multimodal for crop health monitoring based on the concepts remote
    sensing, IoT and ML. Authors conducted their research in Pakistan. Sensors were
    deployed in fields to collect the real time data. Multispectral data from drones
    presented a NDVI and was used to analyze the crop based on its chlorophyll content.
    Variable length time series data captured from IoT devices and sensors were used
    to generate crop health maps. Deep neural networks were implemented for classification
    and provided the optimal classification. Some studies of the articles incorporating
    IoT in fields related to crop monitoring are presented in TABLE 10. TABLE 10 Summary
    of Developed Methods Crop Monitoring D. IoT in Disease Detection Diseases play
    a vital role in the economic and food crisis of a country. So to avoid this, disease
    detection is employed. This involves the detection of various diseases whether
    fungal, viral, bacterial, etc. from the stages of early to the post-harvest. Incubation
    of IoT has revolutionized the disease detection area in plant phenotyping resulting
    in major control resources available to avoid disease occurrence. Wang et al.
    [146], focused on addressing the problem of pests and insects. Authors proposed
    an IoT based model that can detect the early occurrence of the pests and diseases
    from visual references. Rough set theory algorithm and NN were used to model design.
    The proposed model was compared with existing models for accuracy and efficiency.
    Pandiyan et al. [147], applied the concepts of image segmentation and IoT, to
    develop a system/platform that can detect the diseases in plants. Authors proposed
    a novel platform having an Advanced Segmented Dimension Extraction (ASDE) with
    Heterogeneous Internet of Things procedural (HIoT) aspects, to detect the apple
    leaf diseases. A sign based plant disease identification model for real-time resembling
    of leaf diseases namely bacteria, fungi, micro-organisms, and viruses is presented.
    Three levels i.e. connectivity level, platform level, and service level were employed
    for performing data aggregation, transmission, and automatic identity identification.
    Leaf gestures were studied to identify the diseases in leaves. Zhao et al. [148],
    developed an automatic crop disease detection system capable of identifying and
    recognizing the leaves from a cluttered background. Combining IoT concepts and
    CNN, authors designed a novel approach named “Multi-Context Fusion Network (MCFN)”
    along with IoT deployments for crop diseased detection in wild. Kale and Sonavane
    [149], developed a smart and optimized smart fertilizing decision support system
    for smart farming. The authors addressed the problem of disproportion due to lack
    of judgment. Concepts of IoT and GA were used to design the system. An improved
    GA based multilevel parameter optimized feature selection algorithm for ELM classifier
    along with IoT was proposed in the designed system. The proposed system focuses
    on plant disease detection in a real-time environment. Khattab et al. [150], developed
    an IoT based cognitive automatic monitoring system for detecting the epidemic
    diseases in plants. By combining the concepts of artificial intelligence and prediction
    algorithms to develop the expert system, capable of predicting, analyzing, and
    decision making. A layered approach was used to design the model. Soil, leaf wetness,
    wind speed, and wind direction sensors were employed to gather the data. The model
    was tested on detection of the diseases like Late Blight, Early Blight, and Powdery
    Mildew in tomato and potato crops. Chen et al. [151], based on AI technologies
    and IoT, developed a system named “RiceTalk” for the detection of Blight diseases
    in the rice plant. AgriTalk model was used as a base model in this work to develop
    this system. Compared to AgriTalk, the authors used non-image IoT devices to design
    this model for disease detection. Devi et al. [152], proposed a simple and efficient
    IoT enabled solution for developing a system for automatic disease detection.
    Bunchy top of banana and Sigatoka diseases in the wild banana plant were detected
    and classified. Environmental parameters like soil moisture, temperature were
    measured with sensors and the IoT model was framed using the Raspberry PI hardware
    model. Data were classified using GLCM and RFC for disease detection. Kitpo and
    Inoue [153], developed an early disease detection system for rice crops disease
    detection. The drones based IoT architecture with real-time data collection capabilities
    was designed. For the mapping of drones on the fields, GPS sensors were used.
    The designed system is capable of displaying the analytical results and the position
    of the plant where the disease is present. Pawara et al. [154], studied the pomegranate
    diseases such as Bacterial Blight, Fruit Spot, Fruit Rot, and Leaf Spot. Developed
    a HMM and senor based model to early detect the disease and provide the solutions.
    Parameters like air temperature, leaf wetness, air humidity, and soil wetness
    were considered and studied for model design. For digital communication between
    field and farm GSM module was used. Truong et al. [155], real-time data monitoring
    capable system was designed with IoT and cloud storage for disease detection and
    recognition. The fungal diseases of rural crop fields with detected. Environmental
    data conditions such as humidity, temperature, wind speed, and rainfall were employed
    for designing decision support. A Support Vector Machine Regression (SVMr) model
    was used to classify the data. Jumat et al. [156], developed a cost-efficient
    and affordable smart farming prototype capable of detecting plant disease and
    proving decisions. For study and experimentation, Septoria plant disease was taken
    and studied for different stages right from outbreak to spread maturity. The system
    also possesses the web-enabled facilities for farmer support. Some studies of
    the articles incorporating IoT in fields related to disease detection are presented
    in TABLE 11. TABLE 11 Summary of IoT Based Developed Methods for Disease Detection
    SECTION V. Findings Several research articles related to the role and responses
    of the Internet of Things in agriculture have been studied. From the literature
    and studies, it can be seen that immense contribution has made by IoT in the field
    of agriculture starting from micro areas and moving over to macro environments.
    Internet of Things along with the concepts of cloud computing, cluster computing,
    wireless sensor networks and computer vision has revolutionized the field of monitoring,
    crop production, disease detection, and supply chain management. Since the domain
    of agriculture itself is a wide domain so considering the impact IoT has or can
    make on this field, the search was not restricted or limited to any area. The
    data acquisition for agriculture systems is a multidimensional approach. There
    are several fields in agriculture where IoT is applied e.g., crop monitoring,
    diseased detection, precision irrigation, supply chain, cattle grazing, and raising,
    etc. To design a precision approach, the target plays a very important role in
    data collection. From the existing studies it is found that mostly overall 90%
    of the data is self-acquired by the authors with the use of wireless sensors.
    This data included soil data, pH values, light, water, humidity, and images. In
    the case of crop disease detection, leaves were taken as the primary subject of
    study due to their ease of availability and quantity. Nearly 80% of the leaf data
    was self-acquired using digital cameras and web-enabled devices. However in some
    studies to validate their models, authors also used the existing standard ground
    truth databases available. Satellite imaging and remote sensing images were also
    taken to understand the demography and vegetative indexes of a region. UAV drones
    were the most used devices along with web-enabled digital cameras and mobile devices
    to capture the data in the form of images and also acted for providing real-time
    monitoring of device location in the fields. Certain issues and challenges are
    faced by the authors while capturing real-time images due to environmental and
    lighting conditions. To avoid these issues, laboratory-based testbeds such as
    greenhouses were developed and their data was acquired in a closed environment.
    From the literature, it is seen that, to develop the prototypes certain common
    parameters were taken for conducting the study irrespective of the problem to
    be addressed. Theses parameters included soil data, pH value, humidity level,
    moisture content, water content. After the analysis of the studies it was found
    that for any agricultural system to flourish all these parameters play a combined
    role. These parameters were most common for the problems addressing farm management,
    crop monitoring, and irrigation. However in certain other parameters like leaf
    wetness, salinity, disease severity, fertilizer ratio, plant height, CO2 content,
    mineral content, and conductivity were considered while addressing the specific
    problems like plant disease detection, smart irrigation, seedling germination,
    etc. These were the devices employed to collect the data. Depending upon the problem
    the authors addressed, different type of sensors were employed. For soil data
    collection, the contact method sensors such as hygrometers, or electrodes which
    penetrate the soil were used to collect soil information. While as in the case
    of the collection of soil information via tractors or vehicles non-contact soil
    sensors were employed. But for the studies it can be seen that contact method
    sensors are the most common devices used for soil data collection. In case of
    soil pH value and salinity electrochemical sensors are employed. In the case of
    soil nitrates, CO2, and fertilizer content, topsoil depth, biomass content, organic
    matter are measured. For water data collection, parameters like relative humidity,
    leakage of pipes, dissolved oxygen, nitrates, and other oxides were measured by
    the authors. To accomplish this various water sensors like ultrasonic sensors
    were employed to measure the water levels in the tanks, ponds, and farms. Temperature
    and humidity sensors were used to measure the temperature of water and humidity
    of soil for water content. In the case of plant leaves, the leaf wetness sensors
    were employed to understand the moisture content of the plants. Other than these
    sensors, neutron sensors, time travels sensors, and capacitance sensors are also
    employed by some authors for measuring the water levels. In the case of supply
    chain and cattle grazing, tags and biosensors were employed to gather the data.
    To develop the prototypes, the authors used the devices based on functional capabilities.
    From all the devices, Arduino and Raspberry Pi were the most desirable hardware
    platforms for the authors. Arduino was employed to tackle simple or sequential
    issues that do not require complex solutions. In the case of scenarios with complex
    environments, Raspberry Pi boards were employed due to their capability of addressing
    multiple problems at the same time. For functionalities that faced time issues,
    Raspberry Pi boards were employed. In the case of communication technologies,
    LoRa and ZigBee are the most commonly used communication technologies by the authors
    in the platform designs due to their capabilities of handling a multitude of solutions.
    Lora and ZigBee use GPS to enable and detect geo-locations. They are low cost
    and secure for data transmission. Other than these technologies, authors also
    made use of cloud and cluster computing to handle a large mass of data and provide
    on-spot solutions to the consumers. The authors performed the processing of data
    in different stages. At first preprocessing on data was performed to remove any
    kind of outliers or anomalies in the data. To remove the imperfect data, algorithms
    such as noise removal with Gaussian noise, salt and pepper noise, histogram equalization
    were commonly used for the preprocessing of image data. However in the case of
    numerical data missing value imputation, the banana dataset for noise reduction
    was employed. To obtain the optimal data from a given set of data, data reduction
    was performed. The data reduction approaches e.g., dimensionality reduction, attribute
    subset selection, numerosity reduction, etc. were employed by various authors.
    To make systems capable of taking decisions, several learning algorithms like
    GA, CNN, NN, SVM, PNN, GANs were used to train and test the models. From the literature,
    it is seen that most studies and experiments were performed in countries that
    have agricultural economies like the USA, China, India, Brazil, Australia, etc.
    Most of these countries are economically stable and first world countries. They
    have better infrastructure and service availability. Also only 20% of the studies
    were focused on real-time implementation of their prototypes which indicates that
    most of the experimentation was conducted in a closed environment. This pattern
    raises concerns on how these studies can be employed in real-time environments
    with low infrastructure and maintenance costs. The problem of power consumption
    was also addressed by some studies. However there were no comparisons and reasons
    given on how the dream of IoT can be made real for poor and self-financing farmers.
    Along with this, a few studies provided the cost estimation for the deployment
    of the models. In the Fig. 7, the percentage distribution and contribution of
    IoT in different fields of agriculture are shown. From the figure it can be seen
    that more extensive studies are conducted in the field of crop monitoring. FIGURE
    7. Percentage contribution of IoT in different fields of agriculture. Show All
    These studies and analysis put forth by different articles show that current/existing
    solutions have incorporated IoT to solve several challenges in the agricultural
    domain. With the incorporation of these technologies, a large number of challenges/factors
    for improvement have emerged. Along with the study of factors for improvement,
    future research directions, applications are also highlighted. The sections below
    explain the factors for improvement and the futuristic research directions. A.
    Challenges Despite the growth achieved by IoT over the past few decades, there
    still exist some conceptual, fundamental, and developmental issues. 1) Cost Designing
    a cost-optimized model is still a difficulty faced by many authors. Scientists
    are focusing on developing cost-efficient systems by reducing the hardware and
    software requirements in IoT deployments. Economic differences of countries make
    it difficult for farmers to deploy devices and technology. So, it is important
    to develop some economic models. 2) Standardization To fully utilize the technology
    for large range of applications, standardization of devices is essential. The
    present or current mechanisms do not confirm any standardization formats either
    for the data and process representation. Deprived of the cordial use of the semantic
    ontologies, machine-readable codes result in output differences due to misinterpretation
    and alterations from time to time. With standardization the interoperability issues
    of the devices, applications, systems and products can be solved. 3) Heterogeneity
    While designing a system, heterogeneous devices are used. Every device differs
    in processes and services requirements. In the case of agriculture, most models
    perform with heterogeneous devices, so it is important to create interaction between
    heterogeneous modules and communication technologies. Because of heterogeneity,
    the complexity of the network increases, and sometimes falsified results may appear.
    4) Accessibility For developing any farming decision support system based on IoT
    technology and other devices, the demand for availability of existing software
    and hardware to be present anywhere any time is a must thing. These problems need
    to be addressed to ensure the availability of services anywhere and anytime. Lack
    of availability of the required equipment can result in chaos and delay in the
    services. 5) Adaptability While designing a model, especially for precision farming,
    it is pertinent for the devices to be adaptable with the other devices and the
    surroundings. Since the environmental conditions keep varying and also sometimes
    due to certain communication or hardware issues certain devices are not adaptable
    with each other. 6) Energy Optimization Energy is the most emerging issue in IoT
    systems, WSNs, and other devices for their communication. Till now conventional
    sources of energy have been supporting the designing and working models. But due
    to an increase in devices, the consumption of conventional energy is not a reliable
    solution. Non-conventional sources of energy like solar, wind, water energy harvesting
    schemes should also be tested, but they haven’t been of much success and new methodologies
    should be developed to employ them for model development. 7) Compatibility To
    achieve the standards of fragmentation and scalability, the developed models or
    software should be flexible and should run on any machine. 8) Reliability For
    successful and smooth working, reliability is a major concern for IoT devices
    in terms of data transmission. The devices need to gather and transfer reliable
    data as based on the data received and interpreted, the decisions are made. Reliability
    is still a challenge due to system failures, node failures, battery issues, or
    other interventions. 9) Mobility Generally the systems or models developed are
    static. For smooth implementation of the framework, there should be mobility as
    most of the devices and applications are mobile. In mobile models, the issue of
    maintaining connectivity is still a difficult task. 10) Environmental Conditions
    In agriculture there are different landforms. So it becomes difficult to adapt
    to those changes, and this also jeopardizes data and services. This alters the
    accuracy of a system. 11) Real-Time Deployment Most of the studies put forward
    are not employed or tested in a real-time testbed. So before deploying a system
    or model, real-time analysis is a must, to avoid post-deployment losses. B. Improvements
    Since the growth of IoT is remarkable in the field of agriculture, certain improvements
    can be included in the growth and developmental state to make the systems and
    models more efficient, reliable, and business-oriented. 1) Warding Off the Performance
    Degradation Generally while developing systems, customer interaction or input
    is not taken. As the models serve a variety of customers from dynamic backgrounds,
    therefore their input must be taken while developing the models. This way the
    performance hazards and chaos that occurs on the filed can be avoided. 2) Sharing
    Rich Data Globally In almost all, the IoT based models designed for precision
    farming, the data sharing while integrating and mapping the system design should
    be encouraged. This can lead to the development of an interactive model globally.
    This feature can also help in understanding the topographic and demographic challenges
    of various regions on a global level. Thus the suitable solutions can be designed
    with those working in resource-constrained environments. 3) Moving Towards High-Speed
    Communication The communication domain itself is witnessing a progressive and
    dynamic shift. Since the IoT models are remotely located, so better communication
    is a prerequisite. Therefore it is important to consider high-speed communication
    strategies like 5G, for making the devices more reachable with lesser delays.
    4) Cost Analytic Studies for Model Design With the incumbent of IoT in agriculture,
    a variety of models are designed for addressing different domains such as irrigation,
    farm management, disease detection, and crop monitoring, etc. While designing
    the models various case studies are performed. As the development cost of models
    for these cases varies from country to country i.e., in first world countries
    there will be the different cost of devices and in second and third world countries
    it will be different. Therefore a model cost analysis will provide an idea of
    the purchasing power and investment a farmer from these varied economic regions
    can invest to develop a model. Also this can result in seeking or considering
    other cheaper and efficient ways to develop models. C. Future Research Directions
    With the advancement in the development of precision agriculture platforms with
    IoT and other technologies, the development of new applications or research areas
    is envisioned. After the study of the literature, certain potential concepts and
    futuristic research directions are listed and discussed below: Design of platforms
    in a user-friendly manner (from farmers’ perspective and ease of using) using
    Artificial Intelligence and other learning tools. Farmer’s perspective here means
    that an audit should be done well before designing the prototype. From this study
    a clear insight and differences between the requirements of the farmers and farming
    systems across the globe can be understood. To develop concepts and methodologies
    based on multidimensional aspects like science, expertise, experience, industry,
    etc. Energy harvesting or power optimization methodologies should be developed
    to reduce the cost of production, maintenance, and fault tolerance. It is evident
    that mostly the farms be it small or large, require power and energy for the working
    of devices. In most of the cases, the power to the devices is supplied from the
    main line or the power grid. But this is not a sustainable and efficient method.
    Thus in order to make farms self-reliant, the energy harvesting or power optimization
    approaches should be developed or incorporated while designing of the models.
    Induction of cloud sources for data gathering and processing in a reliable, systematic,
    and scientific manner. Develop systems that can withstand variable soil and environmental
    conditions. Since the agricultural environments are harsh and keep on changing
    with change in climatic conditions or seasons. So it is essential to develop systems
    which can be robust and sustainable to the changes in the external as well as
    internal factors. Development of user or farmer friendly apps for monitoring crop
    and plant health. Mostly farmers come different ethnic and linguistic backgrounds.
    So due to this their level of understanding and ways to perform agricultural tasks
    is also different. It is important to develop frameworks considering the native
    language of a region into consideration so the farmer and machine interaction
    can be improved. This will enhance enable the acceptance of precision farming
    methods easy as it can be seen some areas are reluctant to adopt due to this linguistic
    and understanding problems. Development of efficient sensor-based systems for
    high elevation areas. High elevation areas mostly have undulating surfaces and
    also in most of the countries, supply of power to these areas is still a dream.
    Form the literature, it can be seen that these areas have not been targeted for
    precision farming instead of being resource deficient. Therefore deployment and
    design of sensor based systems in these areas opens a scope in future of precision
    farming. Usage of previous and existential scientific data for the development
    of decision support systems in farming. Generally for designing the precision
    farming models, the primary data is considered. However for designing cost efficient
    and reliable models, the previous case studies and deployment models should be
    considered for the study. This means a collaborative model development methodology
    should be developed for understanding the nature of the work. To recognize various
    plant species using mixed data sets or heterogeneous data. Design of a portable
    and sustainable farming equipment control systems for large as well as small farms.
    Mostly from the study it can be seen that first world countries are welcoming
    in PA approaches while as in most third world and other nations, this concept
    is still in avoidance due to cost and shelf life of products and equipment’s.
    Development of reliable supply chain management methods for precision farming.
    D. Applications of IoT in Agriculture IoT has revolutionized the world of agriculture,
    and a manifold of application can be derivative of implementation of the Internet
    of Things in agriculture. These applications are a resultant of the architectural
    design chosen. These applications have been categorized and differentiated based
    on the subject they focus on and also the service they provide. The major sectional
    areas where IoT is applicable in agriculture are- observation, data collection
    and corroboration, governing, and management. Most of these fields work collaboratively,
    and all the applications involve at least two of these sections. All these sections
    are described below and TABLE 12 presents various IoT applications in agriculture.
    TABLE 12 Applications of IoT in Agriculture 1) Observation It is also called monitoring
    as the main aim of this section is to discern the working of various models, devices,
    applications, etc. With the incubation of the concept of IoT, it is the first
    and foremost stage to be smeared. In this phase, all the devices and equipment
    that are placed strategically are monitored for their work. Sensors, are the major
    deployment and data collection tools engaged in this phase for data collection
    of various field and non-field parameters. Monitoring the certain parameters,
    like soil salinity, pH value, volumetric water content by using various soil sensors
    and other essential parameters such leaf wetness sensors, color, humidity, etc.
    helps in the development of systems capable of performing following operations
    e.g., calculation of leaf area index, leaf health, leaf color, plant growth and
    aid in the development of automatic plant recognition systems. Other devices like
    water sensors aid in the monitoring of irrigation levels and requirements of the
    fields. Thus with such devices, smart irrigation scheduling systems are developed.
    Also with the gas sensors, remote monitoring devices such as UAV devices or images
    with hyperspectral reflectance properties, help in the estimation of biomass,
    nitrogen, carbon, and other essential gases content. This data can also be used
    to find the vegetative indexes of the filed or large demography. Heavy-duty vehicles
    such as thrashers, tractors, trucks etc., also need supervision and can use data
    analytics for farm management. Robots, autonomous vehicles, agricultural drones
    other equipment also need to be monitored remotely for better farm supervision.
    Livestock monitoring with the aid of IoT is also an important subject for precision
    farming. It includes cattle monitoring remotely using tags. Labour is also a major
    area of concern for precision farming. Since human intervention is generally prone
    to errors due to differences in understanding, decision making, and methodologies
    applied to solve a particular problem. Also the induction of human labor is cost-intensive.
    Therefore, with the application of IoT, human interference can be minimized and
    a network can be set up for monitoring thus reducing the errors and cost. 2) Data
    Collection and Corroboration Data is the main constituent of precision farming.
    It acts as both base and catalyst in the whole process. With IoT, a large number
    of data is collected in varying forms and formats. Sensors, cameras, and various
    other nodes aid in the collection of data. In precision agriculture, based on
    the nature of the problem, the IoT network can be designed and formulated to collect
    different types of data. After the data is collected, the corroboration also called
    documentation of the data is very important for better understanding. Corroboration
    is a natural application of collected data, but certain additions of different
    samples such as manual or machine integration are also seen. Data once collected
    needs to be refined and understood, labeled, and thus documented in a certain
    format. Documentation or corroboration of data helps in formulating statistical
    analysis and developing the decision support systems. Remote sensing charts and
    other crop assessing tools can be employed to understand the total crop yield
    of a particular region. Crop management can also be optimized using corroborating
    data. A yearly or term analysis can be performed on this data to improve precision
    farming. Food chain supply management can use the predictive analysis of this
    data for optimizing and designing new efficient strategies. The major areas where
    its application is seen are yield mapping for fertilization planning, field planning,
    agro-food traceability, site-specific measurements based on soil and water analysis,
    and remote vehicle monitoring for supply chains, etc. 3) Foretelling Also called
    forecasting is one of the major attributes or applications for decision making
    that is brought in agriculture with the introduction of IoT. With the IoT devices
    and network, real-time data analysis along with the comparison to the previously
    available datasets helps in the forecasting of the upcoming events in much advance.
    With this foretelling, various decision support systems can be designed capable
    of taking optimal and real time-decisions. It can also act as a preventive measure
    mechanism for avoiding or dealing with various upcoming unprecedented situations.
    With monitoring, data collection, and corroboration, foretelling can help in early
    disease detection, pest growth, weeding, drought, smart irrigation, and harvesting.
    Artificial intelligence can be employed for designing these learning systems.
    With IoT, a predictive analysis could be made way earlier than the harvest period
    for assessing crop production and consumption. Pre and post-harvest crop monitoring
    along with behavioral sciences and market analysis can also be employed to help
    site-specific farming and production increase in precision agriculture in the
    context of IoT. 4) Governing and Management It is an outcome of the monitoring
    device. Governing helps in controlling the whole system. Foretelling also plays
    a major role in governing. With IoT, it is important to govern the farm. Thresholds
    play a major role in designing a controlling strategy. Controlling is a major
    addendum of IoT in agriculture. Applications of controlling can be easily seen
    in site-specific management, working of smart irrigation models, plant growth
    monitoring models, and early crop analysis models and also in supply chain and
    smart vehicular navigation, interaction, optimization, and logistics control of
    farms. With governing, all the new strategies, formulae, practices and methods
    employed to solve the problems occurring on daily basis in farms can be monitored.
    These strategies can then be compared and analysed with the previous existential
    strategies. Therefore a knowledge base can be maintained. From the data analysis
    of that knowledge base, the best or the optimal strategies that can be employed
    to design or mould the system can be fetched. Various case studies can be performed
    to gather and test such information. From this the redundant techniques can be
    withdrawn and robust ones can be prioritised. With these methodologies and experiments,
    the management can be made more flexible, scalable and reliable. Also governing
    and management can be employed to find the best suited solutions. Due to the growth
    in agriculture sector, various public and private sector projects and startups
    are being started in various countries across the world. All these projects use
    artificial intelligence and IoT concepts to provide support and solutions to the
    growing industry of agriculture. All these projects or startups are explained
    in the TABLE 13. TABLE 13 IoT Based Public and Private Sector Projects/Startups
    for Precision Agriculture E. Our Proposed Work Inspired by the contribution of
    IoT in the field of agriculture, we proposed an architecture for precision farming.
    The layout of the architecture to be designed is proposed and shown in Fig. 8.
    The structure proposed for precision farming in case of farm management will constitute
    of different layers. The first layer would be the sensing layer, in which different
    types of sensors like soil, humidity, water, light, proximity, and conductive
    sensors will be deployed in the region of experimentation. All data from the sensors
    will be sent to the base station. The second layer is the network layer, which
    consists of gateways, internet, and other devices. This layer manages the traffic
    of the whole architecture. This layer collects data from the sensing layer and
    transfers it to the decision layer and the application layer. The third layer
    is the decision layer, which processes the data, manipulates it, and generates
    alerts or actions. The next layer is the application layer, which constitutes
    the firmware and the users. It receives all the inputs from other layers and the
    outputs are made visible to users. It also manages how the whole architecture
    will work or look. FIGURE 8. Proposed layered architecture for Precision Agriculture.
    Show All Our proposed architecture aims to observe and monitor the farm in real-time.
    Optimize the resource utilization, early detection of the diseases, and identification
    of the plant species, optimize irrigation facilities, and make definite use of
    pesticides and other manures. Monitor the growth of plants in each stage and take
    the necessary actions for the betterment of plants. The model to be designed will
    take into consideration the earning and investment of the small scale farmer.
    A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed by considering the reusability
    and recycling of the materials used. From the literature, it is found that the
    issue of interoperability and robustness is still not achieved. So, while designing
    the model these issues will be prioritized. Also, power supply and power consumption
    is a bottleneck for each model. So, from the literature it is found that energy
    harnessing approaches can be used to address this issue. In the proposed model,
    main focus will be on incorporating the concepts of energy harnessing approaches
    like solar energy and wind flow energy for power optimization. Harnessing solar
    energy for regions which have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four
    seasons like spring, summer, autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these
    regions depending only on solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore, in the
    proposed work, a hybrid approach based on consumption of both wind and solar energy
    for reducing power consumption will be proposed. Some of the major findings of
    the proposed work will be: A scalable and cost efficient model will be designed
    by considering the reusability and recycling of materials used. The issues of
    interoperability and robustness issues of heterogeneous devices will be targeted.
    Power supply and power consumption being the bottleneck of each model will be
    targeted. To tackle such issues, energy conservation and energy harnessing approaches
    like solar and wind energy will be used. Harnessing solar energy for regions which
    have different season’s e.g., Kashmir, which has four seasons like spring, summer,
    autumn and winter throughout the year. So for these regions depending only on
    solar energy will be a bottle neck. Therefore in the proposed work, a hybrid approach
    based on consumption of both wind and solar energy for reducing power consumption
    will be proposed. Small scale farmers will be targeted for the development of
    sustainable and robust model. SECTION VI. Conclusion The Internet is revolutionizing
    our world. Communication via connective devices has become the countenance of
    survival. Agriculture is growing from precision farming to micro-farming. IoT
    has added more potential to communication by enabling the communication between
    humans and objects along with the environmental aspects. Seeking the vision of
    omnipresence i.e., anytime, anything, anywhere, everywhere, IoT should be considered
    a core for the development of new architectural concepts. Resource scarcity is
    a must address issue in precision agriculture and models should be developed to
    optimize resource utilization. Inclusion of monitoring in food supply chains,
    farms, greenhouses equipped with tags, WSN, etc. at each stage in the growth of
    the product/plant, making automatic reasoning via intelligent analysis and responses
    is moving towards much safer, secure, and trustworthy systems. In the article,
    firstly the agriculture sector along with its challenges and economic importance
    is presented. The domain of IoT along with the communication technologies and
    goals, protocols, architectures are studied and put forward. The various IoT OS,
    their specifications and features with respect to agriculture are discussed. An
    analytic study of various articles in the field of agriculture is presented, highlighting
    their most focused sections and gaps or areas not addressed. The sensors based
    on their field of application are also discussed. A systematic review of different
    articles focusing especially on crop monitoring, irrigation, disease detection,
    and farm management is offered. The articles considered for study range from the
    time frame of the year 2015 to 2020. From the studies, certain issues are put
    forward that demand research and experimentation in the future. Various existing
    public and private sector platforms or start-ups which work for precision farming
    are also presented and discussed with their specifications and applications. Making
    precision farming a base, a layout of an IoT based architecture is proposed. The
    communication technologies and the hardware platforms of IoT are also discussed.

    and future research directions are also highlighted. As a whole, the in-depth
    description of various aspects of IoT for agriculture has been discussed and how

    scenarios. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords Metrics More Like This

    resource on earth that plays a critical role in the socio-economic development
    of humans worldwide. Water is used for various purposes, including, but not limited
    to, drinking, recreation, irrigation, and hydropower production. The expected
    population growth at a global scale, coupled with the predicted climate change-induced
    impacts, warrants the need for proactive and effective management of water resources.
    Over the recent decades, machine learning tools have been widely applied to various
    water resources management-related fields and have often shown promising results.
    Despite the publication of several review articles on machine learning applications
    in water-related fields, this review paper presents for the first time a comprehensive
    review of machine learning techniques applied to water resources management, focusing
    on the most recent achievements. The study examines the potential for advanced
    machine learning techniques to improve decision support systems in the various
    sectors within the realm of water resources management, which includes groundwater
    management, streamflow forecasting, water distribution systems, water quality
    and wastewater treatment, water demand and consumption, hydropower and marine
    energy, water drainage systems, and flood management and defence. This study provides
    an overview of the state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to the water industry
    and how they can be used to ensure water supply sustainability, quality, and flood
    and drought mitigation. This review covers the most recent related studies to
    provide the most recent snapshot of machine learning applications in the water
    industry. Overall, LSTM networks have been proven to exhibit reliable performance,
    often outperforming ANN models, traditional machine learning models, and established
    physics-based models. Hybrid ML techniques have exhibited great forecasting accuracy
    across all water-related fields, often showing superior computational power over
    traditional ANNs architectures. In addition to purely data-driven models, physical-based
    hybrid models have also been developed to improve prediction performance. These
    efforts further demonstrate that Machine learning can be a powerful practical
    tool for water resources management. It provides insights, predictions, and optimisation
    capabilities to help enhance sustainable water use and management and improve
    socio-economic development, healthy ecosystems and human existence. Previous article

    is the most essential natural resource for human life that is used in various
    ways, which are keys for human socio-economic development. Water is used for drinking,
    bathing, recreational activities, agriculture, hydropower production, and more.
    Although water covers around 71% of the earth''s surface, only about 2.5% is freshwater
    (USGS, 2019). Therefore, appropriate water resources management is crucial to
    a well-developed society. As a complex system of nature, aquifers are constantly
    changing. Hence, our accessibility to freshwater is continually changing, too.
    In its water scarcity report (United Nations Water, 2020), the United Nations
    estimates that by 2025, 1.8 billion people will be living in water-scarce areas,
    highlighting the urgent need for innovative solutions within the water sector.
    Engineers and decision-makers constantly look for promising methods to address
    climate change and its consequential impacts. As temperatures rise rapidly, more
    extreme weather is observed. One of the most concerning consequences is flooding,
    with over one billion people worldwide predicted to live in cities with a risk
    of catastrophic flood levels due to climate change (Rentschler and Salhab, 2020).
    A natural disaster, such as a devastating level of flooding, can cost lives, property,
    crop destruction and much more. The damaging effects of flooding can have a long-lasting
    impact on the affected area, which can be challenging to recover from. On a global
    scale, the exploitation and consumption of water resources often need to be better
    managed. An important aspect of water resources management is providing solutions
    for optimal resource use, ensuring overexploitation does not occur, and equipping
    water resources managers with the appropriate decision-support tools to plan for
    potential shortages of effective management. Conventionally, physical models have
    assisted decision-makers in enabling a sustainable and optimal use of water resources.
    However, the relationships between hydrological, meteorological and water table
    levels are well known to be very complex. Additionally, these models require a
    larger number of data, and such data tend to be very expensive and/or scarce,
    particularly in developing countries. In recent years, Machine Learning (ML) has
    demonstrated its high efficiency and practicability for water resources management
    compared to traditional models due to its capability to handle different sources
    simultaneously and its lower cost and time requirements. ML has been applied to
    water resources management in various ways to improve the monitoring, prediction,
    and sustainable use of water resources. ML models are often trained on historical
    hydrological data for forecasting. The main hydrological data commonly used as
    input features include discharge, rainfall, water table level, temperature, evapotranspiration,
    land use, and pumping rates. Preference has recently been given to data-driven
    models over physically based or conceptual forecasting models, which have the
    potential to unravel the non-linear input-output relationship and produce reliable
    predictions of physical systems, even without prior knowledge of the underlying
    physical relationships and the catchment information. There are numerous examples
    of how ML can be applied to water resources management. For example, ML can analyse
    historical usage data in a water distribution system, provide optimum water allocation,
    predict future demand, and help detect system leaks (e.g. Shahra et al., 2019).
    With the availability of historical data on groundwater levels, ML has been widely
    used for future predictions of water level dynamics, which helps in the management
    of groundwater reservoirs (e.g. Pathak et al., 2021; Ghosh et al., 2022; Kochhar
    et al., 2021; Teimoori et al., 2023). ML can also be used for streamflow forecasting
    (e.g. Cheng et al., 2020; Mehedi et al., 2022; Dehghani et al., 2023; Akbarian
    et al., 2023). There is increasing pressure on irrigation water demand for agriculture
    use, which is expected to double by 2050 (The Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations, 2017), with only limited resources. ML has been extensively
    used to narrow this gap and to develop smart irrigation practices (e.g. Chen et
    al., 2021; He et al., 2022). Another example where ML has proved successful is
    the water quality prediction. This has been crucial given that water pollution
    has worsened significantly in most rivers in Africa, Asia, and Latin America (United
    Nations Environment Programme, 2016). This has prompted many studies focusing
    on the applications of ML to estimate and predict water quality (Zhou, 2020).
    This study presents an overview of the recent water resources-related studies
    that implemented ML algorithms, with the main aim being to answer the following
    research question: which ML algorithms have been used in water resource management
    in recent years, and what were the most effective approaches adopted for forecasting
    application? This provides the most up-to-date and relevant information pertaining
    to the application of ML to the water sector, thereby highlighting its relevance
    and potential in practical application. Most of the research studies covered in
    this review extend from the time we initiated it until October 2023. Nomenclature

    Machine Learning (ML) techniques have found significant applications in water
    resource management for prediction purposes, ranging from pure forecasting to
    estimating certain parameters of optimisation models (see Table 1). Statistical
    models provide mathematical representations of observed data, which are used for
    prediction purposes. They are generally based on variants of regression models,
    which include simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, generalized
    linear models, nonlinear regression, and autoregressive integrated moving average
    models (ARIMA) (Bovas and Johannes, 1983; Agresti, 2011; Agresti and Franklin,
    2011), regularized regression models - such as Ridge regression (Hoerl and Kennard,
    1970), Least Absolute Shrinking and Selection Operator (LASSO) (Tibshirani, 1996),
    as well as logistic regression models (Agresti, 2011). The latter are used for
    classification. Table 1. Summary of statistical and machine learning models as

    ML can be cast as either (i) supervised learning, (ii) unsupervised learning,
    (iii) semi-supervised learning or (iv) reinforcement learning. 2.1. Supervised
    learning Supervised learning techniques are used to devise a functional mapping
    between input variables and output variable(s) which have proven to be efficient
    for prediction tasks. Depending on the type of the dependent variable(s), a supervised
    learning technique is categorised as either a classification model (for a nominal
    dependent variable) or a regression model (for a continuous dependent variable).
    Therefore, statistical models can be viewed as supervised learning techniques.
    Classification models for ML include Decision Trees classifiers (Breiman et al.,
    1984; Quinlan, 1986), Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifiers (Cortes and Vapnik,
    1995; Steinwart and Christmann, 2008), Naïve Bayes classifiers (Domingos and Pazzani,
    1997), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost) classifiers (Freund and Schapire, 1995), Gradient
    Boosted Trees classifiers (Friedman, 2001; Hastie et al., 2009), Extreme Gradient
    Boosting (XGBoost) classifiers (Chen and Guestrin, 2016), Random Forest classifiers
    (Breiman, 2001), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (Friedman, 1989). Regression
    models include the regression variants of the aforementioned classifiers, namely
    Decision Trees regressors (Breiman et al., 1984), Support Vector regressors (SVR)
    (Drucker et al., 1997), Naïve Bayes regressors (Frank et al., 2000), AdaBoost
    regressors (Freund and Schapire, 1995), Gradient Boosted Trees regressors (Friedman,
    2001; Hastie et al., 2009), XGBoost regressors (Chen and Guestrin, 2016), Random
    Forest regressors (Breiman, 2001), as well as K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) regressors
    (Cover and Hart, 1967). Deep learning (Le Cun et al., 2015; Schmidhuber, 2015)
    is a class of supervised learning suitable for both classification and regression
    tasks, which includes classical Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) (Amari, 1972;
    Hopfield, 1982), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) (Le Cun et al., 1990), Recurrent
    Neural Networks (RNN) (Hopfield, 1982), Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN)
    (Goodfellow et al., 2014), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), Long
    Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), Deep Belief Networks
    (DBN) (Hinton, 2009), Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGAN)
    (Radford et al., 2015). 2.2. Unsupervised learning Unsupervised learning techniques
    are used to discover patterns or relationships within unlabelled data. These machine
    learning techniques can be classified as either: - feature extraction techniques,
    including Hierarchical and Partitional Clustering (e.g., K-means and k-medoid)
    (MacQueen, 1967; Hartigan and Wong, 1979; Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990), Gaussian
    Mixture Model (GMM)-based Clustering (Maugis et al., 2009), Principal Component
    Analysis (PCA) (Jolliffe, 2002), Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
    (UMAP) (Ghojogh et al., 2021), Isomap Embedding (Tenenbaum et al., 2000), Non-negative
    Matrix Factorization (NMF) (Lee and Seung, 2001), Association Rules (e.g. Apriori
    algorithm, (Agrawal and Srikant, 1994)), or - feature selection techniques, which
    revolve around Filter Methods based on mutual information (Pudjihartono et al.,
    2022). Variants of Deep learning (Le Cun et al., 2015) models used for unsupervised
    learning are Auto-Encoders (Kramer, 1991), which include Sparse Auto-Encoder (SAE)
    (Frey and Makhzani, 2013), Denoising Auto-Encoder (DAE) (Vincent and Larochelle,
    2010), Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) (Welling and Kingma, 2019) and Restricted
    Boltzman Machines (RBM) (Sherrington and Kirkpatrick, 1975), and Deep Boltzman
    Machines (DBM) (Salakhutdinov and Hinton, 2009). 2.3. Semi-supervised learning
    Semi-supervised learning (Chapelle et al., 2006; van Engelen and Hoos, 2020) combines
    both supervising and unsupervised learning framework, namely when the data available
    consist of both unlabelled and labelled data, with the sample of unlabelled data
    generally outweighing the one for labelled data. Semi-supervised learning techniques
    include Label Spreading (Zhu and Goldberg, 2009), Label Propagation (Zhu and Ghahramani,
    2002), and Self-Training classifier (Triguero et al., 2015). 2.4. Reinforcement
    Learning Reinforcement Learning (RL) (Kaelbling et al., 1996) is a framework based
    on an agent''s behaviour with a defined environment where some feedback from previous
    actions are used to adjust optimally the subsequent actions. RL techniques include
    Q-Learning (Watkins, 1992), Markov Decision Process (MDP) (Wrobel, 1984), State-Action-Reward-State-Action
    (SARSA) (Rummery and Niranjan, 1994), Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) (Schulman,
    2017), and Policy Gradient (PG) (Sutton et al., 2000). Sometimes, different ML
    techniques and statistical models are combined to improve the predictive accuracy.
    Such hybrid approaches include the combination of RL with Deep Learning (e.g.,
    Deep Reinforcement Learning, Deep Q-Learning) (Mnih et al., 2015), and the combination
    of ANNs with ARIMA (Zhang, 2003). This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview
    of the applications of machine learning in water resources management related
    fields, including groundwater management, water distribution systems, water quality
    and wastewater treatment, water demand and consumption, hydropower and marine
    energy, irrigation and agriculture, water drainage systems, and flood management
    and defence. The following sections provide an overview of the recent water resource-related
    research studies where ML algorithms were implemented (Fig. 1). Download : Download

    methodology This review involved establishing a systematic literature search on
    the water industry. ScienceDirect and Scopus were mainly used as the database.
    The search also mainly focused on journal articles. Two sets of keywords were
    used, where one set included the machine learning elements, and the other set
    included elements related to the water industry. Those relating to the former
    included keywords such as ‘machine learning’, ‘deep learning’, ‘neural networks’,
    ‘LSTM’, ‘long short-term memory’, ‘random forest’, ‘genetic algorithm’, ‘support
    vector machine’, ‘extreme learning machine’, and ‘extreme gradient boosting’.
    Those relating to the latter included keywords such as ‘groundwater’, ‘water distribution
    systems’, ‘water quality’, ‘wastewater treatment’, ‘water demand’, ‘water consumption’,
    ‘hydropower’, ‘marine energy’, ‘irrigation’, ‘agriculture’, ‘river basin management’,
    ‘water drainage systems’, ‘flood management’, and ‘water retaining structure’.
    The searches were limited to mainly include journal publications. While the search
    mainly focused on the articles published in the past ten years, some older articles
    were cited. 4. Groundwater management Groundwater resources are large natural
    reservoir located within the ground. Arid areas often rely on groundwater resources
    for water supply, irrigation and industrial activities. (Pathak et al., 2021;
    Ghosh et al., 2022). Half of drinking water is supplied by groundwater, and irrigation
    accounts for nearly 43% (Rajeevan and Mishra, 2020). However, natural and human
    factors have put groundwater resources under tremendous pressure. The main detrimental
    factors impacting groundwater quantity and quality include climate change, population
    growth, and agricultural demands. Most groundwater-related studies where ML was
    applied focus on groundwater level (GWL) forecasting. Understanding groundwater
    flow dynamics is essential to assess the potential availability and scarcity of
    water. Hence, a sustainable management of the available groundwater resources
    in arid and semi-arid regions is contingent of an accurate and reliable prediction
    of GWL, which directly reflects groundwater availability and provides relevant
    cues on its hydrodynamics. However, characterising groundwater dynamics is a difficult
    task since the occurrence and availability present spatial and temporal variations,
    which depend on several factors, including, but not limited to, slope, geology,
    rainfall, and soil type. A large number of studies have demonstrated the usefulness
    of data-driven models for GWL application, especially in data-scarce context and/or
    complex aquifer systems. Conventional approaches applied to GWL have often involved
    the use of multivariate linear regression models (MLR), autoregressive integrated
    moving average (ARIMA) model, and seasonal autoregressive moving average (SARIMA)
    (e.g., Rahaman et al., 2019), which are generally considered as linear fitting
    models. Future predictions could be derived using the SARIMA model along with
    the input and output of groundwater data (Kochhar et al., 2021). Teimoori et al.
    (2023) demonstrated that K-means clustering and relevance vector machine (RVM)
    could identify the optimal number and locations of monitoring wells and thus help
    design efficient groundwater level monitoring networks. Traditional ML models
    have also yielded acceptable GWL prediction performance. Rohde et al. (2021) use
    the ensemble-based Random Forest model and satellite-based remote sensing for
    long-term GWL prediction in California, USA. GWL was forecasted within all groundwater-dependent
    ecosystems across the state. They demonstrated that their results could be used
    to help groundwater data gaps filling and improve sustainable groundwater management
    policy in California even in the absence of groundwater monitoring well data.
    Liu et al. (2022) also implemented Random Forest and found it very effective in
    predicting GWL in the lower Tarim River. They demonstrated that RF was superior
    to other models in one-step-ahead predictions of groundwater depth in the space-time
    domain. Sharafati et al. (2020) assessed the performance pattern of the Gradient
    Boosting Regression (GBR) model to predict the monthly GWL with short- and long-lead
    times over the Rafsanjan aquifer. This study demonstrated the performance of GBR
    in predicting GWL. Regions with higher water depth and abstraction rates yielded
    better prediction performance. Hikouei et al. (2023) found that XGBoost exhibited
    good performance, reduced prediction uncertainties, and could capture true features
    of GWL in areas near canals. Their results showed that peat surface elevation
    was the most important parameter amongst other parameters tested, including precipitation,
    distance from the canal, and evapotranspiration. Several studies have shown that
    standalone deep learning models are more performant than traditional ML models
    but are still subjected to data characteristics that can affect their performance.
    The most common ML implementation is the use of artificial neural networks, which
    have been used to predict the dynamics of GWL in numerous studies. Ahmadi et al.
    (2022) showed that feed-forward ANN was very effective in groundwater characteristics
    quantitatively with good accuracy. Taormina et al. (2012) compared the ability
    of feed-forward neural network (FFANN) in forecasting GWL to regression and statistical
    models. Mohanty et al. (2015) also employed neural networks to predict GWL and
    found positive results. Another common application of ML in GWL forecasting is
    using deep learning models such as the LSTM, Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and the
    Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Cai et al. (2021) evidenced the superiority of
    the GRU model in regions with higher precipitation, higher average temperatures,
    lower snowfall fraction, more extreme climate events, and more frequent baseflow
    interactions. Regarding input features for the model, precipitation and streamflow
    data were found to be the most influential ones for groundwater level forecasting.
    Gharehbaghi et al. (2022) also examined the performance of the GRU model in Northwest
    Iran. They used three different layer structures of GRU-based neural network models
    via the seq2seq module, a modern deep learning scheme. Their proposed models could
    predict groundwater level fluctuations in arid/semi-arid regions. Wu et al. (2023)
    showed that the GRU model outperformed SVM, LSTM and MLP models at most groundwater
    monitoring stations. Recently, Pham et al. (2022) investigated the performance
    of seven machine learning models, namely random tree (RT), random forest (RF),
    decision stump, support vector machine (SVM), locally weighted linear regression
    (LWLR), as well as reduced error pruning tree (REP Tree), for the prediction of
    groundwater levels in a drought-prone area. This study found that the Bagging-RT
    and Bagging-RF models outperformed other models. Yin et al. (2021) compared the
    performance of machine learning and physical models in forecasting groundwater
    dynamics. The physically-based models included W3 and CLSM models, while the data-driven
    models were based on ANN, RF and LSTM models, respectively. The predicted GWLs
    from the LSTM model significantly perform better than those of RF and ANN models
    during validation and prediction periods. They quantified the importance of GRACE
    observations in data-driven models and found noticeable improvements in the performance
    metrics considered. Liu et al. (2022) found that when compared to Support Vector
    Machine, Generalized Regression Neural Network, Decision Tree, Convolutional Neural
    Network, Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Network, Random Forest performed
    the best in predicting groundwater levels. They showed that RF was superior to
    other models in one-step-ahead predictions of groundwater depth in the space-time
    domain. Mahammad et al. (2023) compared six ML models, including Linear regression,
    Decision tree regressor, Support vector regressor, Random Forest regressor, K-nearest
    neighbours regressor, and Extreme gradient boost regressor. They showed that the
    XGB regressor was the most reliable model for future prediction, while the Decision
    Tree proved to be the least efficient technique for portraying the GWL dynamics.
    They demonstrated that changes in GWL over space and time were strongly linked
    to changes in rainfall and population in the study area. Shakya et al. (2022)
    compared the Support Vector Regression (SVR) model, Multivariate Linear Regression
    (MLR) model, Decision Tree Regression (DTR) model, Random Forest Regression (RFR)
    model, Multivariate Polynomial Regression (MPR) model, and two deep learning algorithms,
    namely ANN model and ANFIS in the task of predicting GWL in an arid area in India.
    They demonstrated that the MPR model was excellent for GWL forecasting and found
    that the groundwater table was highly correlated with evapotranspiration. Sun
    et al. (2022) employed three common data-driven models for GWL forecasting applications,
    which included a back-propagation artificial neural network (BP-ANN), ARIMA, and
    LSTM. The prediction accuracy of the models was tested by deploying them in five
    zones in a Northern Plain in China, which exhibited various hydrogeological properties.
    Amongst the three models, the LSTM model exhibited the best performance. Mohapatra
    et al. (2021) compared the performance of ANFIS, DNN, and SVM to assess their
    capability to predict seasonal GWL in different agroecological Zones of India.
    They found that the DNN model was the most efficient in predicting seasonal GWL
    in most of these agroecological zones and would, therefore, be a reliable forecasting
    tool for seasonal groundwater levels in different agroecological zones of India.
    Wunsch et al. (2022) investigated the impact of climate change on groundwater
    resources in Germany using CNN. Declining trends of GWL could be observed in most
    of the sites as well as spatial patterns of stronger decreases, especially in
    the northern and eastern parts of the country. They also observed increased variability
    of low GWL, which extended over long periods during the annual cycle towards the
    end of the century. Bai and Tahmasebi (2023) compared the performance of a graph
    neural network (GNN) to two baseline models - LSTM and GRU - for GWL forecasting.
    They demonstrated that the GNN model outperformed the other models regarding all
    the performance metrics considered. Also, they demonstrated that their model could
    still learn spatial dependencies from the data even when these were completely
    unknown while still obtaining similar performance. Their model also exhibited
    a high efficiency since it could simultaneously model GWL change for all monitoring
    wells in the system. In addition to standalone ML models, recent studies have
    also examined the performance of hybrid-based models, which combine various ML
    methods to improve forecasting performance. Rahman et al. (2020) used ML models
    coupled with wavelet transforms and showed that wavelet-based hybrid models such
    as WT-XGB and WT-RF were more accurate than standalone models (non-wavelet-based),
    which included Extreme Gradient Boosting, Random Forests, and Support Vector Regression
    models. They also demonstrated that the coupling of WT further improved the performance
    for all ML approaches, and the improvement was more significant for a longer forecasting
    horizon (3 months). Wei et al. (2023) used ANN models combined with wavelet transform
    (WT) and phase space reconstruction (PSR) and found that the performance of the
    WT-PSR-ANN model was better than that of the WT-ANN model and substantially better
    than the standalone models in GWL forecasting. They also found that the type of
    mother wavelet affected the accuracy of the WT-hybrid models, which was more apparent
    for the WT-ANN models than for the WT-PSR-ANN model. Azizpour et al. (2021) proposed
    hybrid models to predict the monthly GWL in Kermanshah, Iran. The hybrid models
    comprised a differential evolutionary algorithm to optimise the ELM and a WT to
    decompose the input parameters into different time series. Their study suggested
    that their hybrid meta-heuristic ML could effectively predict the available water
    quantity in the investigated study area. Yadav et al. (2020) demonstrated that
    the hybrid models (HANN and HSVM) perform better than the original models (ANN
    and SVM) while predicting groundwater level fluctuations. They found that prediction
    accuracy decreased with increasing forecasting horizons for original and hybrid
    models. They evidenced that groundwater decline was much higher in peri-urban
    areas. Van Thieu et al. (2023) proposed a novel hybrid ML model combining Augmented
    Artificial Ecosystem Optimisation (AAEO) algorithm with a traditional MLP network
    and showed that AAEO-MLP exhibited the highest performance and stability with
    reasonable convergence. They evidenced that the AAEO was a promising approach
    for optimising ML models (e.g. MLP) and should, therefore, be explored for other
    hydrological forecasting applications (e.g., streamflow, rainfall) to further
    examine its performance over commonly known methods. Other than all purely data-driven
    hybrid models, physical-based hybrid models combine ML models and physics-based
    models to improve forecasting performance. Su et al. (2020) used deep learning
    algorithms combined with a range of complex numerical models and large-scale Internet
    of Things (IoTs) to measure groundwater levels with acceptable performance. Kayhomayoon
    et al. (2022) proposed a new hybrid model that combines MODFLOW simulation, clustering,
    and optimisation tools for GWL prediction. Specifically, they simulated GWL using
    the MODFLOW, clustered the study aquifer into different clusters using the k-mean
    method, and predicted regional GWL using ANN and ANFIS methods that were optimised
    by the Harris Hawks Optimisation (HHO), Whale Optimisation Algorithm (WOA), and
    Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO). They evidenced that the most important variables
    for groundwater levels in different clusters included GWL in the previous month
    (produced by MODFLOW), groundwater withdrawal, precipitation, temperature, and
    evaporation. Patra et al. (2023) compared Global-LSTM, and Local-LSTM to examine
    the relevance of groundwater sequential forecasting. Their study showed that the
    Global (MS) model was the least performant model in forecasting applications and
    that LSTM was reliable in GWL forecasting. They demonstrated that the local LSTM
    models from the mid-fan area exhibited the best choice for regional groundwater
    forecasting. Groundwater is also sensitive to pollution from various sources which
    is related to GWL decline, particularly in coastal areas, where the associated
    GWL decrease caused by excessive groundwater pumping leads to seawater intrusion,
    pollution and groundwater quality degradation. Nitrate contamination has also
    become a serious threat to coastal groundwater worldwide. Hence, the application
    of ML on groundwater contamination, although outside the scope of this review
    study, warrants further investigation. 5. Surface water management 5.1. Streamflow
    forecasting Machine learning has widely been applied to river basins, specifically
    for short-, mid- or long-term river flow forecasting, which is a pivotal task
    for optimal water resource management during the era of rapid climate change.
    The rapid evolution of hydrological variables, e.g., precipitation, substantially
    impacts the temporal evolution of river flow distribution in recent days, thereby
    rendering prediction challenges even more complex. The high uncertainty associated
    with basin characteristics, hydrological processes, and climatic factors affecting
    river flows makes streamflow prediction challenging. LSTM Networks have gained
    increasing attention in streamflow forecast, given its strong learning ability
    for time series data and ability to process sequential time-series data. Numerous
    studies have demonstrated the superiority of LSTM in streamflow forecasting over
    some traditional physics-based models, including the SAC-SMA model for runoff
    predictions (Kratzert et al., 2018) or the CaMa Flood calibrated model for streamflow
    and climate data forecasting (Damavandi et al., 2019). LSTM networks have recently
    yielded the most promising results in the realm of river streamflow forecasting
    (Wegayehu and Muluneh, 2022). Xu et al. (2020a, 2020b) assessed the performance
    of LSTM networks for 10 days average flow predictions and the daily flow predictions
    at Hun River and Upper Yangtze River basins, respectively. The impacts of network
    structures and parameters, such as the batch size and the number of LSTM cells,
    impacted the learning efficiency and predictive accuracy. Overall, LSTM was proven
    to yield good forecasting capabilities compared to traditional hydrological and
    data-driven models tested, which included the SWAT, Xinanjiang model (XAJ), multiple
    linear regression model (MLR) and back-propagation neural networks (BP). The predictive
    performance of LSTM models has also been compared to a wide range of machine learning
    models. Cheng et al. (2020) examined and compared the performance of ANN and LSTM
    in long lead-time forecasting in the Nan River Basin and Ping River Basin. Their
    ANN and LSTM models were shown to yield reliable daily forecasts up to 20 days
    lead time, albeit the LSTM model outperformed the ANN model when the forecasting
    horizon was increased. Mehedi et al. (2022) used the LSTM neural network to forecast
    river discharge and demonstrated its higher performance than other neural network
    regression models, including for longer lead periods. Dehghani et al. (2023) compared
    LSTM, CNN, and Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM), in hourly streamflow
    prediction in two rivers in Malaysia, namely the Kelantan and Muda River basins.
    They showed all three deep learning methods performed with high accuracy in predicting
    streamflow, but LSTM outperformed CNN and ConvLSTM in small basins with well-spatial
    distributed rainfall stations, while it underperformed them in moderate to high
    streamflow and large river basin. Le et al. (2021) examined and compared the performance
    of six supervised machine learning models in forecasting streamflow in the Red
    River basin in Vietnam. These included a CNN, a feed-forward neural network (FFNN),
    and four LSTM-based models. They also compared two standard models, LSTM and GRU,
    which comprised a single hidden layer, to two more complex algorithms: the stacked
    LSTM (Stacked LSTM) and the Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM). They showed that their
    four LSTM-based models performed better and were more stable than the FFNN and
    CNN models. They also evidenced that the complexity of the Stacked LSTM and BiLSTM
    models did not substantially improve the prediction accuracy compared to the two
    standard and simple models comprising a single layer (LSTM and GRU). Akbarian
    et al. (2023) examined the ability of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
    Forecasts (ECMWF) ensembles in runoff forecast application, with one-to three-months
    lead time in Iran. Five ML models were also used for the runoff prediction, including
    RF, ANN, XGBoost, SVR, and MLR, while results were compared to observations. Results
    showed that the ANN exhibited the best fit, followed by XGBoost and RF models,
    while SVR and MLR models yielded lower performance. ANN and XGBoost outperformed
    the other models for longer lead times, but the performance decreased with an
    increase in forecasting horizon. Ilhan (2023) explored a variety of ML algorithms
    in the estimations of one-ahead instantaneous measurement of streamflow rate in
    the Ergene River, including LSTM neural network, ANFIS with fuzzy c-means (FCM),
    ANFIS with subtractive clustering (SC), and the ANFIS with grid partition (GP).
    All four algorithms could successfully perform in the task of streamflow prediction.
    To further improve streamflow forecasting accuracy and model efficiency, a variety
    of traditional ML models that belong to the supervised category have also been
    either used directly or combined to develop hybrid models (Granata et al., 2022;
    Wang et al., 2023; Akbarian et al., 2023). Granata et al. (2022) proposed a novel
    ensemble model composed of RF and MLP algorithms and compared its forecasting
    capability to a deep learning model based on bidirectional LSTM networks. The
    results show that the two models showed comparable performance, but the forecast
    horizon strongly affected the predictive accuracy. Wang et al. (2023) developed
    a hybrid decomposition-based multi-model and multi-parameter (DMP) ensemble streamflow
    forecast method. Their novel ensemble forecast method extracted the characteristic
    periodic term and trend term of hydrological series, improved streamflow forecasting
    accuracy, reduced ensemble uncertainty and expanded the ensemble size. Hybrid
    models combining numerical models and ML models have also been tested to improve
    streamflow forecasting accuracy, especially for longer forecasting horizons. Hunt
    et al. (2022) tested LSTM for streamflow forecasting purposes for up to 10 days
    lead time at ten hydrological stations in the western US. The catchment-mean meteorological
    and hydrological variables from the ERA5 and Global Flood Awareness System (GloFAS)–ERA5
    reanalyses were used to train the LSTM model, as well as historical streamflow
    data. They showed for the first time that their LSTM model could be used in a
    hybrid system to create a medium-range streamflow forecast outperforming established
    physics-based models. Chu et al. (2023) assessed the ability of novel integrated
    streamflow modelling method combined with the DC-LSTM model with the DC-B-LSTM
    model in improving the forecasting performance. Both the DC-LSTM and DC-B-LSTM
    models were shown to outperform the standalone LSTM models for all river basins
    considered. Li et al. (2022) examined a hybrid model composed of a convolutional
    neural network and long short-term memory network (CNN-LSTM) and evidenced its
    superiority over the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model, especially in
    wet seasons, due to its nonlinear learning ability. 5.2. Water demand, allocation,
    and irrigation 5.2.1. Water demand and consumption Potable water can be inaccessible
    for many reasons, including inadequate water infrastructures, climate-based issues
    such as drought, and overexploitation of freshwater resources. Researchers have
    recently attempted to apply ML in drought forecasting, including Wang et al. (2022),
    who assessed the feasibility of using extreme learning machines (ELMs) to forecast
    hydrological droughts. They deployed support vector machine models and ELMs with
    approximately 144 different models, and they confirmed that ELMs could forecast
    the standardised hydrological drought index with high precision. Their study also
    demonstrated that self-adaptive differential evolution ELM could outperform all
    other tested models and that the wavelet hybrid positively impacted the model''s
    performance, yielding less error in their predictions. Global water scarcity presents
    an extraordinary challenge, so the United Nations prioritise it among its 17 sustainable
    development goals for 2030. Many regions are coming dangerously close to enclosing
    the gap between water demand and its sustainable limit. United Nations Water (2020)
    estimated that the water demand rate is more than twice the population growth
    rate within the last century. Arid areas are facing the worst of the water crisis.
    Therefore, monitoring water demand is of considerable significance for decision-makers.
    Water resources can be more efficiently managed if demand is accurately forecasted.
    This will help resolve the overexploitation of precious and limited water resources.
    Forecasting water demand is a challenging problem. As such, it has been approached
    in various ways, ranging from linear methods (Zhou et al., 2000; Alhumoud, 2008)
    to nonlinear regression models (Nasseri et al., 2011; Bennett et al., 2013). However,
    modelling water demand could be quite complex, and not all input variables have
    linearity between them. Due to the complexities of the water demand data, Romano
    and Kapelan (2014) explored the use of deep learning for forecasting and management
    of smart water distribution using real-life data from a water distribution network
    within the United Kingdom. Perea et al. (2019) applied deep learning to a previous
    study by Romano and Kapelan (2014) to improve the performance of existing short-term
    water forecasting models in Southern Spain. Banadkooki et al. (2022) attempt to
    resolve conflicts related to water resources in arid basins through the exploration
    of intelligent algorithms: genetic algorithms (GA) and non-dominated sorting genetic
    algorithm (NSGA-II). The study considered environmental parameters and the integrated
    water management indices to determine optimal water management scenarios. The
    study performed a variety of trade-offs to balance economic benefit and demand
    management. The results showed that less water was allocated to industries with
    high water demand to conserve aquifers and meet water demands. The real-life application
    of smart metering has become more apparent in recent years. Monitoring demand
    is vital for the adequate management of resources across all service sectors.
    Recently, neural networks have been more commonly implemented to address water
    demand prediction issues. While the water industry has not explored the use of
    deep learning for smart metering as extensively as in the energy sector (Kavousian
    et al., 2013). Pesantez et al. (2020) attempted to address this gap using artificial
    neural networks and cluster analysis to forecast the water demand at the customer
    level. They used smart metered data on water consumption, with no differentiation
    between the type of user, whether residential or non-residential. The study found
    that support vector regression underperformed compared to random forest and artificial
    neural network models despite applying optimisation methods supported by previous
    works (Herrera et al., 2010; Mouatadid and Adamowski, 2017; Antunes et al., 2018).
    As inferred previously by Herrera et al. in (2010), the random forest technique
    was found to be either on par with or slightly outperformed the artificial neural
    network model. Salloom et al. (2021) explored the use of GRU on historic water
    demand data and implemented k-means, an unsupervised classification method, to
    enhance prediction accuracy whilst also reducing the parameters fed into the model.
    The model was found to significantly reduce the complexity required (six times
    what was archived in the most current literature at the time of the study) while
    maintaining the predictive accuracy rate. Salloom et al. (2022) used a proportional-integral-derivative
    (PID) control approach to boost the performance and efficiency of neural network
    models for water demand prediction. The PID''s prediction error experienced the
    same level of reduction as other techniques in the study; however, the efficiency
    of error reduction showed superior performance compared to other techniques. This
    was evident by the negligible effects on the number of variables via the PID approach.
    Wang et al. (2022) explored the use of principal component analysis (PCA) and
    backpropagation (BP) neural network in water resource demand prediction in Taiyuan,
    China, a city subject to severe water shortages. Compared with other models (namely
    PCA-ANN, ARIMA, NARX, Grey-Markov, serial regression, and LSTM), the PCA-BP model
    outperformed them by making highly complex variables easier to compute. The model
    achieved this by reducing the dimensionality of the variables and transforming
    them into uncorrelated composite data. However, their model was limited by limited
    data collection, affecting its accuracy. In addition, although the model''s computation
    accuracy was sufficient to meet the threshold, there was still room for further
    development. 5.2.2. Water allocation and irrigation Water plays a vital role in
    irrigation and agriculture all over the world. The Food and Agriculture Organization
    of the United Nations (2017), FAO, states that 70% of freshwater withdrawn globally
    is supplied to agriculture to sustain the ever-growing human population. Future
    projections on the water demand for irrigated food production will double by 2050,
    increasing pressure on the already limited freshwater supplies. The FAO also anticipated
    an increase in water withdrawal by agriculture by 2050; however, this increase
    is only by 10%. This small increase is attributed to improved management and practices
    for irrigation. Therefore, efficient water use within the irrigation and agricultural
    sectors is crucial to lessen the strain on water demand worldwide. Evapotranspiration
    is an important aspect of irrigation and agriculture, which is split into two
    components: evaporation and transpiration. Evaporation refers to the water evaporated
    over a specific area, whereas transpiration refers to the water lost through the
    stomata of the vegetation. As these natural processes occur simultaneously, they
    are difficult to disentangle. Accurate estimation of the evapotranspiration rate
    is a vital parameter for farmers and agricultural engineers, as it helps reduce
    crop water demand. Traditional methods to address these issues include the Penman-Monteith
    equation, which Baille et al. (1994) used as a simplified method for the rate
    of evapotranspiration prediction. Other approaches found success using scintillometer
    and meteorological measurements applied to the FAO-PM56 model, as used by Poisson
    et al. (2017) study. However, the authors showed that the FAO-PM56 model had more
    significant uncertainties when minor variations were applied and fewer input variables
    were used. Deep learning techniques have been extensively used to model and forecast
    evapotranspiration within the agricultural sector. Feedforward backpropagation
    ANN outperformed multi-linear regression models (MLR) for predicting wind drift
    and evaporation losses of sprinkler irrigation systems (Al-Ghobari et al., 2018).
    Various studies found that convolutional neural networks (or CNN-hybrids) were
    more accurate than other nonlinear regression models, such as random forest or
    extreme gradient boosting, for evapotranspiration forecasting (Ferreira and da
    Cunha, 2020a, 2020b; Lucas et al., 2020). Elbeltagi et al. (2020) opted for a
    more modern approach to the problem by modelling long-term evapotranspiration
    dynamics using deep learning algorithms in major wheat-producing sites in Egypt.
    They applied deep neural networks using real-life data collected from remote sensors,
    which included the monthly maximum temperature, the monthly minimum temperature,
    and the monthly solar radiation. The model parameters were intentionally chosen
    to give the lowest root mean squared error, following a similar procedure presented
    by Maroufpoor et al. (2019a,b). He et al. (2022) successfully demonstrated the
    use of biological heuristic algorithms integrated with an extreme learning machine
    (ELM) to accurately determine the daily evapotranspiration (ETo) in the Hetao
    irrigation district of China. In the hybrid ELMs, the optimisers include grey
    wolf optimiser (GWO), moth-flame optimisation (MFO), particle swarm optimisation
    (PSO), and whale optimisation algorithm (WOA). The GWO was highlighted as the
    strongest performer of the four algorithms, obtaining the highest accuracy (R2
    = 0.945–0.955), specifically using mass transfer (Tmax, Tmin, RH, u2) combination
    as opposed to temperature or radiation. GWO is characterised by the avoidance
    of local optimisation when dealing with nonlinear and multivariate functions.
    Water resources can often become contaminated by agricultural runoff. Improper
    agricultural practices lead to elevated levels of faecal coliforms and other pollutants,
    thus negatively impacting the water quality of the surrounding area. Bilali and
    Taleb (2020) found that artificial neural networks and other machine learning
    models, such as random forest, multi-linear regression and decision tree, are
    highly accurate at predicting irrigation water quality parameters, such as the
    sodium absorption ratio and the TDS dissolved in the water surface. The study
    found that the ANNs outperformed k-nearest neighbours and support vector regression
    models. H. Chen et al. (2020) found that the CNNs architecture could be developed
    and integrated with decision tree algorithms to aid in smart feature extraction
    and to establish intelligent spectroscopic modelling of agricultural water pollution.
    Furthermore, ANNs have been used to forecast infiltration water volume under furrow
    irrigation (Mattar et al., 2015), to forecast irrigation flow (Mouatadid et al.,
    2019), and to forecast estimates for drip irrigation systems (Karimi et al., 2020).
    However, Mouatadid et al. (2019) highlighted that LSTM models were able to outperform
    the other models used in their study, which included an ANNs model, least squares
    support vector regression (LSSVR), multi-linear regression (MLR) and extreme learning
    machine (ELM). The LSTM was coupled with a maximal overlap discrete wavelet transform
    analysis and bootstrap technique. The wavelet-bootstrap-ANN and wavelet-LSTM,
    both with three hidden layers, displayed the most accurate forecasting capability
    compared to the other models used in the study. Chen et al. (2021) explored reinforcement
    learning, a deep Q-learning network (DQN), to develop smart irrigation practices
    focusing on conserving irrigation water and time without losing paddy rice yield.
    DQN combines the perception ability of deep learning with decision-making ability.
    The study found that the DQN strategy could conserve 23 mm of irrigation water
    compared to conventional irrigation decisions. Drainage water was also reduced
    by 21 mm without a reduction in yield. Alibabaei et al.’s (2022) case study in
    Portugal utilised a deep reinforcement learning model to optimise irrigation requirements
    on the site. The model would serve as a smart irrigation scheduling system that
    would aid farmers in water quantity and the irrigation frequency required for
    the site. The model post-training would not require expertise to operate and,
    thus, would be a valuable system for farmers to use after the completion of the
    study. The model would also adjust the irrigation requirements based on climate
    change, as climate data is used in the model. The study considered ANN, LSTM,
    and CNN. However, the LSTM was found to be better at predicting the Q-table than
    the other models. The trained model decreased the water requirement by 20–30%
    and increased productivity by 11% compared to the fixed method. Gorgij et al.
    (2023) demonstrated the predictive potential of LSTM for spatiotemporal forecasting
    of the quality of groundwater used for irrigation. Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR)
    was highlighted as a crucial criterion for the study. An 18-year SAR dataset based
    in northwest Iran was supplied to the model to forecast the irrigation water quality
    for the subsequent year. They found that the LSTM marked against the performance
    indicator RBIAS showed underestimation by the model. However, when assessed against
    the performance indicator GA (generalisation ability), the LSTM model exhibited
    more acceptable performance. The allocation of water sourced from the Transboundary
    River generally involves many stakeholders in different countries that share the
    water resource. Water scarcity and the often-conflicting use of water resources
    ultimately increase tensions between riparian countries. Tension can be eased
    by the efficient management and allocation of transboundary water resources, which
    warrants the need for advanced techniques to enable the proactive and efficient
    planning of available water for human well-being and environmental sustainability.
    As an attempt to apply ML techniques for water allocation in a transboundary context,
    Yan et al. (2019) comprehensively evaluated the water resources of China''s transboundary
    river basins at the basin and country levels. They assessed the performance of
    several ML algorithms, including random forest, gradient boosting, and stacking
    in the task of forecasting runoff. Their study provided valuable information on
    long-term averaged surface water resources by country and basin in China''s transboundary
    river basins and high-resolution runoff coefficient and runoff maps of all the
    riparian countries, thereby providing valuable spatially distributed runoff information.
    Their study also demonstrated the satisfactory implementation of ML models for
    water resources assessment and their superiority over traditional linear models
    and two popular runoff data products (the UNH/GRDC Global Composite Runoff Fields
    and the Global Streamflow Characteristics Dataset) from a predictive accuracy
    standpoint. 6. Hydropower management, marine energy and reservoir operation 6.1.
    Hydropower management and marine energy Statistics from Our World in Data (2020)
    showed that in 2019, global fossil fuel consumption totalled 136,761 TW-hours,
    reaching a new record and continuing the increasing trend observed in the past
    years. Fossil fuels were classified into three categories: gas, coal and oil.
    The data showed that most consumption was attributed to oil (53,620 TW-hours),
    while the least consumed fossil fuel was gas (39,292 TW-hours). This leaves global
    coal consumption at 43,849 TW-hours. Global efforts to struggle against climate
    change have been increasingly witnessed over recent years by shifting towards
    clean and renewable energy. According to the International Hydropower Association
    (2020), the 2020 Hydropower Status report showed that global clean electricity
    generation through hydropower achieved a new record of 4306 TW-hours. This record
    was acknowledged as the “single greatest contribution from a renewable energy
    source in history”. However, this record can only account for a small portion
    of the global fossil fuel consumption in 2019, approximately 3%. Therefore, it
    is essential to maximise the full potential of hydropower and marine energy by
    exploring new methodologies to solve current problems and increase the energy
    efficiency provided, particularly in some parts of the developing world where
    the load on the system is increasing, but hydro-turbines struggle to match the
    demand. The application of ML in hydropower management and marine energy has recently
    met some level of success. Hammid et al. (2018) explored the use of artificial
    neural networks on a small hydropower plant using a Kaplan turbine at the Himreen
    Lake dam in Diyala, Iraq, to enhance the accuracy of forecasting the energy produced.
    Wang et al. (2020) developed a novel integrated approach using traditional and
    more modern methodologies for the production capacity prediction of a hydropower
    station to enhance energy efficiency. A previous study by Zhang et al. (2017)
    found that a backpropagation neural network model, although powerful in terms
    of performance, took a relatively long time to train on the input data. Although
    a radial basis function neural network model could outperform the backpropagation
    neural network (Li et al., 2018), they were both prone to the risk of local minimum
    convergence. To avoid this challenge, Wang et al. (2020) opted for using a simple
    single hidden layer feedforward neural network, defined as an extreme learning
    machine (ELM). The corresponding model showed a generalisable performance with
    a relatively quick training time. Technological advances have made it possible
    to predict energy that can be gained from ocean waves. This type of renewable
    energy carries a higher power density than other renewable resources, such as
    solar or wind energy. Accurate predictions can enhance energy efficiency to reach
    the full extent of potential wave energy, ultimately helping the shift from fossil
    fuels. An early comparative study by Reikard (2009) supported a time-varying parameter
    approach, attributing the weakness of the neural network model to inadequate architecture
    and optimisation for that dataset. Hybrid models have been found to have the potential
    to achieve accurate predictions. Real-life application of wave energy control
    is difficult as it depends on accurate predictions of future waves. Li et al.
    (2018) explored the use of deep learning, namely ANNs, and showed that the model
    was able to provide accurate predictions, which substantially increased the average
    energy absorption from 60% to 80%. However, the control efficiency could still
    be further developed and improved as it was slightly lower than the optimal level.
    Avila et al. (2020) showed that using ANNs and fuzzy interference systems (FIS)
    proved to be effective tools to accurately predict wave power at any point in
    deep oceanic waters, even with a small dataset of a few months collected from
    buoys in the Micronesian region. Recently, Giles et al. (2021) explored the issue
    caused by sun glint for high-resolution red-green-blue (RGB) imagery collected
    by drones over shallow marine environments. An artificial neural network model
    was developed to automatically detect and classify the sun glint in high-resolution
    aerial imagery. The model was supplied with a highly imbalanced dataset, with
    the pixels of sun glint accounting for only 1.19% of the training dataset. Despite
    this, 99.18% of overall predictions were correct. It was also shown that large
    hydropower plants could have high environmental impacts. Bortoluzzi et al. (2022)
    used Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and an artificial neural network to accurately
    predict the local impact of such projects. While the DEA allowed the environmental
    impacts to be ranked, the ANN allowed the assessment of the size of the local
    environmental impact. In other words, they created a hybrid DEA-ANN decision-making
    approach, which enables a more informed evaluation of hydroelectric generation
    projects. The GRU-LSTM hybrid model of Ma et al. (2023) successfully predicted
    water levels in cascade hydropower stations at different time scales. Such information
    is vital for irrigation and flood control. Authors note prediction errors associated
    with downstream tributary backwater jacking could be significantly reduced by
    adding downstream tributary flow as an additional parameter in the dataset. The
    LSTM parameters implemented the Archimedes optimisation algorithm. The output
    results of the GRU and LSTM were weighted. This resulted in increased accuracy
    of the water levels predicted. The authors highlight the use of a semisoft threshold
    function to improve the model in various ways, such as eliminating the noise of
    the original hydrological dataset. 6.2. Reservoir operation Reservoirs provide
    a plethora of services, including the provision of freshwater supply. On the other
    hand, groundwater level fluctuation is subject to factors such as changes in precipitation
    during different seasons. National Thailand (2019) pointed out that the Vajiralongkorn
    Dam in Kanchanaburi was at 51% capacity with 4500 million cubic metres of water,
    down from 70% the same time the previous year, highlighting the harsh reality
    of dams drying up due to climate change. Given this fact, decision-makers are
    under more pressure to be aware of potential shortages in the future. Therefore,
    accuracy in predicting the water balance of a reservoir is crucial. Artificial
    neural networks (ANN) have been applied by Hadiyan et al. (2020) to accurately
    forecast the Sefidroud Dam reservoir inflow. Their study compared different types
    of static and dynamic ANNs, which included static feedforward neural networks
    (FFNN), nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural networks, and nonlinear autoregressive
    neural networks with exogenous inputs (NARX). The models were trained using two
    input variables, namely, the monthly inflow discharge and the precipitation data.
    The architectures were optimised by adjusting the number of neurons within the
    hidden layers. They found that the dynamic NAR model outperformed the other two
    models and could predict high inflows while achieving the lowest RMSE values.
    They evidenced that the most optimum number of time delays was 12 for the input
    variable as the model could perform computation more accurately. They also attempted
    to use dynamic artificial neural networks instead of static ones for forecasting
    discharge inflows. Recurrent neural networks have also been used to forecast water
    levels to improve water resource management, and long short-term memory (LSTM)
    models have proved to be efficient for this purpose, achieving an accuracy of
    97.05% (Ren et al., 2020). Amongst the main hydrological processes impacting the
    sustainable planning and management of river, dam operation and reservoir capacity
    is suspended sediment load (SSL). AlDahoul et al. (2022) successfully demonstrated
    the application of ML models to accurately classify suspended sediment load SSL
    using the data from the Johor River in Malaysia. The analysed models include extreme
    gradient boosting (XGB), random forest, support vector machine, multi-layer perceptron,
    and k-nearest neighbours. The XGB model exhibited superior classification performance
    over the other ML techniques. The model used several parameters, such as environmental
    factors influencing the SSL pattern, while using two different time scales. Nonetheless,
    they demonstrated that most of the ML models achieved acceptable classification
    results. 7. Water distribution and drainage systems 7.1. Water distribution systems
    As water demands increase and freshwater availability decreases, water resource
    mapping (WRM) becomes a key aspect of water resource management. Water resource
    managers need to know where the next set of potential resources are to use them
    in their plans for the future. Therefore, accurate predictions are imperative
    to ensure the availability of freshwater supply is over- or underestimated during
    the planning. Due to inadequate information, traditional approaches for WRM, such
    as water spectral indices (WSI), reach an impasse with high-resolution multispectral
    images. This can be problematic for more complex areas. To provide an alternative
    approach to mediate the issue, K. Chen et al. (2020) deployed a water body extraction
    neural network (WBE-NN) model for a more accurate surface water resource mapping.
    This approach outperformed previous methods (e.g., Feng et al., 2018; Nandi et
    al., 2017) with reduced processing time and a reduction of underestimated water
    areas. Water distribution networks (WND) are crucial infrastructure systems that
    provide potable water to the public. However, according to Interreg Central Europe
    (2020), up to 50% of water is lost in some parts of Europe, with an average of
    26% due to various structural problems, including poor water pressure management,
    deteriorated infrastructure, and leakages. For instance, the Consumer Council
    for Water (2017) stated that England and Wales collectively have a water leakage
    loss of 3.1 billion litres daily. Many traditional approaches have been undertaken
    to resolve water leakage issues; however, these methodologies are limited as they
    need to consider the complex and nonlinear deterioration of the infrastructures
    over time. To resolve the issue of leakage detection, Arsene et al. (2012) explored
    the use of deep learning combined with graph theory. Water distribution systems
    require adequate pressure management to sustain many operational aspects, which
    include demand control, maintenance, water leakage and failure management, cost
    reductions, and energy efficiency. Non-revenue water is largely attributed to
    water that is lost through leakage within the distribution network, thus resulting
    in substantial amounts of water loss through leakage. This increases operational
    costs, impacting the economic value of water companies. Traditional approaches
    for pressure monitoring often leave high uncertainties about pressure values at
    the nodal points that do not have sensors on them. Ridolfi et al. (2014) used
    artificial neural networks with a combination of the entropy-based methodology,
    which was outlined as shifting towards conditions of the highest order. The study
    found that optimal sensor placement on nodes could be achieved by finding the
    best trade-off between sampling design and model accuracy. Other studies show
    the successful use of neural networks for leakage or contamination detection within
    a water distribution system. Rutkowski and Prokopiuk (2018) used learning vector
    quantisation (LVQ) neural networks to pinpoint contamination locations within
    a water distribution system in Poland, whereas Zhou et al. (2019) used a convolutional
    neural network as part of a novel burst location identification framework. Hu
    et al. (2021) proposed a novel approach to leakage detection within a water distribution
    system using multiscale fully convolutional networks integrated with spatial clustering
    of applications with noise. This approach outperformed k-nearest neighbour (KNN),
    support vector machine (SVM) and naive bayes classifier (NBC) by 28%, 78%, and
    72%, respectively. Water resource carrying capacity (WRCC) is an essential aspect
    of urban planning, which aims to balance out the amount of water demand concerning
    the available water resources within an urbanised area. Analysis of the WRCC of
    a city helps prevent the exploitation and degradation of the water resources and
    environment while ensuring a sustainable standard of living for the people. However,
    addressing this issue depends on multiple input variables, which become far too
    complex and reduce the accuracy of the predictions. Yu et al. (2020) proposed
    two simple types of feedforward neural networks (FNN) based on the normalisation
    value (NV) and error correction to address these issues. Almheiri et al. (2021)
    outlined the superior performance of deep learning compared to other machine learning
    methodologies, e.g., survival random forest (SRF). However, since the amount of
    data available controls DL approach, it is therefore limited as pipe failure data
    are not widely scarce. They developed a hybrid model using an ANN-based method
    and integrated an ML process to predict the hazard ratio of water pipes. The performance
    of ML approaches (e.g., SRF) decreased as the training shots decreased, whereas
    the stability of the hybrid model remained constant despite the decrease in the
    training shots. The authors suggested the two learning phases allow the hybrid
    to effectively generalise, while one phase was used in the baseline approaches.
    Garðarsson et al. (2022) successfully demonstrated strong performance of Graph
    Neural Networks (GNNs) to predict pressure values in water distribution networks
    in order to detect leakage and localisation. Results were evaluated by the benchmark
    set in the Battle of the Leakage Detection and Isolation Methods challenge (Vrachimis
    et al., 2020). The authors noted that the model was limited by false positives;
    however, the GNN model could obtain the highest economic score among the contestants,
    suggesting the model was still considered a viable approach to leakage detection.
    More recently, Yu et al. (2023) implemented ML methods with piezoelectric accelerometers
    installed within real-life pipe networks across several cities in China that classified
    vibration signals in order to detect leakages within the systems. They demonstrated
    that a pre-trained compact CNN with 18 deep learnable layers with the ability
    to classify images into 1000 classes, namely SqueezeNet, performed the best and
    showed a 95.15% in leak-detection accuracy compared to the other ML approaches,
    which included SVM, DTR and KNN. They also demonstrated that larger dataset enabled
    SqueezeNet to achieve more accurate results. 7.2. Water drainage system The advent
    of advanced sewage and drainage systems can be traced back to the Indus Valley
    Civilisation around 3000 BC. This historical infrastructure spanned 91 cm across
    and 1.5 m in depth as a watertight sanitary drainage system (Harappa, 2020). Nowadays,
    natural processes required for drainage systems, namely the infiltration, which
    enables water to move into the ground easily, is hindered and reduced in urbanised
    areas. Therefore, increased stormwater can easily overwhelm surface water drainage
    systems of urbanised areas. Pollutants and contaminants within the system can
    potentially be released and have serious consequences on public health, as well
    as the health of any surrounding organisms. Concerns over climate change and future
    projections of heavier rainfall can present a challenge to decision-makers and
    drainage engineers. If drainage systems cannot function properly, urban flooding
    is inevitable and may eventually lead to various issues for both the public and
    the environment. An important aspect when designing drainage systems is understanding
    the rainfall-runoff relationship for any given catchment. Gong et al. (1996) and
    Loke et al. (1997) have attempted to address this issue using ANNs models as a
    predictive tool for urban stormwater drainage. Loke et al. (1997) were able to
    show that neural networks had a high fault tolerance, good generalisation, and
    a high ability to learn. However, limitations of the models included the need
    for substantial amounts of data for more accurate predictions, little transparency,
    and relatively long training times. Pektaşa and Cigizoglu (2013) highlighted the
    inadequate performances of ANNs, univariate autoregressive integrated moving average
    (ARIMA), and multivariate autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMAX) models
    for time series predictions for direct runoff coefficients within large drainage
    basins. They proposed a hybrid ANN-ARIMA model and found that it could be generalized
    to enhance the computational power of the neural networks and offer for more accurate
    time-series predictions. On the other hand, ANNs have also been explored to alleviate
    issues pertaining to stormwater and optimisation of the drainage system (Hsu et
    al., 2013; Rjelly et al., 2018; Mullapudi et al., 2020). An early study by Tran
    et al. (2007) outlined the use of neural network modelling with CCTV data to identify
    the deterioration of stormwater pipes made from concrete. The architecture used
    backpropagation weight estimation and was compared to a Monte Carlo simulation
    using Bayesian weight estimation. Although the neural network model outperformed
    the Monte Carlo simulation, the model struggled to accurately process irrelevant
    features, namely redundant factors such as ''soil type'' and ''buried depth''.
    More recently, Li et al. (2019) used backpropagation neural networks (BPNN) as
    a monitoring tool to assess the performance of stormwater green infrastructure
    practices. The model was successfully able to reduce peak flow rate averages of
    61% per storm event and reduce the flow volume by 33% per storm event. Truong
    et al. (2021) input a 21-year dataset of water levels into a gradient tree boosting
    (GTB) model to forecast the water levels in the culverts within irrigation and
    drainage systems. The GTB consistently outperformed eight other machine learning
    methods. Over 91% of predicted and observed values had an error rate below 10%.
    The comparative common machine learning techniques such as DTR, DL, Adaboost,
    SVM, XGBoost, RF, and LightGBM. The resultant predictions could aid in forming
    a strategic approach considering water resources reallocation, affordable pumping
    technologies, or water rotation in times of low water levels. Zhang et al. (2022)
    utilised deep reinforcement learning (DRL), specifically a Duelling Double Deep
    Qu-learning (D3QN) strategy, to evaluate the uncertainty of control within drainage
    systems. DRL-based real-time control showed reduced statistical dispersion by
    15.48–81.93% compared to the conventional rule-based control strategy, thus demonstrating
    an advantage over the rule-based strategy. The reduction in statistical dispersion
    specifically pertained to random and system uncertainties in monitoring water
    level signals within an urban drainage system. 8. Water quality monitoring Water
    quality is an absolute necessity for public health and safety. However, since
    the 1990s, water pollution has worsened in most rivers in Africa, Latin America
    and Asia (United Nations Environment Programme, 2016). The global population has
    only increased and intensified the global demand for potable water, thus putting
    enormous pressure on water treatment plants. Extensively urbanised cities such
    as London, Hong Kong and New York experience high levels of stormwater runoff.
    Much of the effluents carry various types of pollutants, which lower the drinking
    water quality, in some cases making the water dangerous for marine life. Therefore,
    water treatment engineers faced various challenging issues requiring advanced
    and innovative solutions. For instance, estuaries face various environmental issues,
    including toxic chemicals, water flow changes, and habitat loss. According to
    the National Biodiversity Network (2019), physical changes impact a third of the
    water ecology in the United Kingdom, thus hindering the natural functions of the
    estuaries. Many estuaries undergo large-scale conversions into urbanised areas,
    agricultural areas, and shipping ports. Therefore, human interference imposes
    a great burden on the natural environment, and a substantial number of estuarine
    habitats are lost, forcing more competitive survival pressures on the species
    inhabiting those areas. Other environmental issues include toxins within the water
    supply, such as Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae. Human interference
    can haphazardly provide optimum conditions for Cyanobacteria to bloom. This includes
    degradation of the surrounding water quality caused by the release of fertiliser-polluted
    runoff from farms, eutrophication of waterways and septic tank overflows. These
    environments allow Cyanobacteria to thrive and multiply above a safe level for
    humans, animals, and plants. Various studies have been conducted using deep learning
    for estimations and predictions regarding water quality, including Zhou (2020),
    who used transfer-based LSTMs, and Yu and Qu (2020), who used radial basis function
    neural networks. Zhang and Hu (2020) used difference-gated neural networks, and
    Y. Chen et al. (2020) used deep cascade forests. Jouanneau et al. (2014) found
    that monitoring Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), a key water quality indicator,
    required more time and effort to detect. Ma et al. (2020) addressed this issue
    by developing a deep matrix factorization (DMF) combined with deep neural networks
    (DNN) in a New York City (United States) harbour. The proposed model showed strong
    computational power, superior to other machine learning algorithms such as gradient-boosted
    decision trees, random forest, and support vector regression. Traditional linear
    methods, such as Ridge, LR, and LASSO, were also used as a benchmark but underperformed
    compared to the machine learning methods. The history of modern-day water supply
    infrastructures can be traced back to the 1600s in Medieval London (Water History,
    2020). Newhart et al. (2019) found that water treatment plants are excellent subjects
    for neural network studies due to the large quantity of historical data that is
    usually available and easily accessible. Several studies have shown that ANNs
    outperform other machine learning algorithms for investigating the operations
    of the water treatment plant (Guo et al., 2015; Ghaedi and Vafaei, 2017; Najafzadeh
    and Zeinolabedini, 2019). These operations ranged from predictions for membrane
    fouling in the filtration systems of a water treatment system to predictions for
    real-time coagulant dosage (Dharman et al., 2012; Kim and Parnichkun, 2017; Bagheri
    et al., 2019). Alternatively, Zhang et al. (2019a, 2019b) used ANN with genetic
    algorithms to predict the performance of drinking water treatment plants under
    varying pressures and stresses to effectively manage the water treatment plant.
    Wastewater treatment is imperative to ensure the health and safety of the public
    and the surrounding environment. In 2015, the United Nations International Children''s
    Emergency Fund (UNICEF) estimated that 1.8 billion people have no other water
    source except water contaminated by faecal matter. Therefore, a significant part
    of the world''s population is highly exposed to various water-related diseases,
    including polio, cholera and typhoid. The United Nations Educational, Scientific
    and Cultural Organization (2017) reported that 80% of inadequately treated wastewater
    is released into the environment worldwide. The pollutants in this water can severely
    impact human health and the surrounding ecosystem, such as decaying organic matter,
    reducing oxygen availability, and essentially killing the aquatic inhabitants.
    Proper management of wastewater treatment is pivotal before effluent can be safely
    discharged back into the environment. Ráduly et al. (2007) used ANNs to evaluate
    the performance of wastewater treatment plants, while Shi and Xu (2018) proposed
    a model based on a stacked denoising auto-encoders deep learning network to predict
    biofilm system''s performance under various wastewater treatment plant operations.
    Zhang et al. (2018) used LSTMs to forecast flow to optimise inter-catchment wastewater
    transfer and reduce overflow, and Niu et al. (2020) used genetic algorithms integrated
    into deep belief networks to accurately predict effluent quality and improve process
    monitoring. Bhagat et al. (2020) provided a critical analysis of the development
    of artificial intelligence for modelling the removal of heavy metals within wastewater.
    The approaches investigated included ensemble models, various metaheuristics,
    different ANN models, and unsupervised methods. Recently, Sang-Soo et al. (2020)
    used CNN and LSTM combined with a deep learning approach to predict the water
    level and water quality in the Nakdong river basin. The study highlighted the
    proposed model''s performance and ability to capture the temporal variations of
    the pollutants in the Nakdong River basin. Zhu et al. (2022) successfully used
    enhanced feed-forward neural networks to predict biochemical oxygen demand (BOD)
    and ammonia nitrogen (NH3–N) water quality indicators within wastewater treatment
    plants. The highly accurate model obtained a mean error of less than 10% with
    an R2 of 90%, thus improving on the previous feed-forward neural network with
    the least square support vector machine (FFNN-LSSVM) model. However, the authors
    suggested that the data obtained from real-time monitoring should be used to inform
    future research and improve the model performance. Yang et al. (2023) demonstrated
    the sufficient accuracy of LSTM network in the task of forecasting the effluent
    quality of a constructed wetland. Their model could outperform other predictive
    ML methods including multiple linear regression, backpropagation neural network
    (BPNN), and a GA-BPNN-hybrid neural network (genetic algorithm as an optimisation
    method integrated into a BPNN model) to resolve local minima issues. They showed
    that their data exhibited significant effluent population fluctuations. A moving
    average method was applied to smooth the data, improving the accuracy of the traditional
    and hybrid neural networks. Ibrahim et al. (2023) outlined using ANNs to successfully
    predict the water quality index (WQI). The authors used principal component analysis
    (PCA) to identify the sources of pollution within the Terengganu River and reflect
    the general conditions. They applied three ANN models with differing input layers
    to predict the water quality index (WQI) of the river. The best-performing ANN
    was found to be the one that used the raw data as the input layer, as opposed
    to principal component factor scores (obtained from the previously conducted PCA).
    9. Flood management and water-retaining structures 9.1. Flood prediction Flooding
    poses a serious risk to many people worldwide, with many regions of the earth
    impacted by this natural disaster. Flooding is caused by a wide range of factors,
    including (i) heavy, prolonged rainfall events, which are more likely to rise
    in the future as a consequence of climate change, (ii) urbanisation., which substantially
    increases the surface water runoff and impedes the rate of infiltration, or (iii)
    infrastructure failure such as overtopping of dams. The impacts of flooding can
    have a substantial economic burden, particularly in the developing world. Some
    studies (e.g., Ward et al., in 2017; Peduzzi in 2017; Alfieri et al., 2018) anticipate
    the global economic impact of flooding to cost approximately $1 trillion by 2050.
    Other impacts include mass migration, socio-psychological implications, loss of
    livelihood and property and, in more severe cases, loss of life. According to
    a report presented by the United Nations (2015), 2.3 billion people were affected
    by flooding, with a significantly high death toll of 157,000 people between 1995
    and 2015. Future flooding events have been predicted to become more frequent and
    more intense than they have been in the past. Therefore, to sufficiently mitigate
    and manage the consequences of flooding, exploring innovative solutions and technologies
    that enhance the accuracy of predicting flood occurrences is imperative. Conventional
    methodologies include prediction using flood inundation models (Salvadore et al.,
    2015; Gires et al., 2015; Teng et al., 2017). However, these models can only simulate
    results based on distinct types of flooding, and complete real dynamic processes
    are omitted, resulting in the decayed accuracy of the projections. Fenech et al.
    (2019) attempt to follow a similar methodology but include dynamic processes.
    They aimed to improve this model by using a model that divides the irregular urban
    area into various grid cells. The proposed model considered the characteristics
    of the urban environment, including urban drainage systems and impermeable surfaces.
    To evaluate the model, the authors attempted to reproduce the flood in Lafayette
    Parish in Louisiana in 2016. Results showed that due to coarse resolutions, simulations
    could not reproduce the flood regions of the 2016 Lafayette Parish flooding. However,
    spatial patterns were observed after the model resolution was refined. Fang et
    al. (2019) introduced deep learning for flood prediction and proposed an integrated
    LSTM and reduced-order-model (ROM) framework to perform time series prediction
    and prescriptive analysis on flooding. Their study found that the LSTM-ROM model
    outperformed the full model and maintained its accuracy in predicting flooding.
    However, they found that when lead time is extended, the predictive accuracy decreases.
    Bui et al. (2020) introduced a novel approach using deep learning neural networks
    to aid in forecasting the likelihood of flash floods. This type of ANNs architecture
    was selected due to its ability to represent and process highly complex input
    data and to produce highly accurate projections despite the non-linearity of the
    given data (Lewis, 2016). Their study was specifically designed to address the
    challenges in regions susceptible to a high frequency of tropical storms. Therefore,
    the model was based on real-life data collected in the northwest mountainous region
    of Vietnam. The geographic information system (GIS) input dataset included the
    slope, lithology, rainfall, soil type, elevation, steam density, curvature, and
    normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). All nine factors influenced the
    susceptibility of flash flooding within the area. The influencing factors were
    selected based on the information gain ratio method proposed by Quinlan (1986)
    and Dai and Xu (2013), thus eliminating the need for data collection on unnecessary
    factors. Hosseiny''s (2021) study utilised U-net, an advanced CNN, to predict
    river flood depth and extent. The results surmised an improved accuracy in predicting
    the maximum flood depth by 29%. Löwe et al.’s (2021) research also successfully
    implemented advanced convolutional neural networks, U-Net, to predict urban pluvial
    flood water depth. It was found that deeper networks improved the prediction until
    reaching a limit of around 28 million trainable parameters. It was noted that
    too many datasets led to overfitting and increased prediction errors. The dataset
    that led to the model performing the best included a combination of terrain aspect,
    curvature, depth of depressions, flow accumulation and imperviousness. Ahmed et
    al. (2021) found exponential Gaussian process regression (GPR) accurately predicted
    the daily water levels in a river subject to annual flash flooding in Malaysia
    based on data collected from 1990 to 2019. The GPR model outperformed several
    other machine learning models such as linear regression (LR), interaction regression
    (IR), robust regression (RR), stepwise regression (SR), support vector regression,
    boosted trees ensemble regression (BOOSTER), bagged trees ensemble regression
    (BAGER), XGBoost, and tree regression (TR). The GPR was further used to predict
    water levels based on 10-day minimum and maximum water levels and could forecast
    the extremes of the water levels. The authors of the study denote the study was
    limited by data availability. Ramayanti et al. (2022) explored the generation
    of flood susceptibility mapping, where they implemented two deep learning architectures
    to the problem: group method of data handling (GMDH) and CNN. The study was centred
    around the March 2019 flood in the Beria Area, Mozambique. The models were both
    able to produce similar mapping, where lower-sloped areas (i.e., areas along the
    river) were at a higher risk of flooding. The CNN performance indicator, RMSE
    value, was four times lower than the RMSE value derived from GMDH. This showed
    that CNN could generate an accurate flood susceptibility map more than the GMDH.
    Sorkhabi et al. (2023) employed CNN and LSTM to predict the variability in sea
    level and flooding to measure coastal city resilience. Variables included wind
    speed, sea surface temperature, precipitation, and mean sea level. The study found
    that deep learning approaches offered good predictive accuracy in the resilience
    of the city against flooding due to the variable sea level. However, future works
    suggested are to incorporate more parameters, such as updated satellite data,
    to improve the accuracy of the models. 9.2. Water retaining structures Throughout
    human history, dating back more than 5000 years, according to Biswas and Tortajada
    (2010), water-retaining structures have been constructed in many places worldwide.
    Dams provide many benefits, although their fundamental purpose is to facilitate
    water storage. These benefits include, but are not limited to, flood control,
    hydropower and human consumption. Currently, there are 50,000 of these large hydraulic
    structures (Tata and Howard, 2016) being used worldwide, of which a large majority
    are embankment dams. The British Dam Society (2019) attributes the most common
    dam failure modes to overtopping during floods. The health and structural integrity
    of dams are crucial since the consequences of failure can be severe. Therefore,
    understanding dam behaviour and failure mechanisms is vital. De Granrut et al.
    (2019) explored using ANNs to analyse the behaviour of piezometric data on arch
    dams, focusing on the rock-concrete interface to monitor uplift pressures on the
    dam. The study highlighted the limitations of traditional multi-linear regression
    (MLR) models, such as the Hydrostatic-Season-Time (HST) model, which are commonly
    used across engineering practices to monitor dams (Crépon and Lino in 1999; Penot
    et al., in 2005; Léger and Leclerc in 2007). The advantage of using HST is that
    only the reservoir level is required and performs well only under certain circumstances.
    On the other hand, various mathematical approaches have been proposed to model
    dam seepage (Ding and Han, 2017). Cui and Zhu (2009) successfully implemented
    a three-dimensional finite element method integrated with genetic algorithms;
    however, issues with convergence and basic operators in the genetic algorithms
    impacted the model''s accuracy. Zhang et al. (2020) successfully applied ANNs
    integrated with a three-dimensional finite element model to forecast the regions
    of weakness (particularly seepage) of concrete dam foundations. Unlike the HST
    model, ANNs enable the capture of the non-linearity of the piezometric data, such
    as the leakage flows, movements, and head of the reservoir. Overtopping occurs
    when the dam''s design, such as the freeboard, is not sufficient to cater to the
    actual requirements, which may change over time. Hence, a suitable design during
    the initial construction may no longer be appropriate later due to the changes
    in conditions. The likelihood of overtopping is further exacerbated during extreme
    weather conditions. For example, due to fluctuations caused by the weather, the
    head of the water rises above the designed freeboard, which leads to overtopping.
    The Environment Agency (2018) reports that the projections show increased winter
    precipitation over the United Kingdom because of climate change. Although seasonal
    variation is expected, there will be times during the year when dams will be subjected
    to store more water due to the high precipitation, increasing the risk of overtopping.
    As the years go on, the trend of a rainfall event is expected to further increase
    the risk of overtopping. Huang et al. (2003) used convolutional ANNs for coastal
    water level predictions. However, this method requires large amounts of long-term
    historical data, which is not always readily available. Fuzzy logic parameters
    integrated into ANNs provide effective estimations of water levels under uncertainty;
    however, they do not give insight into the parameters'' uncertainties alone (Alvisi
    and Franchini, 2011). Yang et al. (2019) applied recurrent ANNs to simulate reservoir
    operations using inflow, storage and climate data. In this study, the authors
    used LSTM, nonlinear autoregressive models with exogenous input (NARX) and a NARX-based
    genetic algorithm, and they found that the latter was able to outperform the other
    models. Ren et al. (2021) implemented an interpretable mixed attention mechanism
    long short-term memory (MAM-LSTM) model to predict displacement associated with
    concrete dams. The authors found success in their two-staged encoder approach.
    The highly influential factors were adaptively selected by the factor attention
    mechanism module. The temporal attention mechanism module, in contrast, was able
    to select the relevant hidden states. This model outperformed classical statistical
    modelling and other deep learning and machine learning models. Fan et al. (2022)
    utilised a transfer learning approach, MA-AttUNet. This sophisticated methodology
    applied previous knowledge from a source domain to underwater crack image segmentation.
    The knowledge transfer occurs using a multi-level adversarial transfer network.
    An attention mechanism also limited background noise during detection. Although
    the model exhibited poor real-time performance, it was able to accurately identify
    underwater dam crack images. Nonetheless, the model outperformed other methods
    at the time of the study. Zhang et al. (2023) used a unifying transformer encoder
    integrated into a CNN architecture for pixel-level dam crack detection. The proposed
    model demonstrated flexibility and was able to adapt to a variety of scenarios.
    Although the model performed well against quantitative indicators, the authors
    showed that the model''s accuracy in detection was critically impacted by weak
    or disturbing background information. They also highlighted that the model''s
    speed was slightly lower than comparative machine learning models, thereby suggesting
    that future works could include a lightweight deep learning architecture for faster
    training. 10. Conclusions, open issues, and prospects Machine learning techniques
    have successfully been used to identify patterns within nonlinear datasets. This
    study explored the various ML techniques that have been applied within the realm
    of water resources management. Various Machine Learning techniques have found
    significant applications for prediction purposes, ranging from pure forecasting
    to estimating certain parameters of optimisation models. Particularly, implementing
    artificial neural networks has found great success in recent years. Proactive
    and effective water management requires accurate prediction, and several studies
    have shown that standalone deep learning models could outperform conventional
    machine learning models, albeit the data characteristics could substantially affect
    their performance. Specifically, LSTM networks have been proven to exhibit reliable
    forecasting performance and even outperform ANN models, traditional machine learning
    models, and established physics-based hydrological models. Complexifying the architecture
    of LSTM-based models (via stacked structure) has not substantially improved forecasting
    performance. More complex ML models require more data, and thus, the complexity
    of the deep learning model should be in accordance with the data. However, the
    performance of standalone deep learning models could sometimes be limited and
    unable to effectively capture features from multivariate time series. Presently,
    more studies have considered hybrid ML techniques, such as hybrid ANNs, as they
    have shown superior computational power over traditional ANNs architectures. Hybrid
    models combining classic deep learning models such as the LSTM or GRU and decomposition
    algorithms (WT, EMD, and VMD) have shown good performance and should, therefore
    be further developed. The development of hybrid machine learning models has often
    yielded comparable performance in terms of forecasting accuracy. Hence, these
    models could still be further improved and developed, especially for long forecasting
    horizons, as the predictive accuracy has always decreased with increasing lead
    time. Hybrid deep learning models should be more developed than standalone deep
    learning models, considering their superiority in terms of prediction performance.
    Physics-hybrid models, which combine data-driven models and physical models, have
    also proven to improve prediction performance. Physical-based hybrid models are
    commonly either developed by feeding the ML model with the simulation outputs
    of physical-based models, or by forecasting its errors. When forecasting the error,
    the deep learning models can detect the location of most errors made by the physical-based
    models. When using the output of physical-based models as input for the ML model,
    its contribution should be first assessed to ascertain it would add positive impact
    on model performance. Other advanced deep learning architectures, such as transformers
    (Polosukhin et al., 2017), have yet to be tested in water resources management.
    Transformers have so far been successfully used to design neural networks in various
    application domains, including natural language processing, genomic sequences,
    time series data, and signal processing. Such models are known for their general
    structure, which includes an additional layer between the encoder and decoder,
    enabling them a high degree of parallelisation and, hence, faster training. This
    could be a valuable feature when handling complex data, which is very valuable
    given that several studies have shown that several hydrological/meteorological
    variables could contribute positively to prediction performance. Recent studies
    (e.g., Janner et al., 2021) highlighted how transformer architectures can be used
    to simplify reinforcement learning by formulating it into a single big sequence.
    Such an approach provided more capacity and power to reinforcement models in their
    attempt to address decision-making problems via the distributions of rewards and
    actions over sequences of states. Furthermore, transformer architecture offers
    some promising features for dynamics prediction as well as long-horizon dynamics
    prediction, which could tremendously improve groundwater level or river streamflow
    forecasting. In a data-scarce context, implementing Transfer Learning techniques
    could be a potential solution when developing hybridising physical-based and deep
    learning models. In the future, it is thus highly recommended to further employ
    Transfer Learning to improve ML model performance, particularly for long forecasting
    horizons, as predictive accuracy has always been shown to decrease with increasing
    lead times. The implementation of Transfer Learning could substantially improve
    the performance of hybrid deep learning models, and thus enable more informed
    decision-making process in the realm of water resource management and flood defence
    applications. In the real-world context, ML proved to be a powerful tool in water
    resources management, providing insights, predictions, and optimisation capabilities.
    The practical application of ML in the water sector has taken a wide disparity
    of forms, depending on the intended use or desired benefits. For instance, ML
    has successfully been used to develop a Smart Water Networks in Barcelona, Spain,
    where ML and IoT (Internet of Things) technologies were implemented to improve
    water efficiency and reduce losses in the distribution network (Shahra et al.,
    2019). This was done by monitoring water quality, detecting leaks, and optimising
    water distribution using sensors and data analytics. Another example was the application
    of ML for burst locations in water distribution network in Jiangsu province, east
    China (Zhou et al., 2019). They correctly located 57 of 58 synthetic bursts in
    the system. Another practical application of ML is the development and deployment
    of decision support systems (DSS) to help water resources managers and authorities
    to make informed decisions. DSS have also been greatly beneficial for water resources
    allocations in several countries, including the US (WRF-Hydro), Australia (AQUATOR),
    or the Netherlands (HydroNET). These often leverage machine learning to analyse
    complex data including – but not limited to - satellite imagery, real-time sensor
    data, and hydrological and weather data, to make predictions and assist decision-makers.
    ML algorithms have also been implemented to develop an early warning system that
    helps residents and authorities take preventive measures during heavy rainfall
    events (Dong et al., 2022). Weather patterns, river levels, and historical flood
    data are first analysed to enable the system to provide early warnings. All in
    all, Machine learning has become a valuable asset in the water sector, providing
    valuable insights, predictions, and optimisation capabilities applicable in real-world
    practice to enhance sustainable water use and management, and subsequently improving
    socio-economic development, healthy ecosystems and human existence itself. CRediT

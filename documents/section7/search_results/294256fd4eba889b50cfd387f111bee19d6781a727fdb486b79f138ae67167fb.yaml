  description: The agricultural sector is witnessing a transformative shift with the
    integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, offering innovative solutions
    to enhance crop management practices. This research focuses on leveraging IoT
    for the effective management of diseases affecting onion plants in agriculture.
    By employing a network of sensors, data analytics, and automated control systems,
    this study aims to create a smart agricultural framework that monitors, detects,
    and manages onion plant diseases in real-time. The research begins with a thorough
    investigation into the common diseases affecting onion crops and their associated
    environmental factors. Subsequently, a robust IoT infrastructure is designed and
    implemented, comprising sensor nodes for monitoring soil moisture, temperature,
    humidity, and other relevant parameters. These sensor nodes communicate data to
    a central hub, where advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms analyze
    the information to detect early signs of diseases. In response to disease detection,
    the IoT system employs automated control mechanisms, including precision irrigation,
    targeted application of agrochemicals, and the deployment of environmental control
    measures. The study also explores the integration of remote monitoring through
    mobile applications, allowing farmers to receive real-time alerts and make informed
    decisions promptly. Through field trials and data analysis, the effectiveness
    of the IoT-based disease management system is evaluated, considering factors such
    as disease suppression, yield improvement, and resource efficiency. The research
    also addresses economic considerations and the scalability of the proposed IoT
    framework for widespread adoption in onion cultivation. The findings of this study
    contribute to the advancement of precision agriculture and sustainable farming
    practices, demonstrating the potential of IoT in revolutionizing onion plant disease
    management. As the global demand for agricultural productivity increases, integrating
    smart technologies into traditional farming practices becomes paramount, and this
    research provides valuable insights for stakeholders in the agriculture and technology
    sectors.

  description: This paper gives the idea of solving some of the problems faced by
    farmers. The population rate of the world is growing rapidly and will double in
    the coming decades and the need of food is also increasing simultaneously. To
    meet this rapid growth in demand for food, automation in agriculture is the best
    solution. The aim of this paper is to design and develop an automated system to
    monitor the various conditions of soil and moisture on the crops, and the proper
    supply of water, which affects the crops [5]. Such a system will contain sensors,
    a pump and a device called a humidifier, and various advanced techniques like
    IoT, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. The technical field is racing
    to provide more optimum solutions. The incorporation of IoT, along with cloud
    computing, big data analytics, and wireless sensor networks can provide enough
    scope to predicrocess, analyze situations and improve activities in a real-time
    situation. Green House is one of the best solutions as the crops can be grown
    in a controlled climate without the natural environmental conditions. In the last
    few decades there has been a huge advancement in technology for agriculture, with
    the help of technology we can help farmers for increasing their rate of yielding.
    With this, we can overcome the major problems of farmers. This small processor-based
    unit can be used to control anything from a fan, air- conditioner, humidifier,
    and watering system from 4 relay outputs. A temperature and humidity range can
    be set to control relay outputs. The main focus of this paper is to implement
    the Internet of Things (IoT) in the monitoring of humidity, soil condition, temperature,
    supply of water to the field, level of water, environmental condition, etc. The
    IoT-based Smart agriculture System being planned via this paper is integrated
    with different Sensors.

  description: This paper addresses the concerns in irrigation mechanisms and employs
    a Sensors and cloud-based platform to monitor and control an irrigation system.
    In order to monitor the soil's moisture level in real time, moisture sensors are
    placed in the field. These sensors wirelessly provide data to the NodeMCU, which
    processes and relays the information. The NodeMCU gathers the sensor data and
    processes it, considering standard deviations and crop-specific parameters. Using
    this information, the system starts the water pump and opens the solenoid valves
    to begin the irrigation operation. The NodeMCU coordinates with these valve-opening
    devices via wireless communication. In addition, the system uses online weather
    prediction data to provide more precise watering schedule optimisation. The system
    dynamically modifies the irrigation schedule based on analysis of weather patterns,
    evapotranspiration rates, and crop water needs to save water during times of rain
    or high humidity. The solution makes use of cloud-based platforms to improve scalability
    and accessibility. The gathered sensor data and command instructions are safely
    transferred to the cloud server. This allows farmers to remotely check on and
    adjust the irrigation system by means of the web or mobile apps. In addition,
    data analytics methods may be used to infer information and provide suggestions
    for improved methods of water management and crop care. In conclusion, the Internet
    of Things (IoT) NodeMCU smart irrigation system provides an automated and intelligent
    approach to water management in agriculture. Water is saved, crop yields are boosted,
    and sustainability is enhanced thanks to the capacity to irrigate precisely based
    on real-time soil moisture data, weather predictions, and crop needs.

    Agricultural practices are rapidly changing in the face of the increasing demand
    for food and water resources. Traditional methods of irrigation have proven to
    be inefficient, causing water scarcity and soil degradation. The concept of aquaponics,
    a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, offers an alternative solution to
    sustainable agriculture. It utilizes a closed-loop system where fish and plants
    are grown in the same environment, creating a symbiotic relationship where the
    waste from fish is utilized as nutrients for plants, and the plants clean the
    water for the fish. Fish waste is converted into nitrates by bacteria present
    in the soil, which can be readily absorbed by the plants. This system also provides
    the plants with a much more consistent nutrient supply as compared to traditional
    irrigation systems. Experts say that the aquaponic way of irrigation conserves
    as much as 90% of the water that is wasted in traditional irrigation systems.
    It is also observed that plants grow faster in this system because nutrients are
    readily available to them and they do not have to expend energy searching for
    them. Overall, the nutrient-rich, controlled environment of an aquaponics system
    provides the ideal conditions for plant growth, making it a superior option for
    growing plants. The proposed system takes various samples of tap water as well
    as Potheri Lake water with varying differences in pH, turbidity, and water temperature.
    The pH level of lake water can vary widely depending on various factors such as
    the surrounding environment, the presence of aquatic life, and the weather conditions.
    In general, lake water can have a lower or higher pH level than tap water, depending
    on the lake''s distinctive characteristics and the way the local area''s tap water
    is treated. For instance, tap water is usually treated to have a pH level between
    6.5 and 8.5, which is considered safe for human consumption and does not cause
    corrosion in pipes. The naturally occurring presence of suspended particles like
    silt, sand, and algae in lake water can cause it to have a greater turbidity level
    than tap water. 2 Literature Review The hardware design of one system [1] includes
    various components such as sensors, actuators, relays, an Ethernet shield, Arduino,
    and routers. The monitoring of temperature and humidity is accomplished using
    an Arduino microcontroller, an Ethernet Shield, an FC-28 humidity sensor, and
    a DHT11 temperature sensor. A router is utilized to connect the Arduino Ethernet
    to a server. The relay module functions as a control switch for various actuators,
    which respond to the sensor output. The aquaponic box contains several actuators,
    such as two 12V DC exhaust fans, a mist maker, a 5V DC fan, two LED Grow Light
    lamps, and a 12V DC pump [2]. Another system kept track of numerous environmental
    factors, and over time it would be able to control how the farm operated and create
    a fully automated system. Publishers (nodes), brokers (local servers), and subscribers
    (local servers) all communicated via the MQTT protocol, which allows for the use
    of any data type. Monitoring can also be done with the help of a GUI program,
    a communication network, and [3] wireless sensors. A graphical user interface
    is provided by AWSM to address the aforementioned issues. Farmers can get real-time
    notifications and advice about water quality even when they are not there by using
    AWSM''s mobile applications built on IoT technology. When compared to the conventional
    approach, the introduction of the AWSM-based IoT application in the Aquaponics
    system has shown substantial gains. Additionally, it is feasible to [4] investigate
    many characteristics observed by smart systems, IoT technologies, and aquaponics.
    A ZigBee module [5] can be used in place of the Wi-Fi module to broadcast the
    data gathered by the Arduino while also displaying the values on the LCD without
    performing any control actions. A fish tank, a grow bed, and a light panel that
    simulates the sun''s rays for plant growth make up the aquaponics system described
    in [6]. The fish waste provides nutrients to the plants, which in turn receive
    water from the fish tank as a filter. The system makes use of actuators to operate
    the water pump, light panel, heater, and oxygen provider as well as sensors to
    monitor and control pH levels, temperature, and humidity. To direct the actual
    citrus production process, nutrient monitoring [7] in citrus plants can also be
    done in real time according to the soil situation. Another method that primarily
    focuses on finding magnesium and nitrogen deficiencies in image processing [8]
    in MATLAB for the detection of rice illnesses and nutritional deficiencies. A
    Raspberry Pi, a DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor, and solenoid valves make
    up the hardware employed in this technique. A deep learning method can help in
    the detection of diseases and the prediction of crop growth by utilizing many
    sensors that measure the pH value, temperature, humidity, and water level [9].
    Astute farming is described by the author of reference [10] as the integration
    of a wireless sensor and irrigation system that keeps track of factors including
    soil moisture, nutritional content, and pH levels. A GSM module is used to manage
    the system via wireless communication. 3 Architecture Diagram The proposed system
    shown in Fig 1 comprises two sets of sensors—one for the fish tank and the other
    for the crop soil. The data from these sensors are sent to the Arduino board.
    The Arduino board processes the data and sends it to the NodeMCU Wi-Fi module
    which sends it to the Adafruit cloud platform for visualization and analytics
    [11,12,13,14,15]. The system gathers real-time sensor data from the fish tank
    and crop soil using a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor, temperature
    and humidity sensor, pH sensor, turbidity sensor, and water temperature sensor.
    The physical layer or sensor is made up of this. The data is gathered and transferred
    to the Arduino board regularly. Fig. 1 Architecture diagram of proposed system
    Full size image 4 Methodology The construction of an aquaponics monitoring system
    for effective irrigation is the main goal of the suggested system. The system
    uses a variety of sensors, including a soil moisture sensor placed in a tomato
    plant, pH, water temperature, and turbidity sensors. The irrigation process is
    controlled by the readings from these sensors. Hardware Setup: The hardware setup
    consists of an Arduino board that, via Arduino programming in the Arduino IDE,
    receives data from the sensors. The NodeMCU Wi-Fi module, which is set up to work
    on any internet network, receives the data after that. A personal hotspot or local
    Wi-Fi network was used for this project. The data is sent from the NodeMCU to
    Adafruit.io, a cloud-based platform for IoT data analytics and visualization.
    On this platform, real-time data changes can be tracked and examined. Every 30–45
    s, the sensors update their readings. A CSV file containing the data gathered
    from the Adafruit.io platform can be downloaded. Then, using the downloaded data,
    three classification algorithms—KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes—are trained and tested.
    To forecast the soil''s irrigation needs, data is analyzed. Jupyter Notebook is
    used to analyze and visualize machine learning. Utilizing visualization techniques,
    the three classification systems are compared for accuracy. The system’s overall
    goal is to create an aquaponics monitoring system that controls irrigation by
    using a variety of sensors. Machine learning algorithms are used to analyze the
    sensor data and estimate the need for irrigation, which can result in more effective
    irrigation and higher agricultural yields. 4.1 Machine Learning Algorithms Used
    KNN (K-Nearest Neighbor). To use KNN, we must first select a value for k, which
    specifies the number of neighbors to take into account. Then, when we have a fresh
    batch of data to categorize, we determine how far away each point in the training
    set is from the fresh data and select the k-nearest points. Finally, we designate
    the class for the new data point as being the one that is most prevalent among
    those k points. Naïve Bayes’ classifier. Based on the Bayes theorem, which quantifies
    the likelihood of a hypothesis given evidence, it is a probabilistic categorization
    model. The term “naive” refers to the assumption made in Naive Bayes that the
    features are conditionally independent of the class. ANN (Artificial Neural Network).
    It is a machine learning model that takes its cues from how the human brain is
    organized and works. It is made up of many interconnected layers of neurons that
    analyze data and produce predictions. The features of the instance to be classified
    are sent to the input layer of an ANN classification model, and the predicted
    class is generated by the output layer. There are one or more hidden layers in
    between that process the input and transmit data to the output layer. The weighted
    total of the inputs is applied by each neuron in the hidden layers using a nonlinear
    activation function. 5 Components Used 5.1 Hardware The proposed irrigation system
    based on aquaponics uses various components to measure and transmit real-time
    data to the cloud platform for visualization and analytics. The sensors used in
    the system are summarized below. Soil moisture sensor (LM393). An electrical tool
    called the soil moisture sensor (LM393) measures the amount of water in the soil.
    It measures the soil moisture using the LM393 comparator integrated circuit and
    outputs a digital signal based on the predetermined moisture threshold. This sensor
    comprises two probes that are put into the soil; as a function of the moisture
    content of the soil, the resistance between the probe changes. Temperature and
    humidity sensor (DHT11). A widely used electrical device that can detect both
    temperature and humidity levels in the environment is the DHT11 temperature and
    humidity sensor. It uses a capacitive humidity sensor to monitor humidity levels
    and a Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) thermistor to measure temperature.
    The sensor sends digital outputs of temperature and humidity data to an 8-bit
    microcontroller through a one-wire protocol. pH sensor and turbidity sensor: A
    pH sensor is an electronic device that determines whether a solution is acidic
    or alkaline. The pH scale, which has a range of 0–14 with 0 being the most acidic,
    14 being the most alkaline, and 7 being neutral, serves as the basis for how it
    functions. The fish tank’s water clarity, which is crucial for fish health, is
    measured by the turbidity sensor. Water temperature sensor. A common sensor for
    measuring the temperature of liquids, including water, is the DS18B20. This sensor
    is a digital thermometer that communicates with other devices via a 1-Wire interface.
    With an accuracy of 0.5 °C in the range of − 10 to + 85 °C, the DS18B20 can measure
    temperatures from − 55 to + 125 °C. Arduino board. Arduino Uno is based on the
    ATmega328P microcontroller. It is an open-source hardware board created for people
    of all skill levels who want to develop a variety of electronic projects. The
    board contains a USB port, a power jack, six analog inputs, an ICSP header, and
    14 digital input/output pins. The Arduino programming language, which is based
    on C/C++, can be used to program the board. NodeMCU Wi-Fi module. The board is
    a great option for IoT applications because it combines the capabilities of a
    microcontroller and a Wi-Fi module. The Arduino IDE or the Lua programming language
    is used to creating programs for the NodeMCU ESP8266 device. Various sensors,
    actuators, and other electronic devices can be connected to the board''s GPIO
    pins. Additionally, it has Wi-Fi connectivity functionality built-in, enabling
    it to connect to the internet and communicate with other devices. A USB cable
    or an external power source can be used to power the board. 6 Implementation The
    sensor data was collected for over a month on an hourly basis. Visualizations
    were created based on the data. The data was also collected in the form of CSV,
    and three different binary classification algorithms were applied to it, namely
    KNN, ANN, and Naive Bayes. The working model of the aquaponic system is shown
    in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 Turbidity, water temperature, and pH sensor along with connections
    Full size image 7 Results The suggested technique gives a thorough strategy for
    effective aquaponic irrigation management. Real-time sensor data visualization
    and analytics offer insightful information on fish and agricultural growth conditions.
    The three machine learning methods’ comparison offers useful insights into effective
    irrigation prediction in aquaponics. For visualization and analysis, the Adafruit
    platform can be accessed on a smartphone, laptop, tablet, or any other electronic
    device that can be connected to the internet. Visualization on Adafruit.io is
    shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Fig. 3 Real-time values of data acquired from sensors

    7.1 Comparing the Accuracy of Various Classification Models The selection of a
    classification algorithm for agricultural data is influenced by the details of
    the data, the resources at hand, and the objectives of the classification activity.
    A standard criterion for assessing a classification model''s performance is accuracy.
    It calculates the percentage of cases in the dataset that were correctly categorized.
    To put it another way, accuracy is the proportion of true positives and true negatives
    in all instances. The model is operating effectively and properly predicting the
    class labels of the instances in the dataset when the accuracy value is high.
    A classification model could be taught to determine whether or not a certain soil
    sample needs irrigation based on its characteristics, such as its temperature,
    humidity, and soil moisture content. In this situation, a classification model
    with high accuracy might be helpful since it can make precise predictions about
    the soil samples’ irrigation requirements. As a result, farmers may be better
    able to decide when and how much to irrigate their crops, which may result in
    the more effective use of water resources and higher crop yields. On comparing
    the accuracy of all three algorithms as in Fig. 5, Naive Bayes was observed to
    have the highest accuracy of 94.12%. This is followed by ANN with an accuracy
    of 91.18% and then by KNN having an accuracy of 88.24. Fig. 5 Grouped bar chart
    for comparison of the accuracy of different models used Full size image 8 Conclusion
    In conclusion, we have presented an irrigation system based on aquaponics that
    utilizes real-time sensor data to monitor and irrigate crops efficiently. The
    system gathers information from a variety of sensors, including soil moisture
    sensors, temperature and humidity sensors, pH sensors, turbidity sensors, and
    water temperature sensors. This information is then processed and instantly displayed
    on the Adafruit platform. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of three classification
    algorithms, namely KNN, Naive Bayes’, and ANN, for deciding when to irrigate the
    soil. We discovered that ANN had the maximum accuracy, making it the best algorithm
    for our system''s irrigation timing prediction. As a future scope, we plan to
    further enhance our system by incorporating features that will enable the user
    to receive alerts on their mobile device, indicating when the crop needs water.
    We also plan to compare our results with additional classification algorithms
    to identify the best-performing algorithm for our system. Overall, this system
    provides a significant advancement in the automation of aquaponics-based irrigation,
    offering a more efficient, accurate, and sustainable way of managing crops. References

    In the face of escalating global food demand and the imperative need for sustainable
    agricultural practices, the fusion of technology with farming methodologies has
    emerged as a pivotal solution. With the advent of wireless sensor networks (WSNs)
    and their seamless integration into various industries, agriculture has witnessed
    a paradigm shift towards precision farming. In this context, the deployment of
    wireless sensor nodes presents a promising avenue for proactive fault detection
    and real-time monitoring within agricultural landscapes. The conventional agricultural
    practices, while effective, often lack the precision and responsiveness demanded
    by the dynamic environmental conditions and evolving crop health challenges. Addressing
    this gap, the use of wireless sensor nodes offers an innovative approach by facilitating
    continuous and granular data collection across vast agricultural expanses. These
    sensor nodes, strategically placed throughout fields, enable the monitoring of
    crucial parameters such as soil moisture levels, temperature fluctuations, humidity
    variations, and vital plant health indicators. Harnessing the capabilities of
    these sensors coupled with advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms,
    agricultural practitioners gain unprecedented insights into the intricacies of
    their farming ecosystems [1, 2]. This research endeavors to explore, analyze,
    and validate the efficiency of employing wireless sensor nodes as a cornerstone
    for smart fault detection in agricultural systems. By elucidating the technological
    framework, data acquisition methods, and the application of intelligent algorithms,
    this study aims to demonstrate the potential transformative impact of this technology
    on modern farming practices. Moreover, it seeks to address the challenges encountered
    in implementing wireless sensor networks in agriculture while highlighting their
    role in bolstering irrigation and fertilizer efficiency, predictive harvesting,
    minimizing crop losses, and fostering sustainable farming methods [3]. As the
    global population burgeons and the pressure on agricultural productivity intensifies,
    the need for innovative and proactive measures in farming becomes increasingly
    paramount. The integration of wireless sensor nodes stands poised to revolutionize
    the agricultural landscape, heralding a new era of precision, sustainability,
    and resilience in crop production. This paper endeavors to contribute to this
    unfolding narrative by providing empirical insights into the promising frontier
    of wireless sensor networks use for smart fault detection in agriculture, thereby
    reshaping the future of farming practices worldwide. In this research endeavor,
    the subsequent sections delve into various aspects of fault detection in the agricultural
    domain. Following the introduction, the second section meticulously examines the
    mechanisms and techniques employed for detecting defects, establishing a comparative
    analysis of their reliability and effectiveness. Emphasis is placed on the significance
    of using the WSN (wireless sensor nodes) technique while addressing the challenges
    it entails and offering potential solutions. Section three is dedicated to elucidating
    the motivation behind the robustness of WSN in contrast to contemporary and existing
    techniques for defect analysis and determination. The proposed methodology is
    thoroughly outlined in the fourth section. The fifth section is designated for
    an empirical investigation into the adopted strategy, underscoring the attained
    results. Subsequently, in the sixth section, a detailed interpretation of these
    findings is presented, demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed method in
    comparison to alternative models. Notably, limitations inherent in the approach
    are explicitly addressed, encompassing potential challenges, drawbacks, and constraints
    specifically related to the use of WSNs within this context. Additionally, the
    discussion encompasses prospective avenues for future research and enhancements,
    unveiling opportunities for further advancement. Finally, the conclusion section
    encapsulates the research outcomes and insights gained. 2 Literal Review 2.1 Position
    of WSN Over Models Agriculture is undergoing a significant transformation owing
    to technological advancements, with wireless sensor networks (WSNs) emerging as
    a critical tool for precision farming. This review aims to comprehensively analyze
    the role, challenges, and potential of WSNs in smart fault detection within agricultural
    systems. WSNs have revolutionized agriculture by enabling real-time monitoring
    of crucial environmental parameters. These sensor nodes, strategically positioned
    across fields, collect data on soil moisture, temperature, humidity, and plant
    health indicators. Their integration with IoT technologies facilitates seamless
    data transmission and analysis, empowering farmers with actionable insights for
    informed decision-making [4, 5]. Despite their potential, the deployment of WSNs
    in agriculture presents several challenges. Power management, data accuracy, network
    scalability, and interoperability among heterogeneous sensor nodes remain primary
    concerns. Moreover, environmental factors such as signal interference, harsh weather
    conditions, and geographical obstacles pose hurdles in maintaining reliable connectivity.
    As technological framework, advancements in sensor technology, data analytics,
    and machine learning algorithms have propelled the capabilities of WSNs in fault
    detection. Innovations in sensor miniaturization, energy-efficient designs, and
    data processing techniques have enhanced their reliability and accuracy in identifying
    anomalies, diseases, and irrigation issues in crops. Further more, as application
    and benefits, WSNs offer multifaceted benefits in agriculture. They optimize resource
    use by providing precise and localized information, thereby reducing water and
    fertilizer wastage. Early fault detection facilitates timely intervention, mitigating
    crop losses and improving overall yield. Additionally, these systems promote sustainable
    farming practices by minimizing environmental impact through targeted and optimized
    agricultural interventions. Thus, WSN play a pivotal role in agricultural fault
    detection and can be positioned in relation to various strategies commonly used
    in this domain. In Rule-Based Systems, WSN takes a complementary position. It
    can gather real-time data from agricultural fields or equipment, providing continuous
    input for rule-based systems. The WSN feeds data to these systems, enabling the
    application of predefined rules for fault detection based on the collected sensor
    information [6, 7]. In Statistical Analysis, WSN takes an integral component position.
    It provides the necessary data for statistical analysis by continuously collecting
    and transmitting sensor data. The sensor nodes contribute real-time data streams
    that form the basis for establishing statistical models to identify anomalies
    or deviations from normal patterns [8]. In Machine Learning Algorithms, WSN takes
    a fundamental component position. It serves as the primary data collection infrastructure
    for machine learning algorithms. The continuous data streams from sensor nodes
    are used to train and update machine learning models for fault detection, providing
    the necessary input for adaptive learning and pattern recognition. In Fusion of
    Multiple Techniques, WSN has an enabling component position. It acts as the backbone
    for collecting multi-source data necessary for integrating multiple fault detection
    techniques. It provides diverse sensor data, facilitating the fusion and integration
    of rule-based, statistical, and machine learning strategies for comprehensive
    fault detection. In IoT-Enabled Smart Sensors, WSN has an integral component position.
    It consists of smart sensors equipped with communication capabilities, forming
    the basis for real-time monitoring and data transmission essential for fault detection
    in agriculture [9, 10]. In Blockchain-Enabled Systems, WSN has a data source position.
    It contributes to blockchain-enabled systems by providing the data that needs
    to be securely stored and authenticated. It generates the sensor data, which can
    be securely stored on the blockchain to ensure data integrity and traceability.
    In Long-Range Wireless Technologies (LoRa), WSN takes an infrastructure position.
    It leverages long-range wireless technologies for communication between sensor
    nodes and gateways. These technologies serve as the communication infrastructure
    within WSNs, facilitating long-range data transmission from remote agricultural
    areas [11, 12]. Comparing the WSN approach with existing fault detection techniques
    in agriculture involves highlighting the advantages of WSNs over traditional methods
    or other contemporary technologies. Below, an analysis showcasing how WSN approach
    excels in comparison to existing techniques: For Real-Time Monitoring and Timely
    Detection: WSNs enable continuous, real-time monitoring of agricultural parameters.
    They offer immediate fault detection upon deviation from predefined thresholds
    or abnormal patterns, reducing response time and potential losses. Whereas, traditional
    methods, such as manual inspections, periodic checks, or testing equipment, often
    lack real-time monitoring capabilities. They might result in delayed fault detection,
    leading to increased downtime and losses [13]. For Data-Driven Precision and Accuracy:
    WSNs collect and analyze a vast amount of data from multiple sensors, facilitating
    precise fault detection through machine learning algorithms and data fusion techniques.
    This leads to accurate fault identification and reduces false positives or negatives.
    However, some existing techniques rely on simple rules or manual inspections,
    which might lack the depth of analysis or the ability to adapt to complex fault
    patterns, potentially resulting in less accurate detections. Concerning Cost Efficiency
    and Resource Optimization: while initial setup costs for WSNs might be higher,
    they offer long-term cost efficiency by minimizing losses through early fault
    detection, optimizing resource utilization (water, fertilizers, predictive harvesting),
    and reducing manual labor requirements over time. While, traditional methods might
    incur higher labor costs due to manual inspections or require periodic testing
    equipment maintenance, potentially leading to higher operational expenses in the
    long run. About the Scalability and Flexibility: WSNs are scalable and adaptable.
    Additional sensors can be integrated easily into the network, offering flexibility
    in expanding coverage or integrating new sensors for evolving fault detection
    needs. Unlike, some traditional methods might face limitations in scalability,
    especially when relying on manual labor or fixed testing equipment, making it
    challenging to adapt to changing agricultural requirements or expanding operations.
    For Comprehensive Fault Detection and Decision Support: the integration of diverse
    fault detection techniques within WSNs, such as machine learning, statistical
    analysis, and real-time data fusion, offers a comprehensive approach. This enables
    informed decision-making and actionable insights for farmers or stakeholders.
    But, other methods from existing techniques might lack the comprehensive nature
    of WSNs, focusing on specific fault types or lacking the ability to provide holistic
    insights based on real-time, multi-parameter data [14, 15]. Some stations highlighting
    the development and application of WSN in remote fault detection are mentioned
    below. From early 2000s: the concept of WSNs begins to emerge with the development
    of early sensor nodes like Telos, Mica, and Tmote Sky. The Support Vector Machines
    (SVM) as Machine Learning Models gain traction for classification tasks due to
    their effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data. From mid-2000s: creation
    of IEEE 802.15.4 Standard. The standardization of low-rate wireless personal area
    networks (LR-WPANs) lays the foundation for the development of WSNs for various
    applications, including agriculture. Decision tree-based models and ensemble methods
    like Random Forests gain popularity for their ability to handle classification
    tasks and interpretability [16]. From late 2000s to early 2010s: WSNs start being
    adopted in precision agriculture, focusing on soil monitoring, weather forecasting,
    and crop health assessment. Deep learning approaches, particularly neural networks,
    see a resurgence due to advancements in computational power and data availability.
    From mid-2010s: the integration of WSNs with the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem
    becomes prevalent, enabling seamless data collection, processing, and analysis
    from agricultural sensors. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) and its variants (e.g.
    XGBoost, LightGBM) gain attention for their superior performance in classification
    and regression tasks [16, 17]. From late 2010s to early 2020s: increased adoption
    of cloud-based platforms for data storage, processing, and scalability in handling
    large volumes of sensor data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), especially long
    short-term memory (LSTM) networks, gain prominence for time-series analysis and
    prediction in agriculture, considering temporal dependencies in sensor data. Actually,
    recent developments focus on developing machine learning models that offer interpretability
    and explainability, such as Explainable AI (XAI), in detecting faults to aid decision-making
    in farming practices. Federated Learning explores federated learning techniques
    to train models collaboratively across different agricultural sites while preserving
    data privacy and security [18]. From another horizon, integrating blockchain technology
    into the realm of agricultural equipment and irrigation systems, especially concerning
    fault detection and data management, offers several potential benefits. Blockchain
    provides a tamper-proof and immutable ledger, ensuring the integrity of data collected
    by sensors in agricultural equipment. This feature prevents unauthorized alterations
    or manipulations, ensuring the authenticity of fault detection records.Through
    blockchain, every change or transaction recorded within the system can be traced
    back to its origin. This traceability can be valuable for tracking the history
    of faults detected in equipment or changes in irrigation systems over time. Blockchain''s
    decentralized nature enables secure data storage across multiple nodes, reducing
    the risk of a single point of failure and enhancing data security. Blockchain
    can facilitate controlled and permissioned access to sensor data. Authorized stakeholders,
    including farmers, agronomists, and maintenance personnel, can securely access
    specific data relevant to their roles. Smart contracts, self-executing contracts
    with predefined conditions, can automate tasks triggered by fault detections.
    For instance, when a fault is identified in an irrigation system, a smart contract
    could automatically trigger a maintenance request or adjust irrigation settings
    based on predefined parameters. Blockchain''s transparency can aid in tracking
    agricultural equipment and components throughout their lifecycle. This transparency
    ensures authenticity and reliability in the supply chain, allowing farmers to
    verify the origin and authenticity of equipment [19]. Implementing tokenization
    through blockchain could incentivize stakeholders for efficient equipment maintenance
    or early fault reporting. This system can reward participants with tokens or digital
    assets for contributing valuable data or maintaining equipment in optimal conditions.
    Blockchain can facilitate interoperability between different agricultural systems
    and platforms, allowing seamless integration of data from various sources. Standardization
    of data formats can enhance compatibility and collaboration among different stakeholders
    and systems. Blockchain-enabled systems can track environmental impact data associated
    with agricultural practices, including water usage, energy consumption, and carbon
    emissions. This transparency can help in adopting more sustainable and environmentally
    friendly practices [20]. Integrating blockchain technology into fault detection
    in agricultural equipment and irrigation systems requires careful consideration
    of implementation challenges such as scalability, interoperability, and regulatory
    compliance. However, leveraging blockchain''s inherent features can significantly
    enhance the security, transparency, and efficiency of fault detection processes
    in agriculture. According to the above descriptions, we have chosen to design
    an agricultural fault detection system based on a Delta-hybridization between
    WSN wireless sensor nodes, Block-chain and a Deep learning classifier ERSOM model
    that stands for Evolutionary Recurrent Self Organizing Map. 2.2 Node Principle
    A Node represents an autonomous real time computational system. It receives the
    signals through its integrated sensors and processes them using a Digital Signal
    Processor DSP. A sensor is a fundamental part of Smart technologies that functions
    as a transducer using various effects like capacitive or inductive (magnetic).
    A set of sensors, forming a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), collaborate autonomously
    to monitor and communicate information regarding potential issues. These autonomous
    microsystems communicate wirelessly in a designated space, known as a collector
    field. Nodes, equipped with high-end sensors, organize themselves into a self-structured
    topology, transmitting collected data to an information system or processing center,
    potentially via specialized nodes called “sinks.” Energy constraints, typically
    from small batteries, underscore the importance of managing energy as a critical
    resource in sensor nodes, making WSN technology pervasive and adaptable across
    diverse domains. In general, wireless sensors typically consist of various components
    including capture, processing, communication, and energy units. Depending on the
    application, additional elements like Global Positioning System GPS for environmental
    tracking or solar-powered mobility systems can be integrated. The resilience of
    WSN heavily relies on sensor material quality and precision. Despite their small
    size, nodes feature an efficient architecture incorporating multiple circuits
    on a single board, comprising detection units, microcontrollers, RF-antennas,
    and power units [21]. Further details on the internal structure of a node are
    depicted in Fig. 1. Fig. 1 Architecture of wireless sensor node Full size image
    The detection unit comprises a set of sensors to assess information reliability
    from the environment; in case of sensor failure, it ensures data integrity. Sensor
    outputs link to the processing unit via anti-aliasing filters and an ADC for compatibility.
    This unit functions as the node''s core, managing internal operations, fault detection,
    energy, and coordination among WSN nodes'' processors. ROM and RAM storage support
    processing instructions, communication programs, and collected data. An RF antenna
    circuit enables communication between nodes, while the power unit''s lifespan
    relies on limited resources. External flash memory expands applications limited
    by chip memory, and internal I/O buses ease component communication within the
    node. An RF antenna is integrated at the node''s extremity. 3 Adopted Approach
    Our idea is to design a remote agricultural fault detection model offering better
    reliability and efficiency than those established by existing methods. This approach
    is based on the Delta-Hybridization between WSN wireless sensor nodes, Block-chain
    and a Deep learning classifier ERSOM model that stands for Evolutionary Recurrent
    Self Organizing Map. This last model represents the pivot of the analysis of the
    signals received by sensors. It revolves around a recurrent evolutionary algorithm
    of a self-organizing neural map with unsupervised learning, giving the possibility
    of processing a large volume of data. Recurrence is applied to this neural map
    in order to integrate the dynamic temporal aspect by adapting it to the ability
    to process and evaluate dynamic and not static data information. The fault detection
    and recognition algorithm carried out by this recurrent neural map will subsequently
    be considered a nucleus or an individual of population of iterations supported
    by an evolutionary genetic algorithm ensuring the extension of the search space.
    This insight allows to optimize results and avoid being trapped in an optimal
    static state. This algorithm will be managed by the DSP Mounted on the Sensor
    Node card. This algorithm will be managed by the DSP Mounted on the Sensor Node
    card. The processing result will be carried out based on a comparison between
    the primitives and singularities of the signal received from the system to be
    controlled and the data characterizing all types of faults from an archived database
    and updated at each event at the level of the Block-chain to which it is linked.
    This result will be broadcast in real time through the WSN to a master node linked
    by an HMI interface. The Blockchain and WSN models are detailed previously. The
    following Fig. 2 offers a view on the adopted strategy. Fig. 2 Typical used wireless
    sensor network Full size image RTU stands for remote terminal unit; terminal Node
    mounted on the system to be controlled. MTU stands for master terminal unit; terminal
    Node linked to human–machine interface HMI. The proposed terminal wireless sensor
    node RTU comprises capture, processing, communication, and energy units. The Sensing
    unit includes a physical capture device for local environment data and an Analog
    to Digital Converter (ADC) transforming analog signals into digital ones interpreted
    by the microcontroller. Memories store information from the capture unit. The
    communication unit, known as the Transceiver unit, handles wireless data transmission
    and reception. It can be optical, as in Smart Dust Nodes, or radiofrequency-based,
    with optical communication being robust against electrical interference but requiring
    a direct line of sight. Radio frequency units include modulation, demodulation,
    filtering, and multiplexing circuits. Sensor nodes equipped with various sensors,
    e.g., temperature, humidity, soil moisture, pH sensors, relevant to agricultural
    monitoring. These sensor nodes are distributed across the agricultural area, collecting
    real-time data continuously from the environment such as soil moisture levels,
    temperature variations, humidity, and other relevant parameters related to crop
    health and equipment status. Sensor nodes communicate wirelessly with each other
    and with a central base station or gateway, called sink, using communication protocols
    such as Long Range transmission LoRa. Wireless communication allows the collected
    data to be transmitted over extended distances to a centralized location for further
    processing and analysis. Data collected from various sensor nodes is aggregated
    and transmitted to a centralized system or cloud-based platform. In this centralized
    system, the received data undergoes processing, analysis, and storage for fault
    detection and decision-making. Advanced data analytics and machine learning algorithms
    are applied to the collected data to identify patterns, anomalies, or deviations
    from normal conditions. These algorithms analyze sensor data to detect potential
    faults in agricultural equipment, irrigation systems, or anomalies in environmental
    parameters that could affect crop health. Once anomalies or faults are detected
    through data analysis, the system generates alerts or notifications to relevant
    stakeholders, farmers, agronomists, maintenance personnel, for timely intervention.
    Early warning systems or automated alerts enable proactive maintenance, minimizing
    the impact of faults on agricultural operations. It is important to highlight
    that the ERSOM neural model''s learning phase on an agricultural systems fault
    database might take several hours and can reach one day. The duration depends
    on factors such as the database size, model topology, neuron count, learning iterations,
    and stopping criteria. Once the model has learned and becomes proficient in identifying
    these faults, its real-time testing phase will be instantaneous during system
    control. The signal processing steps for the controlled part proceed as follows:
    Firstly, filtering, windowing, and segmenting the signal to extract primitives
    defining the contained information. Various methods define these primitives, such
    as the Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) matrix. However, our approach
    opts for determining the primitives as Bi-spectrum matrices, as they are well-suited
    for characterizing highly transient stochastic signals. Thus, the Bi-spectrum
    designates an autocorrelation of order 2, called moment of order 2. Namely that
    the cross correlation is the measure of the analogy between two signals according
    to a time shift applied to one of them. One of the signals will be the signal
    measured by the sensors and the other signal is that of the database as a reference.
    The autocorrelation goes deeper to determine the coefficients of similarities
    between the measured signal and the reference one which resembles it better among
    the samples of signals in the database as a reference. The Bi-spectrum, as an
    autocorrelation of order 2, goes even deeper to be like a more selective filter
    in the determination of the similarity coefficients to a very precise default
    sample. Each matrix of bispectrum coefficients will be concatinated vertically
    in order to reduce it into a line vector, without loss of characteristics, which
    represents the input to our ERSOM model. It will be processed quickly to visualize
    the type of defects on one of the neurons, if any. The computation of the bi-spectral
    coefficients will be performed in the following manner: We examine a discrete
    signal x(n) obtained from the motor-pump machine, with a mean of zero and considered
    a locally stationary random process. The signal''s length, denoted as N, ranges
    from 0 to. N − 1. The expression for its autocorrelation function is as follows:
    $$ R_{xx} (m) = E\\left\\{ {x(n)x(n + m)} \\right\\} $$ (1) The calculated \\({\\text{E}}\\left\\{
    \\cdot \\right\\}\\), known as the mathematical expectation, represents the average
    within a set, serving as a statistical function with a discrete time-delay denoted
    as m. It is also referred to as the second-order moment. If the two signals are
    not correlated, we have the autocorrelation R = 0. In case of resemblance we obtain
    simularity coefficients. The Power Spectrum PS is determined by applying the Fourier
    transform (FT) to the preceding formula [22]. $$ P_{xx} (f) = \\sum\\limits_{m
    = - \\infty }^{ + \\infty } {R_{xx} (m)} \\,e^{ - j2\\pi fm} $$ (2) An alternalive
    formula can be used. $$ P_{xx} (f) = E\\left\\{ {X(f)X^{ * } (f)} \\right\\} =
    E\\left\\{ {\\left| {X(f)^{2} } \\right|} \\right\\} $$ (3) X* represents the
    conjugate of X(f), which computes the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of our
    primary current signal to be controlled, x(n). $$ X(f) = \\sum\\limits_{n = 0}^{N
    - 1} {x(n)} \\,e^{{ - j\\frac{2\\pi fn}{N}}} $$ (4) Additionally, we derive the
    bispectrum, referred to as bispectral density B(f1, f2), by applying a transform
    function (TF) to the third-order moment depicted in the equation below. $$ M_{3}^{x}
    (k,l) = E\\left\\{ {x^{ * } (n)x(n + k)x(n + l)} \\right\\}. $$ (5) The parameters
    k and l represent time delay points. Essentially, we need to estimate the expected
    bispectrum values from limited data using the following formula. $$ \\begin{aligned}
    \\hat{B}(f_{1} ,f_{2} ) & = \\frac{1}{M}\\sum\\limits_{k = 1}^{M} {X_{k} (f_{1}
    )X_{k} (f_{2} )X_{k}^{ * } (f_{1} + f_{2} )} \\\\ & \\approx E\\left\\{ {X(f_{1}
    )X(f_{2} )X^{ * } (f_{1} + f_{2} )} \\right\\} \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ (6) The
    sensor detects the fault signal x(n), which is subsequently processed by the processor
    within the suitable WSN node. This calculation involves setting f1 and f2 to an
    identical value, denoted as f, and is expressed as: $$ \\hat{B}(f_{1} ,f_{2} )\\left|
    {_{{f_{1} = f_{2} = f}} } \\right. = \\hat{D}(f) \\approx E\\left\\{ {X^{2} (f)X^{
    * } (2f)} \\right\\}. $$ (7) As exemple, considering a fracture defect in the
    bars of a motor-pump rotor estimated from research to constitute 10% of potential
    defects. The features of BRB related to this specific failure type include frequency
    components defined by the following Eq. (8) [22, 23]. $$ f_{BRB} = \\left[ {\\left(
    \\frac{k}{p} \\right)\\left( {1 - s} \\right) \\pm s} \\right]f_{s} $$ (8) Observing
    that the supply frequency is denoted by fs, the number of pole pairs by p, k represents
    a constant proportionality, and s signifies the rotor magnetic slip. Given the
    effects of speed ripple, it''s plausible that supplementary frequency components
    might appear in the stator current spectrum. Hence, an additional Eq. (9) could
    identify these components. $$ f_{BRBs} = (1 \\pm 2ks)f_{s} $$ (9) To identify
    rotor faults through its connected WSN node, analysis of the side-band frequency
    components at (1 ± 2 s)fs has been conducted. We establish that the lower sideband
    represents the primary fault frequency, while the upper sideband signifies the
    harmonic frequency of certain resultant velocity fluctuations. Consequently, we
    can use these two distinct values as effective control factors. To create a singular
    factor, we calculate their average, as shown below. $$ I_{dB} = \\left[ {20\\log_{10}
    \\left( {\\frac{{I_{l} }}{I}} \\right) + 20\\log_{10} \\left( {\\frac{{I_{r} }}{I}}
    \\right)} \\right]/2 $$ (10) Namely, I1 represents the fault module, Ir signifies
    the rotor current module, which is depicted by the upper sideband, and I represents
    the stator current module as the fundamental. Additionally, the stator current
    related to a mechanical BRB fault can be mathematically depicted. This model characterizes
    the stator current concerning electrical asymmetries in the rotor, generating
    what are known as sideband frequencies, expressed by the equation. $$ \\begin{aligned}
    i_{a} (t) & = i_{f} \\cos (\\omega t - \\varphi ) + \\sum\\limits_{k} {i_{l,k}
    } \\cos ((\\omega - \\omega_{f,k} )t - \\varphi_{l,k} ) \\\\ & \\quad + \\sum\\limits_{k}
    {i_{r,k} } \\cos ((\\omega + \\omega_{f,k} )t - \\varphi_{r,k} ) \\\\ \\end{aligned}
    $$ (11) where fs is the fundamental frequency of the electrical power. As \\(\\omega_{f,k}
    = 2ks\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega = 2\\pi f_{s}\\), the above expression will be:
    $$ \\begin{aligned} i_{a} (t) & = i_{f} \\cos (2\\pi f_{s} t - \\varphi ) + \\sum\\limits_{k}
    {i_{l,k} } \\cos (2\\pi f_{l,k} t - \\varphi_{l,k} ) \\\\ & \\quad + \\sum\\limits_{k}
    {i_{r,k} } \\cos (2\\pi f_{r,k} t - \\varphi_{r,k} ) \\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ (12)
    The separated formula of the controlled current signal will undergo processing
    by the node''s microcontroller. It will then be compared to a healthy signal used
    as a reference to detect faults in machines.This procedure involves applying a
    transform function to the aforementioned equation to obtain the subsequent spectral
    relationship. $$ \\begin{aligned} I_{a} (f) & = \\frac{{i_{f} }}{2}\\delta (f
    - f_{s} )e^{j\\varphi } + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum\\limits_{k}^{{}} {i_{l,k} \\delta
    (f - f_{l,k} )e^{{j\\varphi_{l,k} }} } \\\\ & \\quad + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum\\limits_{k}^{{}}
    {i_{r,k} \\delta (f - f_{r,k} )e^{{j\\varphi_{r,k} }} } . \\\\ \\end{aligned}
    $$ (13) This mathematical model allows for further breakdown into basic elements,
    which are easily comprehensible for the WSN Node''s processor to handle [24].
    $$ \\begin{aligned} B(f_{1} ,f_{2} ) & = I_{a} (f_{1} )I_{a} (f_{2} )I_{a}^{ *

    \\end{aligned} $$ (14) Next, a numerical example simulation will be conducted
    to generate the bi-spectrum. The description of the experimental stator current
    is outlined as follows: $$ i_{a} (t) = i_{f} \\cos (2\\pi f_{s} t - \\varphi )
    + i_{l,1} \\cos (2\\pi f_{l,1} t - \\varphi_{l,1} ) + i_{r,1} \\cos (2\\pi f_{r,1}
    t - \\varphi_{r,1} ) $$ (15) Upon carefully selecting various parameter values
    from the preceding equation, the processor within the WSN Node of the respective
    machine, following the requested information routing at the collection node level,
    enables us to visualize curves labeled accordingly for power spectrum and bispectrum,
    depicted in Fig. 3. Fig. 3 Power spectrum PS and bi-spectrum of a node received
    signal [24] Full size image While this proposed approach offers significant advantages
    in agricultural fault detection, it is not without limitations. Overcoming these
    limitations and planning for future enhancements are pivotal to optimize WSN efficacy
    in agriculture. The constraints include issues such as limited battery life and
    energy consumption, data security and privacy concerns, scalability challenges,
    data management complexities, sensor accuracy reliability, implementation costs,
    and the need for interdisciplinary knowledge integration. To address these, advancements
    in low-power sensor technologies, robust encryption, improved scalability, efficient
    data processing, enhanced sensor reliability, cost-effective solutions, and interdisciplinary
    collaborations are essential. By focusing on technological advancements, refined
    protocols, and collaborative endeavors, WSNs can become more efficient, reliable,
    cost-effective, and user-friendly, ensuring widespread adoption and seamless integration
    into agricultural practices. A techno-economic study shows that implementing Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSNs) in agriculture offers multifaceted advantages, but a comprehensive
    cost–benefit analysis compared to traditional fault detection methods is essential
    to ascertain their overall value. Examining the cost–benefit analysis reveals
    numerous benefits of WSNs in agriculture, such as enhanced precision and efficiency
    in monitoring parameters, real-time data collection enabling timely interventions,
    reduced labor and operational costs, optimized resource utilization, and early
    fault detection capabilities. However, implementing WSNs involves costs related
    to hardware, installation, maintenance, and data management. When compared to
    traditional methods, WSNs showcase superior accuracy, cost efficiency in the long
    run, scalability, comprehensive coverage, and adaptability to changing agricultural
    needs. Despite the higher initial investment, WSNs prove to be more efficient,
    minimizing losses, optimizing resources, and offering real-time, accurate data
    for improved productivity and sustainability in agriculture. In a simplified qualitative
    perspective, WSNs exhibit higher accuracy, real-time capabilities, scalability,
    and potential for cost reduction over time, leading to a moderately high to high
    techno-economic score, whereas traditional methods may offer lower initial costs
    but could result in increased long-term operational expenses and potential losses,
    resulting in a moderate to low techno-economic score. 4 Experiment Results The
    experimental setup consists of the following components: A three-phase induction
    machine under the control of an ‘OMRON’ inverter. The rotor shaft is linked to
    a DC generator, connected to a rheostat for load control. Characteristics of the
    induction machine include: Nominal power: 4 kW Nominal speed: 1480 rpm Moment
    of inertia: J = 0.013 kg m2 Number of stove pairs: P = 2 SKF 6208 ball bearing
    with mechanical rotational frequencies: outer ring (fbext = 89.4 Hz), inner ring
    (fbint = 136 Hz), ball cage (fc = 9.94 Hz), and ball frequency (fbille = 58.4
    Hz). Using a Micro-log portable terminal for acquiring and storing sensor measurements.
    The sensor used is a piezoelectric accelerometer. The entire test bench is defined
    by Fig. 4 below. Fig. 4 Experimental bench Full size image Our ERSOM fault classification
    model was trained using an energetically balanced, locally developed database.
    This database comprises 100 signal samples obtained from the test bench, representing
    diverse failures such as mechanical, electrical, vibration, thermal, and physical
    issues, accompanying the normal signal. The neuron map consists of 100 neurons,
    and the ERSOM model was trained with a stopping criterion after 1000 iterations.
    Subsequently, during the control and testing phase, the ERSOM model analyzed the
    stator signal received from the machine, specifically depicting a mechanical fault
    in the ball bearing. The resulting output of the ERSOM model visualized the topology
    showcased in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 Visualization of the inner ring failure over ERSOM
    model Full size image The topology depicted by ERSOM revealed the presence of
    a ball bearing fault indicated by the frequency Fbi. This fault is accurately
    defined within the inner ring and is constrained by the cutoff harmonics Fn1 and
    Fn2, situated close to the Best Matching Unit (BMU) neuron linked to the fault.
    Additionally, further examination reveals the presence of the reasoning frequency
    Fre generated by the primary fault. Tthe character ‘h’ indicates a healthy signal.
    We plot the spectral amplitude of the processed signal and observe the curve in
    Fig. 6. Fig. 6 Spectrum of the inner ring failure Full size image The main fault
    occupies a frequency of 680 Hz and the two harmonics are present with a difference
    on either side of 25 Hz. This implies that Fn1 has a frequency of 655 Hz and Fn2
    is at a frequency of 705 Hz. In the same way we can see the curve which defines
    the bi-spectrum of the same machine when it is requested by the same frequencies
    of a failure, as shown in Fig. 7. Fig. 7 The bi-spectrum of the inner ring failure
    Full size image Furthermore, using Bi-Spectrum analysis will aid in discerning
    the severity of faults. Referring to Fig. 7, it becomes apparent that the encountered
    peaks are extremely abrupt and lack any frequency breadth. In the same way, the
    rules determining the performance criteria of the fault classifier models which
    qualify the operation of the WSN Nodes are established as follows: a. Accuracy:
    measures the overall correctness of the model''s predictions. Its formula is expressed
    as follows [25, 26]: $$ {\\mathbf{Ac}} = \\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{TN}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{TN}} + {\\text{FP}} + {\\text{FN}}} \\right)
    $$ (16) where TP = True Positives, TN = True Negatives, FP = False Positives,
    FN = False Negatives. Accuracy gives the ratio of correctly predicted instances
    to the total instances in the dataset. b. Precision: indicates the ratio of correctly
    predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations.
    It has the following formula: $$ \\Pr = {\\text{TP}}/\\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{FP}}}
    \\right) $$ (17) Precision focuses on the accuracy of positive predictions and
    indicates the model''s ability to avoid false positives. c. Recall (Sensitivity
    or True Positive Rate): Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations
    to all actual positives. It is defined by the following formula: $$ {\\mathbf{Recall}}
    = {\\text{TP}}/\\left( {{\\text{TP}} + {\\text{FN}}} \\right) $$ (18) Recall measures
    the model''s ability to identify all relevant instances, showing its sensitivity
    to true positives. d. F1-score: F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and
    recall. It provides a balance between precision and recall. It is calculated using
    the following formula: $$ {\\text{F1-score}} = 2*\\left( {{\\text{Precision}}*{\\text{Recall}}}
    \\right)/\\left( {{\\text{Precision}} + {\\text{Recall}}} \\right) $$ (19) F1-score
    considers both false positives and false negatives and is useful when the class
    distribution is imbalanced. The obtained indicators are presented in Table 1.
    Table 1 Evaluation of classifier models Full size table These findings are highlighted
    by the Fig. 8 represented in below. Wherein, It is remarkable that the proposed
    ERSOM model is clearly advantageous compared to other models. Fig. 8 Performance
    of different classifier models Full size image Based on the Fig. 8 curve, it''s
    evident that neural models, particularly the dynamic model RSOM and the evolutionary
    model ERSOM, hold superior positions in performance compared to others. Nonetheless,
    it''s worth noting that SVM has the potential to surpass both the Kmeans moving
    center algorithm and the static SOM model in terms of performance. 5 Results Discussion
    The ERSOM deep learning model’s topology, Fig. 5, reveals that among the 100 neurons,
    merely 2 neurons remain unoccupied. This signifies an impressive defect identification
    rate of 98% using this model. Thus, it offers a precise objective evaluation with
    a well-defined visualization. The ERSOM map identifies the anomaly on the inner
    ring, delineated by the frequency fbi signified by the winning neuron. Adjacent
    neurons signal frequencies fn1 and fn2, representing fbi + fc and fbi–fc, respectively.
    The indicator fre denotes the resonance frequency of the induction machine''s
    structure. The curve depicted in Fig. 6 represents the spectral amplitude of the
    signal under examination, which help us in mechanical inner ring defect identification.
    However, this assessment remains subjective and lacks defined scores for evaluation.
    The spectrum illustrated in the same Fig. 6, depicting the vibration signal from
    the sensor, discloses the following insights: The amplitude evolution of harmonic
    components follows a pattern such as (555 + k25) Hz, where k = 0, 1, 2, 3, …,
    representing frequencies resulting from the ball''s passage on the indentation.
    A substantial increase in amplitudes, approximately 100 dB around 780 Hz, signifies
    the resonance of the structure, possibly attributed to the 31st harmonic resonance
    of rotation (780.2/25 = 31.2). The identification of the 5th order harmonic (680.2/136 = 5)
    reveals the presence of a mechanical anomaly in the inner ring when observed in
    the spectrum''s zoomed mode. The Bi-spectrum plotted in Fig. 7 distinctly illustrates
    a resemblance to the outcomes presented in the ERSOM topology depicted in Fig.
    5. This similarity indicates that the ERSOM model, trained and tested using Bi-spectrum
    coefficients, aligns closely with the observed results. Consequently, this correlation
    strongly substantiates the accuracy and validity of the ERSOM deep learning model
    employed to steer the WSN Node. As depicted in Fig. 8, it''s evident that the
    ERSOM deep learning evolutionary model stands out significantly due to its efficiency
    compared to other models. This superiority is attributed to its integration of
    three essential criteria: evolutionaryism for broadening the search space, dynamism
    facilitated by a loop of recurrence that incorporates temporal aspects, and a
    neuronal aspect that mimics human thought processes. However, it''s important
    to note that this proposed model demands considerably more time during its unsupervised
    learning phase. Moreover, diverse outcomes arise from various fault detection
    strategies in agriculture: Rule-Based Systems: Swift fault identification using
    predefined rules, as seen in detecting irrigation system faults. Statistical Analysis:
    Identification of anomalies or outliers in soil moisture data, suggesting potential
    system issues. Machine Learning Algorithms: Improved accuracy in spotting subtle
    changes in crop health, aiding in early disease detection. Fusion of Multiple
    Techniques: Enhanced precision by combining strategies like rule-based systems
    and machine learning for fault detection. IoT-Enabled Smart Sensors: Real-time
    monitoring and rapid identification of temperature fluctuations, indicating potential
    crop damage. Blockchain-Enabled Systems: Ensuring secure and traceable records
    of fault detection through blockchain technology. Note that, Zigbee finds common
    usage in home automation, industrial control systems, and healthcare due to its
    cost-effectiveness and low power consumption. Meanwhile, Bluetooth enjoys widespread
    adoption in consumer electronics such as smartphones, audio devices, and wearables
    owing to its user-friendly nature and compatibility. The Internet serves various
    sectors, encompassing communication, commerce, cloud services, and IoT applications.
    Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) excel in environmental monitoring, agriculture,
    and healthcare, offering real-time data collection from distant areas. Notably,
    WSN tends to have lower data rates but can cover extensive distances, while the
    Internet exhibits high return on investment ROI potential, particularly in business,
    communication, and data services. Comparably, Wireless Sensor Networks WSN technology
    can have a strong ROI in industries like environmental monitoring, healthcare,
    and agriculture due to their ability to gather data from remote or hazardous locations.
    However, using WSN for fault detection in agriculture encounters key challenges
    such as: Limited access to power sources in remote areas affects device lifespan
    and functionality. Varied landscapes impede signal transmission, affecting accuracy.
    Environmental factors impact sensor accuracy, requiring regular calibration. Efficiently
    handling large data volumes poses computational challenges. High deployment costs
    in vast agricultural areas need a balance for effectiveness. Security and protecting
    sensitive data during transmission is critical. Adapting WSN with existing systems
    is complex, requiring compatibility measures. As avenues for future research and
    improvements to reveal opportunities for further progress, we point out that advancements
    in sensor technology, energy efficiency, and tailored algorithms are crucial to
    overcome these challenges, realizing WSN''s full potential in precise agriculture
    fault detection. 6 Conclusion The WSNs are actually widely applicable in major
    emerging technology. We expressed, in this topic, the ability of the proposed
    Wireless Sensor Node strategy, which becomes a smart powerful tool in remote monitoring
    condition. Our approach is enriched by using the higher order spectrum called
    Bi-spectrum in primitive extraction and analysis of controled signal over an evolutionary
    recurrent self organizing deep learning model ERSOM. This model is implemented
    on the DSP of a Wireless Node Card. Our adopted approach is based on the Delta-Hybridization
    between WSN wireless sensor nodes, Block-chain and a Deep learning classifier
    ERSOM model to overcome some limitations and challenges experienced by traditional
    techniques. The practical application of this method for detecting agricultural
    defects demonstrates its resilience in analyzing these issues and making real-time
    decisions, showcasing promising results in comparison to current techniques. However,
    there are additional paths for further advancement in the future. Data Availability

    resource management 1. Introduction Concerns about water supply and quality have
    been a constant focus in human development. Currently, especially in developed
    countries, there is a significant emphasis on the sanitary and overall quality
    aspects of water. Various regulations establish the criteria to be followed in
    water supply [1]. The consumption of water on our planet has tripled in the 20th
    century, attributed to factors such as continuous population growth, water poverty,
    poor management, and outdated or inadequate facilities, contributing to a global
    water crisis. Consequently, water resources are becoming increasingly expensive
    and scarce, fueling a strong interest in their effective control and efficient
    use. Across various sectors, from industry to agriculture, extensive efforts are
    being made to monitor water distribution networks [2]. To address this significant
    challenge, distribution networks need to become more efficient by reducing losses,
    and consumers must also play a role in decreasing their water consumption. In
    the energy sector, studies and actions have already been undertaken to enhance
    the functioning of related facilities [3]. The substantial user base leads to
    a continuously rising water consumption, necessitating precise control mechanisms,
    despite the high costs associated with installing multiple monitoring instruments
    and their corresponding actuators [4]. Measurement devices often malfunction,
    leading to interventions based on lower-quality data. While studies on urban water
    consumption in broad areas have been conducted [5], research on specific buildings
    is scarce. For individual buildings, the LEED certification (Leadership in Energy
    and Environmental Design) is frequently employed, sought after by many businesses
    in their business plans [6]. Consumption signatures are used to identify the individual
    consumption of each device [7], enabling the identification of more complex consumption
    patterns. Such algorithms have successfully been applied in public buildings for
    energy use rationalization [8]. The role of the Internet of Things (IoT) in water
    supply chain management is crucial for understanding the future trajectory at
    the intersection of computer science and resource management [9]. Actuators play
    a vital role in enabling the automation of various smart city services [10]. The
    primary goal of this study is to scrutinize the entire body of scientific literature
    pertaining to smart water meters on a global scale, emphasizing the significance
    of understanding research trends in this domain. 2. Materials and Methods This
    bibliometric study utilized Scopus databases as the primary source for data retrieval.
    Despite Scopus containing historical content dating back to 1788, the search was
    restricted to the period between 2000 and 2022. The research methodology encompasses
    a comprehensive approach involving data collection, preprocessing, and multifaceted
    analysis to unveil and comprehend scientific communities and their collaborative
    patterns, see Figure 1. Figure 1. Methodology. In the initial phase, scholarly
    publications and their associated metadata were retrieved from the globally recognized
    Scopus database. The Scopus API was leveraged to conduct a targeted search focused
    on documents related to smart water meters, aligning with established research
    methodologies [11]. The search query employed was as follows: TITLE-ABS-KEY (smart*
    AND (water* OR flow*) AND meter*). All documents were downloaded from Scopus leading
    to the annotated search. Crafted to cover a broad spectrum of literature, the
    query specifically addressed terms related to “smart water meter” or “smart flow
    meter” and their practical applications across various communities. However, the
    methodology introduced in this study effectively manages this potential issue,
    thanks to the resulting network graph’s structure and which can be visualized
    with the Gephi (open-source tool). After acquiring the raw dataset, a preprocessing
    phase ensued, employing Microsoft Excel and OpenRefine for basic data organization
    and cleansing. This ensured that the dataset was primed for advanced analysis.
    For the core analysis, the open-source tool Gephi was employed, capitalizing on
    its robust capabilities in statistical analysis and data visualization. The data
    underwent refinement to eliminate documents lacking meaningful connections within
    the main body of scientific literature. This curation process allowed this research
    to focus specifically on the most pertinent documents and their relationships.
    For the primary screening, the open-source tool Gephi was employed, taking advantage
    of its robust statistical analysis and data visualization capabilities. The dataset
    was subjected to a filtering process to eliminate documents that did not establish
    any connection with the rest of the documents. This filtering allowed us to focus
    the cluster analysis on the most relevant documents and their associations. For
    this purpose, we employed a community detection algorithm based on modularity
    in large networks, as detailed in [12]. Specifically, Gephi’s algorithm used Louvain’s
    method, a widely accepted approach for community detection. Louvain’s method is
    optimized for large networks, with the goal of identifying modular structures
    by maximizing a modularity score within the range of −0.5 to 1. This score evaluates
    the density of edges within clusters compared to those between clusters. The Louvain
    method was chosen because of its computational efficiency and its ability to delineate
    clear structures in intricate datasets. Although alternative algorithms such as
    Girvan–Newman, Infomap, and Label Propagation were considered, they proved less
    suitable due to their computational intensity, limited relevance to citation networks,
    or production of less cohesive structures, respectively. For the sorting by year,
    by subject category, and by country, these data are obtained directly from the
    Scopus search in the results analysis section of the website itself. It is possible
    to export them in CSV format. Later, year and subject category data were imported
    and represented using Excel. Country data have been mapped with QGIS software
    3.28. A comprehensive bibliometric analysis will be undertaken to delve into the
    evolution of publications over the years. This includes a meticulous examination
    of the countries and affiliations that make the most substantial contributions
    to this scientific field. Additionally, this study will focus on dissecting the
    key words employed in the articles, aiming to discern the scientific communities
    within which these works can be categorized. The overarching aim is to provide
    a comprehensive and insightful overview of the landscape of smart water meter

    is a gradual increase in the number of publications, with a significant spike
    in 2010, where the count jumps to 85. This suggests a growing interest in and
    focus on the subject during that period. The most substantial growth occurs in
    the subsequent years, particularly from 2011 to 2019, with a remarkable surge
    in publications. The year 2019 stands out with 281 articles, reflecting a substantial

    Meters, stands out as the most significant in terms of size. Table 4 outlines
    the frequency (N) of occurrences of primary keywords associated with this cluster.
    It is noteworthy that this cluster leads in 18 out of the 20 main keywords, indicating
    a higher concentration of these terms within this community compared to others.
    In fact, eight of the 20 main keywords, such as Residential Water and Water Efficiency,
    are exclusive to this cluster. Over the past two decades, more or less detailed
    measurement programs, referred to as smart measures, have been developed [13].
    This progress has led to nearly continuous monitoring of water consumption. The
    abundance of available data has prompted the exploration of strategies for modeling
    and managing water in residential areas [14]. Periodic resource scarcity drives
    interest in limiting and controlling losses; leading studies toward water, notably
    by Rahim et al. [15], demand planning, socio-economic analysis, behavioral analysis,
    classification of water-related events, and user feedback. The cluster’s connection
    with information technology is evident, sharing techniques with other supply systems
    such as electricity or gas [16]. These meters enable the identification of the
    final use of water, a crucial aspect for making utility predictions [17]. The
    technology has matured sufficiently to transition from pilot trials to real-world
    implementation in large supply networks [18] and urban supply planning, closely
    intertwined with city planning itself [19]. Additionally, the current analyses
    aim to disaggregate data to reach individual events [20]. Reengineering of existing
    systems can be undertaken in light of the results already achieved [21]. Cluster
    2, denoted as IOT Connection, forms a community centered on Internet of Things
    (IoT) connection algorithms and network implementation. Ranking as the second-largest
    community, Table 4 details the frequency (N) of primary keywords associated with
    this cluster, establishing connections with the Urban Water metering and Communication
    and Security communities, while maintaining ties with the Energy consumption cluster.
    Among its 20 main keywords, 12 are intrinsic to this cluster, and it holds significance
    as the leading community in 8 of them. Its primary associations lie with Clusters
    1, 3, and 4, positioning it as a substantial and interconnected family with promising
    prospects for future development. Current meters are acknowledged for their sluggishness
    and time-intensive nature, promoting water wastage, thus advocating for the adoption
    of smart meters to enhance resource conservation and early fault detection [22,23].
    Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) architectures are anticipated to facilitate
    the integration of multiple networks simultaneously [24], aiming for user interaction
    [25]. The configuration of networks through smart water meters (SWM) and the advantageous
    use of IoT are highlighted in literature [26]. Case studies explore innovative
    applications, such as using pumps as generators or direct interaction with users
    [27], aligning with user interest in these devices [28]. Efficient data transmission
    mechanisms within the network involve relaying data from each node to the nearest
    node [29]. Two critical aspects, namely sensor network energy consumption and
    security issues, are underscored in the literature [30], emphasizing the multifaceted
    nature of research within the IOT Connection cluster. Cluster 3 was identified
    as Communication and Security and stands as the third-largest community. Table
    4 delineates the frequency (N) of principal keywords associated with this cluster,
    which revolves around communication and security aspects in network meters, particularly
    emphasizing energy meters. Remarkably, it encapsulates the top 10 keywords among
    the first 20 across all clusters, asserting its significance in this domain. In
    half of these 20 keywords, this community holds the utmost importance, while in
    the remaining 10, it shares keywords with other communities, primarily with Clusters
    1 and 3. This community is predominantly concerned with communication protocols
    and applications of automatic meters, with a focus on reducing peak consumption,
    a growingly attractive topic [31]. Traditional systems, effective thus far in
    electricity and water distribution, are deemed insecure and lacking user feedback
    capabilities [32]. Smart energy meters can be leveraged to monitor other types
    of meters, integrated into networks [33,34]. The computerized control of these
    networks [35] presents a challenge in terms of vulnerability to intrusions [36],
    necessitating resolution in future developments [37]. Data aggregation allows
    for processing while maintaining user privacy [38]. The Communication and Security
    cluster, thus, contributes significantly to the exploration of secure and effective
    communication protocols in smart metering systems. Cluster 4 was identified as
    Grid Management. Table 5 provides an overview of the primary keywords associated
    with this cluster. Positioned as a peripheral cluster, it primarily addresses
    the challenges in managing vast amounts of grid data. Although it shares keywords
    with other communities, it assumes a leading role in what is termed Big Data,
    highlighting its auxiliary nature in supporting other fields. This specialized
    community focuses on the implementation of intelligent algorithms for information
    acquisition, data processing, and swift action in extensive supply networks, predominantly
    in energy but extending to other domains such as water or gas [39,40,41]. The
    characterization of overall consumption holds a prominent place in this cluster,
    particularly in the context of water, leveraging time series [42] or neural networks
    [43]. Grid Management emerges as a crucial contributor to the application of intelligent
    algorithms for efficient data management and consumption characterization in large-scale
    supply networks. Cluster 5, labelled as Water Network Partitioning, is outlined
    in Table 5, featuring the primary keywords associated with this cluster. Characterized
    as an isolated cluster, it addresses the challenges of metering an extensive network
    through the analysis of smaller network components. Despite being a smaller cluster,
    it holds significance, representing 1.97% of the keywords. Within this group,
    all authors are closely interconnected, collaborating on a specific strategy for
    distribution network analysis. This strategy involves studying reduced sectors
    of the network to simplify the analysis [44,45,46]. The methodology employed includes
    the installation of valves and smart meters on main lines, accompanied by the
    development of specialized software for these meters, referred to as SWAM [47,48].
    This technique has been applied in fault detection and pollution control [49]
    through recursive sectorization [50]. The Water Network Partitioning cluster,
    although smaller in size, plays a vital role in the exploration of innovative
    strategies for network analysis, particularly in the context of simplifying analysis
    through the study of smaller network components. Cluster 6 focuses on Water Heating
    and the associated metering of this valuable resource, as detailed in Table 5
    with the primary keywords for this cluster. Comprising 1.13% of the keywords,
    this well-defined community primarily interacts with Cluster 1. The majority of
    the keywords within this family are unique to it, although none stands out as
    particularly abundant. The substantial cost of this resource amplifies the significance
    of this family, as highlighted by Bacher et al. [51]. The research within this
    cluster involves the development of prediction models for resource needs, particularly
    emphasizing scenarios in cold climates [52]. Detection of leaks is of particular
    importance due to the high energy costs [53]. This family extends its exploration
    to related networks such as domestic heat and gas, demonstrating a comprehensive
    approach to resource management [54,55]. The Water Heating and metering cluster,
    while relatively small, delves into crucial aspects of resource prediction, environmental
    considerations, and the efficient management of expensive resources. The remaining
    clusters are of limited size but represent emerging sectors with promising prospects
    for future studies. Cluster 7 is a small cluster centered on Groundwater Monitoring,
    utilizing various approaches. It occupies a peripheral position in the diagram
    and is related to Cluster 1, accounting for 0.99% of the keywords. Similar to
    Cluster 8, the majority of the keywords within this group are specific to it,
    sharing few words with other clusters. Table 6 lists the most representative keywords
    for this cluster. Water crisis and the threat of resource shortage are identified
    as direct consequences of factors such as limited precipitation, traditional irrigation
    methods, and inefficient monitoring and control systems in agriculture [56]. This
    cluster serves as a unique case within monitoring, often supported by simulation
    models [57,58,59]. It places special emphasis on control elements and leverages
    other components, such as energy meters, to enhance information completeness [60].
    Additionally, Cluster 7 connects with the use of unconventional water sources,
    such as desalinated water for urban use and reclaimed water for agricultural purposes
    [61]. Cluster 8, also a small cluster, is dedicated to Smart Irrigation control,
    representing 0.85% of the keywords. This group features highly specific keywords,
    occasionally shared with Cluster 1 and Cluster 3. Table 6 displays the most representative
    keywords for this cluster. Focused on intelligent control of irrigation systems
    to promote water savings and efficiency [62], this cluster emphasizes user satisfaction
    as a crucial parameter [63]. Initially applied in residential landscaping [62,63],
    smart irrigation is currently being implemented in agricultural areas [64,65,66].
    This family exhibits significant development potential, with numerous sensors
    of this type being deployed in agricultural areas [67]. In the analysis, two clusters
    with minimal representation emerge—one focused on data acquisition, sensors, and
    pattern recognition of consumption. For instance, Grigoras et al. [68] present
    an innovative solution in the form of a software platform for sustainable water
    supply system management. This platform incorporates advanced ICT solutions, including
    Blockchain and Artificial Intelligence, along with smart concepts such as smart
    metering and demand response, offering benefits to both the energy and water sectors.
    Additionally, there is another cluster specialized in automated decision making,
    utilizing learning programs, decision support programs, etc. [69,70]. 5. Discussion
    The analysis of the clusters reveals several challenges and prospects in smart
    water meter research. One key challenge lies in the need for more extensive exploration
    and development of clusters related to emerging sectors, such as Groundwater Monitoring
    and Smart Irrigation Control. These clusters, though relatively small, represent
    critical areas of study with promising potential for future research. The challenge
    is to further investigate and expand these clusters to gain a comprehensive understanding
    of their applications and implications for water resource management. Another
    challenge is the integration of various clusters, particularly those related to
    Communication and Security (Cluster 3) and Grid Management (Cluster 4). As smart
    water metering systems become more sophisticated, addressing the communication
    protocols, security vulnerabilities, and efficient management of vast amounts
    of data in the grid becomes crucial. Integrating findings from these clusters
    can contribute to the development of comprehensive and secure smart water networks.
    On the positive side, the clusters also offer promising prospects. For instance,

    chapter''s full text. Full Text Preview Introduction Urban agriculture, encompassing
    practices such as rooftop farming, vertical farming, and hydroponics, has emerged
    as a promising approach to address the increasing demand for food in urban areas
    (Su et al., 2020). As the world''s population continues to urbanize, the limited
    availability of arable land and the challenges associated with traditional agricultural
    practices pose significant obstacles to ensuring food security in cities (Kasprzyk
    et al., 2022). However, the integration of smart technologies has the potential
    to overcome these challenges and optimize urban agricultural practices. Smart
    technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence
    (AI), and data analytics, are revolutionizing various industries, and urban agriculture
    is no exception. These technologies offer innovative solutions to enhance resource
    efficiency, improve productivity, and promote sustainability in urban farming
    (Pathmudi et al., 2023). One of the key benefits of smart technologies in urban
    agriculture is the increased feasibility of food production in urban areas. Research
    conducted by Badami and Ramankutty (2015) suggests that urban agriculture is more
    feasible for growing basic daily vegetables for the urban poor in developed countries
    than in developing countries. By leveraging smart technologies, urban farming
    can be made more efficient and productive, making it a viable option for food
    production in resource-constrained urban areas. Resource circularity is another
    area where smart technologies play a crucial role in urban agriculture. Weidner
    et al. (2019) highlight the potential of decentralized anaerobic digestion and
    vermicomposting, coupled with smart technologies, in utilizing organic waste for
    urban agriculture. By closing the loop and recycling organic waste, smart technologies
    contribute to a resource circular economy in urban farming, reducing the reliance
    on external resources and minimizing waste. Water management is a critical aspect
    of urban agriculture, and smart technologies offer improved solutions in this
    regard. Mason et al. (2019) demonstrate the potential of intelligent irrigation
    systems, enabled by IoT and data analytics, to reduce water consumption while
    maintaining crop yield in smallholder farming systems. By integrating sensors,
    wireless communications, and data platforms, these systems provide real-time data
    for informed decision-making, enabling precise and optimized water management
    in urban agriculture. In addition to resource efficiency, smart technologies also
    contribute to the environmental sustainability of urban agriculture. Jaramillo
    and Desyouni (2015) emphasize that the current food system contributes heavily
    to global environmental challenges such as biodiversity loss and climate change.
    However, smart urban farming practices, such as vertical farming and greenhouses,
    supported by smart technologies, offer controlled environments that reduce the
    need for land, water, and pesticides. This can help mitigate the negative environmental
    impacts associated with conventional agriculture. While the integration of smart
    technologies in urban agriculture holds great promise, it is essential to address
    the challenges and considerations associated with their implementation. Benis
    and Ferrão (2018) highlight barriers such as high investment costs, narrow profit
    margins, and uncertain marketing channels that hinder the commercialization of
    rooftop farming. Moreover, the potential drawbacks of smart urban agriculture,
    including the dependence on technology and the exclusion of traditional farming
    practices, need to be carefully examined (Glaeser et al., 2021). In conclusion,
    smart technologies have the potential to revolutionize urban agriculture by enhancing
    resource efficiency, improving productivity, and promoting environmental sustainability.
    Through the integration of IoT, AI, and data analytics, urban farming can overcome
    challenges associated with limited land availability, water scarcity, and environmental
    impact. However, it is crucial to consider the socioeconomic aspects, inclusivity,
    and long-term sustainability of smart urban agriculture initiatives. Continue

    Preview 1. Introduction: Smart Agriculture A farming management idea called “smart
    farming” aims to improve both the quantity and quality of agricultural products.
    Today''s farmers have access to technology like GPS, soil scanning, data management,
    and the Internet of Things. The purpose of smart agriculture research is to provide
    a solid foundation for a farm management decision-support system. Population growth,
    climate change, and labor are all challenges that smart farming believes must
    be addressed. From planting and watering crops to crop health and harvesting,
    smart farming has received a lot of technological attention. A system is created
    in IOT-based smart agriculture to automate the irrigation system while monitoring
    the agricultural field with the aid of sensors (light, humidity, temperature,
    soil moisture, etc.). In the context of agriculture, IOT (Internet of Things)
    refers to the use of sensors, cameras, and other gadgets to convert every aspect
    and action related to farming into data. The negative environmental externalities
    of contemporary agriculture will be greatly reduced if smart agriculture is allowed
    to grow and develop beyond what it is today. Smart cities collect and analyze
    data using Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as connected sensors, lights,
    and meters. The cities utilize this information to enhance their infrastructure,
    public services, and more. Farmers find it challenging to comprehend technical
    jargon and how to use technology, but they also find it to be a cost-effective
    solution (Srivastava et al., 2020). Here Figure 1 depicts that there are numerous
    fields where Smart Agriculture is helping us to improve both the quantity and
    quality of agricultural products. Figure 1. Numerous fields where smart agriculture

    IEEE Conference Location: Tashkent, Uzbekistan SECTION I. Introduction In recent
    years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has emerged as a transformative technology,
    revolutionizing various industries with its ability to connect and automate devices.
    One sector that stands to benefit significantly from IoT implementation is agriculture
    [1]. By integrating IoT into agricultural practices, farmers can gain real-time
    insights, optimize resource allocation, and enhance productivity while ensuring
    sustainability [2]. Smart agriculture management involves the integration of advanced
    technologies and data-driven solutions to streamline farming operations. An integrated
    IoT system plays a pivotal role in achieving these objectives by enabling the
    seamless connection and communication between sensors, devices, and agricultural
    equipment [3] This comprehensive system harnesses the power of IoT, cloud computing,
    data analytics, and machine learning to create a holistic approach to agriculture.
    At its core, an integrated IoT system for smart agriculture management comprises
    a network of sensors strategically deployed throughout the farming landscape [4].
    Sensors collect various environmental data points such as soil moisture levels,
    temperature, humidity, light intensity, and even atmospheric conditions. Through
    the connectivity provided by IoT, this data is transmitted in real-time to a centralized
    cloud platform. The cloud platform acts as a central hub where the collected data
    is stored, processed, and analyzed. Advanced analytics algorithms and machine
    learning models process the data to extract valuable insights and action- able
    recommendations for farmers [4] These insights can range from optimal irrigation
    schedules and nutrient management to pest detection and disease prevention strategies
    [5]. The integration of IoT devices extends beyond environmental monitoring. It
    also includes the connectivity of agricultural machinery and equipment. For instance,
    IoT-enabled tractors, harvesters, and drones can be equipped with sensors and
    GPS technology to perform precise and automated tasks such as planting, spraying,
    and crop monitoring. By automating these processes, farmers can improve efficiency,
    reduce labor costs, and minimize environmental impact. Moreover, an integrated
    IoT system can enable farmers to remotely monitor and control their operations
    using mobile applications or web- based interfaces [3]. This allows farmers to
    access real-time data, receive alerts and notifications, and make informed decisions
    from anywhere at any time. Whether they are in the field or managing multiple
    farms, the power of IoT empowers farmers with greater control and flexibility
    in managing their agricultural practices [6]. Furthermore, the integration of
    IoT in agriculture goes beyond individual farms. It opens up opportunities for
    collaboration and knowledge sharing among farmers, agronomists, and researchers.
    By leveraging data from multiple sources, farmers can gain valuable insights into
    industry trends, best practices, and market demands. This collective intelligence
    fosters innovation and facilitates sustainable agricultural practices at a larger
    scale. In short, an integrated IoT system solution for smart agriculture management
    holds immense potential for revolutionizing the way we approach farming. By connecting
    devices, collecting data, and leveraging advanced analytics, farmers can optimize
    resource utilization, improve productivity, and ensure environmental sustainability.
    With continuous advancements in IoT technology, the future of agriculture looks
    promising, with smarter and more efficient farming practices that contribute to
    global food security. Fig. 1 shows some of major benefits of AgroIoT [7]. Fig.
    1: Advantages of IoT in Agriculture. Show All A. Background The integration of
    Internet of Things (IoT) technology in smart agriculture management has garnered
    significant attention from researchers and industry experts in recent years. The
    need to address challenges such as food security, resource scarcity, and environmental
    sustainability has driven the exploration of IoT -based solutions in the agricultural
    sector [8]. Numerous studies have highlighted the potential benefits of implementing
    an integrated IoT system in agriculture. For instance, research has demonstrated
    that IoT -enabled environmental monitoring can provide real-time data on crucial
    factors like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. This data empowers farmers
    to make informed decisions regarding irrigation, fertilization, and pest control,
    leading to optimized resource utilization and improved crop yields [3]. Additionally,
    the integration of IoT devices with agricultural machinery and equipment has shown
    promise in streamlining farming operations. Studies have explored the use of IoT
    -enabled tractors, drones, and sensors to automate tasks such as seeding, spraying,
    and harvesting. By leveraging IoT technology, farmers can enhance efficiency,
    reduce labor costs, and minimize the use of agrochemicals, thus contributing to
    sustainable agricultural practices [7] Furthermore, researchers have investigated
    the potential of data analytics and machine learning algorithms in leveraging
    the vast amount of data collected by IoT sensors. By analyzing this data, valuable
    insights can be gained regarding crop health, disease detection, and yield prediction.
    These insights enable proactive decision-making and timely interventions, helping
    farmers mitigate risks and optimize production. Collaborative research efforts
    have also focused on the scalability and interoperability of IoT systems in agriculture.
    The integration of multiple farms, agricultural institutions, and stakeholders
    through IoT networks facilitates knowledge sharing, best practices dissemination,
    and the development of industry-wide standards [1], [9], [10]. Such collaborations
    promote innovation and foster the development of sustainable farming practices
    on a broader scale. However, despite the promising potential of integrated IoT
    systems for smart agriculture management, there are still challenges to address.
    Issues related to data privacy and security, standardization, and the high initial
    investment costs of IoT infrastructure require further research and development.
    In conclusion, the research background on integrated IoT system solutions for
    smart agriculture management showcases the growing interest in leveraging IoT
    technology to transform traditional farming practices [11], [12]. Through environmental
    monitoring, automation, data analytics, and collaboration, IoT holds the promise
    of enhancing productivity, sustainability, and efficiency in agriculture. Further
    research and technological advancements are necessary to overcome challenges and
    fully unlock the potential of IoT in the agricultural sector. SECTION II. Litrature
    Review The implementation of an integrated IoT system for smart agriculture management
    requires a well-defined methodology that encompasses various stages of deployment
    and operation. The following paragraphs outline the key steps involved in the
    methodology. The first step in the methodology involves identifying the specific
    needs and objectives of the farm or agricultural operation. This includes understanding
    the key challenges faced by the farmers, such as water management, crop health
    monitoring, or pest control. By clearly defining the goals, the subsequent steps
    can be tailored to address the specific requirements of the farm [1]. In [10],
    a comprehensive analysis of the farm''s infrastructure and environment is conducted.
    This involves identifying the areas where IoT sensors and devices can be strategically
    deployed. Factors such as soil type, topography, and crop types are considered
    to determine the optimal sensor placement for data collection. Additionally, the
    integration of IoT -enabled machinery and equipment is evaluated to automate farming
    operations. Once the sensor and device placement is determined, the next step
    involves selecting the appropriate IoT hardware and connectivity solutions. This
    includes choosing sensors for measuring environmental parameters such as temperature,
    humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity. The selection of IoT gateways or
    hubs, communication protocols, and network connectivity options (e.g., cellular,
    Wi-Fi, LoRa Wan) are also important considerations. After the hardware selection,
    the IoT system''s deployment phase begins. This involves installing the sensors
    and devices in the designated locations across the farm. Careful calibration and
    testing of the IoT infrastructure are conducted to ensure accurate data collection
    and reliable connectivity. The integration of IoT -enabled machinery and equipment
    also takes place during this phase. Once the IoT system is deployed and operational,
    the focus shifts to data management and analytics. The collected sensor data is
    transmitted to a centralized cloud platform, where it is stored securely and processed
    in real-time. Data analytics techniques, including statistical analysis and machine
    learning algorithms, are applied to derive meaningful insights from the collected
    data. These insights can be related to irrigation scheduling, crop health monitoring,
    disease detection, and other relevant factors [6]. The final step in the methodology
    involves the utilization of the generated insights to make informed decisions
    and take necessary actions. Farmers and agricultural professionals can access
    the cloud-based platform through user- friendly interfaces, enabling them to monitor
    the farm''s performance, receive alerts and notifications, and access actionable
    recommendations. This allows for proactive management of the farm, optimizing
    resource allocation, and enhancing productivity. Throughout the entire process,
    continuous monitoring and maintenance of the IoT system are essential. Regular
    checks are conducted to ensure the proper functioning of sensors, connectivity,
    and data transmission. Firmware updates, security patches, and system upgrades
    are performed to keep the IoT infrastructure up to date and protected against
    potential vulnerabilities [5]. to summarize, the methodology for implementing
    an integrated IoT system for smart agriculture management involves identifying
    needs, analyzing the farm''s infrastructure, selecting appropriate IoT hardware,
    deploying the system, managing and analyzing data, and utilizing insights for
    decision-making. Continuous monitoring and maintenance ensure the system''s reliability
    and effectiveness in optimizing farming practices. SECTION III. Proposed Architecture
    The proposed architecture of an integrated IoT system solution for smart agriculture
    management comprises several interconnected components that work together to enable
    efficient data collection, processing, and decision-making. The following paragraph
    provides an overview of the key elements of the architecture. At the core of the
    architecture is the network of IoT sensors strategically deployed across the farm.
    These sensors, such as soil moisture sensors, temperature sensors, and humidity
    sensors, continuously collect environmental data relevant to farming operations.
    The sensors are equipped with wireless communication capabilities to transmit
    the collected data to a central hub or gateway. The central hub serves as a data
    aggregation point and communication interface between the sensors and the cloud-based
    platform. It collects the data from the sensors and performs initial processing,
    such as data filtering and data normalization. The hub also ensures reliable connectivity
    and secure transmission of the data to the cloud platform. The cloud-based platform
    forms a critical component of the architecture. It acts as a centralized repository
    for storing the collected sensor data and provides a scalable and secure environment
    for data processing and analysis. The platform leverages cloud computing technologies
    to handle the large volume of data generated by the sensors. Within the cloud
    platform, advanced analytics techniques are applied to the collected data. This
    includes data preprocessing, feature extraction, and data mining to derive meaningful
    insights. Machine learning algorithms and statistical models are employed to analyze
    the data and identify patterns, trends, and anomalies related to crop health,
    irrigation needs, pest infestation, and other relevant factors. The insights generated
    by the analytics process are made available to the end-users, such as farmers
    and agricultural professionals, through user-friendly interfaces. These interfaces
    can be accessed via mobile applications, web-based dashboards, or other means.
    The end-users can view real-time data, receive alerts and notifications, and access
    actionable recommendations based on the analyzed data. The architecture also includes
    integration with IoT -enabled machinery and equipment. This involves equipping
    agricultural machinery like tractors, harvesters, and drones with IoT sensors
    and connectivity capabilities. These IoT -enabled machines can collect data related
    to their operations, such as fuel consumption, performance metrics, and geospatial
    information. This data can be integrated into the cloud platform, providing a
    comprehensive view of the farm''s operations. Furthermore, the proposed architecture
    emphasizes data security and privacy. Measures such as data encryption, access
    controls, and authentication mechanisms are implemented to protect the sensitive
    farm data from unauthorized access or tampering. Fig. 2: Snapshot of Test Site.
    Show All In summary, the proposed architecture of the integrated IoT system for
    smart agriculture management consists of IoT sensors deployed across the farm,
    a central hub for data aggregation and communication, a cloud-based platform for
    data storage and analytics, user interfaces for data visualization and decision-making,
    integration with IoT-enabled machinery, and robust security measures. This architecture
    enables realtime data collection, data analysis, and informed decision- making,
    ultimately optimizing farming practices and promoting sustainable agriculture.
    SECTION IV. Experiment and Data Analysis The primary objective of the research
    experiment was to assess the effectiveness of a specialized Internet of Things
    (IoT) system tailored for agricultural management. This system comprised of the
    Agricultural Information acquisition system, Transmission system, processing system
    and the Agricultural Information query system. In summary, the research experiment
    successfully showcased the feasibility and advantages of adopting an IoT system
    in agriculture to optimize production processes, utilizing advanced technologies
    to improve efficiency, traceability, and decision-making capabilities in the field
    of agriculture. Table I: Readings from Sensors for Different Crops. A. Environmental
    Data The experiment was conducted for various temperature ranges at the Graphic
    Era Agri Farms situated at ISBT, Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India, which finally yielded
    following for various crops: 1. Tomato An average temperature of 25°C, with minor
    fluctuations observed. The average humidity level ranged from 56% to 57%, indicating
    a moderately humid environment. The soil moisture content remained consistently
    at an average of 55%, ensuring sufficient hydration for optimal plant growth.
    2. Pea Throughout the cultivation period, the experiment aocumentea an average
    temperature of 21°C, with minor variations observed. The average humidity level
    ranged between 40% and 43%, indicating a relatively high humidity environment.
    The soil moisture content consistently remained on the higher side, with an average
    of 48%, ensuring sufficient hydration for optimal plant growth. B. Plantation
    Data The experiment encompassed the cultivation of two distinct crop varieties:
    Pea, Tomato, which are categorized as warm crops, and Cool season crops. The warm
    crops were planted on Feb 15th 2022, while the Cool crop was sown on October 15th
    2023. This approach facilitated consistent growth under controlled conditions
    at different locations, allowing for the assessment of the influence of soil,
    climate, and other variables. The warm crops were harvested in May to July, while
    the Cool crop was harvested in January to March 2023. These time frames indicated
    the duration of the cultivation cycle for each crop type. Various agricultural
    operations were conducted during the experiment, including irrigation, fertilization,
    and weeding. These activities ensured proper care and maintenance of the crops
    throughout their growth stages. Further, the data was also collected from moisture
    sensors implanted in Tomato over a period of 10 seconds showing the deflection
    in every second. Given below is a table of these readings and a graph suggesting
    the changes. SECTION V. Discussion of Results The above table presents readings
    from the sensors installed in the crop field for four different crops: Pea, Tomato.
    The readings include humidity, temperature, and soil moisture measurements recorded
    on different dates. The purpose of this data collection is to monitor the environmental
    conditions and soil moisture levels in the field, providing valuable information
    for smart agriculture management. The humidity sensor, measures the relative humidity
    in the atmosphere surrounding the crops. It provides an indication of the moisture
    content in the air, which is important for assessing the overall humidity levels
    and the potential risk of diseases or pests related to high humidity. The temperature
    sensor measures the ambient temperature in the crop field. Temperature plays a
    crucial role in plant growth and development, affecting various physiological
    processes. Monitoring temperature helps in understanding the thermal conditions
    and making informed decisions related to irrigation, pest control, and crop protection
    measures. The soil moisture sensor, measures the moisture content in the soil.
    It provides insights into the soil''s water availability, enabling farmers to
    optimize irrigation schedules and ensure adequate water supply for the crops.
    Monitoring soil moisture is essential for preventing overwatering or underwatering,
    as it directly affects crop health, nutrient uptake, and overall productivity.
    By collecting and analyzing these sensor readings, researchers and farmers can
    gain insights into the environmental conditions and the moisture status of the
    soil for different crops. This data can be further processed and analyzed using
    various statistical and machine learning techniques to understand patterns, correlations,
    and trends. Such analysis aids in making data-driven decisions, optimizing resource
    allocation, and implementing precision agriculture practices for improved crop
    yield, water efficiency, and overall farm management. Fig. 3: Advantages of IoT
    in Agriculture. Show All SECTION VI. Conclusion In conclusion, the integration
    of IoT (Internet of Things) technology in smart agriculture management holds immense
    promise for revolutionizing the way we approach farming. Through the implementation
    of an integrated IoT system, farmers can leverage real-time data collection, advanced
    analytics, and automation to optimize resource allocation, improve productivity,
    and ensure sustainability. The advantages of an integrated IoT system for smart
    agriculture management are numerous. By deploying IoT sensors across the farm,
    farmers gain valuable insights into environmental parameters such as soil moisture,
    temperature, and humidity. This data-driven approach enables informed decision-making
    regarding irrigation, fertilization, and pest control, leading to optimized resource
    utilization and improved crop yields. The automation of farming operations through
    IoT -enabled machinery and equipment brings increased efficiency and productivity.
    Tasks such as planting, spraying, and harvesting can be precisely and autonomously
    executed, reducing reliance on manual labor, minimizing errors, and enhancing
    overall operational efficiency. Additionally, IoT systems can detect and address
    operational inefficiencies, equipment failures, and maintenance needs, ensuring
    smooth operations and reducing downtime. Table II: Moisture Sensor Reading of
    Tomato in 1–10 Seconds One of the most significant advantages of integrated IoT
    systems is their contribution to sustainable resource management. By monitoring
    environmental conditions and leveraging real-time data insights, farmers can implement
    precise irrigation strategies, conserving water and reducing waste. The targeted
    application of fertilizers and pesticides based on data-driven insights minimizes
    environmental impact, improves crop health, and promotes long-term agricultural
    sustainability. Furthermore, integrated IoT systems foster data- driven innovation
    and collaboration. Cloud-based platforms enable access to industry-wide data,
    best practices, and market insights, facilitating knowledge sharing and driving
    continuous improvements in agricultural practices.8 The scalability and adaptability
    of IoT systems allow for easy customization and expansion based on farm requirements,
    ensuring long-term viability and future-proofing.9 However, the implementation
    of integrated IoT systems in agriculture also presents challenges. Data privacy
    and security, standardization, and the initial investment costs of IoT infrastructure
    require careful consideration and further research and development. Overall, the
    integration of IoT technology in smart agriculture management offers transformative
    potential. By harnessing real-time data, advanced analytics, and automation, farmers
    can optimize their farming practices, improve productivity, and contribute to
    sustainable and efficient agriculture. 10 With continuous advancements in IoT
    technology, the future of smart agriculture looks promising, paving the way for
    a more technologically advanced and environmentally conscious farming industry

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Dehradun, India SECTION I. Introduction To
    feed more people, all sectors need to boost production, but agriculture in particular.
    Still, there will be instances when supply and demand aren''t in equilibrium.
    Financial and human resource management continues to provide a significant challenge
    to agricultural productivity improvement. Smart farming allows for greater crop
    yields, more efficient use of available resources, and reduced labor requirements.
    Predictive analysis, IoT gadgets managed via the cloud, and security systems for
    multi-cultural farms are explored, as are the views of seasoned farmers. The challenges
    of combining modern farming techniques with older, more traditional ones are also
    highlighted. The use of quantitative and statistical techniques has the potential
    to bring about revolutionary changes to the way we farm today. In addition, there
    are agricultural problems, irrigation challenges, and plant leaf diseases to deal
    with while using IoT drones in the field. Many of the reasons why IoT relies on
    sensor activation are discussed. The purpose of this research is to determine
    whether and how cutting-edge Internet of Things (IoT) technology may improve today''s
    agricultural practices. Current and future agricultural trends are forecast using
    a rigorous methodology. The majority of Indians, including 70 percent of farmers,
    depend on agriculture for their livelihood [1] [2]. Indian farmers often choose
    their farming techniques by trial and error. This is true even with complex methods
    like drip, adjoining, and trench irrigation[3] [4]. If we want to increase agricultural
    output, we must move away from labor-intensive manual processes and toward more
    mechanized ones[5]. Water is a precious resource that should be preserved for
    the needs of the future, especially given the widespread availability of water
    in India. A simplified, embedded-based autonomous watering system may be of great
    use to farmers [6]. This method should be helpful for farmers who have to water
    their crops at precise times and in exact quantities. Drip irrigation automation
    is in charge of humidity sensors. The engine''s on/off timing is determined by
    local temperature fluctuations around the crop area. So, a self-reliant individual
    would examine the soil moisture level [8] [9] before making any hasty choices.
    The IoT paves the way for remote access and management of connected devices and
    infrastructure. It can power sensors used in a wide range of applications, including
    those dealing with water management, traffic safety, and rail networks. Therefore,
    both human and system errors are less likely to occur [10]–[16]. The Internet
    of Things (IoT) is a relatively young discipline that has spread to and improved
    upon many other fields. It has progressed in recent years [17] [18] due to the
    introduction of new sensors, sensor networks, and RF-based communications. It
    is capable of intelligent behavior, accurate sensing, and identification. Changes
    in computer networks and mobile technologies have emerged from the combination
    of cloud computing with 3G, NFC, and the Internet of Things. Some examples of
    modern networks include GSM, WLAN, Zigbee, LTE, WiMax, RFID, WPAN, and Bluetooth.
    Fig. 1 depicts a variety of IoT use cases [19]–[22]. Today, the Internet of Things
    is the backbone of the IT industry. The idea of a “computerized India” was first
    presented by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2015. Largely, this is attributable
    to the expansion of the Internet of Things and the emergence of game-changing
    new businesses. Agriculture accounts for a large portion of India''s GDP. In the
    future, an IoT-based sensor system may make significant contributions to agriculture''s
    progress[23]. Electricity infrastructure, railroads, connections, subterranean
    streets, buildings, dams, oil and gas pipes, and so on all have sensors installed
    and maintained in them. Then find out how to operate it remotely and connect to
    the web in order to run the apps you need. Technologies such as radio frequency
    identification, novel sensors, sensor network organization, and networked web-based
    collaboration are all examples of IoT approaches. The Internet of Things (IoT)
    is a cutting-edge innovation that improves both monitoring and detecting capabilities.
    Cloud computing, smart detection, and pervasive organization all come together
    to form what is known as the Internet of Things (IoT). 3G, LTE, GSM, WLAN, WPAN,
    WiMAX, RFID, ZigBee, NFC, Bluetooth, and other forms of distant communication
    convention technology are all examples of ubiquitous systems. Fig. 1. Applications
    of IoT[26]. Show All Present-day farming has been more mechanized and industrialized.
    hence, it must be made. The potential for rural informationization is a boon to
    rural development; it serves as a basis for transformation and the maintenance
    of steady economic growth. Amazing progress has been made in agricultural production
    over the last five years because of the rural framework that has been put into
    place. The agricultural data cellar is a great help. IoT delivers several innovations
    in the field of advanced structures, such as soilless agriculture, culture arrangement
    control technology, manufactured photosynthesis, environmental control for the
    growth of plants, intelligent water system technology, and so on. The farms use
    IoT technology in their manufacturing process to better nurture their plants.
    This is very useful in agricultural frameworks for year-round crop production
    because of the highly regulated conditions, it provides. Temperature, humidity,
    co2 fixation, and crop culture arrangement may all be regulated automatically
    by a PC. Agriculture''s smart command centre and information repository. The platform
    also includes subsystems like agro-environmental control, agrarian asset management,
    production handle control, grow goods, nutritional health, agricultural sorts
    of equipment, and an office. A server farm is a large, sophisticated building
    housing several offices. However, it''s not only a computer system; it also combines
    the environment control office, the screen office, and other kinds of security
    devices, all of which operate on it and shares data through an excess of communications.
    Using IoT techniques like radio frequency identification, remote communication,
    programmed control, and data detection, a large amount of data may be gathered,
    making for really insightful farming. The escalating global demand for food production,
    coupled with the challenges posed by climate change and dwindling water resources,
    has prompted a paradigm shift in traditional agricultural practices. The advent
    of technology-driven solutions has opened doors to a new era of farming known
    as “Smart Farming,” where innovative techniques and intelligent systems converge
    to address the pressing needs of the agricultural sector. At the forefront of
    this transformation is the integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) into agriculture,
    a union that promises enhanced efficiency, resource optimization, and sustainable
    practices. In this context, our research embarks on a journey to explore the potential
    of IoT-driven automation in revolutionizing irrigation practices - a pivotal aspect
    of modern agriculture. Modernization and increased agricultural output may both
    be achieved with a Raspberry Pi-based autonomous irrigation system. While other
    development boards may offer certain advantages in specific contexts, the Raspberry
    Pi''s combination of features, cost-effectiveness, community support, and programming
    versatility makes it a preferred choice for designing and implementing autonomous
    irrigation systems The primary goal of this research is to increase agricultural
    yields while using a minimal amount of water. Precision agriculture using cloud
    computing is a significant benefit of this technology, as it will optimize water
    consumption while increasing agricultural yields [24] [25]. The following is a
    rundown of the organizational structure of the research article: Existing research
    publications on Internet of Things-based smart agriculture are included in Section
    2. In Section 3, we will talk about the many different types of sensors that were
    employed in the study and recommended framework for advancing agriculture. The
    implementation specifics are presented in part 4, while section 5 discusses the
    numerous tests carried out in real-time agriculture. The research is brought to
    a close in Section 6. SECTION II. Related Studies Gia, T. N., and Tcarenko [1]
    developed a system to automate the ongoing monitoring of agricultural fields.
    The method conserves water in the crop ground at the same rate as the energy consumption
    in the agricultural field. The designed system will be protected by irrigation
    insurance. Kansara, K., Zaveri [2] showed off an automated irrigation system that
    reduces water assets more frugally by factoring in the time of water scarcity.
    They proved that both water use and energy consumption could be cut by using a
    solar power system. A smartphone was used to make this by analyzing sensor data
    online. Information gathered throughout the agricultural process was the focus
    of work by Rao, R. N., and Sridhar [3]. Temperature and water-pH sensors based
    on GSM-enabled microcontrollers from ATMEL are part of the system. After then,
    an IOT system based on Arduino is used, whereas a Raspberry Pi system is preferable
    for monitoring a big number of Pis. Monroy-Sahade [4] Omer Aydin et al. [4] gathered
    information on irrigation using Internet of Things devices and sensors. Various
    sensors and other IoT gadgets send data to MongoDB. Using the Weka program, we
    standardized the data and utilized it as a training set. The evaluations led to
    the selection of the decision tree (J48) algorithm as the basis for the AI model.
    Irrigation on/off, repair, and inspection are all controlled by decisions. The
    reliability of the forecasts was examined, and the efficiency of the irrigation
    system was tested. The built-in mobile app allows you to remotely and manually
    manage the system, examine and control it, and even witness its decisions. EA
    The parameters impacting the watering of mustard leaf plants were better monitored,
    and a data-driven model was presented, thanks to the work of Abioye et al.[5].
    The ESPresso Lite V2.0 module is used with the Davis vantage pro 2 weather station,
    flowmeters (YF-S201), and a variety of soil moisture sensors (VH-400) to provide
    accurate readings of soil moisture, irrigation volume, and reference evapotranspiration
    (ETo). Dr. S. Velmurugan[6] offered a free and open-source smart system for estimating
    watering requirements by monitoring soil moisture, temperature, and ambient factors,
    as well as consulting online weather predictions. The suggested system''s brilliance
    stems from a sophisticated algorithm that takes into account both current and
    future weather conditions, including air temperature, precipitation, ultraviolet
    radiation, and humidity. The smart gate for open channel precision irrigation
    was shown by Muhammad Farooq et al.[7] using sensors to monitor water levels and
    flows. After collecting information on the soil''s moisture, temperature, and
    humidity in the field with the use of WSN methods, the data was sent to the cloud-based
    Firebase Real-Time Database. Decisions may be made with the use of fuzzy logic
    approaches by comparing data with a fuzzy rule-base. The precise quantity of water
    required by each crop is calculated by the smart gates using fuzzy logic, and
    the water is delivered in the form most advantageous to the plant. The farmer
    may keep tabs on his or her farm''s performance in real-time with the use of the
    smartphone dashboard. Microscale and MATLAB simulation tests were conducted to
    ensure the viability of the technique. The rate of moisture loss at various temperatures
    may be used to get an estimate of the number of irrigation days. SECTION III.
    Materials and Methods A. Materials 1) Raspberry Pi 3 The schematic of the Raspberry
    Pi circuit board is seen in Fig. 2. Dual-core ARMv6 processors, the BCM2837, have
    superseded the BCM2836 (quad-core ARMv7). The processing performance increases
    by a factor of two in comparison to multi-core CPUs. With proper design, it is
    possible to quadruple or even more than double a system''s speed. With this CPU,
    you can surf the web more quickly and effectively than ever before. The Raspberry
    Pi 3 will support all extra daughter boards with a 99 percent efficiency rate[8].
    Fig. 2. Raspberry Pi 3 Model B[27]. Show All Because of the improved power management,
    the Pi 3 should be able to use more megalomaniac USB devices [8]. 2) Software
    Used Python is one of the most popular Raspberry Pi programming languages. The
    main advantage is that, in comparison to other programming languages, a programmer
    may write fewer lines of code. Although not a web programming language, Python
    is suited to server programming languages[8]. 3) Power Supply All digital electronics
    require a controlled power supply. Fig. 3 shows a basic fixed-regulated power
    supply circuit diagram. Fig. 3. Power supply [3]. Show All 4) Data Acquisition
    System A single chip with sample and hold circuitry is used for advanced data
    collection. The MCP 3208, as illustrated in Fig. 4, is a sophisticated IC that
    transforms analog signals to 12 bit digital information. The output of this sample
    hold capacitor is 12 bits, with a translation speed of 100 kps. This device is
    equipped with a four-wire SPI data communication that operates at low clock speeds
    [1]. Fig. 4. Data Acquisition Chip[27]. Show All 5) Soil Moisture Sensor As illustrated
    in fig. 5, it consists of two probes placed in the soil. When present flows finished
    the reviews, the soil with little moisture offers less resistance and allows for
    high currents to pass through. Thus, the alternating current parameter is used
    to determine the amount of soil moisture [9]. Fig. 5. Soil moisture sensor[29].
    Show All 6) LM35:temperature Sensor The LM35 sensor series (shown in Fig. 6) is
    an example of a kind of precision integrated-circuit temperature sensor that provides
    a voltage output that is directly proportional to the ambient temperature[10].
    Fig. 6. Temperature Sensor. Show All 7) Lm 358 The LM 358 IC has two amplifiers
    with wide bandwidth and bandwidths that are intended to function across a wide
    variety of voltages. Low-power instrumentation applications take advantage of
    these devices. The main advantage is that it is easy to use and may be used with
    single power supply circuits [11]. Fig. 7. Pin- diagram of LM 358 Show All 8)
    Relay Using a relay, the regulated DC signal is used to operate the AC motors.
    It is able to physically divide an electrical circuit. The electromagnet uses
    electromagnetic to alternately complete and break the circuit. There is a high-tech
    rating relay used in this study (see Fig. 8). Fig. 8. Relay[3]. Show All 9) Buzzer
    In order to alert the user when the motor is activated or deactivated, the author
    suggests installing a Beeper or Buzzer as seen in fig. 9. This serves as a mechanical,
    electrical, or electronic warning indicator with an audible tone. A buzzer or
    beeper is an audible signaling device that might be mechanical, electromechanical,
    or electronic. There are currently a variety of buzzers available, including alarms,
    timers, mouse clicks, and more [26] [27]. Fig. 9. Buzzer[3]. Show All B. Proposed
    Framework Fig. 10 is a block schematic of the proposed system. Two sensors have
    been included in this study. 1) A device to measure heat, and 2) a soil moisture
    gauge. The data is sent to the database through wifi from the Raspberry Pi once
    it has been processed by the IC3208(which transforms analog standards to 12 bit
    digital values). Different types of agricultural land have different threshold
    voltages at different times of the year. If the controller data is below 2.4 volts,
    the field will be allowed to dry out, and if it is over 2.4 volts, the field will
    be oversaturated. Soil moisture content is accurately measured by calculating
    the temperature difference using a second temperature sensor and a validating
    value. A buzzer is used to indicate when the motor is transitioning from its “off
    state” to its “on state,” and vice versa, so that the signal to the motor may
    be cut off as necessary. As shown in the flowchart of Fig. 11, the suggested system
    was implemented on a Raspberry Pi. Python was selected as the programming language
    to implement the proposed approach on the LINUX platform. Fig. 10. IoT-based agriculture
    field monitoring block diagram. Show All As can be seen in the flowchart of Fig.
    11, the suggested system was implemented using a Raspberry Pi. Python was selected
    as the programming language to implement the proposed approach on the LINUX platform.
    Raspberry Pi process provides an IP address with all of the sensor data and the
    motor status encoded in Python code. We may use our gadget to check up on these
    IP addresses on Google just as we would any other query using a computer or mobile
    device. SECTION IV. Implementation The Intelligent IoT-based Automated Irrigation
    System uses Arduino and Raspberry Pi3 microcontrollers and processing units. Soil
    sensors for temperature and moisture are also installed. These sensors send data
    to an Arduino microcontroller, which processes it. Aside from the sensors, the
    water pump''s actuator is also connected to Arduino. The detected data is then
    sent serially to the Raspberry Pi3 control unit for machine learning. In order
    to predict soil moisture and temperature in different soil conditions (dry, slightly
    dry, wet, slightly wet), machine learning is used on the Pi3 control units. The
    projected output is sent to Arduino as a command, which activates the pump and
    waters the field. Finally, the irrigated field data is saved in a Cloud Webpage
    accessible by farmers. Fig. 11. The flow chart of the Proposed Framework. Show
    All SECTION V. Results and Discussion Wheat crop data collection using the proposed
    smart system for IoT-based PA has been successful, and the setup has been evaluated
    for both the condensed and practical versions. The soil moisture is checked in
    various climates and the findings are interpreted correctly. As a result of the
    varied environmental conditions, various readings were obtained. In a variety
    of climates, the temperature was measured and reported. Zigbee was used to transmit
    data wirelessly, allowing for the transport of data. To store the data, PHP script
    was used to create a MySQL database. Successfully obtained data from MySQL database
    used for monitoring purposes. There is a table showing the voltage resistance
    values for various soil conditions. Table I. Resistance reading from a soil moisture
    sensor Ewaid et al.[23] suggested a system for evaluating sensor results and determining
    the water needs of a given crop. Using readings and water requirements, the motor
    is automatically switched on or off. SECTION VI. Conclusions The concept of Smart
    Farming emerged from the combination of modern scientific methods with time-tested
    agricultural techniques in an effort to create agriculture that is both environmentally
    friendly and economical with its resources. Our study set out to investigate this
    shifting terrain by developing an IoT-based automated irrigation system that makes
    use of IoT, Arduino, Raspberry Pi3, and machine learning techniques. This study
    maximises efficiency in water use and take precision farming to new heights by
    including temperature and moisture sensors. The future seems promising for the
    continued development, broader implementation, and easier access to these game-changing
    technologies. Authors Figures References Keywords Metrics More Like This IoT-Based

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Greater Noida, India SECTION I. Introduction
    Both the quantity and the caliber of the food consumers want have risen, requiring
    the modernization of farmland and intricate industrial processes. Several cutting-edge
    agricultural concepts are emerging thanks to the booming Internet of Things (IoT)
    business. By connecting research organizations and medical organizations to the
    Internet of Things, that expands its scope and quickens its response time, many
    farms may get period and commodities. The aforementioned systems engage in interactions,
    detection, and linkage with embedded technology originating from both domestic
    and foreign sources, thereby constituting a constituent element of the Internet
    of Things [1]. A landslip likelihood monitoring gadget has been invented with
    a particular layout, allowing for rapid deployment in challenging environments,
    rather than relying on consumer input [2]. The company provides a standardized
    device for the IoT that visually displays variables such as air quality, soil
    moisture, atmospheric conditions, and liquid levels over a wide geographical area
    shown in Figure 1. IoT also creates precise, true representations of a number
    of ambient parameters, such as sound levels and harmful nuclear layers, & environmental
    damage of the water, air, & environment [3]. Reduced use of fertilizers and pesticides
    on crops, accuracy farming, & smart farming are all examples of recommended [4].
    sans asking for the consumer ''s feedback. This device provides a means of authority
    for the Internet of Things (IoT) and offers a visual representation of various
    parameters such as weather, soil conditions, climate, and liquid levels across
    a broad geographical region. The Internet of Things (IoT) generates accurate and
    up-to-date depictions of various environmental factors, including sound levels,
    water and air pollution, temperature fluctuations, and potentially harmful levels
    of radiation [3]. It is recommended to implement targeted agricultural practices
    and employ clever farming techniques, such as reducing the use of pesticides and
    fertilizers on crops, to mitigate the risks associated with runoff, contaminants,
    and environmental changes. Fig. 1. Traditional agricultural [52] building built
    on IOT Show All A. Remedies to issues Regarding IT architecture, there needs to
    be a wide range of bundles with accessible, transparent, & adaptable open architectural
    options. All farms must finish a basic standard in order to utilize Internet of
    things. It is essential to expand information the about Agro-Tech culture if we
    want it to become a worldwide phenomenon. This aspect must be started and progressively
    expanded with the government''s permission in order to build a safe not illegal
    activity [5]. Remarkably superior crops must also be maintained, precise animal
    development must also be done, and distinct cereals, critters, and crops must
    always be conserved, personal ring of relations agriculture must be practiced,
    & organic agriculture must be practiced. [6]. The article presents notable improvements
    to the field of IoT farming. The second section provides an account of the historical
    development of IoT farm technological advances. In Section 3, the administration
    of smart farms based on the Internet of Things (IoT) is presented. Section 4 presents
    the categorization for smart farming. The significant advantages of utilizing
    the Internet of Things (IOT) technology in precision agriculture are enumerated
    in the subsequent sections. Part 6 of the study scrutinizes the issues and unresolved
    queries pertaining to IoT-driven intelligent agriculture from diverse perspectives.
    The findings of this inquiry have been succinctly outlined in Section 7, located
    at the conclusion of this document. SECTION II. Literature Review To increase
    production while reducing labour expenses, researchers have created a variety
    of Internet-of-Things-based fully horticultural gadgets. Scientists have been
    working on certain IoT-based totally agricultural initiatives to boost the company''s
    overall efficiency and quality. From the books, certain IoT-based totally agrarian
    techniques were found and compiled in this article [7]. Explains an entirely aquaponics
    security system that uses WSNs and has parts for monitoring CO2, wetness, temps,
    and illumination. To improve productivity, a real-time gadget for viewing rice
    yield was developed. explains an agricultural monitoring system that uses rain
    and thermometer data to monitor fields, reduce crop failure, and boost productivity.
    [8] An inexpensive Wi-Fi gadget with a microcomputer that notwithstanding serves
    as a meteorology station for tracking farm parameters including temperatures is
    indicated by this term. Potential downsides today include the equipment'' short
    spoken connectivity as well as the requirement for measuring system through Wi-Fi
    connectivity to smart phones. A pressure-detecting ZigBee-based, fully advanced
    sensor platforms, humidity, sunlight, and temperature has been developed by [9].
    To measure environmental elements like temperature and moisture while providing
    alternatives for crop and soil monitoring that are both inexpensive and quick,
    a system built the stack of GSM with FPGA was selected [10]. Provides a low-cost,
    straightforward [11], & flexible communication technology that utilize flexible
    controls to keep track of varied green - house parameters. The operations & architecture
    strategies for WSN have also been outlined in [12] for a higher advanced supervision
    & operations monitoring in the conservatories. Environmental concerns like electrostatic
    effect, Wi-Fi network loading, & WSN resource control have all been handled. [14]
    Created a method for monitoring an animal''s wellness & identifying common ailments
    that are caused by organic or anthropogenic factors... SECTION III. Iot-Based
    Smart Agriculture Management By giving growers a variety of possibilities to address
    the several problems they encounter on various farm, the Internet of Things is
    revolutionizing the agricultural industry. Landowners have access to their property
    at any moment and from almost anywhere thanks to detectors and controllers. WiFi
    surveillance connections are used to make this feasible. With IoT-enabled technology,
    agricultural production costs might go down as crop yield rises [15] shown in
    Figure 2. Fig. 2. IoT-based intelligent [52] agriculture''s function Show All
    A. Control of water: The precise amount of moisture required in conservatories
    is a crucial problem [16]. A smart phone is employed for storing the data to the
    internet while the devices are utilized to show however much water is in the reserve.
    Up to 50% of all this water disappears in traditional irrigation systems owing
    to deals to achieve higher sales as a consequence of limitations in trying to
    cut irrigation methods and frameworks [17] shown in Figure 3. Fig. 3. Water management
    system [55] Show All B. Irrigation management: The responsibility for overseeing
    watering frameworks, as well as their design, improvement, operation, and maintenance,
    falls under its purview. Farmer''s watering [18] design can be enhanced by favorable
    soil & weather characteristics. The IoTs has enabled intelligent watering design
    architectural to adapt to soil characteristics, weather patterns, environmental
    variables, and water system boundaries [19] shown in Figure 4. Soil administration
    necessitates the careful consideration of various soil factors, such as pH and
    moisture levels. With the aid of the Internet of Things, these measurements can
    be readily generated. Water and humidity gauges are utilized to monitor the soil''s
    dampness level. The findings of a soil analysis survey aid agricultural practitioners
    in enhancing crop yield through the provision of suggestions for fertilization
    techniques [20]. In addition, the agricultural sector benefits from safeguarding
    against excessive fertilization and crop harm through the implementation of Internet
    of Things (IoT) technology for identifying contaminated soil. Fig. 4. Irrigation
    management [56] Show All In order to regulate soil conditions, it is necessary
    to select various soil parameters such as pH and humidity levels. The generation
    of these metrics can be facilitated through the utilization of Internet of Things
    (IoT) devices. Water and humidity gauges are utilized to monitor the moisture
    content of the soil level. The findings of a survey conducted to examine soil
    testing aid farmers in enhancing crop yield by offering suggestions for fertilization
    techniques [20]. In addition, the agricultural sector is safeguarded from the
    adverse effects of excessive fertilization and crop harm through the implementation
    of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, which facilitates the identification of
    contaminated soil [21]. C. Precision farming: Physical examination was a standard
    agricultural procedure for cultivating, harvesting, and maintaining crops. Whenever
    an issue arose, frequently it was rectified after extensive farm knowledge and
    instruction from errors that were made. The use of IoT in agricultural might vastly
    enhance productivity [22]. D. Nutrient management: Nutrient regulation refers
    to the method of making the highly efficient use of agriculture nutrients while
    also safeguarding [23]. E. Handling of garbage A solution for trash removal is
    offered using the IoT. IoT devices can be used to make smart waste bins. This
    is most often utilized to detect, record, & send online information on garbage.
    Garbage management is possible with the aid of clever & straightforward methods
    [24]. F. Supervision of animal This fog device is often used to track whereabouts
    of livestock and remotely check animal wellbeing. It makes use of electricity
    as well as sensors [25]. G. FMS: Farm Management System FMS is a crucial component
    of smart agriculture [26] & a microcomputer allows landowners to manage their
    whole field. For additional handling, the information may be accessible by a cellphone
    or the online after being saved at the database in the preferred formats. An automated
    irrigation and management system are used to make the most of the available water
    resources. In addition to the irrigation system, the farm is protected from animals
    and pests. [27]. H. Monitoring system: According to [28], a device for remotely
    monitoring soil quality and shape in relation to crop production goals. ZigBee
    is connected to other devices via WSN, including CMS, GSM, and GPRS, in order
    to perceive and comprehend real-time data processing. I. Harvest Management: With
    the use of a Chinese monitoring station for exact positioning systems, SVM began
    to be pushed for calculating rice output. [29] Has proven to be a successful strategy
    for instantaneously adding up coffee fruition, aiding growers in danger management
    & planning agriculture sector operations. J. IoT and blockchain combined for cultivation:
    The blockchain network is a decentralized database of activities that is updated
    and maintained by each participant. As a result of implementing modifications
    to the bitcoin blockchain recordings, it also enables repayments to users [30].
    SECTION IV. Taxonomic Analysis Of Sensible Farming In this segment, we''ve emphasized
    a just several pieces of devices, applications, & applications that are advancing
    agriculture''s intelligence shown in Figure 5. Data collection for upcoming canalization
    is the responsibility of the applications. Fig. 5. Agricultural intelligence [50]
    taxonomy Show All A. Clever Farming apps It has made available a revised variant
    of its popular ROI (return on investor) estimator for nutrient levels [31], which
    is meant to assist growers in maximizing harvests & profitability. Sirrus: It
    helps to improve communication amongst horticulturalists and farmers by improving
    local information freely available [32]. Field Operative: It collects information
    to create aesthetically engaging agricultural counting plants, among other things
    & crops, identifies dandelions, & fills out yield wellness graphs. It shows specific
    assigned projects, medicinal herbs variants, undesirable plant locations, & accurate
    Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Crop-fitness information stored
    on your computer as well as crop-fitness records from recourses in-discipline
    game planning [33]. To assist plant breeders in determining the popularity of
    various wheat varieties, Open IoT estimates humidity, air temperature, and soil
    temperature [34]. Use Isoyl Scout, a trustworthy local scout business tool, when
    driving or strolling. It has an inbuilt GPS but can also detect places manually.
    Including comments and/or a graphic with concept is another option. Rapid and
    wireless exchange of workplace and geolocation details is made possible by the
    axial loading of ISOYLscout files into MySQL [37]. AgVault 2.0: Customers can
    quickly travel to vast areas with the help of a suggestion drone [38]. By employing
    this software, the UAV''s study area, supervising angle, intersection, and device
    elevation may all be increased [36]. AgriSyncIt makes it simpler for experts and
    peasants to collaborate on solutions to issues facing the agriculture sector.
    via a settings menu for customer care over the Internet, the supervisor''s business
    might have real-time access to expansive situations, contract condition, & grower
    evaluations. [39]-[40]. B. Software for smart agriculture In order to optimize
    harvests, study & monitor fields, and provide The Internet of Things in agribusiness
    integrates robotic system, robotics, far-reaching detectors, & device foresight
    with ever gadget mastery and supercomputing shipment, providing suggestions for
    time- & money-saving agricultural regulate practices. Programme [41]. C. Smart
    agriculture hardware In this section, we''ve highlighted some well-used IoT devices
    for agricultural. The IoT''s greatest important inserted framework may be sensors.
    These gadgets rely on electrical parts, components for sensors & radio intensity
    setups [42]. SECTION V. Advantages Of Iot-Based Intelligant Agriculture Smart
    agricultural structures can handle a larger variety of capitals, decrease waste,
    and boost productivity by using satellite technology. Productive rural methods
    include the farmers constantly monitoring the condition of the soil while not
    in the field. Yet, as fields have grown larger, it has been more challenging for
    growers to keep count of just about everything. regulating crop output and figuring
    crucial major growth elements, including So, in clever agricultural, assuring
    the planned crop''s results are measured on aspects like dampness, fertilizer,
    or resource material gadget [43]. Detection systems and apps operate the system
    from farm to plate, reducing costs, raising output and customer satisfaction,
    and advances the farming pleasure [44]. Specific IoT deployment is challenging
    and plagued with many unknown concerns. This section talks about a few of the
    topics that were raised in the works. IoT standardization: There are several difficulties
    in converting the existing software as well as internet standards to real items
    on the network [45]. With the many different devices that make up the Internet
    of Things, it is difficult to establish elevated amounts of connectivity. This
    information can be used to provide analyses [46]. Security: Modifications to the
    external surroundings, such as cut or attacks using rodents and creatures, as
    well as structural alterations [47]. Reliability: The Internet of Things'' potential
    participants are made to be used outdoors. IoT systems & mountable gadgets should
    be kept physically safe [48]. The implementation of smart agriculture involves
    the utilization of a diverse array of interconnected devices and sensors, thereby
    necessitating the creation of a sophisticated Internet of Things (IoT) control
    framework that can effectively identify and regulate each individual node [49].
    The current entrances and protocols have the capability to support a diverse range
    of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and nodes. Sigfox is capable of supporting
    up to 106 nodes. The task of interconnecting numerous sensor nodes in the domain
    of smart agriculture poses a considerable networking obstacle. The availability
    of cells for cameras is constrained, despite the fact that the devices execute
    intricate computations that necessitate a diverse array of voltages [50]-[51].
    Cost: There are several hurdles associated with implementing IoT in agro, such
    startup and operating expenses. Technical expenses for IoT, ports, phones, and
    ground station equipment all covered by the initial investment. A monthly fee
    charge for IoT tool administration, information sharing, and other activities,
    together with centralized sources that supply information and data collection,
    are also included in operating expenses [52]-[53]. SECTION VI. Conclusion This
    page provides a thorough analysis of the subject while also outlining some cutting-edge
    ideas. Very great research papers on IoT-based agriculture. The model is comprised
    of 67 papers that were handpicked. The discussion then moved on to some few IoT
    agricultural uses, sensor systems, and web technologies. The fact that so many
    nations support this kind of study and so many nations have IoT agriculture rules
    is the most encouraging aspect. The understanding of the essential Sensor agricultural
    components is also important. Last but not least, future research prospects for
    Sensor scientists and researchers was considered as well. Authors Figures References

    Location: Shah Alam, Malaysia Funding Agency: SECTION I. Introduction Agriculture
    is an important sector in Malaysia, contributing significantly to the country’s
    economy and food security. Because urbanization, industrialization, and climate
    change have increased competition for water resources, water conservation is critical
    for sustainable agriculture [1]. Excessive water use in agriculture can harm the
    ecosystem. Over-irrigation can cause water logging, which depletes soil oxygen
    levels and harms plant growth. Furthermore, improper irrigation practices can
    contribute to soil erosion and runoff, contaminating water and nutrient loss [2].
    Water conservation and the use of effective irrigation systems can help to mitigate
    these environmental effects. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a networked system
    of interconnected objects, sensors, and computer systems collaborating to complete
    preprogrammed tasks [3]. IoT is making inroads into agriculture, with several
    techniques for implementing smart irrigation, such as humidity and soil moisture
    sensors (SMS) [4]. IoT-enabled irrigation systems can control irrigation processes
    automatically based on sensor data and specified criteria. For example, when soil
    moisture falls below a given level, the system can automatically activate irrigation
    to maintain optimal moisture conditions. This automation lowers manual involvement,
    improves accuracy, and ensures timely water application, which results in more
    effective water consumption. Irrigation involves artificially applying water to
    agricultural land for crop production. The amount of water needed for the soil
    depends on soil moisture and temperature. The effectiveness of irrigation plays
    a significant role in the entire growth process, and using modern technology for
    automation in irrigation systems can lead to improved irrigation management [5].
    Typically, irrigation systems have been operated manually using traditional techniques.
    However, there is a potential to replace these methods with automated irrigation
    approaches to ensure efficient and effective water usage. In the past, farmers
    would personally oversee the irrigation process in their fields. However, with
    the increasing demands of managing agricultural activities and other occupations,
    sensor-based automated irrigation systems offer a promising solution by eliminating
    the requirement for the farmer’s presence during the irrigation process. The paper
    is structured as follows. Section II presents the literature review covering related
    work. Section III thoroughly explains the research methodology for developing
    the prototype. Section IV presents the results and discussion, while Section V
    concludes with the findings and future research directions. SECTION II. Literature
    Review Water is a precious and invaluable resource, essential for sustaining life
    and maintaining the balance of ecosystems. Among its diverse applications, agriculture
    emerges as one of the foremost water consumers on a global scale. According to
    the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations [6], the agricultural
    sector accounts for 70% of the total freshwater usage worldwide. This statistic
    underscores agricultural water consumption’s profound impact on the planet’s water
    resources. Unfortunately, the problem of inadequate water availability presents
    a significant obstacle in various parts of the world, intensifying the urgency
    for efficient approaches to water management yearly [7]. In this particular situation,
    the considerable water requirements of agriculture emerge as a primary element
    aggravating the overall challenge of water scarcity. Resolving this matter requires
    examining and adopting inventive measures to enhance water utilization in farming
    methods. An irrigation system supplies controlled amounts of water to crops, gardens,
    or landscapes to support plant growth and maintain optimal soil moisture levels
    [8]. It involves the artificial application of water to compensate for natural
    rainfall deficiencies or to supplement existing water sources. Irrigation systems
    are designed to distribute water efficiently and effectively, ensuring that plants
    receive the required amount of water without excessive waste or runoff. A control
    system is used to regulate the operation of the irrigation system. It may include
    manual or automated controls for turning the system on or off, adjusting flow
    rates, and setting irrigation schedules [9]. A. Strengths and Weaknesses of the
    Existing Systems Some of the current smart crop watering or irrigation systems
    include Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller, RainMachine, Gardena Smart System,
    Orbit B-hyve Smart Watering System and Netro Smart Sprinkler Controller. Table
    I shows some of the strengths and weaknesses of the abovementioned systems. TABLE
    I Strengths and Weaknesses of the Existing Systems B. Features Comparison between
    the Existing System A thorough review of the existing systems has been made. Comparisons
    based on the listed features are shown in Table II. The elements covered are how
    the data are gathered, water distribution uniformity, labour requirement, cost-effectiveness,
    and potential for automation and remote monitoring. TABLE II Features Comparison
    Between the Existing Systems Based on the table, the Rachio Smart Sprinkler Controller
    and RainMachine have some differences in sensor options, with Rachio offering
    more sensor options with rain, soil, and flow sensors. The Orbit B-Hyve Smart
    Watering System uses local weather data and forecasts to delay or change the watering
    schedule. The Netro Smart Sprinkler Controller offers a touchscreen with basic
    on-device controls and support for 16 zones. In terms of cost-effectiveness, the
    Orbit B-Hyve Smart Watering System is the least expensive smart sprinkler controller
    one can buy. However, all the systems are designed to be water-efficient, with
    features such as weather-based scheduling and soil moisture sensors. The systems
    generally provide uniform water distribution, but this may depend on the quality
    of the irrigation system and the specific settings used. The systems are designed
    to be low-maintenance and require minimal labour. The systems are generally adaptable
    to different crop types, but this may depend on the specific method and how it
    is configured. The systems are designed to be environmentally friendly, with features
    such as water-saving technology and reduced runoff. The systems are generally
    easy to use, with features like smartphone apps and intuitive interfaces. All
    systems have the potential for automation and remote monitoring, with features
    such as scheduling and alerts. The development and implementation of our smart
    crop watering system prototype, which optimizes water usage and minimizes wastage
    through precision irrigation techniques, directly contributes to SDG 6, Target
    6.5 [14] by promoting integrated water resource management and ensuring sustainable
    water withdrawals, aiming to substantially increase water-use efficiency in agriculture
    while safeguarding ecosystem services and reducing water-related risks. SECTION
    III. Materials and Methods SCWS development methods and materials are two critical
    components of the project. The methods refer to how the research was conducted,
    whereas the materials are the tools and parts used during the project’s development.
    A. Materials This smart crop watering system makes use of several electrical components.
    The components include the ESP8266 microcontroller, ESP8266 baseboard, a 3V relay,
    a 5V DC pump, 9V batteries, a soil moisture sensor, a DHT11 sensor, and an OLED
    screen. The main control unit is the ESP8266 microcontroller, which provides Wi-Fi
    connectivity and stable pin connections for reading and transmitting soil moisture,
    temperature, and humidity data to the cloud. Its primary duties include data collection,
    processing, and communication. The soil moisture sensor measures the moisture
    level in the soil and tells when to water the crops. The DHT11 sensor measures
    air humidity and temperature, which are important factors in determining crop
    watering needs. The DC pump supplies water to the crops, and the relay acts as
    a switch to control the pump’s operation. The microcontroller can activate or
    deactivate the pump by holding the power transmitted to the relay. The 9V battery
    serves as the system’s primary power source. Finally, for easy monitoring, the
    OLED screen displays important sensor readings. The main software tools used to
    develop this project are the Arduino IDE, MIT App Inventor, and Firebase. For
    programming the ESP8266 microcontroller, the Arduino IDE is used. It provides
    an easy-to-use interface for writing, compiling, and uploading code to a microcontroller.
    To design the system’s interface and add functionality to the application, MIT
    App Inventor is used. Another software component in the system is Firebase, which
    allows data from the DHT11 and soil moisture sensors to be sent to the Firebase
    Real-time Database. This information is displayed within the system’s application
    for easy access and monitoring. B. Methods The study is based on a quantitative
    design and focuses on secondary data collection. The method used in developing
    the SCWS can be divided into two parts which are the system block diagram and
    the circuit diagram. 1) SCWS Block Diagram The block diagram for the SCWS is shown
    in Fig. 1. The soil moisture sensor and DHT11 detect soil moisture, temperature,
    and humidity. Once the data has been collected, the ESP8266 analyzes the data
    to determine whether the relay is triggered and whether the DC pump should be
    turned on or off. A below or equal to 30% soil moisture reading triggers the relay
    to turn the DC pump on. It also sends the data to the Firebase Real-time Database.
    From the real-time database, the data is transmitted to the SCWS application,
    making it easy for the user to get real-time data on soil moisture, humidity and
    temperature surrounding their plants. Fig. 1. SCWS block diagram. Show All 2)
    Circuit Diagram The proper and secure electrical component connections are paramount
    due to their crucial role in ensuring the safe and efficient functioning of the
    system. Fig. 2 overviews the connections between various components, including
    the ESP8266, baseboard, DHT11, OLED display, soil moisture sensor, 5V dc pump,
    2 9V batteries, and a 3V relay. Fig. 2. Circuit diagram. Show All The primary
    power source for the sensors and OLED display is a 9V battery connected to a jack
    cover, which is then linked to the jack port of the ESP8266 baseboard. The connections
    for the soil moisture sensor are relatively straightforward: the VCC pin is connected
    to a 3V pin on the baseboard, the GND pin is connected to the GND pin on the baseboard,
    and the A0 pin is connected to the A0 pin on the baseboard. As for the DHT11 sensor,
    its positive (+) pin is connected to the 3V pin of the baseboard, while the negative
    (-) pin is connected to the GND pin of the baseboard. The ''out'' pin of the DHT11
    sensor is connected to the D4 pin on the baseboard. It is important to note that
    the soil moisture data is collected through an analogue pin, whereas the temperature
    and humidity data are collected through a digital pin. The following steps must
    be taken to establish the connections between the OLED display and the baseboard.
    First, the OLED display''s VCC (power) pin is connected to a 3V pin on the baseboard.
    Next, the OLED display''s GND (ground) pin is connected to a GND pin on the baseboard.
    The display''s SCL (serial clock) pin is then connected to the D1 pin of the baseboard,
    while the SDA (serial data) pin of the display is connected to the D2 pin of the
    baseboard. Regarding the relay, the VCC pin of the relay is connected to the 3V
    pin on the baseboard for the power supply. The GND pin of the relay is connected
    to the GND pin on the baseboard for grounding. Finally, the ''IN'' pin of the
    relay is connected to the D6 pin on the baseboard to control its activation. By
    establishing these connections, the OLED display can communicate with the baseboard,
    and the baseboard can control the relay through the specified pins. The NO (Normally
    Open) configuration selection for the relay connection offers distinct advantages
    over the NC (Normally Closed) design, specifically regarding system control and
    resource optimization. By establishing the connection between the NO pin and the
    power pin of the 5V dc pump and linking the COM pin to the power pin of the 9V
    battery cover, an essential pathway for power distribution is created. The negative
    pin of the pump and the battery cover are interconnected to ensure proper functionality.
    The decision to utilize the NO pin instead of the NC pin is motivated by the need
    for precise and selective power delivery to the pump based on a specific trigger
    condition: the soil moisture level falling below 30%. This configuration ensures
    that the pump receives power exclusively when the trigger condition is met, safeguarding
    against unnecessary activation when the soil moisture exceeds the desired threshold.
    Opting for the NO configuration mitigates potential issues associated with a continuous
    and unrestricted power supply to the pump. In contrast, if the NC configuration
    were employed, the pump would remain powered continuously, irrespective of the
    soil moisture level, leading to suboptimal resource utilization, as the pump would
    continue operating even when the soil moisture is already above the desired threshold.
    Such inefficiency could result in excessive watering, potentially harming plants
    and wasting valuable energy and water resources. Fig. 3 illustrates the envisioned
    SCWS prototype, which automatically irrigates the plant crop at regular intervals
    based on sensor readings, resulting in water conservation and reducing the need
    for human intervention. Fig. 3. Prototype of SCWS. Show All SECTION IV. Result
    and Discussion This study aims to address the shortcomings of traditional irrigation
    methods by designing and implementing a smart crop watering system. The system
    was developed to enhance irrigation scheduling, effectively tackle issues of over-watering
    and underwatering, and minimize the environmental impact associated with conventional
    practices. Through comprehensive testing on a soil container, the prototype system
    demonstrated accurate monitoring and analysis of crucial parameters, including
    soil moisture, humidity, and temperature. Notably, the system showcased its ability
    to conserve water by withholding irrigation when soil moisture levels exceeded
    a predetermined threshold, thereby mitigating nutrient leaching caused by excessive
    watering. The successful implementation of this smart irrigation system presents
    a significant advancement in agricultural practices, paving the way for sustainable
    and efficient crop cultivation. Testing was conducted for six hours in a single
    day, during which data were collected from the soil moisture sensor and the DHT11
    sensor. This data was then visualized as a line graph illustrating the observed
    trends. The soil moisture sensor primarily detected variations in soil moisture
    levels, while the DHT11 sensor recorded temperature and air humidity. The collected
    data, presented in Fig. 4, demonstrated the fluctuation in soil moisture levels
    over time. Fig. 4. Soil moisture (%) from the soil moisture sensor. Show All At
    2:00 p.m., the soil moisture percentage stood at 70% and gradually declined to
    68% by 2:30 p.m. Subsequently, at 3:00 p.m., there was only a marginal decrease
    of 1%, resulting in a reading of 67%, followed by a further decline to 65% at
    3:30 p.m. This gradual reduction continued until 4:00 p.m., when the soil moisture
    percentage reached 62%. By 4:30 p.m., the rate dropped to 58%; at 5:00 p.m., it
    decreased by an additional 4% to get 54%. Similarly, at 5:30 p.m., there was a
    3% decline, bringing the reading to 51%. At 6:00 p.m., another 3% decrease was
    recorded, resulting in a reading of 48%. However, at 6:30 p.m., the decline slowed
    to 2%, with the percentage reading at 46%. At 7:00 p.m., the soil moisture level
    measured 43%, followed by 41% at 7:30 p.m. and 39% at 8:00 p.m. Throughout the
    6hour testing period, the data consistently indicated a gradual decline in soil
    moisture levels, ranging from a 1% to a 4% reduction per reading. As the soil
    moisture level remained above the threshold of 30%, there was no need for the
    system to activate the watering process. It is anticipated, however, that the
    system would have been triggered between 10:00 p.m. and 10:30 p.m., considering
    the observed trends and moisture level progression. Fig. 5 provides an overview
    of the temperature fluctuations recorded during the testing period obtained from
    the DHT11 sensor readings. Fig. 5. Temperature ( ∘ C) data from the DHT11. Show
    All At the start of the testing, specifically at 2:00 p.m., the temperature reading
    was measured at 29.8 ∘ C . This temperature remained constant until 2:30 p.m.,
    following which it experienced a slight decrease of 0.5 ∘ C , reaching its lowest
    point at 29.3 ∘ C by 3:00 p.m. Subsequently, at 3:30 p.m., the temperature rose
    back to 29.8 ∘ C and maintained that level until 4:00 p.m. From 4:30 p.m. onwards,
    the temperature increased, reaching 30.3 ∘ C by 4:30 p.m. and peaking at 30.8
    ∘ C by 5:00 p.m. At 5:30 p.m., a slight decline was observed, with the temperature
    reading recorded at 30.2 ∘ C , which remained unchanged until 6:00 p.m. Another
    decrease occurred at 6:30 p.m., resulting in a temperature reading of 29.8 ∘ C
    and a further decline to 29.4 ∘ C at 7:00 p.m. The temperature readings at 7:30
    p.m. and 8:00 p.m. remained constant at 29.8 ∘ C . Consequently, the DHT11 sensor
    provided frequent temperature readings of 29.8 ∘ C , with the highest recorded
    reading reaching 30.8 ∘ C and the lowest at 29.3 ∘ C . The average temperature,
    determined by calculating the values throughout the testing period, was found
    to be 29.9 ∘ C . Fig. 6 depicts the air humidity readings, measured in percentage
    (%), obtained from the DHT11 sensor. Fig. 6. Humidity (%) data from the DHT11
    Show All At 2:00 p.m., the initial air humidity reading was recorded at 80%, which
    remained constant for one hour until 3:00 p.m. Subsequently, at 3:30 p.m., a slight
    increase in humidity was observed, reaching 81%, which remained stable until 4:00
    p.m. However, there was a notable decrease in humidity at 4:30 p.m., with a reading
    of 77%. This decrease could be attributed to the rising temperature, which resulted
    in drier air. The humidity percentage then increased to 79% at 5:00 p.m., followed
    by a further increase to 82% at 5:30 p.m. By 6:00 p.m., the humidity level stood
    at 81%, but it experienced another rise, reaching 84%. Between 7:00 p.m. and 8:00
    p.m., the humidity peaked at 84% and remained constant for the remainder of the
    testing period. Consequently, the lowest recorded humidity during the testing
    period was 77%, while the highest recorded humidity was 84%. The average humidity
    calculated based on the gathered data was 81.3%. Based on the figures obtained
    from the study, it is evident that when the soil moisture levels exceed the threshold
    of 30%, the pumping mechanism remains inactive, thereby preventing any further
    increase in moisture content. Notably, the soil moisture level steadily diminishes
    at a consistent rate of 2.4% per half hour. Analyzing the data in Fig. 5 and Fig.
    6 provides valuable insights into the environmental conditions surrounding the
    soil placement, revealing a warm and humid climate with an average temperature
    of 29.9 ∘ C and an intermediate humidity level of 81.3%. These crucial data points
    are subsequently transmitted to the user''s smartphone via the SCWS application,
    enabling them to monitor the system remotely conveniently. SECTION V. Conclusion
    Our prototype stands out due to its unique features and capabilities, setting
    it apart from other smart sprinkler controller systems. While competitors offer
    various sensor options and weather-based scheduling, we optimize water usage and
    minimize wastage through precision irrigation techniques. It aligns directly with
    SDG 6, Target 6.5, emphasizing integrated water resource management and sustainable
    water withdrawals in agriculture. By using precision irrigation, our prototype
    ensures water is applied precisely, reducing losses from evaporation and runoff.
    It maximizes water-use efficiency and minimizes environmental impact, supporting
    broader sustainable agriculture and water resource management goals. Our dedication
    to achieving SDG 6, Target 6.5, underscores our commitment to responsibly addressing
    global water scarcity challenges in agriculture. By promoting sustainable water
    practices, we contribute to safeguarding ecosystem services and reducing water-related
    risks for future generations. The prototype''s automation and remote monitoring
    capabilities enhance irrigation management, providing real-time data, alerts,
    and remote adjustments for informed decision-making. To enhance the system further,
    we aim to make it compatible with all soil and crop types. SCWS is a crucial first
    step in addressing farmers'' irrigation challenges. Its development brings us
    closer to realizing the vision of water-saving in agriculture. With ongoing improvements
    and advancements, we can make significant strides in achieving water efficiency
    and sustainability in agriculture, positively impacting our environment and global
    food security. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT This research was supported by Universiti Tun Hussein

    1. Introduction Advances in technology and industry have helped humanity to increase
    life quality and expectancy. This includes delegating laborious processes traditionally
    performed by hand to machines that can perform these tasks more efficiently. However,
    it has brought with it several problems as well [1] relating to the overexploitation
    and nonrational use of Earth’s natural resources, which in turn causes disruption
    of the natural balance expressed by climate change effects, such as global warming
    and severe climate events (droughts, flooding, storms, hurricanes, etc.). In response
    to this alarming situation, humanity is asked more than ever to rethink and reconsider
    its way of dealing with the environment, especially in the context of a world
    population that grows at a higher rate [2]. This puts a lot of pressure on our
    food systems to meet the increasing demand and feed the planet. Agriculture is
    the sector that must be addressed, and agricultural management practices need
    to be optimized and become more efficient and sustainable to address these challenges.
    With water resources as an example, agriculture comes in as the largest consumer
    of this resource, with about an average of 70% in use around the world [3]. In
    this sector, water resources are used mainly in irrigation activities that still
    follow unsustainable methods such as gravity irrigation, the most widely used
    type of irrigation globally [4,5]. Additionally, even when using modern methods
    of irrigation, such as drip irrigation, they can be inefficient in the absence
    of good management [6]. The crucial step to achieving an efficient irrigation
    system, whatever the type of irrigation system used, is to know the proper amount
    of water to supply and the time to apply it (when and how much). To this end,
    we need to monitor either the soil, the crop, or the weather. Monitoring the weather
    enables the estimation of evapotranspiration (ET), which is the sum of transpiration
    from plants and soil surface evaporation. Accurately estimating this parameter
    allows compensation of the lost water quantity to the atmosphere. There are two
    methods of estimating the evapotranspiration of a crop. One uses a single crop
    coefficient (Kc) that incorporates all physiological and physical variations between
    the crops and the second where the Kc is split into two separate coefficients:
    Kcb for crop transpiration and Ke for soil evaporation. The Kc coefficient, then,
    is multiplied by the reference evapotranspiration (ET0), which reflects the rate
    of evapotranspiration for a specific crop (grass). It is obtained by monitoring
    various meteorological parameters (air temperature, solar radiation, air relative
    humidity, wind speed, etc.). Therefore, weather monitoring is a key step toward
    implementing efficient irrigation systems and ensuring sustainable agriculture.
    Today, we are able to collect weather data with high spatial and temporal resolution
    thanks to advances in science and technology, including advances in remote sensing
    such as the availability of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) [7] equipped with cutting-edge
    sensors with affordable prices, satellite imagery with different spatio-temporal
    resolutions, open-access reanalysis data such as European ReAnalysis data [8],
    MERRA [9], the JRA-55 [10] or NCEP–DOE AMIP-II Reanalysis data [11]. Additionally,
    advances in the Internet of Things (IoT) field have enabled cost-effective sensor
    data acquisition [12,13,14,15,16]. This huge amount of data raised issues regarding
    the efficiency, complexity, interfaces, dynamics, robustness, and interaction
    between these new types of peer-to-peer connected systems that need to be re-examined
    on a large scale, as discussed in [17]. This unprecedented amount of generated
    data is also contributing to what is known as big data, which needs adequate infrastructure
    to be stored and gain insights for assisting agricultural decision making. This
    work aligns with this objective and is intended to provide intelligent ways to
    deal with these abundant data by applying the concepts of big data analytics and
    leveraging the potential applications of artificial intelligence in agriculture
    to help farmers minimize their risks, or at least make them more manageable, which
    represents a step towards the development of smart and precision agriculture.
    2. State of the Art Several researchers have tried to leverage the challenges
    and opportunities of the big data wave in the agricultural field and how it can
    be the driver of sustainability and precision in this sector by gaining insights
    from massive volumes of data that can be used to assist decision making. As surveyed
    in [18], big data analytics is leading to advances in various industries, but
    it has not yet been widely applied in agriculture. The work presents a range of
    suggested solutions, tools, algorithms, and data, including how they were used
    and their impact upon the sector as a whole. It also emphasizes the enormous potential
    of big data analytics in agriculture for smarter farming, demonstrating how the
    accessibility of big data analytics tools, methods, and software, as well as the
    growing openness of heterogeneous data sources (the “open data wave”), will encourage
    more academic research, public sector initiatives, and business ventures in the
    agricultural sector. The paper concludes that the adoption of big data practices
    in agriculture is still challenging and faces several obstacles when applied to
    real-world applications. In the paper [19], the authors developed a system composed
    of three components: (i) hardware to capture crop data, (ii) a web application
    for crop data and field information manipulation, and (iii) a mobile application
    to control irrigation via mobiles. The objective of this work is to analyze the
    suitability of crops in terms of air temperature, air relative humidity, and soil
    moisture to optimize future plans and strategies. The authors of the work [20]
    propose a solution to be adopted in India to help farmers face the unpredictable
    nature and variability of climate and weather circumstances. They built a system
    for managing local weather stations in real time that would keep farmers well-informed
    about the current weather conditions in advance, allowing them to make the right
    decisions at the right time and prevent crop loss. High-speed internet infrastructure
    available even in rural areas is the main motivation for conducting this work.
    It facilitates the communication of collected data to remote servers. Once received
    and analyzed, the information derived from these data gives farmers a way to automate
    their agricultural management practices (irrigation, fertilization, and harvesting)
    by triggering the right action at the right time. Article [21] also presented
    a smart weather station management system intended to be used in agriculture and
    to manage meteorological stations. It is based on Internet of Things technology
    (IoT) to minimize costs. The connected sensors measure air temperature, humidity,
    light intensity, air pressure, and wind speed. It then sends the collected data
    to the server part of the system through the Global System for Mobile Communications
    (GSM) module. The application layer is powered by the ThingSpeak platform, which
    offers standard services to the proposed system such as data visualization and
    data analysis. In regards to dealing with the challenges related to handling huge
    amounts of data generated by sensors, the paper [22] proposed a standard architecture
    for a data infrastructure platform called WALLeSMART, which is a cloud-based solution
    that provides a general architecture to handle the difficulties of gathering,
    processing, storing, and visualizing extremely large amounts of data in batch
    and real-time modes. An initial prototype has been developed and tested at various
    farms in the Wallonia region of Belgium, showing prominent results. This proposed
    system can be used as the basis for developing customized smart agricultural services
    to meet our needs. Our contributions not only propose an architecture containing
    some of the standard pipelines used in the literature to build data platforms,
    namely data acquisition, storing, visualizing, and analysis, but a complete system
    with the aim of going from data to decision making. The proposed system provides
    services such as weather time series forecasting, missing values handling using
    a multisource approach (reanalysis and situ data), and estimating important parameters
    needed in the day-to-day life of farmers, such as the evapotranspiration (ET).
    3. Study Area The study area is situated 40 km east of Marrakesh in the semiarid
    Haouz plain in the heart of Morocco (Figure 1). About 2800 ha of this area is
    irrigated, and it is nearly flat. Cereal crops such as wheat and barley are the
    main dominant crops. The region’s climate is typically Mediterranean semiarid,
    with an average annual rainfall of about 250 mm [23,24], temperatures that range
    from hot in the summer (38 °C in July) to cool in the winter (5 °C in February),
    significant daily and monthly variations that are concentrated primarily from
    autumn to spring, and an average annual ET0 of 1600 mm [25]. Figure 1. R3 district
    study area in Morocco and a Photo of the meteorological station installed. 4.
    System Architecture The proposed system is designed to enable the smart management
    of weather data, which represents the key to implementing smart agriculture. By
    monitoring and analyzing the weather effectively, we can optimize various agricultural
    management practices such as irrigation scheduling and choosing the appropriate
    crop to sow [26]. The design of the platform follows a service-oriented architecture
    (Figure 2) to offer services that address each of the four categories of big data
    analytics. As part of a descriptive data analysis that tries to understand what
    happened in the past, a scenario would be: rainfall declined, and the frequency
    changed over the last decade. The answer to why this happened, in turn, is very
    important, and it takes us to the diagnostic data analysis, where the focus is
    to identify anomalies in data to explain the reasons behind events, such as linking
    this event with long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns observed
    in weather evolution charts. The third type covered by the platform is predictive
    data analysis. It looks beyond the present and tries to predict the future using
    statistical methods and machine learning algorithms that learn from historical
    data in an iterative approach, trying to identify the optimal way to predict the
    future. One such service is weather forecasting. The output of the forecasting
    service can be used to support decision making about what actions to take that
    aim to prevent severe events from occurring in the future. This is carried out
    through the last type, which is prescriptive data analysis. Figure 2. General
    architecture of the platform. The platform can be decomposed into four main layers:
    the data acquisition layer, the data storage layer, the processing layer, and
    the application layer. 4.1. Data Acquisition Layer Heterogeneous data from a variety
    of sources, including meteorological station data, IoT weather sensors, reanalysis
    data, third-party meteorological services, and raw files (CSV, Excel, etc.), are
    used as the input for this layer. The concept of big data is introduced to the
    field by the volume, velocity, and variety that characterize these data. Missing
    values are handled in this layer using the method developed in Section 4.4.1 prior
    to being stored in the NoSQL MongoDB database. 4.1.1. Weather Station Data The
    weather dataset used in this study was collected from a meteorological station
    installed in the study area (Figure 1) at the half-hour scale from 2013 to 2020.
    The used tower is equipped with different sensors [27,28] to measure: Incoming
    solar radiation using (Kipp and Zonen CM5 Pyranometer, Delft, The Netherlands).
    Air temperature in Kelvin, relative humidity (R3_Hr, as a fraction between 0 and
    1) and vapor pressure by using (HMP45C, Vaisala, Helsinki, Finland). Wind speed
    using (A100R Anemometer, R.M. Young Company, Traverse City, MI, USA). Rainfall
    using (FSS500 Tipping Bucket Automatic Rain Gauge, Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan,
    UT, USA). Next, records are stored in data loggers before being collected manually
    by agents or sent to a centralized server via a cellular connection. A full description
    of these data is shown in Table 1, which also includes statistics for missing
    values. Table 1. Meteorological station data description. 4.1.2. ERA5-Land Reanalysis
    Data Advances in measurement technologies have enabled us to use various observation
    methods to monitor the Earth’s weather, including weather stations, weather balloons,
    and satellite imagery, to name a few. However the distribution of these observation
    methods does not cover the entire globe, they may have overlapping footprints
    between covered areas, and fewer of them were available in the past, which makes
    it challenging to conduct studies of past years. To deal with this, climate reanalysis
    emerges as a new way of trying to deliver a complete picture of the past and of
    the entire globe by combining the laws of physics, modern weather models, and
    available weather sources. Such data, if accurate, are crucial and will certainly
    assist decision making in several domains such as smart cities, smart management
    of renewable energy stations, sustainable and climate-smart agriculture [29,30],
    climate change assessments, hydrology [31], and much more. In our study, we used
    the fifth generation of European ReAnalysis (ERA5-Land) [32] available to be downloaded
    for free through the Climate Data Store (CDS) web platform [33]. ERA5-Land is
    the successor to ERA5 [8], which in turn is the successor to ERA-Interim [34].
    This new product covers the period from 1950 to the present. ERA5-Land has the
    benefit over the predecessors of its high horizontal resolution (9 km against
    31 km for ERA5 and 80 km for ERA-Interim). These strengths were achieved thanks
    to the integration of the ECMWF land surface model forced by the ERA5 climate
    reanalysis with corrected elevation for the thermodynamic near-surface state and
    then applied to Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. The data used in this
    study concern the two pixels that cover our study area (Figure 3). We downloaded
    ERA5-Land weather data from 2013 to 2020. Since the cloud service Climate Data
    Store API (cdsapi) has a limit of 100,000 records per request, we downloaded each
    year separately and combined them all at the end. The downloaded data were then
    converted to a pandas dataframe data structure using the Python language. We also
    developed a function called “get_era5_land_grib_as_dataframe”, available as a
    part of the GIS class of the public library Data Science Toolkit (DST) [35] that
    accepts an ERA5-Land grip file as a parameter and returns a pandas dataframe,
    which is the most commonly used data structure in the data science field. The
    full description of the downloaded parameters is described in Table 2. Figure
    3. The projection of ERA5-Land pixels over the study area. Table 2. ERA5-Land
    downloaded data description. 4.2. Data Storage Layer In our system, most of the
    collected data are time series (meteorological data, reanalysis data, satellite
    data, etc.). This type is characterized mainly by variety (multisource), volume,
    and velocity (each half-hour). To deal with this, the system uses MongoDB, a big-data-driven
    database for storing and retrieving meteorological data. The choice of using the
    MongoDB database comes after several strengths it presents and its suitability
    for our use case, including that it was designed to replace or enhance the classic
    Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS), providing it with a variety of
    additional characteristics such as scalability being schema-less. It is also powerful
    at handling large amounts of real-time data and efficiently handling memory, as
    it is written using the C++ programming language. Not to mention the geospatial
    indexing feature, which makes it perfect for real-time geospatial data collection
    and analysis. Figure 4 shows the Entity Relationship Diagram of the weather data
    subcomponent. Figure 4. The Entity Relationship Diagram used in the climate database
    design; ta: air temperature (R3_Tair), rg: global solar radiation (R3_Rg), hr:
    air relative humidity (R3_Hr), p: rainfall (R3_P), ws: wind speed (R3_Vv), wd:
    wind direction (R3_Dv). 4.3. Data Processing Layer The data processing layer takes
    the data from the data storage layer as input and applies the statistical, machine
    learning, and deep learning models to gain insights from the data and turn that
    into services (Figure 2). 4.3.1. Statistical Models Statistical models are used
    in this platform for forecasting purposes. Initially, the model Facebook Prophet
    [36] was used to conduct long-term weather time series forecasting, since it was
    tested on the same data in previous work. 4.3.2. Machine Learning Models The system
    also makes use of machine learning models, given the fact that they can perform
    well on small datasets, for example, the XGBoost [37] model for reference evapotranspiration
    estimation based on stored metrological data [38]. 4.3.3. Deep Learning Models
    Deep learning models or neural networks have gained success in solving complex
    tasks that were previously human-specific and have required some level of human
    intelligence to be solved in different fields. They derive their power by trying
    to mimic the way the human brain works. They are composed of neurons able to process
    huge amounts of data in order to map the output from a set of inputs using internal
    mathematical operations. These neurons are organized into groups called layers
    and, during the propagation of signals between layers in two senses (Forward and
    backpropagation), the deep learning network learns to perform tasks. In our case,
    this is a regression task, where the input is ERA5-Land reanalysis data and the
    output is meteorological station data. 4.4. Application Layer The application
    layer contains multiple services related to weather times series. 4.4.1. Time
    Series Data Imputation Service It is common in real-world meteorological data
    to have missing values for various reasons. Missing values can be due to a network
    error or due to technical issues with certain measurement sensors, etc. These
    missing data can affect the performance of any type of model (machine learning,
    numerical, physical, etc.). As such, they need to be identified and handled efficiently
    during the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing stages. There are
    several techniques for dealing with missing data depending on the use case: Deletion:
    Deleting rows or columns with missing values will remove this unwanted type of
    data from our dataset, but it may drastically reduce the size of the dataset,
    especially in the context of data scarcity. Imputation in time series data: In
    the case of a time series with a trend and seasonality, missing data can be replaced
    using seasonal adjustment, such as using the data from the same period of the
    previous year, which is the case for most weather data. However, this method may
    not be as efficient due to changes in weather patterns around the world. In contrast,
    if the time series do not present a trend or a seasonality, it can be treated
    the same way as imputation for a normal dataset. Imputation in normal datasets:
    Replacing it using statistical measures of central tendencies such as the mean,
    median, or mode of a given window of data that require some assumptions about
    the distribution type of the data to be efficient. This service proposes an approach
    based on reanalysis data and artificial intelligence to build models that can
    learn rules to map ERA5-Land reanalysis data to station meteorological data, which
    is also useful for the surrounding regions of our study area (Section 3), since
    we are in relatively homogeneous areas in terms of elevation and climate. We use
    the ERA5-Land data presented in Section 4.1.2 and two different architectures
    of deep learning models. The steps to implement the method workflow are shown
    in Figure 5. Figure 5. The flowchart of the deep learning approach. a. Exploratory
    data analysis Before implementing the proposed machine learning approach, exploratory
    data analysis (EDA) was the first exercise we conducted. It enabled us to understand
    our collected data, as well as to create hypotheses for further analysis and investigation.
    In this step, we made no underlying assumptions about the variables, and we were
    guided only by the observed data. We first calculated the correlation matrix (Figure
    6). This matrix allowed us to choose potential estimators for each target variable.
    Table 3 shows in the second column the potential estimators based on correlation
    coefficients (|r| > 0.5 means high relationships between variables). In the third
    column are the estimators that are used in the literature. Figure 6. The correlation
    heatmap and hierarchical clustering of the station and ERA5-Land parameters. Table
    3. Potential estimators of meteorological parameters. The variable 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 in
    the matrix is calculated using the rule of thumb (Equation (1)), which uses both
    air temperature ( 𝑡2𝑚 ) and dewpoint temperature ( 𝑑2𝑚 ) to estimate air relative
    humidity efficiently for moist air (relative humidity above 50 percent) [39].
    According to the matrix, 𝑅3_𝐻𝑟 has a high negative correlation with 𝑡2𝑚 but a
    very weak correlation with 𝑑2𝑚 . Despite this, using the latter ( 𝑑2𝑚 ) combined
    with 𝑡2𝑚 gives a correlation of 0.87 for 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 instead of −0.77, if we take
    only 𝑡2𝑚 into consideration. This motivated us to take both variables as input
    to neural networks for the estimation of 𝑅3 _ 𝐻𝑟 . This is also a confirmation
    for other rule-based (physics-based) approximations that use the same variables
    for air relative humidity estimation derived from the Magnus formula [40] (Equation
    (2)). 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟=100−5(𝑡2𝑚−𝑑2𝑚) (1) 𝑑2𝑚= 𝜆(ln( 𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 100 ))+ 𝛽.𝑡2𝑚 𝜆+𝑡2𝑚 𝛽−(ln(
    𝑒𝑟𝑎5_ℎ𝑟 100 )+ 𝛽.𝑡2𝑚 𝜆+𝑡2𝑚 ) (2) Equation (2) is valid for air temperatures ranging
    from −45 to 60 degrees Celsius, the Magnus parameters are, in this case, 𝛽 = 17.62
    and 𝜆 = 243.12 degrees Celsius. For global solar radiation ( 𝑅3_𝑅𝑔 ), the study
    uses the surface solar radiation downwards (ssrd) as estimator. Since the objective
    is to predict meteorological station data based only on ERA5-Land data, we evaluated
    the performance of two deep learning models, namely a Feed Forward Neural Network
    (FFNN) and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), to predict 𝑅3_𝑇𝑎𝑖𝑟 given 𝑡2𝑚 , 𝑅3_𝑅𝑔
    given the ssrd, and 𝑅3_𝐻𝑟 given 𝑡2𝑚 and 𝑑2𝑚 . b. Feed Forward Neural Network (FFNN):
    In this type of neural network, the input signals (ERA5-Land data) are fed into
    the input layer composed of 100 neurons. In each neuron, the data are processed,
    taking the weighted sum of inputs plus a bias and then applying an activation
    function (Figure 7), before forwarding the output to the next layer. The activation
    function introduces nonlinearity to the output. The choice of this function has
    a real impact on the training process and performance of models and must be chosen
    according to the problem at hand. For example, sigmoid and hyperbolic tangent
    activation functions (Equations (3) and (4)) can be used to capture nonlinearity
    that may exist between inputs and outputs. Figure 7. A single neuron model. For
    our case, and given the fact that moving from ERA5-Land reanalysis data to meteorological
    station data is the inverse of inference in statistics, that is, estimating the
    mean of an individual (station data) given the mean of the population (ERA5-Land
    pixels), the error with this assumption is supposed to be linear (polynomial of
    degree one); that said, we used the Rectified Linear Unit function (ReLU) (Equation
    (5)) as the activation function in our neural network layers, which is true for
    both proposed architectures (FFNN and LSTM). 𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)= 1 1+ 𝑒 𝑥 (3) 𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)=tanh(𝑥)=
    𝑒 𝑥 − 𝑒 −𝑥 𝑒 𝑥 + 𝑒 −𝑥 (4) 𝑦=𝑓(𝑥)=𝑚𝑎𝑥(0,𝑥)={ 0, x, if𝑥<0 if𝑥≥0 (5) c. Long Short-Term
    Memory (LSTM): The choice behind using this neural network as a comparison is
    due to its ability to deal with data that have long-term dependency, which is
    the case for climate data. LSTM belongs to the Recurrent Neural Networks family
    (RNN), and therefore also has an internal recurrence, that is, during the learning
    process, a signal is fed back to a neuron or layer that has already received and
    processed it (Figure 8), as well as its ability to remember data through gated
    cells, which are a kind of memory that accept values in the interval [0, 1] and
    are used to decide when the flow of a signal passes through the corresponding
    neuron. LSTM was first developed to resolve the limitations of the vanishing [41]
    and exploding gradient problems that may occur during the training phase. This
    problem stops the learning of the neural network because the updates to the various
    weights become very small. Figure 8. Architectures of FFNN and LSTM used in the
    approach. These two architectures (Figure 8) are trained using the Mean Squared
    Error (MSE) as a loss or cost function that enables calculating the error of a
    network at the end of a forward pass. To optimize the network weights, we used
    the adaptive moment estimation optimization algorithm (Adam), which is characterized
    by fast convergence to the optimal solution and combines the strengths of other
    optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and RMSProp
    during the training phase. Like most other optimization algorithms, Adam uses
    the partial derivative during backward propagation to calculate the error function
    with respect to each weight within the network (Equation (6)). The Adam algorithm
    then updates the network weights for a minimized loss or cost function using rules
    in Equations (7), (8) and (9), respectively. 𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑑= ∂𝐽 ∂𝜃 (6) 𝑚 𝑡 = 𝛽 1 𝑚 𝑡−1 +(1−

    (9) d. Data normalization Data normalization is performed as part of the data
    preprocessing step and is the process of bringing data to a similar scale. The
    process is also known as feature scaling. In some cases, such as for statistical
    machine learning models, it may not be beneficial, but for deep learning models,
    it is proven to help models to perform better [42,43] in terms of faster convergence,
    reduced training time, and improved stability (preventing models from oscillating
    or divergence). There are multiple methods for data normalization: Min–max standardization:
    Min–max scales the feature values between [0, 1], with 0 being the feature’s minimum
    value and 1 being its maximum value, while maintaining the original distribution
    (Equation (10)). 𝑥 𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥−𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑥) 𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑥)−𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝑥) (10) Decimal scaling: This form
    of scaling is used where values of different decimal ranges are present. For example,
    two features with different bounds can be brought to a similar scale using decimal
    scaling (Equation (11)) 𝑥 𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥 10 𝑛 (11) Such that n is an integer representing
    the order of the scalings. Z-score: This transformation scales the value toward
    a normal distribution with a zero mean and unit variance using the z-score formula
    (Equation (12)). 𝑥 𝑛𝑒𝑤 = 𝑥−𝜇 𝜎 (12) such that 𝜇 is the mean and 𝜎 is the standard
    deviation of the features’ distribution. This method is very efficient for datasets
    with a Gaussian distribution. In our case, we applied the min–max method (Equation
    (10)). Next, we initialize the hyperparameters of the two proposed architectures
    (Table 4). These parameters are not updated during the learning phase. Table 4.
    Hyperparameters used during the training of FFNN and LSTM models. e. Dataset splitting
    Before training begins, we split our dataset into three sets: training, validation,
    and test sets. The validation set is used to assess the performance of the model
    during each epoch of the training phase. Next, the test set is used to evaluate
    the final trained model. We used 80–20% splitting for the training–test sets,
    respectively, and took 20% of the 80% for the validation set. f. Evaluation Metrics
    To evaluate the trained deep learning models’ performance on the test dataset,
    we employed the most commonly used metrics for regression tasks (Equations (13)–(16)):
    Training time: The time it takes for the model to complete 20 epochs. R2 score
    or R2: The coefficient of determination informs about how well the unknown samples
    will be predicted by our model. It ranges between 0 and 1, but it can be negative
    as well (Equation (13)). R 2 =1− ∑ 𝑛 1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 ) 2 ∑ 𝑛 1 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̲ 𝑖 )
    2 (13) The Pearson correlation coefficient (R): It measures the linear relationship
    between two normal distributed variables (Equation (14)). R= ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥
    ̲ )( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̲ ) ∑ 𝑛 𝑖=1 ( 𝑥 𝑖 − 𝑥 ̲ ) 2 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̲ ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − −
    − − − − − − − − √ (14) Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): The average of the squares
    of the errors between real and predicted values by the model (Equation (15)).
    RMSE= 1 𝑛 ∑ 1 𝑛 ( 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 ) 2 − − − − − − − − − − − − −  ⎷   (15) Mean
    Absolute Error (MAE): This is the average of absolute errors between real and
    predicted values (Equation (16)). MAE= ∑ 𝑛 1 | 𝑦 𝑖 − 𝑦 ̂ 𝑖 | 𝑛 (16) Given the
    fact that we applied the scaling in our data using the formula in Equation (10),
    all metrics (from Equations (13) to (16)) are unitless. 4.4.2. Forecasting Service
    The forecasting service helps make projections of the future state of the atmosphere
    (air temperature, air relative humidity, global solar radiation, etc.) by performing
    a univariate time series forecasting task. The Facebook Prophet model is used
    according on the performance it has provided when trained and evaluated using
    the same meteorological dataset to perform long-term weather forecasting tasks.
    4.4.3. Climatic Parameters Calculation and Estimation Service One of the most
    important agricultural practices in the day-to-day life of a farmer is irrigation.
    To achieve efficiency, we need to accurately estimate crops’ water needs at each
    phase of crop growth throughout the agricultural season. This can be performed
    through several methods, among others is the estimation of the evapotranspiration
    (ET). It indicates the amount of water loss caused by transpiration from the crop
    and soil surface evaporation. We can obtain the ET of a crop (ETc) by multiplying
    the reference evapotranspiration (ET0) and crop coefficient Kc, which holds all
    the physical and physiological differences of a given crop. This service proposes
    to estimate the ET0 using machine learning, namely the XGBoost model constrained
    by the physical model FAO Penman–Monteith. The proposed approach follows the steps
    presented in Figure 9. First, we resampled the air temperature, global solar radiation,
    air relative humidity, and wind speed to the daily average, and precipitation
    to the cumulative daily values, and then the missing values were deleted. Figure
    9. The flowchart of the proposed method. To select the most important contributor
    variables to the ET0 estimate, the method uses a random-forest-based technique
    that ranks the importance of features based on their occurrences in nodes across
    all trees: the bar chart (Figure 10) shows sorted meteorological variables’ importance
    scores. Next, the dataset containing meteorological data and the corresponding
    FAO Penman–Monteith ET0 estimated values are split and fed into the XGBoost model,
    and the model is then evaluated. Figure 10. The features’ importance bar chart
    of meteorological parameters. The objective of this service is to provide an alternative
    to the FAO Penman–Monteith calculation procedure by learning the behavior of this
    procedure using a limited number of climatic variables (Figure 11). It is either
    suitable for stations that lack the necessary hardware and sensors to provide
    the entire set of meteorological data required for FAO Penman–Monteith or in the
    case of technical problems with sensors, among other things. Figure 11. The logic
    of the Evapotranspiration estimation component. 4.4.4. Weather Data Analysis and
    Visualization Service It is well-known that data in their raw form are useless,
    but the information, knowledge, and wisdom derived from them are not. Moving from
    one state of data to another is known as Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD),
    which is a subset of the modern data science field and can be performed using
    various methods, such as CRISP-DM [44], which stands for CRoss-Industry Standard
    Process for Data Mining, or the proposed standard method in [45]. One example
    of insights data visualization and analysis which can be given in our use case
    is shown in Figure 12. This is achieved by following a hybrid methodology that
    includes the following steps: collecting, storing, cleaning, visualizing, analyzing,
    and mining. Figure 12. An example of the data analysis scenario. The first three
    steps are common for all other services available on the platform. The added value
    of this service is providing different types of visualization options, including
    comparison plots (line charts of weather time series), relationship plots (scatter
    plot of weather data), and automatically generating correlation heat maps, which
    are important steps in the data analysis phase to study how one variable affects
    another. 4.4.5. Custom Early Warning Alerts Service This service is classified
    as an outlier or anomaly detection problem. These special types of data can be
    detected in time series by using, among others, rule-based methods, in which case
    the service alerts administrators via SMS and email once the given condition is
    satisfied. An example of such a condition is a threshold of temperature or rainfall.
    The second method of sending warnings is to identify sequences that are notably
    different from the rest of the historical time series data. These sequences can
    be the result of measurement error or noise and can inform administrators about
    the status of the different sensors installed in the meteorological station and
    inform them about events that could require urgent action. To perform this, we
    use unsupervised machine learning methods that do not require an annotated series
    of anomalies to be trained, in contrast to supervised machine learning algorithms.
    The unsupervised method we used is Local Outlier Factor ( 𝐿𝑂𝐹 ) [46]. It uses
    the KNN algorithm principle to calculate the distance of a point with respect
    to its neighbors. This distance is used, in turn, to obtain the Reachability Density
    ( 𝑅𝐷 ) (Equation (17)). 𝑅𝐷( 𝑥 𝑖 , 𝑥 𝑗 )=𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐾−𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒( 𝑥 𝑗 ),𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒( 𝑥 𝑖 ,
    𝑥 𝑗 )) (17) Next is measuring the local deviation of the density of a given point
    using Local Reachability Density ( 𝐿𝑅𝐷 ) (Equation (18)), which tells us how far
    the point is from the nearest dense cluster of points. 𝐿𝑅 𝐷 𝑘 (𝑥)= 1 ∑ 𝑥 𝑗 ∈ 𝑁
    𝑘 (𝑥) 𝑅𝐷(𝑥, 𝑥 𝑗 ) || 𝑁 𝑘 (𝑥)|| (18) where 𝑁𝑘(𝑥) is the number of neighbors of
    x whose distance from x is not greater than the k-distance. As a final step, the
    algorithm calculates the 𝐿𝑂𝐹 (Equation (19)). Conventionally the points that have
    a higher anomaly score than their neighbors 𝐿𝑂𝐹 > 1) will be considered as potential
    outliers, but that is not always true, since in anomaly detection there is no
    clear and standard validation approach, and the final decision must relies on
    domain expertise to consider the detected point as an outlier or not, and the
    role of the service ends by notifying the administrators and letting them decide.
    𝐿𝑂 𝐹 𝑘 (𝑥)= ∑ 𝑥 𝑗 ∈ 𝑁 𝑘 𝐿𝑅𝐷( 𝑥 𝑗 ) || 𝑁 𝑘 (𝑥)|| × 1 𝐿𝑅 𝐷 𝑘 (𝑥) (19) 5. Results
    and Discussions 5.1. Time Series Data Imputation As a result, for handling missing
    data using deep learning, Figure 13 shows the curves for the loss function (MSE)
    and R2 in both training and validation sets during each epoch. For both architectures
    (FFNN and LSTM), the learning curves indicate a good fit of the model represented
    by an initially high training loss that steadily decreases as more training instances
    are added and flattens over time (0.04 for air temperature, 0.098 for global solar
    radiation, and 0.116 for air relative humidity), and the same way for R2, which
    begins with nonoptimal values in training and validation and converges to stable
    change (0.96 for air temperature, 0.84 for global solar radiation, and 0.77 for
    air relative humidity). Table 5 shows the performance comparisons between the
    two deep learning architectures used in the test set. Figure 13. Monitoring of
    MSE and R2 during training and validation phases: air temperature: (a) FFNN, (b)
    LSTM, global solar radiation: (c) FFNN, (d) LSTM, air relative humidity: (e) FFNN,
    (f) LSTM. Table 5. Performance of deep learning models. Table 5 shows the performance
    comparisons between the two deep learning models used in the test set. Once trained,
    the final deep learning model will be ready for deployment in the production environment
    and used to make inferences about meteorological station data given the ERA5-Land
    data. In contrast to Numerical Methods for Weather Prediction (NWP), which take
    considerable time to run [47], predictions based on our model are made instantly.
    5.2. Climatic Parameters Calculation and Estimation We split our dataset into
    five randomly shuffled parts (five folds). We used one fold for model evaluation
    and the remaining four to train it. Finally, we assess the model’s performance
    by calculating the regression metrics across the five folds of the dataset (Root
    Mean Squared Error RMSE and the coefficient of determination R2). According to
    the results of Table 6, the main point is not the perfect results obtained by
    using all parameters as estimators but using only air temperature and global solar
    radiation (average RMSE = 0.27 and average R2 = 0.93), which gave promising results.
    This represents a practical data-driven approach for accurately estimating ET0
    by combining two criteria: accuracy of the FAO Penman–Monteith method and using
    limited and simple-to-obtain meteorological variables (air temperature with global
    solar radiation or only air temperature). Table 6. Cross-validation results for
    the three scenarios. According to the results, the proposed method represents
    a practical data-driven approach for accurately estimating ET0 by combining two
    criteria: accuracy of the FAO Penman–Monteith method and using limited and simple-to-obtain
    meteorological variables (air temperature with global solar radiation or only
    air temperature). The results obtained are in agreement with the approach followed
    in [48] for the most contributing variables for ET0 estimation, but it outperforms
    it in terms of RMSE (0.19). In addition, the XGboost model used in this study
    outperforms [49] when using all meteorological variables to train a neural network
    (RMSE = 0.19). 5.3. Prototype of the System The platform is named “FLA7A”, which
    means agriculture in Arabic. Figure 14 shows a screenshot of the platform’s dashboard.
    By default, it contains the real-time visualization of the last three days of
    hourly weather data (line charts). However, the user can customize the period
    according to their needs. Figure 14. A screenshot of the platform’s real-time
    weather time series visualization service. The black dots represent the original
    measurements, while the black line represents the linear interpolation of the
    dots. Figure 14 shows a screenshot of the dashboard that visualizes the last three
    days of hourly weather data. Figure 15 shows the interface of the forecasting
    service. By default, the forecasting period is set to one year. However, the user
    can change this parameter and also customize the number of years it will take
    into consideration when training the model. As mentioned in Section 4.4.2, the
    service initially uses the statistical model Facebook Prophet, which is powerful
    in long-term forecasting. In future work, the platform will integrate more models,
    especially those known for their performance in the task of short-term and mid-term
    weather forecasting, as surveyed in [50]. Figure 15. A screenshot of the platform’s
    forecast service. The light blue is the uncertainty bounds of the uncertainty
    interval around the final predictions (upper and lower), while the dark blue is
    the predicted values, and the black dots represent our original data. This platform
    is the first incremental step towards our goal of creating a decision support
    system intended to implement smart agriculture in Morocco by using artificial
    intelligence and data science to solve real-life problems facing farmers. More
    studies will be performed to add and optimize different parts of this system.
    For example, for data storage, we used MongoDB as a database to deal with real-time
    big data, however, in terms of system scalability or dealing with batch processing
    or long-running ETL (Extract, Transform, and Load) jobs, other technologies should
    be considered. A potential candidate for this could be other NoSQL databases [51]
    or the Hadoop ecosystem (Spark, MapReduce, Hive, etc.) [52,53]. Additionally,
    MongoDB has fault tolerance issues, which is true of practically all distributed
    databases. Moreover, in the proposed deep learning method to deal with missing
    data, we do not cover hyperparameter fine-tuning [54], which is one of the biggest
    drawbacks to using deep neural networks. This task can be performed using GridSearch
    [55] or other optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithms or the Monte
    Carlo method, which can lead to better results. Despite this, we found promising
    results, confirming the reliability of the ERA5-Land reanalysis data for our study
    area, which could lead to the application of this method using several stations
    in regions with challenging conditions. Finally, for the anomaly detection part,
    we presented an unsupervised machine learning method that is based on how isolated
    a measure is with respect to the surrounding neighborhood to alert administrators
    via SMS and emails, but other efficient methods can be investigated, such as Conformal
    Anomaly Detection (CAP) [56,57]. 6. Conclusions The work conducted in this paper
    makes use of artificial intelligence and big data analytics to develop a platform
    intended for intelligent weather data management, which is essential to implementing
    smart and sustainable agriculture in Morocco. The platform exploits huge amounts
    of generated data to gain insights and help assist decision making. The proposed
    platform offers a number of weather-data-related services such as handling missing
    data, visualization, analysis, estimation, and forecasting. Combining ERA5-Land
    reanalysis data and deep learning algorithms to learn the relationship between
    the two data sources gave promising results (R2 = 0.96 and RMSE = 0.04) for the
    air temperature variable. The same is true for the estimation of the reference
    evapotranspiration using XGBoost (R2 = 0.97 and RMSE = 0.07). The platform is
    designed to be service-oriented and will incorporate other services and solutions
    to help farmers and policymakers. Author Contributions Platform and machine learning

  description: Effective agricultural water management requires accurate, continuous,
    and transparent accounting of water use in irrigated agroecosystems, especially
    in water-limited regions where moratoriums may be imposed. Advances in sensor
    technologies, networking, and data analytics can aid in fulfilling this task by
    automatically collecting, analyzing and reporting real-time data to infer irrigators’
    practices and behaviors, crop water requirements, water applications and use.
    In this research, an automated irrigation water withdrawal and water use monitoring
    and data collection system was deployed to monitor actual irrigation dynamics
    for 31 commercial and large-scale agricultural production fields for three consecutive
    years. Production scale fields (representing a total of 1050 ha) included center
    pivot (P), gravity (surface/furrow) (G) and subsurface drip-irrigated (S) fields.
    On average, irrigation was initiated 40–70 days after planting (DAP) and terminated
    by 120–140 DAP. The proportion of irrigation systems operating simultaneously
    and peak water abstraction were highest (70–90 %) during July and August. Mean
    depth of water applied across all fields was 243, 264 and 284 mm in 2013, 2014
    and 2015, respectively. Site-specific monitoring of precipitation, soil moisture,
    and evaporative demand and a soil-water balance model resulted in mean seasonal
    irrigation requirement estimates of 394, 242 and 184 mm, in 2013, 2014 and 2015,
    respectively; for maize; and 307, 163 and 219 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively,
    for soybean. Despite reduction of calculated mean irrigation requirement in 2014
    and 2015 by 40–50 %, actual irrigation applications by producers did not change
    considerably and irrigation applied exceeded irrigation water requirements in
    80 % of the fields, suggesting needs for irrigation water management technology
    implementation and associated educational programs in the region. Some fields
    showed irrigation applications exceeding the mean annual allocated (moratorium)
    irrigation depth (305 mm), implying that irrigation decisions are still largely
    driven by non-scientific and/or technical methods. While substantial farm-to-farm
    heterogeneity makes it challenging to robustly benchmarking regional water footprint
    and irrigator behavior, it also creates an opportunity for developing and implementing
    methodologies and strategies for real-time monitoring of farm-level irrigation
    dynamics. New advances in technologies with telemetry capabilities as well as
    internet of things (IoTs) can be leveraged to effectively create databases, track
    and compare water usage to better plan, allocate, distribute, monitor and manage
    limited water resources for enhancing agricultural productivity. These processes
    can also be used for education and demonstration for irrigation professionals
    to enhance adoption of such technologies. This research has the potential for
    technology and strategy transfer for advanced water management to other regions
    in the United States and globally.

    the novel goal of producing food, fiber and fuel demand of rapidly-growing world’s
    population, agricultural irrigation, in many cases, is the largest customer of
    global freshwater resources with 70–80 % of the total water withdrawal from ground
    and surface water resources globally (OECD, 2021; Gordon et al., 2010). In many
    cases, it is stated by different researchers, scientists and other non-experts
    in water resources engineering, agricultural water management, agricultural engineering
    disciplines that “irrigated agriculture consumes 70–80 % of water withdrawn water
    resources,” which is not accurate and is misleading as not all water withdrawn
    from ground or surface water resources is consumed by plants and a considerable
    portion of water withdrawn and delivered to the production fields through irrigation
    systems returns to its sources. The amount of water withdrawn that returns to
    the source is a function of numerous factors, including irrigation method, soil
    characteristics, crop type and crop growth stage, climate conditions, soil and
    crop management practices, effectiveness of irrigation management, irrigation
    method, etc. On a rough estimate, in the United States, about 42 % of the total
    water withdrawal is for irrigation purposes (ERS, 2015), which is experiencing
    increasing pressure for improved efficiency to produce significantly more food
    and fiber and other commodities. In addition to proper assessment, forecasting,
    planning, effectively managing limited freshwater resources requires transparency
    in accounting and analysis of irrigation water withdrawal and use characteristics
    at appropriate scales. This immense and critical task is typically accomplished
    by site-specific measurement of environmental, biophysical, and micrometeorological
    parameters or by estimation of irrigation water requirements by relying on empirical
    and other approaches. Irrigation water requirement in agriculture can be defined
    as the adequate amount of water that must be artificially supplied to the crop
    for achieving ideal crop growth, quality and desired yield in cases where the
    amount of precipitation and stored soil-water are not sufficient to meet crop
    water demand for achieving potential yield. The primary unknown in order to accurately
    determining irrigation water requirement is crop water use or crop evapotranspiration
    (ETc), which is driven by weather conditions (solar radiation, relative humidity,
    air temperature, wind speed, vapor pressure deficit), soil and crop management
    practices (including tillage practices, seeding rate, row spacing, etc.), crop
    type and growth (including leaf area index, leaf orientation etc.), soil properties
    (soil texture, field capcity, permanent wilting point, water holding capcity),
    root development (root density, rooting depth), soil-water availability, time
    of the year, time of the day (for hourly time step) and other factors. ETc can
    be measured via advanced techniques such as lysimeters, surface renewal, Bowen
    Ratio Energy Balance Systems, and Eddy Correlation Systems (Steduto and Hsiao,
    1998, Irmak and Irmak, 2008, Irmak, 2010, Li et al., 2008, Snyder et al., 1996).
    Despite high representativeness and accuracy, these measurement techniques can
    be quite laborious, expensive, require trained professionals, time-consuming and
    can be used only on certain areas due to their nature of operations. As convenient
    alternatives, estimation methods such as two-step approach (i.e., ETc = reference
    ET x crop coefficient) can be used to calculate ETc. However, this approach is
    subject to assumptions that do not consider variability in soil and crop practices,
    variety differences, and other factors that different commercial fields are managed
    with. Moreover, evaporative demand at a particular site may vary considerably
    than what is calculated at a nearby weather monitoring site, due to microclimate
    impacts from specific management practices, e.g., tillage (Irmak et al., 2019),
    irrigation method (Cavero et al., 2009), terrain characteristics, etc. This results
    in compromising of the site-specificity of ETc and irrigation requirements that
    are needed for precise assessment and management of water in producers fields.
    In contrast, several sensor technologies, network, and data advances make it possible
    to observe and record irrigation water withdrawal, ETc as well as irrigator behaviour
    at individual farms simultaneously by avoiding the complications encountered in
    the abovementioned technical approaches that rely on energy balance principles.
    Several critical variables that drive ETc and irrigation water withdrawal can
    be measured independently and site-specifically to render robust data on regional
    irrigation-related characteristics in real- or near real-time. These technologies
    include atmometers (ETgauges) that can be deployed in-field to measure site-specific
    evaporative demand by closely resembling plant’s resistance to ETc (Alam and Trooien,
    2001, Magliulo et al., 2003, Irmak et al., 2005a, Chen and Robinson, 2009), soil
    moisture sensors installed in the crop root zone to report soil-water depletion
    (Wetzel and Chang, 1987) and precipitation gauges. In addition, measurement of
    flow rate and volume of water pumped by an individual producer aids in determining
    and improving irrigation water productivity (IWP), crop water productivity (CWP),
    determining pumping plant efficiency; detecting various technical and operational
    well, pump, pipes and irrigation system malfunctions that result in improved irrigation
    water delivery and use. A variety of flow measurement devices are available to
    measure instantaneous and total flow rate applied to a particular field throughout
    the growing season. Various state water management agencies such as, Water Management
    Districts, Natural Resources Districts (NRDs), etc., have been established to
    monitor irrigation water consumption by implementing the management plans and
    strategies in their specific areas. In Nebraska, NRDs regulate groundwater resources
    and Department of Natural Resources (DNR) regulates surfacewater resources. The
    difference between NRDs and irrigation districts is that NRDs are responsible
    for regulating groundwater and developing rules for withdrawal, allocations, etc.,
    whereas irrigation districts are usually responsible for delivering the water
    to the irrigators. For example, in Nebraska, regulations are imposed by NRDs to
    install water meters on the irrigation systems which helps keep a check on producers
    to monitor and/or limit their water withdrawal to the allocated amount with respect
    to the allocated amount. However, these rules and regulations vary in respective
    geographic areas of concern and are decided by the local NRDs according to the
    requirements in the concerned area. In some NRDs, flowmeters are required on all
    wells and/or on new wells, and some NRDs require flowmeters in sub-areas or in
    certain areas, whereas irrigation water allocation/moratorium rule are employed
    by some NRDs. For example in the larger Republican River Basin, Upper, Middle
    and Lower Republican NRDs impose different amount of water allocations (moratoriums).
    Based on the Stakeholders Advisory Committee (2016), the Lower Republican NRD
    (LRNRD) established a moratorium (restriction on the amount of water irrigators
    can pump during a given time) on new irrigation well drilling on December 9, 2002.
    No new irrigation wells have been drilled since that date. District established
    a moratorium on adding new irrigated lands on December 31, 2004. No new irrigated
    land has been added since that date. All groundwater irrigated areas were certified
    in 2004 and all wells were metered by April 1, 2005. The Lower Republican NRD
    has the lowest groundwater allocation in the state. The present allocation is
    230 mm/yr. NRD allocates a 5 year block for 1143 mm and the water may be used
    however the irrigator chooses during that 5 years unless there is an allocation
    cap. NRD allows up to 230 mm to be carried over the end of an allocation period
    to the next allocation period. Unless otherwise provided, imposition of penalties
    for exceeding the allocation amounts shall be at the discretion of the NRD Board
    and may include, but are not limited to: (a) A reduction (in whole or in part)
    of a person’s allocation of groundwater; (b) A reduction (in whole or in part)
    of a person’s certified irrigated acres; and (c) Decommissioning of water wells.
    Penalty for exceeding carry over include deducting 50 mm carryover deducted for
    every inch of carry-over used above 190 mm. The Middle Republican NRD (MRNRD)
    is and will continue to enforce all of the management actions that have been described
    in the handout such as: Moratorium on new irrigation wells and acres; Abiding
    our 4th generation of the Integrated Management Plan; helping producers with programs
    for their irrigated land; implementing allocations and penalties; and much more
    that we have been doing for years already within our district. The MRNRD currently
    has 1524/5-yr allocation rule imposed. In cases when unused amount of water remained
    from the allocated amount, it is carried over to the next allocation cycle. If
    an irrigator has exceeded his/her allocation, the allocation for the next allocation
    period shall be reduced by the number of acre inches, by which said allocation
    was exceeded in the prior period. A penalty of 25.4 mm for every inch over the
    first 76 mm and 50 mm for every mm over 76 mm of overuse will be applied. Moratoriums
    in the Republican River Basin do not consider the cropping pattern grown in a
    given year, although most district has maize-soybean rotation. Based on the Republican
    River Basin-Wide Plan (2018), the Upper Republican NRD (URNRD) has prohibited
    new irrigation wells since 1998. Any replacement irrigation well, replacement
    livestock well, replacement industrial well or replacement public water system
    must be at least 183 m from any domestic well or range livestock well, 805 m from
    a public water supply well, and 305 from any irrigation well, commercial livestock
    well or industrial well. No wells can be connected without prior approval from
    the URNRD. In all three NRDS, any person who violates a cease-and-desist order
    issued by the district pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. §46–707(h) may be subject to
    a civil penalty assessed pursuant to Neb. Rev. Stat. §46–745. To monitor water
    withdrawal by irrigators, NRD personnel travel long distances and manually read
    the meters installed at the registered wells once a year after the irrigation
    season and record the readings. These readings are used to keep a check on the
    water pumped to keep a sustainable balance between water use and water supply
    which ensures the region’s economic viability, social and environmental health/environmental
    services, safety, and welfare. These practices of manual data collection, though
    effective, are very labor intensive and expensive. It is also subject to human
    error, and annual readings are not enough to provide sufficient information to
    find the relation between the water usage during the crop growing season and crop
    water requirements. Furthermore, these manual readings provide data and information
    only after the season is over and are not effective to make in-season or real
    time monitoring or assessments. Taking totalized readings only once a year after
    the irrigation season does not provide detailed data on how water is used during
    the crop growing season in relation to crop water requirements. This critically
    important need to better assess, forecast and manage water resources can be fulfilled
    by implementing an automated water use monitoring and data collection system which
    can compile, record, and communicate irrigation flow rate/water withdrawal data,
    along with critical site-specific drivers of irrigation water use. Recent developments
    of smart meter technologies that are capable of remotely reading meters in real-time
    and archiving the records in a central database provides great opportunity to
    change the way irrigation water use is monitored and documented. The smart meter
    technology is already being used by public utility providers (electricity, gas,
    domestic water supply) to reduce the expenses of periodic trips to each physical
    location to read a meter. The new technologies transmit hourly water consumption
    data to the city’s billing system by wireless network. This real-time water use
    information allows city’s water managers to monitor water use and detect leaks
    and other issues quickly. Water consumers are also able to view their daily water
    usage data online and learn ways to conserve water. Despite the great potential
    of smart meter to provide reliable and real-time water-use information, the technology
    has not been applied in the management of irrigation water use by irrigation and
    water resources management organizations. Application of this technology in the
    management of the nation’s irrigation water use has several potential benefits
    including reduced cost of data collection, documentation and analyses and real-time
    data for better irrigation management strategies. In addition to irrigation water
    use data, other information such as rainfall, soil moisture and ETc are required
    for management and performance evaluation of irrigation systems. When such data
    are measured by sensors with wireless data transmission capability, it becomes
    possible to automate the collection, documentation, and storage of the data to
    a central database. The timely water use information coupled with analysis can
    give both irrigation managers and farmers better control of water-use. Smart meter
    technologies allow farmers to view their irrigation information through handheld,
    mobile and network technologies via wired or wireless platforms, radio frequency,
    or powerline transmission. In this research, we demonstrated the use of such an
    automated system to analyze irrigation analytics across commercial agricultural
    production fields within an important irrigated crop production region, i.e.,
    Republican River Basin, Nebraska, United States, which is divided into three Natural
    Resources Districts (NRDs) among which MRNRD is the largest and intensively irrigated.
    The largest source of irrigation water in the MRNRD is groundwater with 3000+
    registered wells, and the area is facing significant challenges associated with
    water needs and quality. The objectives of this research were to demonstrate the
    deployment and use of a novel and an automated near real-time water withdrawal
    and use monitoring and data collection system and decipher the complex irrigator
    behavior and pattern of irrigation water use in the region. Specifically, critical
    aspects of regional irrigation are studied such as the start and termination of
    irrigation season, frequency of the irrigation in a crop growing season, and depth
    of irrigation water applied. Finally, irrigation water depths directly observed
    at producer fields were compared and assessed against irrigation requirement estimates
    obtained using viable and scientific methodologies. The irrigator behaviour in
    decision making is assessed against both true irrigation requirements as well
    as water allocation (Moratorium). Such large-scale deployment of technologies
    and extensive water withdrawal and use analyses on large scale production fields
    as well as irrigator behaviors with respect to water allocations are unique and
    have not been studied before. The anticipated benefits from this project are reduced
    cost of data collection, documentation and analyses; real time data availability
    for better irrigation management strategies; improvement in groundwater quality
    from reduced irrigation and reduced chemical leaching potential to water resources;
    and reduced soil erosion from reduced runoff. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Research
    area The Republican River Basin is located along the border of Kansas and Nebraska
    and encompasses portions of three states. The total drainage area sums up to 64,800
    km2 of which 31 % is in northeastern Colorado, 30 % in northwestern Kansas, and
    39 % in southwestern Nebraska (Fig. 1). The drainage area within Nebraska overlaps
    with four Natural Resources Districts (NRDs): Upper Republican, Middle Republican,
    Lower Republican, and Tri-Basin NRD, while smaller areas also overlap with Little
    Blue and Twin Platte NRDs. The area for this research is the MRNRD. The MRNRD
    encompasses all of Hayes, Hitchcock, and Red Willow Counties, most of Frontier,
    and the southern one-third of Lincoln County (Fig. 1). The total land area covered
    by MRNRD is 9950 km2 (995,332 ha) comprising of 53 % of rangeland and 46 % of
    cropland. The major crops in this region are maize, winter wheat, sorghum, and
    soybean. The growing season generally lasts between 150 and 160 days. The major
    soil types in the area are a Coly-Uly and Colby-Ulysses associations of silt loam
    texture, silty Hord, McCook, Hobbs and Valentine and Valent sands in the northwestern
    part. The 30-year normal (1991–2020) annual precipitation and temperature for
    the region are 546 mm and 10.1 °C, respectively (PRISM, 2021). Over 3000 registered
    irrigation wells in the MRNRD (Fig. 1) are required to be equipped with a flowmeter.
    For this research, 31 fields that have well permits were selected for a 3-year
    pilot assessment distributed across MRNRD. Twentysix fields were irrigated with
    center pivots, 3 with gravity (surface) and 2 with subsurface drip- irrigation
    (SDI) (Fig. 1). Geographical details of the research fields are provided in Table

    drip irrigation system fields. 2.2. Instrumentation and data sources 2.2.1. Instrumentation
    and development of irrigation water-use data acquisition system In this research,
    all producer collaborators’ fields were named with their respective irrigation
    method such as center pivot irrigation (P1, P2,…) gravity (furrow) irrigation
    (G1, G2,…) and subsurface drip irrigation (S1, S2,…) (Table 1) to avoid using
    actual producers’ names. These field names were also used in the telemetry and
    online/cloud platforms to protect the identity and privacy of the collaborators.
    The irrigation water-use data acquisition system was designed to automate the
    gathering of irrigation water-use and other information such as rainfall, crop
    type, planting date, ETc and soil moisture data into a central irrigation water
    use database platform. The system uses the most appropriate and cost effective,
    yet advanced satellite telemetry/wireless technology for delivering up to date
    irrigation water flow, soil moisture, ETc, and rainfall data from the sensors
    installed in the field to a central monitoring computer. The components of the
    irrigation water use data acquisition system are shown in Picture 1. All research
    fields were equipped with flowmeters on the irrigation pipelines to measure, record,
    and communicate irrigation flow data every 15 min. The telemetry system allows
    monitoring water withdrawal quantities and enables to set alerts/alarms to indicate
    high or low water withdrawal, which can be concurrently tracked for each field.
    The collected data are processed and output via easy-to-understand graphs showing
    the irrigation water pumped in each farm in relation to water allocation limits,
    crop water use and average irrigation withdrawals of the neighboring farms. Farmers
    can login to the system online using a username and password to view their own
    irrigation water withdrawal data and associated information. Download : Download

    of the irrigation water-use data acquisition system. The research used the existing
    totalizer flowmeters (TFM) installed in the research fields. The flowmeters were
    propeller-type manufactured by McCrometer (Great Plains Meter, Inc., Aurora, NE,
    USA) and have a measurement accuracy of ± 2 % of discharge and repeatability of
    ± 0.25 %. To obtain this accuracy of discharge, we ensured that the TFM were installed
    correctly, following the manufacturer’s specifications. At each selected irrigation
    well, a TFM was installed inline in a full-flowing, acceptable test section of
    pipe on the discharge side of the pump where the measurement of water velocity
    was made (Picture 2). The flowmeter location was in a straight, constant diameter
    length of pipeline without turbulence to prevent obstructions (elbows, valves,
    pumps, and changes in pipe diameter) for a certain distance upstream and downstream
    from the flowmeter installation point. Distances required usually were related
    to the diameter of the discharge pipe at the measurement location. The desired
    distance upstream for the flowmeters without a straightening vane installed was
    10 pipe diameters and for flowmeters with a straightening vane, it was 5 pipe
    diameters. To allow automated flowmeter readings, data logging and telemetry transmission,
    a pulse transmitter unit was installed at the bases of the existing flowmeters
    (Picture 3). The transmitter unit transmits pulses representing irrigation flow
    rate (pulse range: 4–20 mA) to the telemetry unit through a cable. On-site calibration
    was performed for each installed pulse transmitter unit in each field. Download

    and solar panel in the field. The remote telemetry units (RTUs) used in this data
    acquisition system was standalone GPRS stations (Model A755 GPRS SDI-12, Adcon
    Telemetry, Vienna, Austria) (Picture 3). Each station has two input ports and
    was connected through cables to receive data signals from the flowmeter and from
    either rain gauges or atmometers (ETgauge) as needed. Data signals are first stored
    in the memory of an RTU. An RTU has its own intelligence in the form of a built-in
    microcontroller, which periodically performs several tasks. For example, it interrogates
    the sensors, stores the measured data and checks the local battery status continuously.
    RTU is equipped with a GSM modem, which allows for real-time wireless communication
    with a base station. Reverse communication is also possible from the base station.
    The stations were configured to record data with 15 min intervals and set to deliver
    the recorded data to the telemetry gateway at hourly intervals to provide near
    real-time data. The power for the unit comes from an internal NiMH battery which
    is charged using a compact solar panel. Rain gauge (Model RG1 200, McCrometer,
    Inc., Aurora, NE, USA) that was used is compatible with the RTU and has a capacity
    to maintain an accuracy of within 2 % of rainfall up to 60 mm. ETgauge is an ET
    measurement device in the local field conditions. The electronic version of ETgauge
    (Model E, ETgauge Company, Loveland, CO, USA) was used. It has a performance accuracy
    of ± 1 % of evaporated water. The Watermark soil moisture sensors (Irrometer Co.,
    Riverside, CA, USA) were used to measure soil matric potential (kPa) in each field
    and sensors were connected to Watermark monitor/dataloggers (model 900 M, Irrometer
    Co., Riverside, CA, USA) to log soil moisture data on an hourly basis. SMP data
    were converted to soil water content (%vol) using the soil-water retention curves
    developed by Irmak, 2019a, Irmak, 2019b for the research area soils for each field.
    Telemetry Gateway (Model A850, Adcon Telemetry, Austria) was used in the research
    (Picture 3). It forms the core of the data acquisition system as a base station.
    The Gateway acts as a network controller and at regular intervals (typically 15 min,
    but this can be changed) it requests data via modem from the RTUs in the field
    network. The Gateway also stores the incoming data in its memory, allowing it
    to supervise large numbers of RTUs and keep their data for a period of time before
    data are downloaded to a ProServer for long-term storage in a central database
    and for processing. One Telemetry Gateway (Model A850) can handle up to 1000 RTU
    field stations. Communication between the remote telemetry unit and the Telemetry
    Gateway is through cellular communication system''s global system for mobile communication.
    This data acquisition system is run by the addVANTAGE Pro software (Adcon Telemetry,
    Vienna, Austria) which controls various functions in the RTUs and the Gateway
    (Picture 4). The software collects data from the Telemetry Gateways and makes
    it available for viewing or for specialized analysis. The server is responsible
    for downloading data from the Telemetry Gateway, storing into the database, starting
    and stopping raw data processing, and servicing clients as they connect to the
    system. Download : Download high-res image (965KB) Download : Download full-size

    2.2.2. Meteorological data, field-specific measurements of soil matric potential,
    evaporative demand and precipitation Four agricultural weather stations were selected
    for the computation of reference and crop evapotranspiration. For this purpose,
    daily weather data from 2013 to 2015 at Brule Plate Valley, Champion, McCook,
    and Dickens sites were obtained from the High Plains Regional Climatic Center-Automated
    Weather Data Network (HPRCC-AWDN). The meteorological variables included in this
    dataset were maximum and minimum air temperatures, wind speed, relative humidity,
    and incoming shortwave radiation. The magnitudes of average growing season meteorological
    variables recorded at each site for the three growing seasons are presented in
    Table 2. Crop growing season was considered as May 1 to September 20, based on
    the most common historical planting and harvesting dates in the region.SMP in
    each field was measured on an hourly basis using Watermark granular matrix sensors
    installed at four depths in the root zone profile (30, 60, 90 and 120 cm). ETgauges
    were installed in five representative fields for site-specific reference ET measurements,
    designed to simulate ET from plant canopy in a way that closely mimics plant’s
    resistance to ET (Irmak et al., 2005a, Irmak et al., 2005b). Tipping-bucket rain
    gauges were also installed in these five representative fields for site specific
    precipitation data. Geographic Information System (GIS)-based tools were used
    to record, organize, and analyze these datasets geographically within the research
    area. The management practices adopted by individual growers which included crop
    type, acreage and cultivar information (maturity), planting and harvesting dates,
    seeding rate, tillage practices, fertilizer type and application, crop yield,
    etc. were obtained via personal communication with the producer partners. Table

    on the crop grown in the selected fields was obtained through the use of survey
    forms circulated and collected annually. Additionally, the Cropland Data Layer
    (CDL) provided by USDA-NASS was considered as an appropriate tool to collect crop
    type information. The CDL is a raster-based, geo-referenced, crop-specific land
    cover data layer created annually for the continental United States using moderate
    resolution satellite imagery and extensive agricultural ground truthing data.
    CDL-derived crop type data were verified against survey-collected crop type data,
    and a perfect agreement was found for available 51 field-year combinations, ensuring
    confidence in use of CDL data. The total number of fields planted with maize was
    28 (90 %) in 2013; 24 (77 %) in 2014 and 21 (67 %) in 2015; and, soybean was 3
    (10 %) in 2013; 7 (23 %) in 2014 and 7 (23 %) in 2015 (Table 3). Additionally,
    there were 3 (10 %) fields in 2015 cultivated with winter wheat. However, our
    analyses was limited to the fields growing maize and soybean, due to their dominance
    in the region. Table 3. Crops grown in the research fields in 2013, 2014 and 2015,

    reference evapotranspiration The precipitation data were obtained from three sources:
    NOAA-GHCN (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - Global Historical
    Climatology Network), HPRCC-AWDN and NeRAIN (Nebraska Rainfall Assessment and
    Information Network). Among these sources, 101 weather stations in 2013, 99 in
    2014, and 96 in 2015 were selected to determine precipitation depth for spatial
    interpolation. A proportion of the selected weather station sites were outside
    the geographic boundary of the MRNRD, ensuring accurate interpolation along the
    borders. Inverse distance weighing (IDW) interpolation technique was implemented
    for spatial interpolation using the Spatial Analyst Toolset provided in ArcGIS
    10.2 (ArcGIS 10.2, ESRI, Redlands, California). Interpolation resulted in 459
    spatial datasets (rasters) of daily precipitation for the region across the research
    period, which were used to develop monthly and growing season total precipitation
    datasets and field-level daily, monthly and growing-season precipitation were
    extracted using GIS tools. Grass- and alfalfa-reference evapotranspiration (ETo
    and ETr) was estimated using the standardized American Society of Civil Engineers-Environmental
    and Water Resources Institute (ASCE-EWRI) Penman-Monteith (PM) equation (ASCE-EWRI-PM)
    (ASCE-EWRI, 2005). This equation requires four primary meteorological observations:
    air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation: (1) ETref
    = standardized reference crop evapotranspiration (mm d-1). Rn = net radiation
    at the reference surface (MJ m-2 d-1). G = soil heat flux density at the soil
    surface (MJ m-2 d-1, assumed to be zero for daily time step). T = mean daily air
    temperature at 2 m height (°C). u2 = daily wind speed at 2 m height (m s-1). es
    = vapor pressure at 2 m height (kPa). ea = mean actual vapor pressure at 2 m height
    (kPa). es-ea = vapor pressure deficit (VPD, kPa). Δ = slope of the saturation
    vapor pressure-temperature curve (kPa °C-1). γ = psychometric constant (kPa °C-1).
    Cn = constant that changes with the reference crop (1600 and 900 for ETr and ETo,
    respectively). Cd = denominator constant that changes with the reference crop
    (0.38 and 0.34 for ETr and ETo, respectively). Apart from the estimation of reference
    ET, efforts were made to measure reference ETo and data were telemetrically recorded
    at five of the selected fields using ETgauges. In this research, number 30 green
    canvas cover was used to simulate ETo. In order to prepare complete records and
    assess the robustness of ETgauge measurements, intercomparisons between ETgauge-measured
    (at field P2) and ASCE-EWRI-PM-estimated ETo (at Dickens HPRCC weather site) for
    three research years were made (Fig. 2). A strong agreement was observed among
    the measured and estimated ETo with a mean RMSE of 0.99 mm d-1 and R2 ranging
    from 0.78 to 0.88, indicating that estimated ETo can serve as a proxy for the
    measured ETo (or vice versa) with good accuracy for research fields/locations
    where ETgauges could not be deployed for more local reference ET measurements.

    grass-reference evapotranspiration (ETo) and atmometer-measured ETo for the experimental
    locations in 2013, 2014 and 2015 growing seasons. The solid black line represents
    1:1 relationship. 2.5. Crop evapotranspiration ETc is the product of ETo and crop
    coefficient (Kc) (Eq. (2)), which is determined according to the crop type and
    the crop growth stage: (2) ETc = crop evapotranspiration (mm d-1). ETo= grass-reference
    evapotranspiration (mm d-1). Kc = crop coefficient. Kc differs for the different
    growth stages of the crop as well as varies with climate, soil, crop type and
    varieties, irrigation methods and management practices. The crop growth is generally
    divided into four stages: initial stage, crop-developmental stage, mid-season
    stage and late season stage. In this research, the crop coefficient curves (maize
    and soybean) were used as the function of days after planting (DAP) as shown in
    Fig. 3. These curves were measured and developed by the senior author (S. Irmak)
    in Nebraska as a part of the Nebraska Water and Energy Flux Measurement, Modeling
    and Research Network (NEBFLUX; Irmak, 2010) project. Developed polynomial equations
    were used in this research to calculate Kc values. For maize, the Kc values were
    0.15–0.20 in the initial stage and extended up to 1.02 in the mid-season (July),
    again reducing to 0.48 in the late season. For soybean, the Kc values start with
    0.20, increasing up to 0.94 in July and decreasing to 0.28 in the late season.
    The Kc values reported in Fig. 3 are generally within the range of values reported
    in the literature. Sharma and Irmak (2012a) used the same crop coefficient equations
    to determine long term (1986–2009) growing season (1 May to 30 September) ETc
    and net irrigation requirements. The actual plating dates were used for the fields
    for which the actual producer-reported data were available, which resulted in
    better field-specific estimations. Download : Download high-res image (168KB)

    requirement for each field site was calculated using a soil-water balance equation:
    (3) P = precipitation (mm). I = irrigation water requirement (mm). U = upward
    soil moisture flux (mm; assumed zero as the depth of the groundwater is approximately
    33 m below the surface). Ron = surface run-on (mm; assumed zero). Roff = surface
    run-off (mm). D = deep percolation (mm) below the crop root zone. ΔSWS = change
    in soil water storage in the soil profile (mm) from the beginning to the end of
    the season. ETc = crop evapotranspiration. Total soil-water storage (SWS) was
    calculated for the effective root zone depth which was considered as 1.20 m for
    both maize and soybean. Predominant soil textural classes in selected fields were
    silt loam, loamy sand, sandy loam, and sand in 12, 4, 9, and 6 fields, respectively.
    The soil-water characteristic equations (Irmak, 2019a, Irmak, 2019b) were used
    to convert soil matric potential (SMP, kPa) to volumetric water content (VWC,
    %vol) for each soil and are presented below: (4) (5) (6) (7) The surface run-off
    from each field was estimated using the USDA-NRCS curve number method (USDA-NRCS,
    1985). There were four different soil textures as discussed above and the maize
    and soybean were considered as straight row crops with good hydrologic condition.
    Curve number value for the sandy loam, loamy sand, and sand was used as 67. For
    silt loam, it was considered as 78. All calculations were done seasonally at each
    field site by solving Eq. (8) to calculate the irrigation water requirement (I)
    required for each field individually in each season: (8) 3. Results and discussions
    3.1. Precipitation The magnitudes of mean growing season precipitation across
    the MRNRD for the years 2013–2015 are presented in Fig. 4. Growing season precipitation
    varied from 295 to 593 mm across the research region. The year 2013 was the driest
    with mean precipitation of 301 mm across all the research fields. The mean precipitation
    amounts in 2014 and 2015 were 423 mm and 418 mm, respectively. Maximum precipitation
    was recorded in field S3 (345 mm) in 2013, field P26 (546 mm) in 2014, and field
    G3 (508 mm) in 2015. The fields (G1, G2, G3, P16, P17, P23, P24, P25) with higher
    mean precipitation occurring in Frontier County, which lies in the eastern part
    of MRNRD (Fig. 4). Fields P26 and S1 lie in Red Willow County (southeastern part
    of MRNRD) and received highest precipitation in 2014. Fig. 5 presents the precipitation

    3.2. Initiation, termination and length of irrigation season One of the most important
    decision in irrigation application is the onset and termination of the irrigation
    season. The start of irrigation in a season usually depends on the antecedent
    moisture availability in the soil profile and crop growth stage. The last irrigation
    of the season depends on the maturity stage of the crop, soil-water availability
    in the soil profile and evaporative demand. Since these factors are subject to
    change both spatially and temporally, it is expected that the timing of first
    and last irrigation events would also vary in different fields. Primarily, these
    dates depend on the management practices of the irrigator as well as the planting
    date and climate conditions. The planting dates varied from April 26 to May 21
    between the research fields. The first and last irrigation in a season was tracked
    from the data communicated via the telemetry system for all three years. Fig.
    6, Fig. 7 show the first and last irrigation, respectively, represented as days
    after planting (DAP). It was observed that the first irrigation varied from 4
    to 82 DAP (Fig. 6). In 2013, 55 % (6 out of 11) producers irrigated from 50 to
    60 DAP. 27 % of them irrigated from 41 to 44 DAP whereas two of them (fields P15
    and S1) irrigated at 70 and 82 DAP, respectively. In 2014, three of them were
    irrigating at 45, 46 and 47 DAP, respectively. Field P26 was irrigated 4 DAP which
    was very early in the season whereas field P16 was irrigated on 65 DAP. In 2015,
    eight fields were irrigated first time on 38–54 DAP and the gravity field G1 was
    irrigated on 67 DAP. Similarly, the last day of irrigation was also observed for
    the same fields. The last day of irrigation in all the three years ranged from
    112 (field G2) to 141 (field P3) DAP (Fig. 7), which is a duration of 49 days.
    Almost 90 % of the fields in 2013 terminated irrigations between 118 and 136 DAP,
    with the exception of field G2 in which irrigation was terminated 112 DAP. In
    2014, the range was between 114 DAP and 135 DAP. In 2015, 78 % of the fields terminated
    irrigation season between 125 DAP to 131 DAP whereas fields P1 and P3 applied
    their last irrigation on 137 and 141 DAP respectively (Fig. 7). Download : Download

    of irrigation application in all the thirty-one fields. Length of irrigation season,
    defined as the total number of days that water was pumped for the purpose of irrigation
    in a season. The number of fields selected in this analysis were 25 in 2013, 25
    in 2014, and 22 in 2015 from the common period (May 1 to September 20) in all
    three years. The maximum and minimum length of irrigation season was observed
    in SDI-irrigated field S3 (86 days in 2015) and gravity field G2 (14 days in 2014)
    respectively (Fig. 8). A significant difference was observed in the length of
    irrigation season among the selected fields demonstrating the role of management
    practices, climatic variables, and irrigator’s decision-making in irrigation application.
    For example, In field S3, the length of irrigation season in 2015 was quite high
    as compared with 2013 and 2014 which increased the irrigation depth applied in
    2015. However, the precipitation was 32 mm higher in 2015 than in 2013 and was
    61 mm lower than in 2014. Hence, it was observed that precipitation timing or
    amount likely has little impact on the irrigator’s decision making. Instead, the
    observed differences in the initiation, termination, and length of irrigation
    season across fields that were even planted within the same time frame (last week
    of April to the first week of May) demonstrates the role of individual decision-making
    of the irrigator. This can vary almost arbitrarily across irrigators, most likely
    due to their time-share among other activities on the farm, such as fertilizer
    application, pesticide applications, fungicide application, tillage, and other
    soil and crop management practices. Download : Download high-res image (203KB)
    Download : Download full-size image Fig. 8. The length of irrigation season in
    all 31 research fields. 3.3. Frequency distribution of irrigation applications
    In the research region, the crop planting dates usually range from the last week
    of April to the first week of May. Most producers planting at the same date with
    same or similar varieties would also need to irrigate at the same time, especially
    the ones experiencing the same distribution of precipitation and evaporative demand.
    Simultaneous irrigation application by a high proportion of producers not only
    results in high water abstractions from the aquifer, but also increases the energy
    demand at that particular time. It remains crucial to determine the peak water
    demand and its timing in a particular region for efficient allocation by the authorities.
    Fig. 9 shows the percentage of irrigation systems operating during each month
    of the growing season. It was observed that July and August were the months when
    the highest number of irrigation systems (70–90 %) were operational in all three
    years. However, in September, which is the last month of the growing season, 71
    %, 45 % and 61 % of the systems were operating in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively.
    The lowest number of irrigation systems that was in operation was in May due to
    early crop growth not requiring supplemental moisture other than contribution
    from stored crop root zone moisture from spring precipitation. In fact, there
    were no irrigation systems operating in 2013 in May and a small percentage in
    2014 (23 %) and even smaller percentage (16 %) in 2015. On average of three years,
    most of the precipitation occurred in May (104 mm) and June (109 mm) and lowest
    occurred in July (55 mm), August (80 mm) and September (34 mm) when plant leaf
    area index and consequently, ETc rates are the highest. Download : Download high-res

    systems operating in each month of the growing season from the selected thirty-one
    systems. 3.4. Depth of irrigation applied The irrigation systems selected for
    irrigation depth calculations were 25 in 2013, 25 in 2014, and 22 in 2015. The
    information on crop type in each field and each season is presented in Table 3.
    The total water depths applied by all individual irrigators in each season are
    shown in Fig. 10 along with the mean annual allocated (moratorium) irrigation
    depth (black line) by MRNRD. The irrigation amount allocated to each irrigator
    in MRNRD is 1524 mm per five years or a annual mean allocated depth of 305 mm,
    assuming uniform annual distribution. There were considerable differences in irrigation
    applications between the fields for the same crop type and between the years for
    the same fields. In 2013, nine of the 25 CP fields were irrigated by approximately
    300 mm or more, approaching the mean allocated depth. Gravity system fields were
    irrigated considerably more than the CP fields by about 90 mm in 2013. Field P9
    was irrigated with 386 mm, which was the only CP field irrigated significantly
    higher than its neighbors as well as more than the annually allocated irrigation
    depth in 2013. However, about 40 % of the selected fields were irrigated less
    than 200 mm in 2013. The irrigation depth in gravity system field G2 was reduced
    to 345 mm in 2014 and 307 mm in 2015 as compared with 391 mm in 2013. However,
    in field G1, the irrigation was increased to 415 mm in 2015 as compared with 390 mm
    in 2013. In the CP fields in 2014, the irrigation depth was almost equal or more
    than the previous year. Field P9, P5 and P10 were irrigated the most with 398,
    375 and 352 mm, respectively, in 2014. In 2015, irrigation depth in field P1 was
    about 500 mm, which was considerably higher than the previous two years and all
    other selected fields. However, most of the systems irrigated around or less than
    300 mm in contrast to the field P9 for which the irrigation depth was around 400 mm
    in all the three consecutive years (Fig. 10). In SDI fields S1 and S3, the irrigation
    depth was 164 and 199 mm in 2013, and 208 and 195 mm in 2014, respectively, which
    was considerably less than the gravity and center pivot fields. There was no difference
    observed in irrigation depth due to the crop type planted in the research fields.
    The average irrigation depth was observed to be 243, 264 and 284 mm in 2013, 2014
    and 2015, respectively. There were 40 % of fields each year exceeding the mean
    annual allocated irrigation depth threshold. Download : Download high-res image

    irrigation depth by MRNRD, assuming uniform annual distribution of 1524 mm allocation
    per five years. 3.5. Evaporative demand and crop evapotranspiration (ETc) Daily
    ETr values in the growing period (April 27 to September 20) for each year are
    presented in Fig. 11. Daily ETr values of all the four stations were observed
    to be very similar to each other and the variability observed in seasonal ETr
    was not higher than the inter-annual variability observed at an individual site,
    indicating that ETr did not vary substantially across the MRNRD. Since computation
    of reference ET requires extensive climate data measurements and the region did
    not have adequate number/density of these measurement sites, the computation of
    field-scale ETr was not carried out. The black line in Fig. 11 represents the
    average ETr values of all four stations for the three consecutive growing seasons.
    The growing season total ETr for 2013, 2014 and 2015 was 1175, 1005 and 958 mm,
    respectively. The most probable reasons for the higher ETr in 2013 can be the
    warmer air temperatures, higher solar radiation, higher wind speed, higher vapor
    pressure deficit and lower relative humidity as compared with 2014 and 2015 (Table
    2). Download : Download high-res image (999KB) Download : Download full-size image

    along with standard deviation among the thirty-one fields for three research years
    is presented in Fig. 12. For maize, the growing season total ETc ranged from 676
    to 756 mm in 2013; 615–659 mm in 2014; and 608–624 mm in 2015 with an average
    of 733, 648 and 621 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. For soybean, the
    growing season total ETc ranged from 629 to 680 mm in 2013; 535–597 mm in 2014;
    and 544–571 mm in 2015 with an average of 663, 577 and 560 mm in 2013, 2014 and
    2015, respectively. On average, maize ETc was 10 % higher than the soybean ETc
    in all three years, similar to the results found in Sharma and Irmak (2012b) for
    the long-term (1986–2009) large-scale assessments for MRNRD area. ETc in 2013
    was relatively higher than in 2014 and 2015 for both crops. The average ETc for
    maize in 2013 was 85 mm and 112 mm higher than those determined for 2014 and 2015,
    respectively. For soybean, average ETc was 86 mm and 103 mm higher in 2013 than
    in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The ETc variations observed within the fields
    were primarily due to the differences in the planting dates and the crop type
    as other parameters/variables were similar for all fields. Download : Download

    vs. producers’ actual application The actual irrigation depth applied for each
    field was compared to the computed irrigation water requirements as estimated
    using two-step approach and the soil-water balance (Fig. 13) that used information
    and data obtained specifically for each field. In 2013, irrigation requirement
    was greater than irrigation applied in all fields, except field G2. In 2014 and
    2015, irrigation applied exceeded the irrigation water requirements in 80 % of
    the fields. There were three fields in 2014 and in 2015, where irrigation requirement
    was more than actual amount of irrigation water applied. On average, irrigation
    requirement in maize fields were 394, 242 and 184 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively,
    whereas the average amount of irrigation water withdrawal was 267, 292 and 264 mm
    in the same years, respectively. Similarly, irrigation requirement in soybean
    fields was 307, 163 and 219 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively, whereas the
    average amount of water pumped was 234, 251 and 274 mm in the same years, respectively.
    It is observed that on average, maize irrigation requirement was 61 % and 47 %
    in 2014 and 2015, respectively, as compared with 2013 whereas irrigation applied
    was 109 % and 99 % in 2014 and 2015, respectively, as compared with 2013. Similarly,
    soybean irrigation requirement was 53 % and 71 % in 2014 and 2015, respectively,
    as compared with 2013 whereas irrigation applied was 107 % and 117 % in 2014 and
    2015, respectively, as compared with 2013. The inter-annual variation in irrigation
    requirement was substantial, but it was relatively insignificant in irrigation
    application. Given the same site characteristics, irrigation requirement is mostly
    affected by environmental factors such as evaporative water demand (vapor pressure
    deficit), precipitation and stored soil-water. The magnitudes of these variables
    were considerably different between the three years which govern the magnitude
    of irrigation requirement. Ideally, the changes in irrigation requirement should
    be reflected in irrigation application by producers, provided that continuous
    and appropriate monitoring of soil moisture and/or crop water use is performed
    as these metrics will respond to the various factors governing plant water uptake.
    In contrast to this, our observations of irrigation application show that most
    producers did not consider following any established irrigation scheduling approach,
    resulting in suboptimal (greater or lower) amount of water being applied to their
    fields. For example, field P10 was under-irrigated (by 78 mm) in 2013 while it
    was over-irrigated by 70 mm in 2014 and by 105 mm in 2015. Field P3 was under-irrigated
    by 210, 104 and 35 mm in 2013, 2014 and 2015, respectively. SDI-irrigated field
    S3 was under-irrigated by 170 mm in 2013 whereas it was over-irrigated by 73 and
    42 mm in 2014 and 2015, respectively, indicating the need for implementing agricultural
    water management technologies and associated educational programs, training and
    demonstrations to enable optimum use of limited water resources and enhance crop
    water productivity. Download : Download high-res image (863KB) Download : Download

    Solid bars represent maize fields and bars with dashed diagonal lines represent
    soybean fields. 3.7. Applied irrigation water vs. water allocation Fig. 14 shows
    the cumulative amount of water pumped in each field in three years along with
    the allocated water per five years as well as an annual mean allocated water,
    assuming uniform distribution of 305 mm per year. There were few fields that pumping
    more irrigation water than allocated in 2013, which increased in 2014. There were
    seven fields in 2015 which crossed the 3rd year mean allocated amount, with the
    field P9 almost pumping the fourth-year allocated amount. According to the trend
    observed in Fig. 14, it is expected that a reasonable proportion of fields would
    have exceeded the five-year allocated water depth in the region. Nevertheless,
    70 % of the producers applied irrigation water well within their restricted water
    allocations. If producers pumped more than 305 mm of water per year for multiple
    years, they risk consuming their 5-year allocation sooners, which also risks not
    having enough (or any) water available for crop production in the 4th and/or 5th
    year, which can have significant negative consequences to farm income. Thus, implementing
    scientifically-based water management technologies and strategies to account for
    stored soil moisture and effective use of precipitation as well as implanting
    effective soil management practices (e.g., reduced till or no-till) can aid not
    only increasing crop water productivity, but can aid in ensuring the total allocated
    water amount can be used appropriately in a given year. Download : Download high-res

    conclusions Field-specific irrigation water withdrawal and use data are essential
    for effective agricultural water management and for development of policies and
    regulations governing the use of water, predicting changes in water demand in
    response to changing climatic conditions, cropping systems and irrigation management
    scenarios. Good decision-making in irrigation water management is dependent upon
    data that can provide real-time information about crop water needs, irrigation
    applications, crop growth and development stage and weather patterns. Irrigation
    water-use data are also used to more effectively manage finite groundwater supplies
    in regions where surface and groundwater supplies are either over-appropriated
    (demand exceeds supply) or fully-appropriated (demand are supply are critically
    equal). The field-specific automated irrigation water use monitoring and data
    collection system deployed in this research provide real-time and site-specific
    metrics reflecting irrigation analytics and irrigator behavior throughout the
    growing season. Various metrics calculated from the obtained datasets such as
    initiation, termination, and length (duration) of irrigation season, irrigation
    application frequency and irrigation depth show that there can be substantial
    farm-to-farm heterogeneity even within relatively small irrigated regions. Thus,
    it is challenging to robustly benchmark regional water footprint and irrigator
    behavior across larger scales owing to the high degree of farm-to-farm variability,
    unaccounted variables (irrigation vs. other farm operations) that are used (or
    not used) for decision-making by irrigators. Surprisingly, it was also observed
    that irrigation depths estimated using scientifically-based and widely used procedures
    such as the two-step approach of computing ETc and site-specific soil-water balance
    showed little agreement with actual applied irrigation depths by the producers.
    Only few farms followed the trend of year-to-year and farm-to-farm variation captured
    in estimated irrigation depths. Monitoring and accounting for farm-specific evaporative
    demand, soil moisture and precipitation amounts did not lead to accurate representation
    of irrigator decisions. This observation is strong evidence that irrigation decisions
    by users are not backed by data and scientific protocols, and are largely driven
    by condition of crop, feel of soil, personal calendar schedule, neighbor practices,
    or no irrigation management protocol at al. Despite increase in technologies that
    can be used for agricultural water management decision-making, in this research,
    irrigator decisions did not seem to reasonably follow patterns of water use metrics
    like soil moisture and/or crop water use or evaporative demand. Thus, standard
    estimations of crop water footprint should be carefully assessed prior to representing
    actual water use across large regions. Our observations demonstrate the need for
    greater momentum for real-time monitoring of farm-level irrigation dynamics and
    their integrative reporting. Advances in Internet of Things (IoT) can be leveraged
    to connect these data-streams to effectively report, privately or publicly host,
    and utilize quantitative information on irrigation water use and irrigation behavior
    across agroecosystems. Automated water dynamics system deployed in this research
    can aid in more effectively planning and managing the quantity and distribution
    of limited water resources, especially in regions with pumping allocations. Declaration

    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Greater Noida, India SECTION I. Introduction
    The necessity for agricultural modernization and in-depth manufacturing strategies
    has expanded because the call for meals has expanded in phrases of each first-rate
    and quantity. The Internet of Things (IoT) enterprise is booming, and it is bringing
    a flood of recent agricultural principles to the forefront. By connecting to the
    Internet of Things, studies institutes and clinical societies can enlarge its
    attain and speed, imparting era and commodities to a number of agricultural areas.
    As a part of the Internet of Things, those systems interact, detect, and hyperlink
    with inner and outside country embedded technology [1]. A custom-constructed landslide
    chance tracking device has been advanced, which lets in for fast implementation
    in antagonistic environments without requiring user input [2]. The affords an
    Internet of Things (IoT) control device that video display units'' variables which
    include wind, soil, atmosphere, and water over a huge area. IoT additionally creates
    exact, actual-time maps of quite a number environmental characteristics, consisting
    of noise levels, air, water, and temperature pollution, and perilous radiation
    levels [3]. Precision agriculture, clever agriculture, and crop use of fewer insecticides
    and fertilisers will all assist to decrease leaching hazards, pollution, and weather
    alternate consequences [4]. A. Problem Solutions In terms of IT design, a variety
    of open architecture answers for cost-effective, interoperable, and scalable packages
    have to be available. All farmers have to acquire loose education to help them
    apprehend the way to use IoT devices. It is vital to elevate know-how of Agro-Tech
    subculture everywhere in the international so as for it to grow. In order to construct
    a secure and felony practise, in addition to start and progressively broaden this
    aspect [5], the authorities must approve it. Smart Farming is an exciting idea
    that revolves round farm control the usage of the cutting-edge IoT gadgets to
    enhance product best and amount at the same time as lowering the quantity of human
    labour required. Individual plants/animals/plants have to be kept, extremely good
    plants maintained, cattle farming practised, precise animals bred, own circle
    of relatives farming practised, and natural farming practised [6]. Fig. 1. Classical
    iot based agriculture architecture Show All The following are the contributions
    of this paper to the IoT agriculture domain. The background of IoT agriculture
    technology is presented in Section 2. The IoT-based smart agriculture management

    of iot based smart agriculture Show All A WSN-primarily based totally polyhouse
    tracking machine with carbon dioxide, humidity, temperature, and mild detecting
    modules is defined in [7]. To raise productivity, a real-time rice crop tracking
    machine become developed. Describes a crop tracking machine for stopping crop
    loss and growing manufacturing via way of means of accumulating and analysing
    rainfall and temperature data. [8] Indicates a low-value Bluetooth-primarily based
    totally system with a microcontroller that still serves as a climate station for
    tracking agricultural variables like temperature. The machine''s constrained verbal
    exchange range, in addition to the requirement for common tracking thru Bluetooth
    reference to cell phones, also are disadvantages. [9] has advanced a ZigBee-primarily
    based totally clever sensing platform that may come across pressure, humidity,
    sunlight and temperature. A system was based on GSM and FPGA''s Array has been
    selected to evaluate environmental factors such as temperature and moisture &
    gives crop and soil monitor options that are either outlay and prompt [10]. [11]
    Offers a low-cost, simple, and adaptable networking system that monitors various
    greenhouse conditions using a fuzzy control technique. For a more sophisticated
    surveillance and operation control in the conservatory, the operation and design
    approaches for WSN have already been described in [12]. Sustainability issues
    like as WSN material regulation, wireless node packing, and electromagnetic influence
    have all been managed. [14] Devised a method for monitoring an animal''s health
    and identifying common diseases, whether induced by biological or natural factors.
    SECTION III. Iot-Based Smart Agriculture Management Agriculture is being revolutionised
    through the Internet of Things, that''s giving farmers with a different series
    of equipment to address loads of problems they confront at the farm. Growers can
    access their farmland from practically anywhere & everywhere and whatever time
    through sensors and actuators, and Wi-Fi sensor networks are utilised to display
    the farm. With IoT-enabled solutions, crop manufacturing fees may be reduced whilst
    land productiveness is raised [15]. Fig. 3. Role of iot based smart agriculture
    Show All A. Water Management The particular quantity of water required in greenhouses
    is a vital challenge [16]. The sensors are utilized to show the quantity of liquid
    with inside the reservoir, and the facts is put away to the cloud using smartphone
    app. In standard irrigation structures, as much as 50% of this water is misplaced
    because of over-watering as a result of shortcomings in cutting-edge irrigation
    strategies and structures [17]. B. Irrigation Management It is responsible for
    the design, improvement, operation, and management of irrigation structures. Weather
    and soil situations may be used to enhance a farmer''s irrigation gadget in some
    of ways [18]. Shrewd water system structures endured the Internet of Things use
    field-conveyed sensors to tune soil properties, meteorological and climatic circumstances,
    and water system boundaries [19]. C. Soil Management Numerous soil factors, including
    pH and moisture content, have to be decided for soil control. These metrics may
    be without difficulty computed with the assist of IoT devices. Moisture and humidity
    sensors are used to maintain music of the soil''s moisture level [51]. The consequences
    of a soil trying out take a look at survey assist farmers beautify crop yield
    via way of means of recommending fertilisation choices [20]. Furthermore, via
    way of means of using IoT era to come across dirty soil, the sector is blanketed
    from over-fertilization and crop damage. D. Weather Management Many key components
    are blended to hold and construct a perfect habitat for flora at the same time
    as adhering to strict rules, together with ventilation, temperature, CO2, and
    oxygen levels. This may be facilitated through organising an IoT-enabled environment
    wherein clever sensors and devices speak statistics as a way to decorate decision-making
    [21]. E. Precision Farming Physical inspection changed into a conventional farming
    method for growing manufacturing and maintaining crops, and if a hassle arose,
    it changed into typically addressed after a sizeable farm event, and it changed
    into completed on a trial-and-mistakes basis. The use of IoT in agriculture might
    drastically growth operational efficiency [22]. F. Nutrient Management The method
    of creating the high-satisfactory use of agricultural vitamins even as additionally
    safeguarding the surroundings is referred to as nutrient control. Nutrients are
    required to acquire sustainable agriculture at the bottom viable environmental
    and financial cost [23]. G. Waste Management A trash disposal answer is proposed
    via way of means of the Internet of Things (IoT). Intelligent trash cans may be
    created the usage of IoT sensors. This is probably used to read, store, and ship
    waste-associated statistics over the internet. Waste control may be done with
    the assist of smart and simplified algorithms [24]. H. Livestock Monitoring The
    growth of agricultural manufacturing to be able to feed the world''s populace
    is turning into an international concern. As a result, cattle control in farmland
    is vital to the survival of the farm. At this moment, the Internet of Things (IoT)
    enters the picture. Using verbal exchange and strength sensors, this cloud-primarily
    based totally generation is regularly used to remotely harmony the wellbeing of
    animals and aids within side the identity of cattle locations [25]. I. Farm Management
    System (FMS) FMS is an important thing of clever farming [26]. Farmers may also
    screen the whole farm the usage of a connected FMS that captures all the facts
    the usage of WSN, GSM modules, and a microcontroller, statistic is recorded at
    the server in a preferred layout and may be accessed through a smartphone or the
    net for added processing. To make the maximum of water resources, an automated
    irrigation and manage system is employed. The farm is covered from pests and animals
    further to the irrigation system [27]. J. Tracking and Tracing A machine for remotely
    tracking soil first-class and shape on the subject of crop cultivation wishes
    is defined in [28]. To perceive and understand real-time records processing, ZigBee
    is attached to different gadgets thru WSN, inclusive of CMS, GSM, and GPRS. K.
    Crop Management SVM became advocated for estimating rice manufacturing with using
    a Chinese tracking station for particular geographic data. [29] Has proven to
    be a feasible manner for counting espresso culmination automatically, which aids
    farmers in making plans their agricultural sports and decreasing risk. L. Block
    Chain Along with Iot for Farming The block chain is a decentralised record of
    transactions that everyone contributors preserve & make contributions to, it additionally
    lets in for well-timed bills to stakeholders that can be caused with the aid of
    using block chain records changes [30]. SECTION IV. Taxonomy of Smart Agriculture
    We''ve highlighted a few software, hardware and apps and that are helping to make
    agriculture more intelligent in this section. The apps are in charge of collecting
    data for analysis in the future. Fig. 4. Taxonomy of smart agriculture Show All

    of its notably seemed ROI (go back on investment) calculator [31], that''s designed
    to assist farmers maximise yields and profits. ii. Sirrus It helps conversation
    among agronomists and farmers through making area records effortlessly accessible
    [32]. Users and apps can get right of entry to based area records offline and
    interchange it with different customers and gadgets through connecting to the
    agX framework. iii. Fieldagent It collects facts for a whole lot of uses, together
    with growing visually attractive farming harvest fitness charts, counting seeds
    and plants, and weed detection. On your computer, it shows certain ortho mosaics,
    herbal types, unwanted plant locations, and specific Normalized Difference Vegetation
    Index (NDVI) crop-fitness information, in addition to role facts to useful resource
    in-discipline scouting [33]. iv. Openiot It calculates humidity, air temperature,
    and soil temperature to help plant breeders in figuring out the fame of numerous
    wheat kinds. Farmers can use these facts to expect crop ages, irrigation plans,
    and fertiliser necessities for plant growth [34]. v. Farmbot It is based at the
    advent of an open supply self sufficient clever agriculture system for the truer
    of humanity [35]. vi. Smartfarmnet It responds to sensor-primarily based totally
    requests for time-collection streaming information in close to actual time. SmartFarmNet
    collects, extracts, and aggregates evidence streams from approximately all IoT
    systems. The OpenIoT X-GSN capabilities [36] are utilized by the Smart Farm Net
    gateway for information input. vii. Isoylscout When taking walks or in a vehicle,
    iSOYLscout is a sincere area scouting utility that identifies areas manually or
    the usage of the integrated GPS. It''s additionally viable to position notes and/or
    an image with the point. ISOYLscout documents are right away loaded into MySQL,
    permitting area and workplace information to be shared wirelessly and quickly
    [37]. viii. Agvault 2.0 With a suggestion drone [38], customers can speedily go
    to massive fields. The utility permits the consumer to extrude the UAV''S elevation,
    device settings, overlapping, supervision angle, and investigation zone. ix. Agrisync

    web-primarily based totally device that lets in customers to speedy and clearly
    assemble farm maps [40]. Your map is saved within side the cloud & may be accessed
    from any device, along with a cellular phone, tablet, or computing device computer.
    C. Smart Agriculture Software The Internet of Things in agriculture combines robotics,
    drones, far flung sensors, and laptop imaginative and prescient with ever-enhancing
    device mastering and computational package program to tune harvests, study & observe
    fields, also offer farmers with indication for time and money-saving farm control
    practises [41]. D. Smart Hardware Agriculture We''ve emphasized many well IoT
    gadgets used in agriculture in this area. Sensors could be the most important
    embedded system of IoT. These devices make use of electrical components, radio
    frequency configurations, and sensor modules [42]. SECTION V. Key Benefits of
    Iot Based Clever Farming Smart farming structures use faraway sensing to lessen
    waste, improve production, and control a bigger diversity of capitals. In orthodox
    farming methods, the farmer become continually out within side the field, examining
    the fame of the farmland. However, as farms have grown larger, it''s been greater
    hard for farmers to maintain song of everything. As a result, controlling agricultural
    output and detecting crucial boom components - inclusive of moisture, fertiliser,
    or cloth content - in a clever agriculture gadget is all approximately making
    sure the supposed crop''s manufacturing, relying on its state [43]. Overall, sensors
    screen and software program control the complete system from farm to fork, reducing
    normal expenses, growing normal manufacturing and deliver quality, and in the
    end enhancing the farmer experience [44]. SECTION VI. Challenges & Open Issue
    of Iot Base Smart Agriculture With IoT application installation, there are several
    unresolved concerns and challenges. This section discusses some of the problems
    that have been raised in the literature. Iot Standardization There are some of
    demanding situations in adapting present net protocols and packages to bodily
    gadgets at the net [45]. Because the Internet of Things is made from a various
    variety of gadgets, attaining excessive degrees of interoperability is hard. Iot
    Data In the Internet of Things, data management is critical. The volume of created
    data and the processes required in its administration become significant when
    considering a world of networked items constantly sharing all forms of information.
    A strategy for collecting and delivering data in a consolidated style is data
    aggregation. This data can be used to generate statistics [46]. Security Physical
    tampering, which include housebreaking or assaults with the aid of using rats
    and cattle, in addition to adjustments in bodily deal with or connection, are
    all ability threats within side the clever agriculture area [47]. Reliability
    Devices which might be a part of the Internet of Things are designed to be utilised
    outside. Physical protection of mounted IoT gadgets and networks [48] need to
    be maintained to defend highly-priced gadget from detrimental climate occasions
    consisting of floods and hurricanes. Scalability A huge range of linked gadgets
    and sensors are utilized in clever agriculture, necessitating the improvement
    of wise IoT control framework to discover and adjust every node [49]. Current
    gateways and protocols could must assist a huge range of IoT gadgets/nodes, for
    example, Sigfox helps 106 nodes. Networking Issue The connectivity among several
    sensor nodes in clever agriculture poses a huge task. Sensors do good sized computations
    that want a variety of strength, but sensor batteries are limited. As a result,
    in mild of environmental problems and rural locations, the best and strong generation
    for records transmission may be chosen [50]. Cost Several cost-associated demanding
    situations exist whilst the use of IoT in agriculture, consisting of setup and
    jogging prices. Hardware expenditures, consisting of IoT, gateways, devices/sensors,
    and base station infrastructure are covered within side the setup prices. Furthermore,
    operational prices consist of an ongoing subscription for IoT tool administration,
    records sharing, and different offerings, in addition to centralised offerings
    that offer information/records collecting [50]. SECTION VII. Conclusion This article
    provides a comprehensive overview of the literature that consists of a dialogue
    of cutting-edge tremendous studies articles on IoT -primarily based totally agriculture.
    The look at contained a complete of sixty-seven studies, all of which had been
    cautiously chosen. The dialogue then moved directly to some of IoT farm applications,
    sensors/devices, and connectivity protocols. The truth that many governments are
    sponsoring studies on this area, in addition to the truth that many nations have
    their very own IoT agriculture rules, is the maximum encouraging element. Aside
    from that, the important thing additives of IoT-primarily based totally agriculture
    had been contextualised. Finally, potential studies instructions for IoT-primarily
    based totally agriculture scientists had been considered. Authors Figures References

    on Applications of Internet of Things in Healthcare Chapter © 2020 1 Introduction
    Different IoT solutions [1] are being implemented in the industry for solving
    different industrial problems to make industrial processes and manufacturing processes
    much more efficient than the way it is at present. The main aim of IoT is to interconnect
    different smart objects so that they are uniquely identified and able to interoperate
    between themselves. In these smart objects, intelligence is embedded. IIoT is
    an application of IoT in the industries to modify various existing industrial
    systems. IIoT links the automation system with enterprise, planning, and product
    life cycle. IIoT borrows some of the features of IoT and some from the vision
    of Industry 4.0 and tries to have a separate vision and technology for itself.
    So Industry 4.0 gives a framework for automation and data exchange in manufacturing
    technologies. So, Industry 4.0 basically tries to improve the automation and data
    exchange in manufacturing and technologies; it tries to incorporate concepts from
    cyber physical systems, IoT cloud computing, and so on. IIoT and IoT are not the
    same [2] as IoT focuses on consumer-level services and consumer-level products
    whereas IIoT has the focus on the enterprise. IoT traditionally focuses on the
    convenience of the individuals, and IIoT focuses on the efficiency, safety, and
    security of operation. In terms of machine-to-machine (M-2-M) communication, its
    use is limited in IoT, whereas M-2-M communication is extensively used in IIoT;
    the whole industrial operation in a plant is automated. So, one machine talking
    to another machine is quite extensive in the industrial sector IIoT. Some of the
    integral components for building IIoT are machine learning, big data technology,
    M-2-M communication, and automation. So machine learning involves learning from
    the existing data and then trying to make predictions so as to make things better
    in the future. The machine-to-machine communication is about two machines communicating
    with each other for getting a particular work or a task accomplished without any
    human intervention. So, a robotic arm opening the door of a refrigerator and then
    performing certain other tasks in the refrigerator are an example of machine to
    machine. So, maybe the robotic arm goes and opens the door of the refrigerator
    and checks whether there is sufficient milk in the milk pot of the refrigerator
    or not; if there is no sufficient milk, then the system as a whole will send an
    SMS to the milk person. So, we have machine-to-machine communication and automation
    without human intervention. So, these are the different aspects of IIoT. So, IIoT
    is supported by a huge amount of data collected from sensors, and it is based
    on wrap-and-reuse approach rather than rip-and-replace approach. We are not building
    a new system from scratch; we use the existing industrial systems; wrap them with
    sensors, actuators, and so on; and make things efficient. In IIoT, we try to reengineer
    the existing systems and the processes and we do not build anything brand new
    from scratch. IIoT combines the second generation of Internet (where things are
    connected), fourth generation of industrial automation, and cloud computing. So,
    cloud has become a very popular technology since about more than half a decade
    and it is being used in the industrial sector as well. So, cloud offers computational
    environments, computational infrastructure, computational platforms, and computational
    software in addition to regular storage. Using cloud one can get access to everything
    in an industry without basically having to purchase these of their own. In the
    IIoT network, we have physical objects, different systems and subsystems, platforms,
    and applications that are interconnected. IIoT networks can communicate with one
    another, external environment, and different people. The acquisition of IIoT has
    led to the availability and affordability of sensors, processors, and other technologies,
    which facilitate the capture of and access to real-time information. IIoT has
    a plethora of applications like transportation [3–4], power plant security and
    safety [5], inventory management and quality control [6], facility management
    [7], milk processing and packaging industries, healthcare, manufacturing industries,
    and food industry. But in this chapter, we only focus on the three applications:
    healthcare, manufacturing industries, and food industry. 2 Requirements of IIoT
    There are four broad requirements of IIoT. We need the hardware and software connectivity
    and a cloud platform with respect to processing, infrastructure, and data storage.
    Application development and big data analytics are very important. All these different
    sensors and actuators are fitted to these different machines and manufacturing
    equipment. They throw in a huge volume of data in real time that can reveal a
    lot of information. Data also have other characteristics, such as they come in
    huge velocities, and there are different types of such data, like speech, images,
    and video, all coming at the same time need to be handled, and so on. By mining
    such data using big data analytics, one can predict different things to make these
    industrial processes much more efficient. Another IIoT requirement is with respect
    to access, i.e., one can access anything, at anytime, from anywhere in IIoT. So
    here end-to-end security is important. User experience has to be taken into account
    as one of the fundamental requirements for building IIoT, i.e., what users exactly
    want, how their problems can be addressed and solved, how through the use of IIoT
    system users can do things better and how their experience as a whole can be improved.
    Transition to smart machines: By adding sensors and actuators we are making the
    machine smart. Asset management is very important; through asset management, different
    sensors and actuators (which are the industrial assets) can be managed in a much
    more efficient way. We now take a deep dive into the issues and challenges [8]
    in the adoption of IIoT: There are data integration challenges, so here we refer
    to a large number of machines. These different machines have their own heterogeneity
    in place. Integration of these heterogeneous data coming in high volumes and velocities
    is a herculean task. Cyber security is very important because we are referring
    to a connected world, where there is connectivity between (i) machines themselves,
    (ii) machine and human beings, and (iii) machines and human beings. Due to this
    connectivity, it is quite likely that some vulnerabilities are introduced in the
    overall network, making it possible for different types of attacks and newer types
    of attacks to be launched. There is lack of standardization; large automation
    supplier firms do not encourage open standardization as it will reduce customers’
    reliance on them. So, small automation supplier firms basically lack the capability
    to incentivize this huge step. Lack of standardization leads to different issues
    related to device interoperability and semantic interoperability. So, different
    machines supporting different IoT devices need to talk to each other and they
    have been made by different vendors. Legacy installations are a very crucial aspect
    to be considered. Technology is evolving fast. Industries have a huge legacy machine
    base and these machines have been operating successfully since decades. With the
    incorporation of IIoT, we need to have support for these newer technologies and
    newer machines being procured. So fast-evolving technology should coexist with
    the legacy equipment without leaving any kind of vulnerability in the whole integrated
    system. The next issue with IIoT adoption is lack of skilled workers. The workers
    do not have IIoT-related skills, like data integration. The technologies associated
    with IIoT are new in nature, so workers should have fast and diverse knowledge
    about these technologies. Now we discuss the different design considerations for
    building IIoT. 3 Design Considerations for IIoT To use an IoT device for industrial
    applications, the following design objectives [9] have to be considered: Energy:
    Time for which the IoT device can operate with the limited power supply Latency:
    Time required to transmit the data Throughput: Maximum data transmitted across
    the network Scalability: Number of devices supported Topology: Communication among
    the devices, i.e., interoperability Safety and security: Degree of safety and
    security of the application So, now we discuss some of the application areas of
    IIoT like healthcare industry, manufacturing industry, and food industry. 4 IIoT
    Applications: Healthcare 4.1 IIoT in Healthcare Earlier, people used to die due
    to lack of healthcare. People used to forget about their health due to busy life,
    and this has also happened in the recent past. Additionally, the number of diseases
    has also increased in recent times. So, we have our IIoT solutions that could
    be used to alleviate some of the problems that are encountered by people with
    respect to health. So, IIoT solutions can help in making healthcare easier and
    affordable. There are different sensors [10] such as the ECG sensor, blood pressure
    sensor, glucose-monitoring sensor, and temperature sensor that are currently available
    in the market; these are affordable and can be procured by patients themselves
    for monitoring their health conditions at their homes or these could also be purchased
    by different healthcare facilities, hospitals, and so on. If any patient has a
    critical condition, different levels of alerts would be sent to the healthcare
    facilities or hospitals to which these patients are registered. 4.1.1 Concerns
    in Healthcare Regarding IIoT There are different healthcare concerns with respect
    to their implementation of IIoT. Populations are aging all over the world, different
    diseases are increasing, and medical expenses are also increasing. These are some
    of the generic healthcare challenges, but from an IIoT perspective as well. Catering
    to these requirements is also a challenge; scalability of IIoT solutions will
    have to be taken into consideration not only in terms of numbers, but also in
    terms of diversity. So, all generic healthcare challenges also have implications
    on IIoT implementation in the healthcare industry. 4.1.2 IIoT Implementation for
    Old Population Looking at the age groups, populations are growing older; between
    2017 and 2050, the persons aged over 60 years are expected to increase more than
    double. By 2050, the number of elderly persons is expected to grow to 2.1 billion
    worldwide which is a huge number. We have a growing population and it will invite
    taking care of their health. Monitoring of elderly people’s health condition has
    to be done efficiently. So, telecare applications, smartphone, or telemedicine
    basically can help elderly people to live safely. So, we can have telemedicine
    solutions [11] being deployed in the homes of these elderly persons so that the
    doctors can remotely monitor the condition of these elderly people from their
    homes. This applies to not only elderly people but also other population. 4.1.3
    IIoT Implementation for Increase in the Diseases Not only the number of diseases
    but also the types of diseases are increasing day by day. So, we need to have
    a suitable and efficient large-scale monitoring system that will cater to the
    particular problem and address that problem. So, nowadays, we talk about having
    telecare applications, smartphone applications, and telemedicine applications
    for elderly people. We are also talking about these kinds of solutions for catering
    to the other segments of the population. So, continuous monitoring of patients’
    health can be done, and this can also help in reducing the number of cases of
    hospitalization. Sensors can collect blood pressure, respiration, pulse rate,
    heart rate data, and weight data continuously and as and when required; if any
    alarm has to be triggered, this can be done in a much more efficient manner, and
    this can be done if any abnormal solution is detected or any abnormality is going
    to arise in the future. 4.1.4 IIoT Reduces the Expenditure IIoT-based solutions
    for healthcare can help in reducing the expenditure; different wearable healthcare
    devices can help in reducing the cost of health checkup; remote continuous monitoring
    of patients using smart sensors would be made possible. In hospitals and other
    healthcare units, smart beds can be deployed which can send notification to the
    doctor about the patient’s activity. 4.1.5 Cloud-Enabled IIoT Healthcare Solution
    There are different layers in the IIoT healthcare architecture. It starts from
    acquiring the data from the sensors; at the very bottom; sending the sensed data;
    processing the data; storing the data and getting different information knowledge
    etc. about what is going on, underneath from the data and trying to make more
    sense out of the data, through information processing, knowledge processing and
    so on. Now we discuss the cloud-enabled IIoT healthcare architecture. On one end
    we are going to have all devices which are typically sensor enabled, i.e., the
    smart sensors and then some gateway. So, from these sensors, the data are going
    to be sent to the IoT-enabled cloud platform where different analytics will be
    performed. Not just analytics, but health data verification can be performed and
    the data can be stored and also processed in a computer or a computational resource
    in the cloud and so on. And there are lot of other different things that could
    also be done at the cloud and finally we are going to have this two-way communication
    and we are going to have healthcare applications which are going to be the beneficiaries
    from the cloud where analytics is performed. At the application end, different
    patient data about their health condition such as ECG, EMG, then may be pulse
    oximeter data, and many other different types of healthcare data could be made
    available after suitable processing and analytics. So, this is going to be the
    data flow architecture at very high level for healthcare IoT. 4.1.6 Benefits of
    IIoT in the Healthcare Now we discuss the benefits of IIoT in healthcare. With
    IIoT, one can monitor the patient’s health condition remotely. So, remote healthcare
    is possible. Remote real-time continuous monitoring of patients’ health condition
    24 × 7 is possible. Hospital staff can predict the arrival of a patient in their
    emergency units; it is also possible to have a hygiene monitoring system which
    can detect the cleanliness of the hospital and the healthcare facility. Medical
    staff can provide quality medical services with a small budget using IIoT. So,
    these are some of the benefits that IIoT implementation in healthcare can provide.
    4.2 IIoT-Based Healthcare Devices 4.2.1 Wireless ECG Monitors Wireless ECG monitors
    are there which can collect biosignals from ECG devices; the collected data could
    be sent to the cloud; and medical staff can analyze the health-related data in
    real time. In fact, we can have some programs which can autonomously analyze the
    data that are coming in and can send alerts. So, one example of a wireless IoT-enabled
    ECG sensor [12] is QardioCore. QardioCore is a wireless device for ECG monitoring.
    4.2.2 Glucose Level Monitoring Device IIoT is very useful in glucose level monitoring
    [13], particularly for diabetes patients as they need to check the glucose level
    quite often. Particularly, the ones who have higher degrees of diabetes are required
    to check the blood sugar quite often. So, if we have an automated IoT-enabled
    system to which the patients can be fitted, then automatically the data from these
    different patients can be made available to doctors who are treating the diabetes
    patients and so on; an example of continuous glucose monitoring device is the
    Dexcom. Dexcom devices can help in continuous glucose monitoring. 4.2.3 IIoT-Based
    Blood Pressure Monitor Similarly, we have IIoT-based blood pressure monitors.
    Using IIoT devices the patient’s blood pressure is measured in real time. Doctors
    can monitor the patient’s blood pressure in real time; can get alerts if the blood
    pressure is beyond a particular threshold; and, depending on the blood pressure
    data, can prescribe medicines to the patients. One such example of blood pressure
    monitoring system is iHealth BP5. 4.2.4 IIoT-Based Body Temperature Sensor In
    body temperature monitors, wearable sensors are there to continuously monitor
    the human body temperature. This sometimes is very much required for some patients
    who are suffering from diseases which make the patients vulnerable to a sudden
    increase or sudden decrease in the body temperature. So, there are different body
    temperature sensors in the market. One such body temperature sensor is by Kinsa.
    So, they have their smart thermometer which is an IoT-based body temperature monitoring
    device. 4.2.5 IIoT-Based Asthma Treatment For oxygen saturation monitoring, particularly
    for asthma patients, this is very important; oxygen saturation can be monitored
    with the help of IoT devices such as pulse oximeter. So, pulse oximeter can help
    in measuring the oxygen saturation, so this pulse oximeter could be integrated
    with connectivity solutions such as Bluetooth, which can send continuously the
    data of the oxygen saturation level of the patient who is being monitored. 4.2.6
    IoT-Based Contact Lenses IoT-based contact lenses are also there in the market.
    There are different IoT-based contact lenses which also offer Wi-Fi connectivity
    with smartphones so that the condition of the patient, their eye condition, their
    sugar level, etc. could also be monitored. 4.2.7 Smart Inhalers IoT-based asthma
    treatment solutions are already in the market. Smart inhalers are a very essential
    requirement of asthma patients, and hence they are being manufactured. ADAMM is
    an intelligent asthma monitoring device that has been developed. This particular
    device can keep track of the body temperature, coughing rate, heart rate, etc.
    which are preliminary symptoms of an asthma attack. 4.2.8 Smart Phone-Based Healthcare
    Solution Different smartphone-based healthcare solutions are already available.
    Smartphone devices connected to electronic devices such as sensors can help in
    collecting the data of patients. Smartphone is used to monitor the health of users
    and detect diseases. Smartphone healthcare apps provide low-cost healthcare devices
    which are sort of diagnostic apps that help in detecting the health condition
    of patients; it can also help in medical communication between the patients and
    the hospitals and can also offer medical education in the form of tutorials to
    the patients. 4.2.9 Smart Phone App: Health Assistant Health assistant is one
    such app which keeps track of the health condition of the patients. Google Fit
    is another solution which keeps track of different physical activities of the
    patient. ECG self-monitoring is another solution which serves as ECG device, based
    on the “ECG Self Check” software. 4.2.10 IIoT Healthcare Technology Different
    solutions can be explored that are there in terms of healthcare and IoT implementations
    in healthcare. Cloud is enabled together with big data because most of this data
    generated from these healthcare sensors have the nature of big data. So, cloud
    enablement, big data analytics, etc. are very important in IoT implementation
    in healthcare. 4.3 IIoT Healthcare Requirement and Challenges Security is of paramount
    importance in the healthcare sector. Privacy of individuals is very important
    because the data that is being carried forward from one device to another through
    a particular communication channel should not be hacked and unauthorized users
    should not be able to get access to the data. So, ensuring the confidentiality
    of the data, integrity of the data, authentication mechanisms and their implementation,
    and availability of the data are very important in terms of security requirements
    and their implementations in IIoT healthcare. IIoT healthcare has different challenges.
    There are challenges with respect to limited computational capability, not being
    able to perform expensive operations. There are hassles with respect to having
    very less device memory, energy limitation, and also taking care of the mobility
    of these different devices because the patients themselves are mobile. So, consequently,
    these devices themselves are wearable devices, and the sensors themselves are
    also mobile. Taking care of the mobility of these different devices from a technical
    point of view is a challenge; both from a communication and algorithmic point
    of view there are different challenges. So, taking care of all of them is important
    for consideration. 5 IIoT in Manufacturing Industries 5.1 Smart Factory Motivation
    for smart factory: Now we discuss the drawbacks of traditional manufacturing industries.
    The machines work in isolation; that is, these machines are not connected. And
    because of this reason, there is unbalanced workload in these different machines.
    There are other drawbacks like unavailability of real-time data, longer changeover
    time (converting a line or machine from running one product to another), and extending
    production time (lack of proper information and data of the production line).
    These drawbacks are removed in the smart factory with the implementation of IIoT.
    Smart factory involves machinery and equipment which improve processes through
    self-optimization and automation. Benefits of smart factory are as follows: supply
    of real-time data, data analysis and quality control, reduced changeover time,
    reduced production time, and flexibility and easy management. The manufacturing
    devices, equipment, workforce, supply chain, and work platform are internetworked
    and linked to accomplish smart production. The integration has to be done in order
    to reduce operational costs, improve the productivity of the worker, and reduce
    injuries at the workplace. The reason for using IIoT is to improve safety in the
    manufacturing plant. With the help of IIoT, resource optimization and waste reduction
    can also be achieved, which are also again very important aspects in industrial
    engineering. Let us now look at how the smart factory is going to work. So, at
    the very bottom we have the sensor-enabled tools and workers. They throw in a
    lot of data which are going to pass through the gateway to the cloud where further
    data analysis, data visualization, etc. are going to be done and the results are
    going to be made available to the respective stakeholders based on their corresponding
    policies. 5.2 Features of Smart Factory In a smart factory [14] we talk about
    connected devices which are going to send a lot of data in real time continuously.
    Optimized components and optimized data without any human intervention or with
    minimal human intervention are characteristics of a smart factory. Smart factory
    is transparent in the sense that we get a lot of live data on the metrics that
    are implemented and those data can be used suitably at different levels of management
    for quicker decision, and hence, transparency is also promoted in a smart factory.
    Proactive feature means that we know proactively we can predict the future outcomes
    and take preventive actions depending on the situation and what is going to happen
    in the future. So, based on the prediction of future outcomes one can take preventive
    actions proactively. So, all of these things are possible in a smart factory.
    Now we discuss smart factory applications. 5.3 Smart Factory Applications 5.3.1
    Airbus: Factory of Future Airbus is a German company which is a state-of-the-art
    implementation of IIoT. So, Airbus is a major pair player in the aviation sector.
    It is a European aircraft manufacturer and it applies a lot of IoT technologies
    in its production process. So, essentially what happens is that during manufacturing
    productions on the floor of the plants and also after the products are deployed
    in a real aircraft, a lot of data can be collected. Further lot of data can be
    collected from the flight recorders while the flights are in operation. So, collecting
    data on flights will help to improve the in-flight experience and the workers
    on the factory floor can use these IoT devices to know about how much the manufacturing
    has processed, what are the different gaps, etc. in the process. So, Airbus is
    the digital manufacturing initiative which is also known as the factory of the
    future. So, in a factory of the future, we talk about different components, such
    as IoT sensors for supply-chain management. Now we discuss modular equipment;
    use of different robots, robotic arms, etc.; use of concepts of industrial augmented
    reality; use of computer vision; image processing and video processing in real
    time; and so on. Now we delve into the implementation of factory of the future;
    Airbus now has mechanisms for digital tracking and monitoring. There are tools
    and machines, and sensors are integrated into them. Further wearable sensors like
    smart glasses can be used with maybe augmented reality support. So, Airbus is
    using all of these different things for its implementation. 3D real-time visualization
    of the production process is possible and all of these things are deployed on
    A330 and A350 models and their assembly lines which are there in the Toulouse
    manufacturing plant; they have also deployed this factory of the future for the
    A400M model and their assembly operations in the UK. 5.3.2 Amazon: Robotic Shelves
    Amazon has robotic shelves, and as this name suggests, Amazon uses different types
    of robots that will carry these shelves and rearrange them. Amazon basically is
    an e-commerce company and these shelves and their rearrangement robotically are
    very important and that makes the processes much more autonomous and efficient.
    So, the good part of this thing is that because it is an autonomous robotic system,
    using this system, the robots can efficiently locate and search different items
    from different shelves. Thus, in 2014, the operating cost was cut down by 20%
    using these robotic shelves by Amazon. 5.3.3 Caterpillar: Augmented Reality App
    Caterpillar has the augmented reality (AR) app which is integrated with IoT; Caterpillar
    is a heavy equipment maker, and it has come up with the augmented reality app
    that generates end-to-end view of the factory floor. So, the machine operators
    can detect the need for tool replacement whenever it is required after viewing
    the end-to-end view through that particular AR app. This app sends instructions
    for doing things like tool replacement, air filter change, and fuel monitoring.
    Caterpillar has the IoT-driven ship maintenance that is done by their marine division.
    They use the shipboard sensors to perform predictive maintenance analytics. The
    sensors that are deployed can monitor generators, engines, GPS, air-conditioning
    systems, and fuel meters. The analysis of the sensed data provides useful insights
    with respect to the power usage of refrigerated containers, cost of hull cleaning,
    and optimized cleaning schedule and their data; these are all provided through
    the analysis of the data that are obtained through these different sensors that
    are deployed in the onboard devices of the ships. So, preventive maintenance analytics
    talks about the use of all these machine learning techniques. Tools and techniques
    like Python and Weka could be used to come up with these different predictive
    analytics and so on. It is used to have easier fault correction, reduced downtime,
    and increased profitability, using predictive maintenance analytics, and this
    is what Caterpillar is doing. 6 IoT and the Food Industry Before discussing implementation
    and application of IIoT in the food industry, we take a deep dive into the chain
    of activities to be followed in the food industry. 6.1 Field to Plate We first
    discuss what happens in the food industry. It starts with the agricultural field
    where the crops are grown. Farmers sow seeds, grow crops, apply fertilizers, apply
    pesticides, etc. and then after the crops get matured, these get harvested. Following
    harvesting, these food grains need to be processed and packaged. These packages
    are transported typically to a wholesale market. Then it goes to the retailer,
    and finally, the consumers buy, cook, and consume the agricultural produce. This
    is typically the chain from the agricultural field to the plate. So, this is typically
    the chain of activities that are followed; this is the supply chain because ultimately
    for each of the activities, the supply will have to be ensured through this entire
    cycle. So, in this kind of scenario, for each activity, sensors can be used; IIoT
    devices can be used in the agricultural field for monitoring the growth of crops
    and the sowing of seeds and for applying fertilizers precisely adequately. So,
    sensors, actuators, and different agricultural robots can be used over here. So,
    not only over here, even in harvesting, food grain processing, packaging, transportation,
    and logistics these could be used. The sensors and actuators help the systems
    or the machines that are helping in the activities to be much more efficient and
    autonomous. Now we discuss how IIoT is implemented in the food industry [12].
    6.2 Implementation of IIoT in the Food Industry IIoT is implemented in the food
    industry using three layers: sensing layer, communication layer, and application
    layer. These layers need to be internetworked. In the sensing layer, we have network
    sensors for food quality monitoring along the supply chain. The food grains go
    through the warehouses and the network sensors also monitor the temperature in
    those warehouses and also other environmental conditions. The communication layer
    deals with stakeholder access supply-chain data, communication between different
    stakeholders, and communication between different components of the supply chain.
    The application layer has applications for farmers, retailers, government, analysts,
    consumers, and insurance companies. We need sensors for doing many tasks like
    sensors for monitoring humidity, temperature, and composition of food products.
    The sensors throw a lot of data in real time which have to be analyzed in in order
    to make the most out of those data that have been retrieved. So, we need easier
    process control, increased food safety, etc. and it is also very important to
    have adequate end-to-end traceability. So, if we have the field to plate and the
    corresponding supply chain adequately implemented using suitable IoT solutions,
    then it would be possible for example to trace a rice packet back to the paddy
    field. 6.3 Impact of IoT on the Food Industry We now discuss the impact of IIoT
    in the food industry. We have an efficient production line as IoT monitors the
    equipment performance and detects the anomaly in the production line. This efficient
    production line enables the generation of real-time solutions by predictive maintenance.
    Using the temperature tracking sensors we can implement adequate, suitable, and
    efficient food safety measures. Also, we have Automatic Hazard Analysis and Critical
    Control Points (AHACCP) checklist, which ensures food safety. IIoT ensures transparency
    of the supply chain as the real-time data about the products are available, and
    it is easier to find the inefficiencies and meet the food safety regulations.
    We have minimized wastage of food resources, and we can analyze in real time,
    for example, the information of food products and reduce food wastage. So, all
    of these things are possible if we have IIoT implementation in the food industry.
    6.3.1 Utilizing the IoT in the Farms On the farm we can have sensors to monitor
    weather, crop maturity, presence of insects, and conditions of the field with
    respect to the soil conditions, for example, how much soil moisture is there in
    the field, how much is the water level, how much is the fertilizer content of
    the field, and soil nutrient condition of the field. So, all of these things are
    possible with the help of IoT implementation in the food industry. 6.3.2 Utilizing
    the IoT in the Livestock Barns In the livestock barns, sensors can help in monitoring
    the health parameters of different animals such as cows, buffaloes, and different
    other livestock, including sheep and goats. So, all of the life monitoring in
    real time is done using IoT-enabled devices. Automated feeding cycles can be set
    up with the help of IoT implementation, and diet control of these different livestock
    is possible with the help of IoT implementation. Automated temperature control
    in the brooding barns and hatchery is also possible with the help of suitable
    IoT implementation. 6.3.3 Utilizing the IoT for Equipment in the Food Industry
    On the equipment level, IoT enables GPS tracking whenever these animals are moving
    around their exact location, and their position could be tracked. This is just
    an example; similarly, GPS could be used for tracking the mobility of different
    components in the food industry. Drone-assisted field monitoring applications
    in agriculture are quite common and are being implemented using IoT. 6.3.4 IoT
    for Maintenance in the Food Industry In the food industry, IoT implementation
    can be done for maintenance. Sensors are embedded in different machines, such
    as farm machinery and tractors, to monitor their condition and performance and
    to detect whether any machine is going to go down in the future. The early detection
    of warning signs, smart maintenance of these machines, and extending the lifetime
    of these equipment are possible with respect to maintenance in the food industry
    through IoT implementation. 6.3.5 IoT to Improve Margins in the Food Industry
    IoT implementation in the food industry can improve the margins through predictive
    analytics, spotting early warning signs, making well-informed decisions, and maximizing
    profits. 6.3.6 IoT for the Consumer For the consumer, there are different initiatives;
    smart label is an initiative by the Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), which
    uses a QR code to provide product-related information to consumers. These consumers
    consequently can get information about the ingredient details of a particular
    food item, allergen exposure of that particular food item, nutrition, value, and
    other information. 6.3.7 IoT for the Product in the Food Industry Consumers can
    scan the QR code to get details about the product; the product information includes
    nutrition, ingredients, allergens, third-party certification, social compliance
    programs, usage instructions, advisories, and also safe handling instructions.
    6.3.8 IoT for the Food Processing Factory In the factory, IoT implementation can
    help different machineries in the food processing industry and also aid different
    workers who are working in the food processing industry to remain connected autonomously.
    This connectivity can help in gaining insights to improve the quality of the food
    product, the quality of the food processes, and so on, and consequently, they
    can also help in the reduction of the time to market (TTM). 6.3.9 IoT for Empowering
    the Workers in the Food Industry IoT implementation in the food industry can also
    help in empowering the workers through augmented reality, safety glasses, and
    other wearable sensors, thereby increasing the overall productivity and efficiency
    of their processes, workers, and the machinery they are using. 6.4 IoT Solutions
    for the Food Industry We now discuss different IoT solutions [15] for the food
    industry. 6.4.1 City Crop City crop is an intelligent indoor garden that provides
    intelligent indoor gardens to grow fruits, herbs, vegetables, greens, and edible
    flowers; they have implementation of automated climate control, automated livestock
    monitoring, and automated smart notifications that can be sent to the concerned
    stakeholders and also to the plant doctors. 6.4.2 Diagenetix Diagenetix has the
    product bioranger which can help in detecting the presence of microbial diseases
    in the food. Bioranger is a small handheld device that connects with Android and
    instantly detects pathogens in the food. 6.4.3 Eskesso Eskesso is a company that
    has the cooking sorcery which is basically for smart cooking. So, they have Wi-Fi-connected
    smart cooking device that can help in easy monitoring of the cooking status via
    the smartphone app. Smart cooking helps by placing the food packet and Eskesso
    device in a pot of water; selecting the recipe and starting via smartphone app
    one can get the food cooked in a smarter way through minimal involvement. 6.4.4
    Culinary Science Industries: Flavor Matrix Culinary science industry Flavor Matrix
    infuses foods and beverages with unique flavors; they collect data on the food
    ingredients, collect user data, and use different implementations of machine learning
    and data analysis to enhance the flavor of dishes and provide user-specific food
    and beverage pairing. 6.4.5 IntelliCup IntelliCup is the smart cup solution which
    is a smart beverage vending machine which reduces the waiting time and increases
    the profit at beverage shops. These are like IoT-enabled cups which have NFC-integrated
    chips at the base of the cup, and they connect the cups to the mobile banking
    platform and IntelliHead which is a modular dispensing unit. This NFC chip helps
    in connecting each user to a cup. So, the cups are usable and made with biodegradable
    material. There are separate apps for the merchants and the customers, the customers
    create IntelliCup accounts using the app, they transfer the funds to the e-wallet,
    and the cups are linked to the e-wallet by scanning a QR code via the app and
    docking the cup on the dispensing unit using the IntelliHead. So, customers enjoy
    the beverage that is finally produced through this smart cup. 7 Conclusion In
    this chapter, we focused on IIoT and its applications in the food industry, manufacturing
    industries, and healthcare. Most of the industries are transforming globally.
    They have been mandated to transform to be Industry 4.0 compliant. And they are
    transforming towards the adoption of IIoT technologies. So, we discussed the different
    aspects of both Industry 4.0 and IIoT. We also focused on the requirements of
    IIoT and design consideration for IIoT. It makes the industrial processes much
    more efficient and autonomous. In all of the different applications of IIoT, the
    core technological ideas remain the same and cannot be changed. So, the only thing
    that changes is the type of sensors that would be used. The specific requirements
    that a particular industry has are mostly dealt with in the application level,
    and at the device level more or less the concepts remain similar. References Miorandi,

    challengesIoT smart farming 1. Introduction The increasing demand for food, both
    in order to ensure quality and quantities, has accelerated the need of industrial
    growth and intensive methods of production in agriculture. At the forefront of
    the new agricultural era, there is an emerging Internet of Things (IoT) market
    that is suggesting several creative solutions. Research organizations and scientific
    associations are seeking to increase their own scope and speed by connecting with
    IoT, contributing technologies and goods to a range of different agriculture markets.
    The IoT idea gained prominence in the year 2000, with the development of the Auto-ID
    at MIT and the subsequent market research reports. In IoT, these systems communicate,
    perceive, and connect with internal & external state embedded technologies [1].
    IoT is widely seen as the next-generation technologies with widespread applicability
    across almost every facet of the market, with the ability to increase the degree
    of integration of end products, systems, and services. IoT technologies are ideal
    for a number of applications, including healthcare services, smart communities,
    traffic management, agricultural systems, and security facilities. ICT(Information
    and Communication Technologies) being integrated into conventional agricultural
    activities is helping to spark a fourth farming revolution. An important facet
    of technologies such as machine learning, UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), Remote
    Sensing, Big Data Analytics, etc. is having the capability to boost farming activities
    to new heights. A broad variety of agricultural parameters, such as environmental
    factors, production status, soil condition, irrigation water, herbicides and pesticides,
    weed control, and greenhouse output climate, may be tracked in smart agriculture
    to increase crop yields, minimize costs, and maintain process inputs. Smart agriculture
    and the use of reduced pesticides and fertilizers in crops will help to mitigate
    leaching issues and pollution, as well as the effects of climate change, in precision
    agriculture [2]. Burgeoning IoT technology offers many new solutions and further
    growth opportunities, particularly for novel ideas in the agricultural sector.
    We also benefited greatly from recent developments in communication systems and
    protocols [3], primarily on the lower layers, which is the physical, network,
    and link layer. Besides that, the protocols in the topmost layers of the network
    are critical for effective data exchange and gathering. There are many applications,
    procedures, and designs that can be used in the agricultural sector as a whole.
    There are several ongoing developments in IoT agriculture research that involve
    network engineering and applications, device design, security challenges. Furthermore,
    in several nations and institutions around the world, various IoT guidelines and
    policies have been adopted in agriculture. However, an impressive amount of research
    has been done on IoT and there is still a great need for further research on the
    topic in the agricultural field. This survey paper examines numerous challenges
    and trends related to smart agriculture. 2. IoT-based smart agriculture The IoT
    is reshaping the agriculture sector by providing farmers with a diverse set of
    tools to address several challenges faced by them on the field. Farmers can connect
    to their farm from almost anywhere and at any time using IoT-enabled technologies.
    Sensors and actuators are used to regulate farming processes, while wireless sensor
    networks are being used to monitor the farm. Wireless cameras and sensors were
    used to remotely monitor the farm and collect data in the form of videos and pictures.
    Farmers can also use IoT to keep up with the current conditions of their agricultural
    land using a smart phone from anywhere in the world. IoT-enabled technologies
    have the potential to deplete the crop production cost and increase productivity
    of the land. Some of the key role played by IoT in smart agriculture is illustrated
    via Fig. 1. i. Water management: A major challenge in greenhouses is determining
    the exact amount of water required [4]. To prevent unnecessary water use, smart
    sensors are installed and operated using a variety of IoT techniques. Water storage
    in greenhouses is achieved by the use of automated drip irrigation, which is regulated
    by a soil moisture threshold. Water management may be handled effectively via
    IoT technology by avoiding water waste through the use of various kinds of sensors.
    The sensors are used to monitor the amount of water in the tank, and data is saved
    on the cloud through a mobile application. Farmers may monitor the water level
    using their cell phones. The motor will operate automatically as a result of this
    technology. If the water level drops, the motor automatically turns on, and if
    the water level is high, the motor will shut down. Up to 50% of this water is
    lost in conventional irrigation systems owing to over-watering due to inadequacies
    in traditional irrigation techniques and systems [3]. To address this issue, smart
    irrigation systems powered by IoT assist farmers in avoiding water waste and improving
    crop quality via timely watering. Temperature and soil sensors are installed on
    fields in smart irrigation systems; these sensors communicate field information
    to farmers via a knowledge gateway. Weather-based precision agriculture controllers
    monitor and modify irrigation schedules depending on local weather information.
    ii. Irrigation management: It is in charge of anticipating the design, improvement,
    operation and management of irrigation systems. Tracking water requirements of
    crops based on gathered data and actuating the water flow in accordance with the
    anticipated needs without the participation of human operators is one of the objective
    of irrigation systems. It uses dispersed sensors to monitor different soil, water
    body, plant, and micro-climate factors. The irrigation technique (e.g., spray,
    drip, flooding and nebulizer) has an influence on how to properly monitor the
    water body as well as the actuation mechanism. Weather is one of the most significant
    variables in calculating agricultural water needs. The IoT will help to upgrade
    the new irrigation infrastructure in a more fascinating way. By tracking weather
    and soil conditions, a farmer can refine his irrigation system in a variety of
    ways [5]. Weather prediction data, manage and track the whole farm from almost
    anywhere, Ethernet, and WIFI are all exemplars of how IoT technology tracks irrigation
    systems. Smart irrigation systems driven by the IoT make use of field-deployed
    sensors to monitor soil properties, weather and climatic conditions, and agricultural
    terms for irrigation. iii. Soil management: Soil management entails determining
    various soil parameters such as pH, moisture content, and so on. These parameters
    can be conveniently calculated using IoT sensors. Farmers will then take measures
    such as fertilization, drainage, irrigation, and so on. Soil management assists
    in the discovery of the right plant breed. It also assists in the identification
    of fertilizer needs in the soil. It necessitates a low-latency network for urgent
    intervention. For both enterprises and farmers, soil monitoring has been among
    the most challenging activities in agriculture. There are several environmental
    concerns in soil testing that have an impacts on crop productivity. If these types
    of problems are correctly defined, farming patterns and procedures can be readily
    understood. Soil Humidity, Precipitation, Fertilization, and Temperature are among
    the factors being monitored. The moisture content of soil is monitored using moisture
    and humidity sensors. The findings of a soil testing research survey improve crop
    production and propose fertilization options to farmers [6]. Furthermore, using
    IoT technology to identify polluted soil protects the field from over-fertilization
    and crop degradation. Soil management protects and improves the productivity of
    the soil. Additionally, it lowers input costs, avoids pollution, and increases
    agricultural yields and quality. Prior to planting, the topsoil should be in the
    optimal fitness level for the crop in order to promote fast and effective root
    development. While each farm and crop has unique soil needs, there are a few measures
    that may help promote good soil biology such as: organic fertilization, soil analysis,
    proper tillage, measure for chemical soil protection, etc. iv. Weather management:
    Many relevant factors are combined to preserve and establish an optimal ambience
    for plants while staying under strict limits, such as airflow, temperature, ,
    and levels. This can be achieved by deploying an IoT-enabled ecosystem, in which
    smart sensors and devices exchange data for improved decision-making [7]. Weather
    have the greatest impact on crop production. Farmers can decide the best time
    for planting, irrigation, and harvesting using an IoT-enabled weather forecasting
    system. Probabilistic weather analyses were done using sensors in IoT applications.
    Farmers can learn about environmental conditions such as soil moisture, humidity,
    and air temperature by embedding remote sensors in the fields. Farmers should
    prepare accordingly and adjust the harvesting and irrigation period to boost the
    crop based on historical results. Farmers should take proactive measures to ensure
    a safe crop harvest by arranging and reviewing collected data. v. Precision farming:
    It is an IoT-based farming technique which primarily entails the analysis of data
    collected in the field in order to determine the most productive crop. Farmers
    gather data using sensors and analyze it for forecasting in precision farming.
    Farmers may use the information collected to schedule their farming operations,
    including what seeds to sow, how much fertilizer to use, when to harvest, and
    also what crop yields to expect. Farmers may also track the farm through sensors
    that detect moisture levels, crop output, and livestock levels with the deployment
    of IoT. The sensors can effectively monitor irrigation machinery from afar. The
    data collected on the land is analyzed by IoT linked devices, making data-driven
    decisions on resource allocation and crop harvesting. The conventional method
    of farming to maximize yield and preserve crops was focused on physical inspection,
    and if there was a problem, it was typically resolved after a severe event involving
    the farm, and it was performed on a trial and error basis. However, in precision
    farming using IoT applications, anything can be pinpoint sooner and behave in
    compliance with the collected data. IoT innovations are assisting farmers in increasing
    agricultural output quantity while maintaining efficiency, productivity, and cost
    effectiveness. Farmers will face a variety of problems, including water shortages
    and floods, a lack of suitable land for crop plantations, and cost control. Farmers
    can reduce possible missteps and increase returns by implementing the IoT infrastructure
    and associated technology. IoT-enabled farming allows farmers to make fast decisions
    depending on the circumstances. The use of IoT in farming would greatly improve
    operational productivity. For example: A precision agricultural practice is one
    that involves assessing a field’s inherent soil variability. When the soil in
    a particular region retains more water, crops may be sown more thickly and irrigation
    can be used sparingly. Alternatively, if the plot is utilized for grazing, it
    may accommodate a greater number of cattle than a comparable area with lower soil
    quality. vi. Nutrient management: Nutrient management entails making the most
    effective use of crop nutrients while also preserving the environment. Nutrient
    management is based on the concept of matching soil nutrient supplies with crop
    needs. Nutrients help in producing optimal crop yields when supplied in the appropriate
    amounts and at the right times; providing too little will restrict output, while
    applying too much will not make practical sense and may damage the environment.
    Nutrients that are not properly used by crops may leak into surface and groundwater
    waters nearby. For example, too much ammonia, phosphorus, or nitrogen may degrade
    water quality. Measuring the concentration of nutrients in the soil allows for
    selection of the best crop for multiple cropping cycles on the same land. Nutrients
    and technologies are critical for achieving sustainable agriculture while minimizing
    environmental and economic costs [8]. vii. Waste management: The Internet of Things
    (IoT) proposes a waste disposal solution. IoT sensors may be used to create intelligent
    trash cans. This could be used to read, store, and transfer waste-related data
    through a network. Governance of waste can be accomplished with the aid of certain
    intelligent and streamlined algorithms [9]. viii. Livestock monitoring: The growth
    of agricultural production to provide adequate food for the world’s population
    is becoming a growing worldwide issue. As a result, the significance of livestock
    management in farmland is essential for the survival. Farmers, on the other hand,
    are trying to maintain their cattle in the context of rising worry over land and
    water supplies. Apart from that, farmers continue to focus on reducing waste and
    lowering total expenses. New technological advances are critical in helping to
    enhance the quality and quantity of agricultural output. The Internet of Things
    (IoT) enters the scene at this point. It allows farmers to improve the health
    of their livestock via remote access and data-driven decisions. Cattle Watch is
    a system for monitoring livestock. This cloud-based technology is often used to
    remotely track the well-being of livestock and aids in the identification of livestock
    locations using communication and energy sensors [10]. This method obviates the
    use of an alert system. If any state goes outside of a predetermined parameter,
    the users are told by call, text, or email. As a result, people can view real-time
    information from the comfort of their own homes or workplaces using their smartphones.
    The IoT livestock tracking scheme entails implanting sensors in animals that collect
    specific details about their body and their well-being. Farmers may monitor the
    position, counting, and other similar details of livestock using wireless IoT
    applications. The real-time data provided by the livestock tracking system allows
    sick animals to be identified and removed from the herd, preventing disease spread.
    For example: Farmers can monitor their livestock’s cardiac output, blood pressure,
    respiration rate, digestion, and perhaps other vital signs around the clock using
    connected sensors. ix. Farm Management System (FMS): Farm management systems centralizes,
    administers, and optimizes a farm’s output and operations. IoT based farm management
    system automates the collection and storage of farm data, manages business expenditure,
    agricultural budgets, monitors and analyses farm operations and consumption. Smart
    farming raises production while lowering environmental effects, but this smart
    farming approach is only feasible with the help of FMS. For smart farming, FMS
    is an important component for production, planning, and decision-making [11].
    Farmers can track the entire farm with an interconnected FMS that uses Wireless
    Sensor Networks (WSN), Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) modules [12],
    and a micro-controller to capture all of the data. On all sensors and devices
    throughout the field, an identifier is used to provide proper awareness of fertilization,
    weather details, automated buffer zone width tracking, and automatic information
    record generation based on daily farm activities. This data is saved in a regular
    format on the server and can be accessed for even further processing through a
    mobile phone or the internet. An automatic irrigation and control system [13]
    is used to maximize the usage of water supplies. In addition to the irrigation
    scheme, the farm is secured from pests and animals [14]. x. Tracking and tracing:
    IoT provides agricultural firms with helpful data to help them make better choices,
    such as organizing, handling, and communicating with business associates intelligently
    while saving resources and time. RFID and GPS are used to map the conditions of
    soil, air, water, herbicides and pesticides in a growing environment. Using wireless
    network connectivity, a GPS device is used to pinpoint the precise location of
    an agricultural areas and track different agricultural parameters. In [15], an
    architecture was developed to remotely track soil condition and soil structure
    in accordance with crop culture requirements. Through using WSN, ZigBee is linked
    to other devices such as CMS, GSM, and GPRS to track and acknowledge real-time
    data processing. When unexpected changes arise, GPS provides an interface to communicate
    with ARM (an intelligent control device to accomplish tasks such as SMS/MMS) and
    sends an alert to the farm manager, enabling the farmers to take appropriate action.
    Despite its high operating and maintenance costs, it is commonly used in agriculture
    because of its accurate positioning identification and control capabilities. xi.
    Crop management: Crop management involves assessing and recording the well being
    of a crop. Plant and crop diseases can be detected using IoT sensors and RFID
    chips. These details can be gleaned from RFID tags and shared across the internet
    by the reader. This data are processed remotely by the farmer, and necessary steps
    are taken. This will keep pests away from the crops. In agricultural sector, production
    tracking and prediction have played an important role in delivering benefits to
    users in order to produce valuable output while minimizing losses. [16] suggested
    using SVM to forecast rice production with the aid of a Chinese monitoring station
    for specific knowledge of geography. [17] has demonstrated an efficient automatic
    counting strategy for coffee fruit, which helps farmers schedule their agricultural
    processes and efficiently prevent risk. Neural Networks has been used to forecast
    crop production and analyze pest management in the context of environmental conditions.
    Analogously, the research scientist used an Artificial Neural Network to predict
    the current agricultural yield [18]. Due to the extreme changeover in spatio temporal
    and also its crop yielding task, the K-means approach has been proposed for evaluating
    the extreme computational measure. Crop production is fully estimated under various
    edaphoclimatic types of environmental conditions. The effect of numerous agricultural
    parameters within the spectrum of obtained loss by applying decision tree algorithm
    on grain loss analysis and prediction has been explored [19]. Furthermore, CNN
    [20] was used to recognize and categorize the generated drop based on an illustration
    of a vein leaf containing red, white, and soya bean. xii. Blockchain with IoT
    for agriculture: The blockchain is a decentralized ledger of transactions that
    all parties contribute and maintain. It offers a trustworthy source of information
    about the condition of farms, inventory, and agreements in agriculture, where
    such data gathering is often extremely expensive. Blockchain technology enables
    the tracking of food’s origin, thus facilitating the establishment of trustworthy
    food supply chains and the development of trust amongst suppliers and consumers.
    As a secure data storage medium, it enables the employment of data-driven technology
    to improve agriculture’s intelligence. Additionally, when used in conjunction
    with smart contracts, it enables payments on time to stakeholders that may be
    prompted by blockchain data alterations [21]. Table 1 highlights few recent findings
    and shortcomings of different IoT based frameworks for performing smart agriculture.

    agriculture This section of the paper gives an overview of different IoT sensors
    and sensor networks being used for making the agriculture sector smart. A sensor
    is indeed a device that monitors several parameters, such as pressure, light,
    moisture level, and so on. Most of the time, the sensor output is an electrical
    signal, which is sent to a micro-controller for the further analysis on a network.
    The development of simple to advanced sensors represents a transformation in the
    way we gather information, conduct analysis, and connect diverse structures in
    order to attain new ideas we may never before have conceived of. Fig. 2 illustrates
    the components and basic structure of a sensor node used for performing smart
    agriculture. An intelligent sensor node comprise of three components namely: Sense,
    Compute, and Communicate. The sensing component is responsible for capturing the
    real-world parameters such as moisture, temperature, etc. The computational component
    pre-processes the captured parameter value and the communication component makes
    sure that the gateway sensor nodes are able to communicate with gateway nodes
    and can share the information among them. A variety of sensors are available for
    measuring and calculating the specifications of a farming field. The underlying
    concepts of different sensors, as well as their corresponding requirements, are
    summarized below: Download : Download high-res image (109KB) Download : Download
    full-size image Fig. 2. Components of sensor node. • PH sensors are being used
    to track the precise quantity of nutrition in soil, which is important for the
    stable germination of seeds and crops. The absorption of chemicals or biomolecules,
    as well as the speed or rate of chemical processes, are both affected by pH [29].
    Soil pH is very important because it affects biological & chemical processes.
    For instance, when pH is low, nutrition, growth, and productivity of most crops
    suffer, and when pH is high/optimal, productivity enhances. Many crops thrive
    in soils with a pH of 6 to 7.5, whereas others favor acidic or alkaline soils.
    For example: In soil management, soil pH acts as an important indicator for crop
    production, therefore its geographical variation must be handled to enhance precision
    management choices. • PIR sensor: A motion detector is integrated into the PIR
    (Passive Infrared) sensor, which tracks the direction of an individual’s movements
    in the field. Additionally, the sensor has a light detector feature: when monitoring
    an object, it converts rise in temperature to voltage for the purpose of examining
    crop production [30]. Everyone produces some IR radiation, with some emitting
    modest levels and others emitting high levels depending on just how hot they are.
    Two slots of IR sensitive material are included in a PIR sensor. Both slots detect
    the same amounts of IR if there is no motion in front of them. When anything hot
    pass in front of the slots, such as an animal, the very first slot detects a variation
    in IR level and produces a positive differential between the two slots. As the
    animal moves from the second slot to the first, the impact is reversed, resulting
    in a negative difference between the two positions. The PIR detects these fluctuating
    amounts of IR. • UV sensor monitors the intensity of ultraviolet radiation for
    optimal crop production [31]. For instance, while using Iot components for weather
    management, it is evident to notice that plants respond to a variety of environmental
    factors, including soil nutrients, airborne chemicals, watering frequency, and
    the amount and type of light they receive. UV radiation has also been shown to
    affect the flavor, fragrance, and appearances of food cultivars, as well as increase
    the terpene concentration of cannabis crops. • Weed seeker is a self-confined
    unit that is usually fitted with opto-electronic components for the purpose of
    weed identification and spraying. The unit is composed of an activated source
    of light and a specific spray sensor that detects chlorophyll. By the use of an
    optical system, the device is capable of detecting and spraying mainly weeds throughout
    the field. The service’s systemic application will greatly minimize herbicide
    use. As a consequence, only a small amount of chemical is needed, lowering the
    implementation cost [22]. While performing crop management, weed control using
    IoT in agriculture is a time-consuming and costly process. Precision weed management
    (PWM) is defined as the administration of the appropriate quantity of inputs to
    the correct target (weeds) at the appropriate time. PWM is centered on using information
    technology to make site-specific weed management decisions. The spectroscopic
    reflectance of the leaves may be used to distinguish between various plant species
    [32]. • Wind speed indicates the speed of the wind at the surface. It is often
    important to observe occurrences in a field, such as changes in wind direction.
    These sensors must be installed at an appropriate height based on the location
    of the crop [33]. The input on wind direction is utilized for weather forecasting,
    crop harvesting, insecticide spraying, and other agricultural operations. Wind
    speed is monitored using a cup-type sensor, with the speed related to the number
    of revolutions. A potentiometer is used to detect the direction of the wind. •
    Water content/Soil moisture sensors for measuring water content are used in a
    broad variety of research fields. The proportion of the quantity of water available
    in the test soil to the overall amount of the test soil denotes the soil water
    content. It is quantified by the variation in capacitance value, that is dependent
    on the soil’s dielectric constant [34]. It can vary from completely dry to the
    saturation porosity of the material. Since the measurements vary according to
    the soil condition, the sensor should be tuned at each location. This sensor tests
    soil water suction, which seems to be a substitute for the effort exerted by the
    plant root in absorbing moisture from the ground. It may be used to determine
    the amount of water contained in the soil or the amount of irrigation necessary
    to achieve a desired level of soil water. The sensor determines the amount of
    water and the degree of moisture present in the field. [35] describes the usage
    of a wireless moisture sensor to track the greenhouse irrigation method. Dielectric
    Soil Moisture Sensors [36] measure an electrical characteristic that varies based
    on the quantity of moisture present in the soil to determine moisture levels.
    • Temperature sensor monitors the temperature changes in the soil that have an
    impact on the absorption of nutrients and moisture. A novel sensing technique
    was developed to precisely map the volume of nutrients in the soil and on the
    surface of the water. A 3-dimensional crop sensing element equipped with photosynthetically
    active radiation technology can be deployed in any field area to measure temperature
    [37]. Ambient condition & asset monitoring are two significant aspects of smart
    agriculture that need temperature sensors. Ice wine cultivation, for example,
    is known to take place within a limited temperature window between −10 °C to −12
    °C throughout a harvesting period. The ice wine business requires very precise
    temperature and humidity for efficient output. Temperature sensors are crucial
    in almost all smart agricultural asset monitoring applications. • Gas sensor determines
    the precise concentration of poisonous gases in farmland, livestock and hydroponics
    by monitoring infrared radiations [38] There are a variety of strategies for reducing
    agriculture’s carbon output, but all of them require the ability to calculate
    and consider existing pollution levels, as well as track improvements. This is
    typically accomplished by the usage of gas sensors equipped with various analytical
    capabilities which could be used to monitor and log the quantities of , , or hydrocarbon
    gases. For example: monitoring is essential for the long preservation of grains
    and cereals. Variations in temperature and relative humidity levels in grain storage
    may be detected using gas sensors, which is significant for freshness and edibility.
    • Humidity sensor captures humidity that has a detrimental effect on plant leaf
    growth, and photosynthesis. As a result, this sensor involves measuring the moisture
    and temperature content of the air to indicate the degree of humidity [39]. Grofit
    offers a variety of climate control instruments that measure air temperature,
    relative humidity, and solar radiation. The device’s data transfer range is up
    to 200 m, and it records measurements for a period of 30 days. • Motion detector
    sensor is often used to locate the position of animals and fields; however, it
    detects the motion of an unexpected entity in the farm and sends warnings to the
    farmer, allowing for prompt intervention and crop loss prevention [40]. • GPS
    (Global positioning system) provides the precise positioning of farm, or livestock
    with respect to latitude, longitude and altitude. With respect to farm management
    systems, drones may be used, that can operate in tandem with sensor and GPS. It
    may be commanded remotely or fly autonomously using software-controlled scheduled
    flights in their embedded devices. Crop condition, irrigation, fertilization,
    sowing, plant enumeration, yield prediction, etc. may all be learned from drone
    data. Drones may be purchased and kept near farmland where they will be charged
    and serviced, or they can be scheduled for agricultural surveys (drone as a service).
    Following the surveys, the drones must be transported to neighboring laboratories
    where the gathered data can be analyzed. • Photodiode helps in identifying the
    soil properties such as organic matter and moisture content using light. It can
    be used by ray attenuation for measuring the soil-water content [41]. • Tensiometer
    detects the force used by roots for water absorption. It measures soil compaction
    using probes. Irrigation scheduling uses tensiometers to assist farm owners and
    other irrigation operators in determining when to irrigate. Tensiometers may be
    used in combination with a water retention curve to calculate how much they should
    water. The subtype of IoT sensors being used in agriculture domain is illustrated

    image Fig. 3. Subtypes of IoT sensors. 4. Data analytics in smart agriculture
    Precise data analysis is important in agriculture towards growing operational
    reliability and productivity. Based on IoT applications requirement, data analytics
    can be categorized into following types: i. Memory-level [42] ii. Massive analytics
    [43] iii. Business Intelligent data analytics [44] iv. Offline analytics [45]
    v. Real-time analytics [43] Memory-level data analytics deals with analyzing the
    data stored in some storage memory statically. Memory analytics contributes to
    the overall performance of a business intelligence system and offers BI users
    with quicker responses than conventional disk-based BI, particularly for requests
    that take a very long time to execute in a massive database. Massive analytics
    is also referred as big-data analytics. It is the delicate procedure of analyzing
    large amounts of data in order to extract information – such as correlations,
    market trends, and consumer preferences – that may assist companies in making
    sound business choices. While both business intelligence and data analytics include
    the use of data to uncover insights that help the company, there is one significant
    distinction to make. Simply stated, business intelligence is concerned with present,
    whereas data analytics is concerned with the future. Real-time analytics is a
    strategy that involves reasoning and statistics on data in order to provide insights
    that may be used to make faster, and more rational decisions. For certain scenarios,
    real-time analytics simply implies that the analyses are performed immediately
    on the arrival of fresh data. Image analysis has been widely used in agriculture
    for a variety of applications, including disease identification in leaves, stems,
    & fruits, fruit quality assessment, weed identification and irrigation. Lately,
    image processing and IoT have been used in agriculture to boost the efficiency
    of crop production. This entails the need for drones to acquire aerial photographs
    on a regular basis, as well as environmental surveillance using IoT devices. Numerous
    data analytics techniques have been explored in depth in [46]. Fig. 4 illustrates
    the involvement of data analytics in performing smart agriculture. This survey
    paper would not address these techniques in detail. We address the significance
    of data analytics in agriculture and how it can be used to assist in protection,
    estimation, storage management, precise application, and decision-making. Estimation:
    The IoT generates massive amounts of data that can be analyzed over time to determine
    current environmental conditions. Data analytics may be used to analyze data obtained
    from various forms of network sensors, and use intelligent algorithm to forecast
    environmental trends and have data-driven solutions. Even though IoT data could
    also be used to monitor different facets of a field, including irrigation systems,
    it also can be used to forecast and alert farmers about disease and adverse weather
    events, such as flooding or drought [47]. For example, in forestry, sensors may
    be used to detect fire outbreaks and forecast the area within a forest that is
    at risk of igniting. This knowledge will assist firefighters in implementing preventative
    steps at the precise spot. Another field of forecasting is early alert systems
    for natural hazards in order to enhance emergency response. Download : Download

    in smart agriculture. Protection: Landowners are often subjected to harsh climatic
    conditions, which may result in a substandard yield. Fortunately, farmers can
    insure their crops and livestock with the usage of IoT technologies. A sensor
    network can be configured, and remotely unmanned stations can perform surveillance.
    The data may then be analyzed in the cloud. The insurance scheme will have a notification
    device, in which adverse weather events are forecast and insured farmers are notified
    by text message. This encourages farmers to take preventative steps to safeguard
    their activities. An additional value of data analytics in insurance is that insurance
    providers have access to information from distant farms and may trigger an automatic
    payout through IoT digital payment services in the context of adverse weather
    conditions. This will obviate the need for a prolonged claim procedure in which
    the insurance provider visits the farms to determine the degree of the harm. Storage
    management: Agricultural commodities are often destroyed as a result of insufficient
    warehouse control. Although climate, humidity, and some other external conditions
    significantly influence food product, bugs, microorganisms, etc may affect the
    production of food products [48]. The incorporation of IoT and data analytics
    into storage monitoring systems has the potential to significantly increase agricultural
    commodity storage. Sensors may be used to keep an eye on storage warehouses and
    the surrounding environment. The data is stored and processed in the cloud. To
    change the environmental circumstances, a self-automated decision framework based
    on analyzed data can be used. Additionally, when severe circumstances are encountered
    or a pest is found in the warehouse, an alarm signal may be sent to farmers. In
    India, approximately 35% to 40% of fresh produce is lost following harvest due
    to a variety of reasons, like rancidity or pest. Although the IoT has the ability
    to enhance agricultural storage facilities, protection should be incorporated
    into those networks to deter commodity theft during rolling blackouts. Precise
    application: By using sensor data, it is possible to apply pesticides and fertilizers
    precisely to particular areas of the field, increasing production thus decreasing
    farming costs. Although developed countries have already implemented precision
    agricultural practices on farms, developing countries are starting to adopt the
    tech, particularly on research farmlands [49]. Consequently, the implementation
    expense, technology, and knowledge of IoT-based smart agriculture programs in
    different countries continue to confine their adoption. Additionally, since the
    majority of farms in developed countries are small-scale, most farm workers do
    not see the value in implementing such technologies. Developing suitable precision
    farming systems for smallholder farmers remains a testing and design challenge
    for researchers and designers. Another benefit of data analytics in smart agriculture
    is its use of directing machinery to specific positions inside the farm utilizing
    GPS and position details, thus growing farming productivity as opposed to human-driven
    equipment. This will result in time and fuel savings, as well as cost savings
    on operations. Decision-making: Making decisions involves accurate knowledge,
    which can be gleaned from sensor data. The vast volume of data gathered by sensors
    creates resources for learning to enhance decision making in continuously evolving
    environmental scenarios. These choices may be taken in the immediate, intermediate,
    or long term. When those requirements are fulfilled, the IoT device may make automatic
    decisions, requiring little to no human interference. These automatic decisions
    may vary from temperature regulation to irrigation system management. For example,
    in solar farms, machine learning may assist in determining the optimum condition
    for growing a specific crop by analyzing data from sensors measuring nutrients,
    yield, development, transpiration, brightness, smell, and re-transplantation.
    The amount of knowledge gathered from data analytics will also help administration
    and all stakeholders make better policy decisions; thus, it is critical that the
    data is reliable, succinct, full, and timely. Numerous strategic decision-making
    frameworks have been created to assist farmers in making rational agricultural
    and livestock management decisions [50]. The data analytics makes professional
    recommendations to landowners, manages pests and diseases, and makes recommendations
    derived from remote expertise control systems. Machine Learning technological
    farms: Machine learning (ML) may be seen as a breakthrough mechanism for machines
    to mimic human active learning, acquire new information, continuously boost efficiency,
    and attain unique development. On other side humans (in case of agriculture: Farmers),
    are masters at multi-modal processing and can almost immediately integrate incoming
    inputs into an hypothetical knowledge based on their experience [51]. In recent
    years, machine learning models, concepts, and implementations have been very effective
    when coupled with other agricultural methods to reduce crop expenses and increase
    output. On agricultural fields, machine learning technologies may be used in a
    variety of ways, including disease diagnosis, crop identification, irrigation
    management, soil quality, weed tracking, crop quality assessment, and weather
    prediction. After harvest, machine learning may be used to analyze the freshness
    of products (fruits, vegetables, etc.), lifespan, quality of products, and market
    analysis. The application of machine learning in IoT-enabled agriculture could
    be based on a variety of different machine learning algorithms, including Gaussian
    mixture models, Neural networks, support vector machines (SVM), fuzzy clustering,
    etc. [52] present an Iot system with a ML algorithm that anticipates climatic
    conditions for fungal detection and mitigation based on temperature, comparative
    air humidity, speed of wind, and rainfall; furthermore, [53] developed a mechanism
    for disease prevention and monitoring on cotton leaves in conjunction with soil
    quality tracking. In certain scenarios, where the machine learning based IoT model
    faces shortage of streamline flow of data, interactive machine learning proves
    to be fruitful. The interactive machine learning algorithms regulates the learning
    factor of the algorithm by involving humans as agents [54]. The farmers can play
    the role of agents in case of agriculture domain. It has also been presented that
    the intelligence of machines can be improvised by involving human(farmers)-in-the-loop
    [55]. 5. Smart agriculture applications, software and hardware In this section,
    we have highlighted few apps, software and hardware which are playing a crucial
    role in making the agriculture system behave smartly. The apps are responsible
    for collecting the data for further analysis. 5.1. Smart agriculture apps Following
    are some of the most widely used IoT apps in smart agriculture: i. Nutrient ROI
    calculator: eKonimics has launched a revised edition of its highly esteemed ROI
    (return on investment) calculator [56] which aims to assist farmers in optimizing
    yields and earnings. The most recent iteration of the calculator integrates spatial
    uncertainty, providing farmers with a more precise representation of predicted
    nutrient response in production-scale agriculture. Farmers are able to create
    more precise fertilizer application strategies as a result, optimizing the gains
    of farm inputs and therefore can enhance their profitability. ii. Sirrus: It enables
    collaboration between agronomists and farmers by rendering field data available
    and simple to obtain [57]. By linking to the agX framework, users and applications
    can access structured field data offline and exchange it with some other users
    and devices. The advanced advice editor in Sirrus Premium enables service providers
    to offer changes in the field or when consulting with a grower. Users may modify
    fertilizer application rates, costs, and overall product prices. Sirrus credits
    prices dynamically depending on recent or flat rate applications. After selecting
    a product, labeling and safety data sheets (SDS) are widely sufficient to ensure
    proper product safety and usage. iii. FieldAgent: It collects data to create stunning
    agricultural crop health charts, count seeds, plants and identify weeds, among
    other things. It is compatible with the majority of modern DJI (Da-Jiang Innovations)
    drones and takes care of all the flying specifics, allowing you to concentrate
    solely on the targeted map. It displays the comprehensive orthomosaics, plant
    species, weed positions, and precise Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)
    crop-health items directly on your computer, along with position data to facilitate
    in-field scouting [58]. Task forecasts are given at the start of each trip and
    are revised as the task changes. Prior to takeoff, you can view and change almost
    any part of your flight route. Without regard for size, way-point, or acreage
    restrictions, you may fly vast fields simultaneously. When the drone’s batteries
    run out, FieldAgent would drive it home and drop it off where it departed off.
    iv. OpenIoT: It assists plant breeders in determining the state of various varieties
    of wheat by calculating humidity, temperature of air and soil. This enables farmers
    to forecast harvest dates, irrigation schedules, and nutrient requirements for
    plant development [59]. v. Farmbot: It makes use of open-source hardware and software
    for IoT in farming. It is based on developing an open source autonomous smart
    agriculture machine for the sake of mankind [59]. FarmBot assists customers in
    producing and growing their own food, developer Rory Aronson (CEO of Farmbot Inc.)
    said [60]. “It is something more than just understanding the origins of your food.
    Anyone who wishes to participate and assist us in building the future of agriculture
    has the potential to do so through their open-source technology”. vi. SmartFarmNet:
    It responds in near real-time to requests raised on time-series streaming data
    via sensors. It integrates non-SQL (NoSQL) and conceptual storage arrays. This
    arrangement manages (user, sensor, aggregated) data, and data caching. SmartFarmNet
    gathers, extracts, and aggregates data streams [61] from nearly all Internet-of-Things
    (IoT) system. For data ingestion, the SmartFarmNet gateway makes use of the OpenIoT
    X-GSN feature [62]. Wrappers are used to interact with sensors. A wrapper is a
    platform which enables the gateway to retrieve and transmit data from and to an
    underlying IoT system. At the moment, the SmartFarmNet network supports data ingestion
    from over thirty IoT interface platforms. vii. iSOYLscout: iSOYLscout is an intuitive
    field scouting application which s imply labels areas manually or using the built-in
    GPS when on foot or in a vehicle. The application can be used to monitor crop
    production, weed infestations, and any other function you want to track around
    the field. Each logged function instantly estimates the area. Interest points
    are denoted by a text tag such as ’Broad weed’. Additionally, notes and/or a photograph
    may be included with the point. ISOYLscout files are automatically imported to
    mySOYL, allowing for wireless and quick data sharing among field and office [63].
    Using iSOYLscout app, the farmer/user initially defines the region of interest,
    which may be scaled to include a single field, a portion of the farm, or the entire
    farm. For instance, the user may choose this based on the kind of data they want
    to collect, which may range from weed infestations to water-logging. Using GPS
    signal, the app will correctly record the position of these locations. Furthermore,
    the software has a manual sketching feature that could be used to distantly add
    a tag to a known place of interest even when the user is not in the vicinity.
    In any scenario, the app will inform the user of the estimated area and allow
    them to modify it. This is particularly advantageous for planning purposes. For
    instance, if a farmer has to establish a 1.0 hectare area of wild bird seed, the
    application will capture this and assist the farmer in properly establishing and
    recording the exact area. Along with regions of interest, any additional information
    deemed helpful by the farmer may be recorded at a particular location on the property.
    Users may create and modify a list of farm-related points. GPS data may be recorded
    automatically or manually. Free text changes of any length are also available,
    as well as the addition of pictures. viii. AgVault 2.0: It enables users to navigate
    whole fields with ease using an inspire drone [64]. The software enables the user
    to configure the UAV’s height, sensor settings, overlapping, steering angle, and
    survey region. The UAV is launched from the inside of the app, autonomously completes
    the preset path, and returns automatically. AgVault app helps in inspecting different
    areas of the field for analyzing the growth rate of crops, insect infestation,
    etc. ix. AgriSync: It helps farmers and consultants to communicate and collaborate
    on farm service concerns. Farmers may communicate with several advisors from different
    organizations in near real-time via video to send and request assistance. Advisors
    can monitor several customer requests with a console and remote video, which enables
    them to see exactly whatever the farmer experiences in real time. The advisor’s
    company will view open cases, settlement status, and farmer reviews in real time
    from a Web-based customer support dashboard [65]. x. FARMapper: It is a web-based
    application of the next generation that enables users to rapidly and easily create
    farm maps [66]. Your map is safely stored in the cloud and it can be accessed
    through mobile, tablets and desktop devices. You can view the farm project from
    nearly every platform that supports a Web browser. The app parses public land
    statistical data for the Municipality, Range, Segment, and quarter segment upon
    clicking on any point. It adds information to every clicked point and highlights
    the parcel. Using the app’s drawing tools, you can create custom polygons in no
    time. Additionally, the app assists farmers in maintaining information on water
    resources, easements, and cultivation. In FARMapper app., the different fields
    are clubbed in the form of maps which can be accessed anytime. Custom Polygons
    are in the app represents different field locations owned by any individual farmer.
    All the maps are stored in cloud and can be accessed anytime with a single click
    using the app, thus helping the farmer to monitor several plots easily. Fig. 5

    IoT combines robotics, drones, remote sensors, and computer vision with constantly
    improving machine learning and computational software to track crops, survey and
    analyze fields, and provide evidence to farmers for appropriate farm management
    strategies that save time and money. Table 2 discusses some of the well known
    IoT software being used in agriculture domain. Table 2. IoT software used in agriculture.

    hardware In this section, we highlighted some of the well known IoT hardware being
    used in agriculture domain. The most significant hardware component of IoT could
    be its sensors. Power modules, radio frequency modules, and sensor modules are
    used in these units. Table 3 discusses some of the widely used IoT hardware. Table
    3. IoT hardware used in agriculture. Hardware Description ESP8266 The ESp8266
    [75] is a wifi module that helps in establishing wireless connection between different
    components of IoT-based smart agriculture. RTC module This module helps in setting
    up a real time clock. It enables the module to keep track of precise timings of
    any operation to be performed by the designed IoT system [76] DHT11 The DHT11
    is a widely used sensor for measuring humidity and temperature. The DHT11 temperature
    and humidity sensor is a widely used component. The sensor is equipped with a
    specialized NTC for temperature measurement and an 8-bit micro-controller for
    serial data output [77]. Additionally, the sensor is factory tuned, making communication
    with other chipsets easy. The sensor has a precision of ±1 °C and ±1% when measuring
    temperature between 0 °C and 50 °C & humidity between 20% and 90%. Therefore,
    if you need measurements within this range, this hardware might be the best choice
    GSM module It can allow SIM from any GSM network provider and can operate as a
    smartphone with its own specific contact number. The RS-232 protocol can be used
    to link the controller quickly [69]. PIC Micro-controller It is used in defense,
    monitoring devices and domestic appliances. Often included is an EEPROM that is
    being used to permanently store the content [78]. This can be used to store the
    data collected by drones while analyzing the farmland. LM35 The LM35 temperature
    sensor generates an analog O/P voltage equal to the measured temperature. It indicates
    the output voltage in Celsius (C). It is self-calibrating and does not involve
    external tuning circuitry. The LM35 [79] has a sensitivity of 10 mV/degree C.
    If the temperature rises, the output voltage rises as well. 6. Principal advantages
    of IoT in smart agriculture Through remote sensing, smart agricultural systems
    minimize wastage, increase production, and allow management of a wider variety
    of resources. In conventional farming techniques, the farmer was continuously
    out there in the field, checking the farmland condition. However, as farms have
    become bigger, it has become increasingly difficult for farmers to manage everything
    everywhere. This is particularly true in micro-farming, where many distant pieces
    of land could be cultivated for a variety of crops, each of which requires a unique
    set of circumstances and precise control over soil and water. Control systems
    handle sensor input, providing remote monitoring for supplies and decision support,
    as well as automating machinery and equipment to respond to developing problems
    and to assist production. This is not dissimilar to the success criteria for any
    other “smart” marketing strategy; a standardized methodology establishes the better
    utilization of resources enabling production process on the supplier side and
    for satisfying strict demand-side limitations. Thus, in a smart agriculture system,
    it is about controlling agricultural production and, depending on its state, establishing
    the appropriate growth factors – such as moisture, fertilizer, or material content
    – to ensure production of the desired crop. During production, it is all about
    resource management in order to optimize the growth process. Smart and precision
    farming methods, for example, focus on precise sowing using unmanned tractors
    to minimize seed waste and optimize plant spacing to provide the greatest potential
    output per acre. Another example is water usage, which may be improved by using
    precision water delivery techniques such as dripping or subsurface irrigation
    to decrease evaporation and increase soil moisture content by providing water
    only if it is required through sensors and automation. Overall, the whole procedure
    from farm to fork is monitored by sensors and managed by software which reduces
    overall costs, increases overall yield and supply quality, and ultimately improves
    the farmer experience. Following are some of the key benefits of using IoT for
    performing smart agriculture: i. Agility: The improved agility of operations is
    one of the advantages of utilizing IoT in agriculture. Farmers can rapidly react
    to any major change in climate, humidity, quality of air, or the condition of
    soil or crops, thanks to real-time surveillance and forecast systems. Emerging
    IoT technologies aid agricultural experts in saving crops in the face of severe
    weather fluctuations. ii. Clean Process: Precision farming using IoT-based technologies
    not only saves water and energy, making farming more environmental friendly, but
    it also reduces pesticide and fertilizer usage considerably. In comparison to
    conventional farming techniques, this technology provides for a better and more
    organic end result. iii. Automating sowing, irrigation, and harvesting operations
    may help save resources, minimize human error, and lower total costs. iv. Accurately
    monitoring production rates per field over time enables accurate forecasting of
    a farm’s future crop output and value. v. The Internet of Things will aid in the
    advancement of community farming, particularly in remote areas. The IoT can be
    used to encourage services that enable communities to exchange data, knowledge
    and increase contact between landowners and farming expertise [80]. vi. Smart
    agriculture makes extensive use of drones and robotics, which help in a variety
    of ways. This enhancements strengthen the data collection mechanism and facilitate
    wireless surveillance and control. vii. The agricultural sector faces a number
    of challenges, not the least of which is ensuring adequate productivity while
    still ensuring a healthy and nutritious food supply. Numerous allegations of food
    theft have been produced, including adulteration, counterfeiting, and artificial
    manipulation [81]. This kind of fraud is hazardous to one’s health and may have
    a detrimental economic effect [82]. Several of the components of food theft discussed
    in [83] can be resolved by the use of IoT technologies, including product validity,
    procedure integrity, individual truthfulness, and data integrity. The Internet
    of Things can be used to include logistical and analytical regulatory compliance
    for food [84]. viii. One of the alleged benefits of IoT is the opportunity to
    control equipment remotely [85]. The implementation of IoT in agriculture would
    enable significant time and cost savings in inspecting vast fields as contrasted
    to staff personally checking the field by vehicle or foot. Through using IoT to
    determine when and how to apply fertilizers or pesticides, expense and wastage
    may be reduced. ix. The adoption of IoT would enable new business opportunities
    through which independent farmers will escape the manipulation of “middle men”
    and establish direct relationships with customers [86], resulting in increased
    benefit. x. IoT can allow real-time surveillance of farm properties and equipment
    to prevent fraud, expedite component replacement, and ensure routine maintenance
    is performed on time. 7. Key challenges & open research issues We have encountered
    significant technological advancements over the last few decades, and these advancements
    have impacted our daily lives. It is credited with making our lives more convenient
    by putting resources at our fingertips. Among the many innovations in progress,
    IoT, also recognized as M2M, has effectively drawn a large community (in which
    smart sensors gather real-time data and communicate with one another or with the
    internet in order to take appropriate action). IoT as a technology presents both
    prospects and challenges. M2M can be divided into four distinct layers. The first
    component is a sensor that collects real-time data, followed by a communication
    device that handles data transmission. The third computational unit is in charge
    of data analysis, while the service layer is in charge of performing any required
    actions. These four elements are largely carried forward to the Internet of Things.
    The following are the imminent critical issues confronting IoT: i. IoT standardization:
    It is a crucial aspect in developing credibility and establishing a market for
    a novel idea. The introduction of physical objects into the internet creates a
    number of problems in terms of the adaptability of existing internet protocols
    and applications to these objects [87]. In recent years, detailed study has been
    conducted to match current procedures and solutions to these artifacts. The IoT
    includes a diverse variety of heterogeneous devices; if these devices utilize
    disparate standards and protocols, achieving high degree of interoperability is
    challenging. As a result, IoT regulatory agencies such as the IEEE, ETSI could
    prioritize implementing a technical standard to address standardization concerns.
    There are continuing efforts to develop the protocols and specifications necessary
    for millions and millions of IoT devices to communicate with one another. This
    entails interoperability on technological, semantic, conceptual, and organizational
    levels [88]. Interoperability of syntax is synonymous with code formats such as
    XML, JSON, EDI, comma separated variables, etc. as common syntax for data exchange
    [89]. Significant research is expected to be done to promote open standards in
    order to increase interoperability across billions of IoT apps and platforms.
    ii. IoT data: Some of the major issues with data usage in smart agriculture includes
    data reliability, data uniformity, and data volume. (a.) Data uniformity: Agricultural
    data may be lost due to equipment failure or network node breakdown, post-processing
    errors, or pest/disease infestation. Due to the loss of a large number of recorded
    incidents, missing data results in erroneous calculations and degrades the success
    of IoT applications in agriculture. Several researchers have suggested numerous
    imputation approaches over time, including multiple mean matching, kernel smoothing,
    regression technique, and uniform kriging. (b.) Data Reliability: In agriculture,
    the primary cause of missing data is mechanical failure, electricity, weather
    conditions, mislabeled data, and computation error. Numerous implementations of
    data mining techniques [90] exist in smart agriculture, including crop safety
    assistance, irrigation prediction [91], and pesticide reduction [92]. In the other
    side, noisy and abnormal data pose significant impediments to the successful use
    of data mining techniques in smart agriculture. As a result, it is critical to
    manage noisy data using proven techniques [93], (c.) Data Volume: Heterogeneous
    data is another issue with data that arises as a consequence of big data’s existence.
    Agricultural data may be collected using a variety of different technologies,
    including monitors, drones, cameras, and RFID tags. Indeed, since big data is
    heterogeneous, we can employ frameworks that reduce memory requirements and processing
    time correlated with data analysis. iii. Regulatory issues: It is necessary to
    sort out the regulatory and legal structures governing the management and possession
    of farm data between farm workers and data firms [94]. Regulations can vary by
    country in terms of service provision [95] (for example, frequency for wireless
    IoT), technological difficulties, competitiveness, data protection, and security
    [96]. Different laws in different regions of the world can have an effect on how
    IoT is applied in specific applications, such as monitoring and agro-food supply.
    iv. Market issues: Agriculture sector has a very low profit margin, and as such,
    there is a need to coordinate the introduction of IoT-enabling technologies against
    the future benefits. As a result, we address market challenges associated with
    IoT implementation in terms of expense and industry awareness. • Cost: There are
    certain costs associated with IoT implementation in agriculture, which can be
    classified as setup and operating costs [97]. The setup cost covers the expense
    of IoT hardware required for framing a smart environment for agriculture. The
    operating cost is based on a consistent subscription to centralized networks or
    IoT systems that facilitate data processing, maintenance of IoT devices, and knowledge
    exchange, among other aspects. Additional operating costs include those associated
    with data sharing among IoT devices, gateways, and cloud servers, as well as energy
    and maintenance. While certain IoT providers offer free subscription packages
    with restricted features, the amount of linked IoT devices, and the volume of
    information that can be stored is limited. Increased features and facilities result
    in increased payment rates. • Lack of awareness: A significant factor impeding
    IoT adoption in agriculture is a lack of sufficient awareness about IoT and its
    applications, notably among farmers in rural areas. This is a frequent occurrence
    in developed nations, where the bulk of farmers reside in remote areas and are
    often illiterate. If human interference is unavailable, the farmer’s failure to
    use knowledge can be a significant obstacle. v. Security: In smart agriculture
    domain, IoT devices are susceptible to physical tampering, including burglary
    or attacks by rodents and livestock, as well as changes in physical address or
    connection [98]. [99] addressed different security breach cases such as Data Theft,
    SQL Injection attack, etc. at different layers of IoT. Physical components, such
    as sensors and actuators, are the prime focus of the perception layer. Accidental
    or deliberate human activity, malware, or crooks may lead physical equipment to
    malfunction. Consequently, complex and complicated algorithms are challenging
    to incorporate in IoT devices due to their restricted memory, connectivity capacities,
    and low energy usage. Congestion threats, DOS attacks, and routing attacks are
    all possible on the gateway. The protection and positioning of location data and
    IoT-enabled services used in smart agriculture are vulnerable to attacks such
    as system capture [100]. An intruder traps an IoT device and removes cryptographic
    signatures, allowing the attacker unlimited access to the details contained on
    the device’s memory. Such higher-level networking layers may be susceptible to
    denial-of-service (DOS) threats, jamming and man-in-the-middle attacks [101].
    Cloud repositories are susceptible to data tampering and unauthorized resources
    that may disrupt smart farming process [102]. The fast development and widespread
    use of smart mobile technology, and also the combination of IoT with corporate
    digitalization and automation, create new risks and hazards for Information and
    Communication Technologies security on the worldwide market. Potential cyberattacks
    on a variety of different smart agricultural systems may create significant security
    concerns in a dynamic and dispersed cyber–physical context [103]. These risks
    and cyberattacks have the potential to cause significant disruptions to linked
    companies. Additionally, in agriculture’s highly automated environment, smart
    technology and remote administration employed in precision agriculture and smart
    farming are novel to its stakeholders, with the majority of new risks in this
    sector being closely related to comparable concerns in other industries. These
    risks are mostly concerned with cybersecurity, data security, and loss of data
    [104]. Additionally, since the precision agriculture industry makes extensive
    use of heavy equipment that is linked to the internet, there are many new vulnerabilities
    that may have catastrophic effects. Table 4 lists out the different potential
    cyber attacks on smart agriculture. It is important to note that the majority
    of today’s smart agriculture applications are built on IoT technology, which means
    they may directly inherit their security issues. Security features are disabled
    by default in protocols like MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) and CoAP
    (Constrained Application Protocol), and the operator must enable it as per the
    project’s objectives. [105] demonstrates a system for predicting irrigation needs
    based on climatic and environmental data. The technology predicts soil moisture
    using sensor data and makes irrigation recommendations. A web page is used by
    the end-user to communicate with the system. In the gathering, transmitting, and
    storing stages, the article presents no security measures, authentication checks
    or failure diagnostics. Because of the absence of security, systems are susceptible
    to different types of the attack, indicating that the system is extremely insecure.
    Data corruption or inaccuracy causes predictions to be incorrect and decisions
    to be made incorrectly. Incorrect actions can undermine the growth and diminish
    the system’s acceptance. Likewise, [106] developed a system that uses soil moisture,
    light levels, humidity and temperature sensor to monitor farms. Irrigation can
    be controlled manually or automatically using web or mobile apps. The system description
    is devoid of any security mechanisms, leaving the system vulnerable to the entire
    array of attacks described in Table 4. Controlling actuators with instructions
    from a web application that lacks strong security safeguards provides an ideal
    chance for malevolent adversaries to manipulate the system via malicious scripts
    and illegal access. Similarly, for data sharing between the host, the gateway,
    as well as the nodes, [107] offer a smart agriculture architecture. The article
    presents the system’s architecture but makes no mention of interactivity or remote
    control, and it exhibits no security issues. The most damaging attacks, such as
    DoS, signal interruption, data transit, and routing, are those that target the
    network layer, since it is a data exchange platform. Some of the open issues [108]
    available for researchers include: (Malicious Scripts, Phishing attack, Deny of
    services) at Application layer, (Signature wrapping, Booting Vulnerabilities,
    Forged control of actuators) at Edge layer, (Signal disruptions, Data transit
    attack, DoS, Routing attack) at Network layer, (Autonomous system disruption &
    Hijacking, Fake node, Sleep deprivation, Node capture) at Perception layer. vi.
    Reliability: The Internet of Things devices are intended to be installed outdoors.
    This exposes the devices to extreme environmental factors, which may result in
    sensor deterioration over time and connectivity failures. Physical security of
    installed IoT devices and networks [109] must be maintained to safeguard expensive
    equipment against adverse weather events such as floods and hurricanes. vii. Scalability:
    In smart agriculture, a significant number of connected devices and sensors are
    installed, necessitating the use of an intelligent IoT management framework for
    the detection and control of every node [110]. Gateways and protocols in use today
    would have to accommodate a massive range of IoT devices/nodes, e.g., Sigfox supports
    nodes. viii. Localization: Numerous considerations must be weighed when deploying
    IoT systems. These considerations include the IoT device’s capacity to accept
    position and play capability, i.e., to be installed anywhere and linked to the
    remainder of the globe without requiring any (or minimal) modification or the
    deployment of external hardware, such as gateways. Other considerations include
    the optimal location for the IoT system to have sufficient knowledge and reliability
    without creating disturbance [111]. ix. Networking issue: Smart agriculture presents
    a difficult communication challenge between various sensor nodes [112]. Sensors
    conduct large computations that consume energy, but sensor batteries have a limited
    capacity. As a result, networks need effective energy storage. These problems
    do not occur just at the hardware implementation stage, yet even at its network
    layer. Wireless connectivity [113] is critical for the implementation of smart
    agriculture owing to the uptick expense of wiring. Physical implementation demonstrates
    that the efficiency of approved transceivers is exaggerated by the proximity of
    humans, temperature, moisture, and a variety of other obstacles inside the region
    in which a wireless system or node wishes to interact. As a result, the most effective
    and stable technology can be used to transmit data in view of environmental problems
    and rural environments [114]. A thorough review of the problems and issues associated
    with IoT-based smart agriculture connectivity is offered in [115]. x. Resource
    optimization: Farm owners require a resource optimization process to decide the
    optimal number of gateways, IoT devices, communicated data and cloud storage required
    to achieve an advancement in profitability. This is made more difficult by the
    fact that various farms have varying sizes and need varying types of sensors to
    detect farm variables for certain crops or livestock [116]. This will necessitate
    the implementation of sophisticated algorithms and statistical models capable
    of determining the optimum resource distribution while mitigating costs and optimizing
    agricultural production and income. After setting different prospects for prolonged
    research efforts, most IoT applications in themselves enable to identify difficulties
    for research and development to get a dependable as well as viable solution. The
    roadmap was drawn up by correctly identifying the research goals and objectives
    based on an assessment of the following criteria: (i) Thorough apprehension of
    the Smart-IoT architecture, (ii) Appropriate establishment of constraint free
    communication interface in the network minimizing the cost and maximizing the
    heterogeneity, (iii) Correct recognition and subsequent signal processing of incoming
    data when items are synced via the Internet via communication devices, there is
    a tremendous data generation. Therefore, correct management of collaborative data
    sharing is one of the top-priority, (iv) Standards should be developed to enable
    a broad variety of applications and meet common criteria for all potential IoT
    Smart-agriculture applications. Table 4. Different security concerns and attacks

    of internet devices, steady progress in all domains, from time to time, attracts
    critical concerns, along with updates, that cannot be neglected or disregarded.
    Over the last several years, the Internet of Things (IoT) has made great strides.
    The resources accessible beneath the hood of IoT have run out, and current situations
    have prompted a slew of questions that must be addressed in some manner before
    expanding to newer dimensions. In light of the ever-expanding scope of the IoT,
    several future-related questions have been raised that must be answered before
    we enter a new horizon of performing smart-agriculture. – Would there be any next
    major step in properly identifying and managing the vast array of sensors being
    introduced to setup smart environment for agriculture? – How will the future generation
    of smart-agriculture systems operate in tandem with IoT, especially when technological
    advances is not incessant? – Safeguarding of electrical circuits in IoT system
    against specific environmental conditions such as fire, heavy rain, winds, excessive
    humidity, etc. Different IoT systems for performing smart-agriculture has been
    proposed by several researchers, but crop residue remains a major environmental
    concern. To address this issue [117], we could indeed develop an IoT system infused
    with biotechnology that can assist in gathering data (which would include climate
    factors for growing bacteria and fungi for various sites and croplands) to solve
    the crop residue problem as well as provide a remedy to biodegrade the residue.
    8. Conclusion and future trends IoT has expanded steadily in last few years and
    a variety of IoT-based frameworks have been formulated in a variety of domains,
    most notably in agriculture. This review article discussed the prevailing state
    of the IoT in agriculture by reviewing key works of literature, analyzing current
    IoT research trends, and investigating common IoT sensors, devices, agriculture
    APPs, benefits & challenges, and analytics in IoT-based agricultural production.
    Despite of many challenges, IoT is an innovative breakthrough with a predicted
    exponential rate of growth of 27.1 billion connected components by 2021. Via its
    ubiquitous internet networking, it links diverse gadgets, devices, and individuals.
    The upcoming studies, inventions, and initiatives mostly in field of IoT-based
    smart agriculture would improve the quality of living for farmers and result in
    significant improvements in the agricultural sector. However, a variety of questions
    remain unresolved in order to make things sustainable for small and medium-scale
    growers. Security and expense are critical considerations. As competitiveness
    in agriculture intensifies and beneficial policies are adopted, it is projected
    that the increasing adoption of IoT for framing a smart agricultural environment
    will increase proportionately. Some of the future trends of smart agriculture
    includes: construction of generic platform for all sort of crops and livestock,
    QoS (Quality of Service), usage of explainable artificial intelligence to monitor
    crop growth and disease control, Policies standardization, other technological
    and deployment advancements. Explainable AI [51] is one of the major necessity
    in most of the domains for understanding the reasons behind any specific decision.
    It fades away the traditional black box concept of machine learning and enables
    the farmers/users in understanding the factors behind the obtained solution. CRediT

  description: The use of artificial intelligence has made life easier for farmers,
    as analysis of agricultural data allows farmers to make informed decisions, supported
    by large data sets and processed by machine learning algorithms. In this paper,
    we present the literature on rice quality assessment according to the different
    criteria and factors used to predict the quality or yield of rice. Thus, we provided
    a list of machine learning and deep learning models that had high accuracy in
    predicting rice yield and quality. In addition, due to the lack of literature
    of a real-time rice field monitoring system, we proposed a real-time rice field
    condition monitoring system that collects weather and soil condition data and
    sends them to the web server. The farmer can see the status of its remotely field
    and can automate certain tasks such as irrigation based on the collected data
    values.

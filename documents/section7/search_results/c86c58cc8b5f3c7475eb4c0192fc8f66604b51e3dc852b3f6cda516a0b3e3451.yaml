    text   Introduction Water is the essential natural resource for agriculture, and
    it is limited in nature (Kamienski et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2020; Sahoo et al.,
    2019). In a country like India, a huge share of water is used for irrigation (Nawandar
    & Satpute, 2019). Crop irrigation is a noteworthy factor in determining plant
    yield, depending upon multiple climatic conditions such as air temperature, soil
    temperature, humidity, and soil moisture (Bavougian & Read, 2018). Farmers primarily
    rely on personal monitoring and experience for harvesting fields (Glaroudis, Iossifides
    & Chatzimisios, 2020). Water needs to be maintained in the field (Liu et al.,
    2020; Fremantle & Scott, 2017). Scarcity of water in these modern days is a hot
    issue. Such a scarcity is already affecting people worldwide (LaCanne & Lundgren,
    2018; Schleicher et al., 2017). The situation may worsen in the coming years.
    The uniform water distribution of traditional irrigation systems is not optimal.
    Hence, research effort has been exterted towards efficient agricultural monitoring
    system (Kim, Evans & Iversen, 2008). In this regard, standalone monitoring station
    is under development. For instance, a mixed signal processor (MSP430) has been
    developed with a microcontroller along with a set of meteorological sensors. A
    wireless sensor-based monitoring system has also been developed. It has made of
    several wireless sensor nodes and a gateway (Gutiérrez et al., 2013). It has been
    implemented as an easy solution with better spatial and temporal determinations.
    In addition, there is a demand for automating the irrigation system. Automation
    enables machines to apply intelligence by reading historical data and accordingly
    analyze and predict the output. This mechanism is more effective than the traditional
    rule-based algorithm (Chlingaryan, Sukkarieh & Whelan, 2018). From here onwards,
    the role of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) play an important
    role. The applications of ML in the field of agriculture domain is numerous (Jha
    et al., 2019). Starting from crop selection and yielding to crop disease prediction,
    different ML techniques like artificial neural networks (ANN), support vector
    machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor (k-NN), and decision trees have shown huge success
    (Ge et al., 2019). After the great success of the combination of WSN and ML techniques,
    there is a requirement for more automation and without human intervention. The
    development of machine to machine (M2M) and the Internet of Things (IoT) allows
    devices to communicate with one another without much human intervention. These
    days, the usage of mobile devices is increasing, at the same time cloud computing
    is becoming a popular technology. The existing water monitoring system used wireless
    sensors for monitoring the soil condition for irrigation. These systems barely
    capture the data from the land and subsequently controls the electric motor for
    watering the land. Moreover, there is a high demand to analyze the real-time data
    based on the historical information for irrigating fields. Research on M2M system
    is limited, particularly regarding communication among devices to more intelligently
    perform analysis and recommendation. Realizing the water scarcity issue and at
    the same time the technological advancement, we are motivated to design a fully
    automated irrigation system. This system must be smart enough so that it can adapt
    to the local climatic conditions and precisely predict the decision on irrigation
    in a reliable way. There are many aspects of an efficient automatic irrigation
    system. As weather data is an important parameter for making irrigation decisions,
    the system must be smart enough to integrate the forecasted weather data (Goldstein
    et al., 2018). The next important aspect is to estimate the soil features properly
    so that the prediction error can be minimized in the irrigation recommendation
    system (Khoa et al., 2019). Once the weather data along with soil and environmental
    parameters are forecasted, the data can be used to make final decisions regarding
    irrigation. For this task, we need an efficient binary classifier to decide whether
    to irrigate or not. The advanced ML techniques and IoT may provide a solution.
    The two main motivations for this work are efficient water usage in irrigation
    to reduce water wastage and minimize human intervention as much as possible. The
    main objective of the work is to reduce water wastage in the agricultural field
    by introducing an IoT-enabled ML-trained recommendation system (IoT-IIRS). In
    this prototype, the analyzed information can be sent from the cloud server to
    the farmer’s mobile handset priorly. This system makes the decision of whether
    to water the field or not simple for farmers. The main contributions of this work
    are as follows: An IoT-IIRS is proposed for efficient water usage. IoT devices
    are deployed in the crop field to collect the ground and environmental details
    precisely. The gathered data such as air temperature, soil temperature, humidity,
    and soil moisture are forwarded through an Arduino and stored in a cloud-based
    server, which applies ML algorithms such as SVM, regression tree, and agglomerative
    clustering to analyze those data and suggest irrigation to the farmer. To make
    the system robust and adaptive, an inbuilt feedback mechanism is added to this
    recommendation system. Experimentation reveals that the proposed system performs
    well on our own collected dataset and NIT Raipur crop dataset. The remaining part
    of the paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces the related
    work. The proposed methodology section discusses the working steps for the solution
    framework. The results of the experiments are discussed in the result section.
    Finally, the last section ends with concluding remarks and further scope for improvement.
    Related work Communication is one of the most important aspects of the implementation
    of an automatic and intelligent irrigation system. In the last few years, significant
    research is carried out on smart irrigation. In Salas et al. (2014), the authors
    suggested the implementation of general packet radio service (GPRS) communication
    as a gateway between wireless sensor network (WSN) and the Internet. Numerous
    data transmission techniques have been applied in closed-loop watering systems.
    These are used to apply the required amount of water in the desired place in due
    time to conserve natural resources. Bhanu et al. presented a system to build a
    wireless sensor network-based soil moisture controller, which determines the water
    demand by differentiating the soil moisture with a preset threshold value (Bhanu,
    Hussain & Ande, 2014). Field authentication tests are regularly performed on distinct
    soils to estimate the soil moisture and water quantity in the soil to develop
    a productive watering system. If the preserved data do not match with the measured
    soil data, then an interrupt is passed to the pressure unit to stop the irrigation.
    Solar power-based intelligent irrigation system is proposed to provide the required
    amount of water to the crop field (Rehman et al., 2017). Soil and humidity sensors
    are deployed to measure the wet and dry states of the soil. Once sensing is completed,
    the sensor node transmits the signal to the microcontroller. In addition, they
    forward that signal to the relay to switch on and off the motor. In Kaur & Deepali
    (2017), the authors presented a WSN-based smart irrigation system for efficient
    water usage with the help of automated remote sensing and persistent analysis
    of soil parameters and environmental conditions using ML. Hema et al. proposed
    an approach to estimate the native real-time weather parameters for interpolation
    with the help of an automated weather station (ASW) (Hema & Kant, 2014). This
    intelligent system provides past, present, and future predictions utilizing nearby
    ASW data and control the irrigation process during conditions like rainfall. To
    control the irrigation, soil moisture and ASW data are exploited for error correction,
    where interpolated value is compared with soil moisture data. In Ashwini (2018),
    the authors stated that the smart irrigation system employing WSN and GPRS modules
    optimizes water utilization for any agricultural crop. This approach comprises
    of a distributed WSN along with different sensors, such as moisture and temperature
    sensors. Gateway components are employed to transfer data from the sensor unit
    to the base station. Direct order is sent to the actuator for regulating the irrigation
    process and handling data from the sensor unit. According to the need and conditions
    of the field, different algorithms are used in the system. It is programmed in
    a microcontroller that sends commands through an actuator to regulate water quantity
    with a valve unit. The entire framework is powered by photo-voltaic panels, where
    duplex communication takes place through cellular networks. Web applications control
    irrigation through regular monitoring and irrigation scheduling. In Leh et al.
    (2019), the authors designed hardware and software by analyzing the routing protocols
    of the sensor network. Mobile phones and wireless personal digital assistant (PDA)
    help to monitor the soil moisture content, as a result, irrigation system is controlled.
    Mohapatra et al. proposed an irrigation system based on WSN (Mohapatra, Lenka
    & Keswani, 2019). The designed system uses fuzzy logic and neural network to save
    water efficiently. The used fuzzy neural network is an integrated set of fuzzy
    logic reasoning and self-learning ability of a neural network. Sensor nodes measure
    temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and light intensity data. LAN or WAN helps
    to transfer the collected data to the irrigation control system via gateway nodes.
    The electromagnetic valve is controlled for precision irrigation based on the
    collected data. To predict the soil moisture, the authors in (Goap et al., 2018),
    developed an algorithm that works based on field sensor and weather forecasting
    data. The algorithm uses the support vector regression model and k-means clustering.
    This algorithm also provides a suggestion regarding irrigation based on the level
    of soil moisture. Collected device information and the output of the algorithm
    are stored in MySQL Database at the server end. In Gutiérrez et al. (2013), the
    authors presented a system that uses a camera to capture images. Captured images
    are processed to determine the water content of the soil. Depending on the level
    of water in the soil, water is pumped into the crop field. The camera is controlled
    from an Android application. The camera captures RGB pictures of soil using an
    anti-reflective glass window to find the wet and dry areas. The WiFi connection
    of the smartphone is used to transmit the estimated value to the gateway through
    a router to control the water pump. M2M communication is applied as a robust mechanism
    for effective water management during farm irrigation (Shekhar et al., 2017).
    In Vij et al. (2020), the authors proposed a distributed network environment using
    IoT, ML, and WSN technologies for efficient water usage and reduced soil erosion.
    Soil moisture prediction is one of the most important tasks for an automatic irrigation
    system. Many researchers contributed various methodologies and algorithms for
    this task (Adeyemi et al., 2018; Sinwar et al., 2020; Singh, Kaur & Kumar, 2020).
    Proposed methodology The proposed three-tier architecture along with the descriptions
    are mentioned in this section. The solution architecture of our smart irrigation
    system is given in Fig. 1. The details of each level are described below. Figure
    1: Solution framework.   Download full-size image DOI: 10.7717/peerj-cs.578/fig-1
    • Crop Field Level: The first one is the crop field level where different sensors
    are deployed in the field. Various sensors like soil moisture (EC- 1258), soil
    temperature (DS18B20), air temperature (DHT11), and humidity (DHT11) are used
    to gather all these soil and environmental attributes. All these sensors collect
    data and send them to the Arduino. The Arduino then forwards the sensor data to
    the cloud server. All these sensor data are collected twice a day and forwarded
    for cloud storage using a micro-controller device. The average value is calculated
    and stored as the final reading for the particular day. To eliminate the inter-dependency
    among the used parameters, the Pearson correlation is computed. It is found that
    there is no strong correlation exists. The Arduino is also connected to the motor
    pump through the breadboard and relay switch to turn on/off the pump for irrigation.
    Here, we use the Arduino microcontroller because it requires low energy. • Cloud
    Level: The second level is the cloud level where the cloud server is used to provide
    service to the user. The sensors’ data are stored in the database. The data are
    then feed to the ML-based model for analysis. This ML unit is the heart of this
    intelligent system, which has two sections. One is the regression model that is
    used to predict the soil and environmental parameters in advance. By doing so,
    it can be used effectively to improve the performance of the system. The parameters
    that are considered from forecasted weather data are the atmospheric pressure,
    precipitation, solar radiation, and wind speed. These predicted values are passed
    through a clustering model to reduce the predicted errors. The other ML-based
    model takes the results of the clustering model along with the forecasted weather
    data as input. This binary classification model categorizes the predicted samples
    into two predefined classes: irrigation required (Y) or not required (N). The
    results of these ML models are stored in the database for future actions. The
    last component of the cloud-based server is the handler used for coordination
    between the user and field units. Based on the suggestion of the ML model, the
    handler will send irrigation suggestions to the user via the Android application.
    Based on the agricultural literature, the formula used for calculating the water
    requirement is discussed in Eq. (1). (1) E V o ∗ C f = W need where, EVo = rate
    of evaporation Cf = crop factor Wneed = amount of water needed. • User Level:
    At the user level, the user interacts with an Android application to enter the
    details about the farmer and crop. Farmer credentials are used to authenticate
    the user through login operation. In crop details, the farmer may have to provide
    the information by selecting the drop-down menus like a session, crop name, total
    crop days, date of sowing, and so on. Through this application, the farmer may
    get all relevant information about the crop and field. Thus, upon receiving the
    sensor data along with the irrigation suggestion on the Android application, the
    user may order the on/off command to the microcontroller. Here, the system is
    an adaptive one that takes feedback from the user for each suggestion by the handler.
    If the farmer does not follow the recommendation, then feedback is sent to the
    server for updation. The system will be fine-tuned subsequently based on user
    feedback. The microcontroller upon receiving the on/off command from the user
    performs the motor on/off operation for the supply of water to plants. Thus, we
    have an automatic irrigation system, which can be used to increase the productivity
    of the crop by providing an optimal amount of water. The working steps of the
    proposed solution framework have shown in Algorithm 1. Algorithm 1: Working steps
    for solution framework. Input: Authentication details for Login to Android application;
    All relevant crop information from the drop down list Output: Motor turn on/off
    1: Collect all sensor data at regular intervals through the Arduino. 2: Save the
    sensor readings in the cloud server database. 3: Using the weather forecasted
    data, the ML analyzer model analyzes these stored sensor data to check whether
    irrigation is required or not? 4: The recommendation of the ML model is forwarded
    to the Android through the handler. 5: Based on the ML recommendation and sensor
    readings the user will inform the Arduino to send an on/off signal to the motor.
    6: User may follow the recommendation and irrigate the field. 7: If the user does
    not follow the recommendation, then feedback will be sent and stored in the database
    for the corresponding sensor readings. DOI: 10.7717/peerj-cs.578/table-2 ML model
    As mentioned earlier, the ML analyzer is the main building block of our proposed
    system. On the stored sensor data, the regression tree (RT) algorithm is applied
    to predict future soil and environmental data. RTs may grasp non-linear relationships
    and are reasonably robust to outliers. These predicted parameters are further
    improved using the agglomerative clustering (AC) algorithm. It may be suitable
    for this task as the clusters are not supposed to be globular. The forecasted
    weather data are combined with the predicted soil data to be fed into the classification
    model. Then, the classifier categorizes the data sample whether irrigation is
    required or not at that time. This way, the ML technique helps the farmer with
    the suggestion for irrigation on the crop field. The details about this recommendation
    architecture is mentioned in Fig. 2. The working steps of the ML model are detailed
    in Algorithm 2. Figure 2: Architecture of ML-based model.   Download full-size

    Input: All sensor data and the forecasted weather data from Indian Meteorological
    Department (IMD) Output: Recommendation for irrigation required or not 1: Apply
    previously trained RT model on these sensor data to predict future soil and environmental
    data. 2: Apply AC algorithm for a more precise prediction of all these sensor
    parameters. 3: All predicted sensor parameters are combined with the forecasted
    weather data to prepare the final data samples. 4: Apply the previously trained
    SVM model on these final data samples. DOI: 10.7717/peerj-cs.578/table-3 RT RT
    is constructed via a procedure known as binary iterative splitting, which is a
    repetitive process that partition the data into branches, subbranches, and so
    on. Each decision node in the tree assesses the value of several input variable’s
    values. The leaf nodes of the RT carry the predicted output (response) variable
    (Torres-Barrán, Alonso & Dorronsoro, 2019). Here, the AdaBoost algorithm is applied
    using its library. AC AC is a type of hierarchical clustering that works on a
    bottom-up approach (Stashevsky et al., 2019). A fundamental assumption in hierarchical
    AC is that the merge operation is monotonic. Each scrutiny begins in its own cluster,
    and clusters merged as one moves up the hierarchy. This clustering may improve
    the performance of classical regression by partitioning the sample training space
    into subspaces. SVM SVM is a supervised ML model that works very well for many
    classification tasks (Lebrini et al., 2019). Once SVM is fed with sets of labeled
    training data for each class, they can be categorized into new samples. For non-linear
    classification, it performs well with a limited number of labeled training data.
    The prototype model and its deployment in the paddy field are depicted in Figs.
    3A and 3B separately. It contains all sensors, Arduino, GSM module, different
    connecting wires. Along with all these IoT devices, one power bank is used as
    the source of power. This power source may be replaced with a small solar panel
    with a battery in the future. The Arduino is used because of its low power consumption.
    The prototype of the android application is illustrated in Fig. 4A and the recommendation
    for the motor using the classification, of whether irrigation is required or not
    is shown in Fig. 4B. Figure 3: (A) Prototype model (B) Model deployment inside

    Results and discussion The performance of the proposed model has been evaluated
    using Python. All the ML models have been implemented using the Scikit-learn Python
    library. To validate the effectiveness of the system, our own collected data (GCEKIoTCommunity)
    (https://github.com/NitrrMCACommunity/Agriculture-Automation-) along with the
    Crops dataset of NIT Raipur (NitrrMCACommunity) (https://github.com/NitrrMCACommunity/Agriculture-Automation-/tree/master/Dataset)
    have been used. We have collected data like soil moisture, soil temperature, humidity,
    air temperature, and UV radiation by using the relevant sensors. The stored readings
    of each day are the average of all readings on that day. We gathered 150 samples
    from our simulation area. In the NIT Raipur dataset, there are 501 samples available.
    As mentioned earlier, we have integrated the forecasted weather data from Indian
    meteorological department site (IMD) (https://mausam.imd.gov.in/) by using weather
    application programming interface (APIs) (https://restapitutorial.com/). Through
    this, we have collected the data like next-day rainfall, amount of rainfall, precipitation,
    and so on of a particular area to make our irrigation accuracy even better. As
    the evening is the best time to irrigate, each day in the evening, the ML model
    runs. Based on its results, the handler sends irrigation suggestions to the farmer
    along with the stored and forecasted parameters. For the classification task,
    the five-fold cross-validation method is used for better generalization. The efficiency
    of the system is estimated based on the most extensively used measures, such as
    precision, recall, F1-measure, and accuracy (A). Mathematically, these measures
    are represented in Eqs. (2) to (4). (2) Precision( P r )= T p T p + F p (3) Recall(
    R c )= T p T p + F n (4) F1−measure(F1)= 2∗ P r ∗ R c P r + R c where Tp, Fp,
    and Fn are denoted as true positives, false positives, and false negatives, respectively.
    The results of different ML models for classification are given in Table 1. The
    different performance evaluations of the proposed model on our own collected dataset
    are shown in Fig. 5A and 5B respectively. Similarly, the performance evaluation
    of the proposed model on NIT Raipur crop dataset is depicted in Figs. 6A and 6B
    respectively. The experimental results show that the performance of our system
    is quite satisfactory for this automation task. The performance of this system
    may further improve with experience as new data will be collected. The user feedback
    will further fine-tune this system even if there are a few wrong suggestions.
    The experimental results clearly demonstrate that the SVM-based model outperforms
    other classification models on both datasets. Of the two datasets, the NIT Raipur
    crop dataset performs better, which may be due to the larger number of samples
    present in it. Figure 5: Performance evaluation of proposed model on our own collected

    future work In this work, a smart irrigation system prototype for efficient usage
    of water and minimal human intervention is proposed. The proposed recommendation
    system includes regression of soil and environmental attributes, which are further
    improved with the help of AC. Forecasted weather data are integrated with these
    predicted attributes to reduce the irrigation error. Finally, the classification
    model is used to categorize the combined set of attributes for the suggestion
    of irrigation is required or not. Based on these results, the system recommends
    the farmer for the next irrigation. If the farmer rejects the approval, then feedback
    is sent to the system. Further, it updates and fine-tunes the model subsequently.
    The experiment reveals that the SVM model outperforms other classification models
    on both datasets. As the ML-based models are data hungry, there is a strong intuition
    that the proposed system will perform even better with more samples. This system
    can be further extended to deciding on spraying appropriate chemicals for proper
    growth of crop. Supplemental Information Code and data. All the ML models have
    implemented using the Scikit-learn Python library. To validate the effectiveness
    of the system NIT Raipur and our own collected data have been used. DOI: 10.7717/peerj-cs.578/supp-1   Download

  description: The scarcity of clean water resources around the globe has generated
    a need for their optimum utilization. Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, based
    on the application specific sensors’ data acquisition and intelligent processing,
    are bridging the gaps between the cyber and physical worlds. IoT based smart irrigation
    management systems can help in achieving optimum water-resource utilization in
    the precision farming landscape. This paper presents an open-source technology
    based smart system to predict the irrigation requirements of a field using the
    sensing of ground parameter like soil moisture, soil temperature, and environmental
    conditions along with the weather forecast data from the Internet. The sensing
    nodes, involved in the ground and environmental sensing, consider soil moisture,
    soil temperature, air temperature, Ultraviolet (UV) light radiation, and relative
    humidity of the crop field. The intelligence of the proposed system is based on
    a smart algorithm, which considers sensed data along with the weather forecast
    parameters like precipitation, air temperature, humidity, and UV for the near
    future. The complete system has been developed and deployed on a pilot scale,
    where the sensor node data is wirelessly collected over the cloud using web-services
    and a web-based information visualization and decision support system provides
    the real-time information insights based on the analysis of sensors data and weather
    forecast data. The system has a provision for a closed-loop control of the water
    supply to realize a fully autonomous irrigation scheme. The paper describes the
    system and discusses in detail the information processing results of three weeks
    data based on the proposed algorithm. The system is fully functional and the prediction
    results are very encouraging.

    Water scarcity is already affecting a part of the world and the situation is getting
    worse over time due to the increasing world population and fresh water demands.
    The current world population is around 7.2 billion and it is expected to be more
    than 9 billion by 2050 (United Nations, 2013). The agriculture sector, particularly
    irrigation, consumes a major portion of the freshwater. Due to lack of cost-effective
    intelligent irrigation systems, developing countries are consuming more water
    in contrast to the developed countries for achieving the same yield. For example,
    India has approximately 4% of world’s freshwater resources to serve 17% of the
    world population; however, it takes 2–4 times more water for some of its major
    agri-produce in comparison to the other countries like China, USA (G. o. I. NITI
    Aayog, 2015). Therefore, there is a dire need to come up with advanced technologies
    based smart strategies and systems for effective utilization of fresh water. Gubbi
    et al. (2013) discussed an IoT framework with cloud centric storage, processing
    and analysis of the data received from ubiquitous sensors along with a decision
    support interface. Cruz et al. (2018) suggested a reference model for an IoT middleware
    platform that would support intelligent IoT applications. IoT based solutions
    are proving very helpful in many dimensions of the agricultural landscape (Sharma
    et al., 2016), and these intelligent solutions could also be fruitful in smart
    irrigation with optimum utilization of water. Soil moisture, precipitation, and
    evaporation are the essential parameters for designing a smart irrigation system.
    The precipitation and evaporation are important key factors, which influence the
    soil moisture. In geography and climatology, the wetness of soil is estimated
    by the proportion of annual (or monthly) precipitation and evaporation (Shang
    et al., 2007). Daily soil moisture can also be evaluated by the ratio of daily
    precipitation and evaporation in the above perspective. Precipitation is directly
    accessible in the routine weather reports; nonetheless, evaporation can be calculated
    using other metrological essentials. For evaporation, we use an empirical model
    given by Penman (Chen and Chen, 1993) (1) The entire evaporation depends on the
    thermodynamic evaporation and the dynamic evaporation , where depends upon the
    velocity of the land storm, air temperature, relative humidity of the air and
    UV radiation. To achieve water saving, irrigation system frameworks have been
    proposed based on various techniques, e.g., thermal imaging, Crop Water Stress
    Index (CWSI), direct soil water measurements, etc. Thermal imaging is a prominent
    technique for irrigation management and it is based on the shade temperature distribution
    of the plant. In this framework, the status of the water in the plant is checked
    over continuous intervals and irrigation is planned in view of the shade temperature
    distribution of the plant (Wang et al., 2010). In addition, CWSI based framework
    has been proposed for irrigation scheduling of the crops for efficient use of
    water. The observation of CWSI was first characterized more than 30 years ago
    (Idso et al., 1981). O’Shaughnessy and Evett (2010) proposed an automatic irrigation
    scheduling based on direct soil water measurement that utilizes water proficiently
    over manual irrigation system. Allen et al. (1998) suggested evapotranspiration
    (ET) based approach, which is an important parameter to decide crop irrigation
    needs influenced by climate parameters, e.g., solar radiation, relative humidity,
    temperature, wind velocity, and crop features such as phase of the crop growth,
    assortment and plant density, properties of soil, nuisance, and disease control.
    ET-based frameworks can save water up to 42% over time-based water irrigation
    scheduling (Davis and Dukes, 2010). Davis et al. (2009) conducted the investigations
    in Florida and verified that ET‐based watering scheduling controllers are more
    beneficial in term of cost, size and labor requirement for irrigation. ET-based
    irrigation system uses much less water as compared to scheduled practices. Viani
    et al. (2017) proposed a fuzzy logic-based decision support system based on farmer’s
    experience with the understanding of crop condition. This system provides more
    water saving over single-threshold and multi-threshold based irrigation scheduling.
    Gutiérrez et al. (2014) proposed an automated irrigation system using a wireless
    sensor network and GPRS module to save water in irrigation. In this system, a
    network of soil moisture sensors with controller has been installed in a crop
    field for real-time monitoring and irrigation control. Gill et al. (2006) suggested
    a method for soil moisture prediction using support vector machines based on air
    temperature, relative air humidity and soil temperature. Jaguey et al. (2015)
    developed irrigation sensor based on smart phone. For sensing soil moisture, the
    digital camera of smart phone is used to process RGB to gray for estimation of
    ratio between wet and dry area of soil. The ratio of wetness and dryness is transmitted
    via gateway to water motor controller. A Mobile Application (APP) is developed
    to control sensor activity (like wakeup) and to set sensor in sleep mode. Goldstein
    et al. (2017) proposed irrigation recommendations based on machine learning algorithm
    with support of agronomist’s encysted knowledge. It was found that the best regression
    model was Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT) with 93% accuracy in prediction
    of irrigation plan/recommendation. The developed model is helpful to the agronomist’s
    irrigation management. Roopaei et al. (2017) proposed an intelligent irrigation
    monitoring system based on thermal imaging. The proposed technique uses thermal
    imaging camera mounted on Drone. An algorithm is developed using images processing
    techniques for identification of water requirement, Leaf water potential, and
    non-uniform irrigation, which are used for irrigation monitoring. Majority of
    the earlier irrigation systems do not consider the weather forecasting information
    (e.g., precipitation) while making irrigation decisions. It leads to a wastage
    of fresh water, energy and loss of crop growth (due to excess water) when a rain
    is followed immediately by the watering of the crop. To handle such cases, IoT
    based solutions can provide a better decision support for irrigation by utilizing
    weather forecasting information (e.g., precipitation) from the Internet. Further,
    the accuracy of weather forecasting is improving due to the advancement of satellite
    imagery technology. For effective and optimum utilization of fresh water in irrigation,
    it becomes essential to develop the smart irrigation systems based on dynamic
    prediction of soil moisture pattern of the field and precipitation information
    of upcoming days. This paper presents an intelligent system that predicts soil
    moisture based on the information collected from the sensors deployed at the field
    and the weather forecast information available on the Internet. The field data
    has been collected through a self-designed sensor node. The server-side software
    has been developed with node side connectivity along with information visualization
    and decision support features. A novel algorithm has been developed for soil-moisture
    prediction, which is based on Machine Learning techniques applied on the sensor
    node data and the weather forecast data. The algorithm shows improved accuracy
    and less error. The proposed approach could help in making effective irrigation
    decisions with optimum water usage. 2. Methods/Techniques used Prediction of soil
    moisture is vital for effective irrigation management system. The estimation of
    soil moisture depends upon evapotranspiration Hargreaves and Samani (1985) developed
    a method based on temperature and extra-terrestrial radiation to estimate ET0.
    It is expressed as (2) where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Tmax
    and Tmin = maximum temperature and minimum temperature (°C) and Ra = extra-terrestrial
    radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). Ritchie developed another method for estimation of ET0
    (Jones and Ritchie, 1990) based on temperature and solar radiation. It is expressed
    as (3) where ET0 = reference evapotranspiration (mm/day); Tmax and Tmin = maximum
    and minimum temperature (°C) and Rs = solar radiation (MJ m−2 day−1). When (4)
    Cobaner (2011) developed evapotranspiration estimation method based on Neuro-Fuzzy
    (NF) inference and found that the NF model (based on solar radiation, air temperature,
    and relative humidity) exhibits better accuracy than the combination of solar
    radiation, air temperature and wind speed. From state of art, it has been analyzed
    that prediction of soil moisture is possible using sensors placement at the field
    and weather forecasted data. So, we have considered evaporation of soil moisture
    based on air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, and radiation.
    The parameters are considered for analyzing the soil moisture drain (change/difference)
    pattern based on the recorded data of soil moisture. An IoT based architecture
    (Fig. 1) has been proposed to collect, transmit and process the physical parameters
    (soil moisture, air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, and
    radiation) of farming land along with the weather forecast information to manage
    the irrigation efficiently. Download : Download high-res image (307KB) Download

    based on a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques
    (block diagram shown in Fig. 3 and pseudocode is discussed in Section 3.2.1) has
    been developed using Support Vector Regression (SVR) and k-means clustering for
    estimation of difference/change in soil moisture due to weather conditions. It
    gives good accuracy and less Mean Squared Error (MSE) (Theobald, 1974; “Mean Squared
    Error, 2018’’) in the prediction of the soil moisture of upcoming days with the
    help of sensors data and the weather forecasting data. SVR model has been trained
    using data (air temperature, air relative humidity, soil temperature, radiation,
    and soil moisture difference) collected from field device shown in Fig. 2. The
    Soil Moisture Differences (SMD) of upcoming days have been predicted using trained
    SVR model and the predicted value of SMD is given as input for k-means clustering
    for improving the accuracy of soil moisture difference (centroid value of k-means),
    which is more accurate (Table 2) with less MSE (Table 3). The final predicted
    soil moisture (Table 4) has been used in the development of smart irrigation scheduling
    algorithm (Section 3.2.2) to efficiently utilize the natural rain (precipitation)
    information for effective irrigation. To visualize the predicted soil moisture
    of upcoming days along with precipitation information and to control (start and
    stop) the irrigation, a responsive web portal has also been developed (Fig. 4,
    Fig. 5). Download : Download high-res image (250KB) Download : Download full-size

    Planning Module. Support Vector Regression (SVR) (Drucker et al., 1997) is the
    modified version of Support Vector Machine (SVM) (Hearst et al., 1998), where
    the dependent variable is numerical in lieu of categorical. SVR is a non-parametric
    technique and allows the creation of nonlinear models. The SVR method utilizes
    kernel functions to generate the model. Some of the frequently used kernel functions
    are Polynomial, Linear, Radial Basis and Sigmodal. k-means clustering (Kanungo
    et al., 2002) takes a straightforward and simple methodology to group a given
    information set into a definite number of clusters. The objective is to find k
    centroids, one for each bunch. First, it divides n number of the objects into
    k non-empty subgroups/cluster, and then finds the cluster centroids (mean point)
    of every subgroup/cluster. Then it calculates the distances from every point to
    the centroids and allocate each object to a specific cluster where the distance
    is minimum from the centroid. The process iterates to re-assign the points and
    identify the centroid of the new clusters. 3. The proposed system 3.1. System
    architecture The architecture of proposed IoT based smart irrigation system is
    shown in Fig. 1. It has seven main components, viz., Field data collection device
    with relay switch (Standalone and WSN Scenario); Web service for collecting field
    sensor data; Web service for collecting weather information available online (Internet);
    Web service to control water motor; Soil moisture prediction algorithm; Responsive
    web based interface for real-time monitoring; IoT enabled motor pump. These components
    are grouped into three different layers, i.e. Data collection and transmission
    layer, Data processing & intelligence layer and application layer of IoT (Fig.
    1). These components are discussed in the following sections. 3.1.1. Field data
    collection device Depending on the field requirements, a standalone sensor node
    or a wireless sensor network of the sensor nodes may be deployed. In standalone
    scenario field data collection device consists of four sensors, viz., VH-400 Soil
    Moisture sensor, Soil temperature sensor, DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor,
    and Ultraviolet (UV) Light Radiation sensor based on GUVA-S12SD and SGM8521 Op
    Amp. The output of these sensors is read by an Arduino-Uno, which is connected
    to Raspberry Pi (R-Pi). In R-Pi a program is written in Python language to hourly
    fetch the data from sensors and to store the data in SQLite database, which is
    synched with the server database using developed web service. For large farming
    area, a Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) (Ojha et al., 2015) scenario with ZigBee
    (Pandey et al., 2017, Gutiérrez et al., 2014) technology can be implemented in
    which multiple sensor nodes can be planted in the specified area. Each sensor
    node will consist of the sensors similar to the standalone device. The output
    of these sensors is read by an Arduino-Uno connected to ZigBee for sending data
    to Gateway Node (similar to the standalone device with ZigBee connectivity) that
    will aggregate the received data and store it locally in SQLite and also send
    the data to the server using web service. The current analysis (statistical analysis
    of predicted soil moisture and its accuracy is exhibited in Fig. 6, Table 3, Table
    5) has been done with the standalone device. The standalone device is shown in
    Fig. 2. Table 5. Comparison of correlation, R squared and MSE between soil moisture
    values based on the sensor data and the proposed algorithm. Parameter Predicted

    Fig. 6. Graphical representation of the results shown in Table 2. 3.1.2. Web service
    for field sensor data collection The Web service is written in PHP with a light
    weighted REST API to communicate the data between the field device and the server.
    The service is hosted on Apache (Web server) at server machine. The R-Pi sends
    the field data to the server using this web service. This web service can handle
    the network fluctuation/outage during synchronizing the data from the filed device
    to the server with the help of flag settings at the database level. 3.1.3. Web
    service for online weather data collection A web service has been developed in
    Python to collect the weather forecasting data. This web service also aggregates
    the weather forecasting data like temperature, humidity, cloudiness, UV Index
    and precipitation of different web forecasting portal like OpenWeather and AccuWeather
    using API of these portal (Weather API, 2012, API Reference, 2017). These portals
    provide the forecasted information in JSON, XML, or HTML format. The developed
    web service read the forecasted data (JSON format) of the specified location using
    API and store it in MySQL database at the server, which is considered in the prediction
    algorithm. 3.1.4. Soil moisture prediction algorithm An algorithm has been developed
    (Fig. 3) to predict the soil moisture based on field sensors data and weather
    forecasting data using support vector regression model and k-means clustering
    algorithm. The algorithm shows information regarding soil moisture of the upcoming
    days. It also provides irrigation suggestions, based on the defined level of soil
    moisture and predicted precipitation, to save water and energy. The generated
    information by algorithm and device is stored in MySQL Database at the server.
    The algorithm is discussed in detail in Section 3.2. 3.1.5. Responsive web based
    interface for real-time monitoring A responsive web based user interface is developed
    using PHP, MySQL and Bootstrap API for real-time monitoring and scheduling of
    irrigation activities (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). The interface visualizes real-time sensors
    data, predicted soil moisture of upcoming days, and precipitation information.
    Further, it also provides a facility for irrigation scheduling. The user can schedule
    the irrigation at a specified threshold value of soil moisture. The system guides
    to maintain the threshold value based on the predicted pattern of soil moisture
    and precipitation information. The system can automatically start the irrigation,
    which stops after achieving the specified threshold value of soil moisture. 3.1.6.
    Web service to control water motor A web service has been developed on top of
    HTTP protocol to start and stop the water motor. This web service has been accessed
    by Python code in R-Pi to start and stop the water motor. The Python code (running
    on R-Pi) send signal to Arduino-Uno that controls the relay switch to start/stop
    the water motor. 3.1.7. IoT enabled water pump In this module, a water pump is
    connected to a relay switch that is controlled by a Wi-Fi enabled node. The node
    is controlled by the web service through a trigger from the responsive web based
    interface for real-time monitoring. Using this web based interface the water pump
    can be managed remotely in manual and auto modes. 3.1.8. Communication technologies
    used in proposed architecture In the proposed architecture, the WiFi module/Mobile
    data communication module can be used as communication media between the field
    device and the server. In this experiment (Standalone device scenario), a WiFi
    module has been used to send the data to the server. In WSN scenario, ZigBee network
    can be used between sensor node to Gateway Node and then a WiFi module or Mobile
    data communication module can be used to send the data from the gateway node to
    the server. 3.2. Prediction algorithm and data visualization Flow diagram of the
    proposed soil moisture prediction algorithm and the irrigation planning algorithm
    for data visualization and decision support is shown in Fig. 3. 3.2.1. Algorithm
    for soil moisture prediction Algorithm Steps (Variables as in Table 1.) • Initialize

    2 …n } • Output (NPSMD0, NPSMD1, NPSMD2, …., NPSMDn) 3.2.2. Algorithm of irrigation
    scheduling Algorithm Steps Step 1. Initialize minimum threshold (THmin) of soil
    moisture to start irrigation and maximum threshold (THmax) of soil moisture to
    stop irrigation Step2. Set mode (manual/auto) for irrigation Step 3. If (mode = auto)  {   Read
    and check current soil moisture (Csm)   If (Csm <= THmin) // condition check of
    current soil moisture from its set threshold value by user   {    Ndate = Read
    precipitation information of upcoming days and select nearest date of precipitation.    Calculate
    required soil moisture (Rsm) = sum (predicted SMD from current date to nearest
    date of precipitation (Ndate)) //Total change in soil moisture till nearest precipitation
    date    Set THmax = minimum ((THmin + Rsm), THmax) // selection of minimum soil-
    moisture required to maintain crop growth    while (THmax > Csm) // condition

    1 to relay to start irrigation //Signal to Start Water motor    }    Send 0 to
    relay to stop irrigation //Signal to stop the water motor  } Else   {    Send
    0 to relay to stop irrigation //Signal to stop the water motor   }  } Else  {   Enter/Set
    date to start irrigation    If (current_date >= irrigation_date) // condition
    to start the irrigation at specify date    {     while (THmax > Csm)     {      Send
    1 to relay to start irrigation //Signal to start the water motor     }    }    Else    {     Send
    0 to stop irrigation //Signal to stop the water motor    }  } 3.2.3. Experimental
    setup The main objective of this experiment is to collect the physical parameters
    of a farming land using sensors and to utilize these sensors’ data along with
    weather forecast information for developing an algorithm for prediction of soil
    moisture of the upcoming days. The algorithm uses a hybrid machine learning approach,
    as discussed in Section 3.2, to achieve higher accuracy in soil moisture prediction.
    It provides a probable estimate of soil moisture to plan and provision the optimum
    irrigation. Statistical measures, R squared (Table 5) and Mean Squared Error (Table
    3, Table 5), are used for estimation of accuracy and error rate of the proposed
    algorithm. The experiment shows that a good estimation (close to the actual value)
    of the soil moisture (Table 4), with the help of field data and forecasted information,
    can be utilized for optimum irrigation with an effective utilization of natural
    rain. As described in Section 3.1, one field data collection device (node) has
    been deployed in the garden of our organization to collect the field data (Fig.
    2). The data is collected at the server using the web services. Then, the data
    is analyzed using the proposed machine learning approach (Section 3.2.1). Further,
    a responsive web based interface has been developed for real-time monitoring,
    data visualization and decision support system, and for the scheduling of irrigation.
    Fig. 4 shows the GUI of responsive web based interface for real-time monitoring
    and decision support system, which shows the current soil moisture recorded by
    the sensor, and the predicted soil moisture generated by the algorithm. This information,
    predicted soil moisture and precipitation information, will help user/farmer in
    planning/scheduling of optimum irrigation. Fig. 5 shows the GUI of irrigation
    planning module to schedule the irrigation by setting Irrigation Date, and Threshold
    Levels for Soil Moisture. It works in two modes, viz., auto, and manual, as discussed
    in Section 3.2.2. In manual mode, the user takes the scheduling decision based
    on predicted soil moisture and precipitation information. In auto mode, user sets
    the Soil Moisture Threshold levels, and the system automatically schedules the
    irrigation date based on the predicted soil moisture and weather forecast (precipitation)
    information. For example, if rain is expected on the scheduled irrigation date
    or near to scheduled date, then the system will wait for the rain and it will
    suspend the artificial/manual irrigation or it will start watering (if needed,
    based on the algorithm) the field to maintain minimum soil moisture till the arrival
    of rain. Further, the system can handle the changes in forecasted precipitation
    values. 4. Results and discussion The smartness of the proposed system is dependent
    on the accuracy of the predicted soil moisture (Table 4, Table 5). To verify the
    accuracy of soil moisture prediction algorithm, the hourly field data for air
    temperature, air humidity, soil moisture, soil temperature, and UV is collected
    for three weeks. The three weeks’ hourly data has been averaged out on per day
    basis and the 21 days’ data is divided into a training set (70% of the data) and
    testing set (30% of the data) for applying the proposed algorithm. Initially,
    we have predicted SMD of upcoming days using the proposed algorithm (Fig. 3) and
    the predicted values of SMD has been used in prediction of soil moisture of upcoming
    days. The results are summarized in Table 2, Table 3, Table 4, Table 5. The SVR + k-means
    approach has higher accuracy with lower mean squared error over SVR approach while
    calculating SMD (Table 2 and Table 3). The graph (Fig. 6) shows that predicted
    SMD using proposed algorithm (SVR + k-means) is nearer to actual SMD as compared
    to predicted SMD using SVR only. The SVR + k-means approach has the same accuracy
    with the lower mean squared error over SVR approach in soil moisture prediction
    (Tables 4 and 5). The predicted soil moisture shown in Table 4 has been calculated
    based on soil moisture and SMD of previous day, e.g. soil moisture on 14-11-2017
    is 26.8982 then the soil moisture of the next day (15-11-2017) will be equal to
    the difference of soil moisture on the previous day (i.e., 14–11-2017) and SMD
    difference predicted for 15-11-2017 (Table 2). From the Tables 2 and 3, we have
    observed that the prediction of SMD using SVR + k-means approach gives higher
    accuracy with less MSE as compared to SVR approach, and we have also observed
    the same accuracy (R squared = 96%) with lesser MSE in prediction of soil moisture
    using combined approach (SVR + k-means) (Table 5). It shows that the proposed
    algorithm (based on SVR + k-means) is better as compared to SVR based approach.
    Due to higher accuracy and minimum MSE, SVR + k-means based hybrid machine learning
    algorithm has been used in irrigation planning module. 5. Conclusion The soil
    moisture is a critical parameter for developing a smart irrigation system. The
    soil moisture is affected by a number of environmental variables, e.g., air temperature,
    air humidity, UV, soil temperature, etc. With advancement in technologies, the
    weather forecasting accuracy has improved significantly and the weather forecasted
    data can be used for prediction of changes in the soil moisture. This paper proposes
    an IoT based smart irrigation architecture along with a hybrid machine learning
    based approach to predict the soil moisture. The proposed algorithm uses sensors’
    data of recent past and the weather forecasted data for prediction of soil moisture
    of upcoming days. The predicted value of the soil moisture is better in terms
    of their accuracy and error rate. Further, the prediction approach is integrated
    into a standalone system prototype. The system prototype is cost effective, as
    it is based on the open standard technologies. The auto mode makes it a smart
    system and it can be further customized for application specific scenarios. In
    future, we are planning to conduct a water saving analysis based on proposed algorithm
    with multiple nodes along with minimizing the system cost. Acknowledgements Authors

    References Citations Keywords Metrics Abstract: Big Data (BD), Machine Learning
    (ML) and Internet of Things (IoT) are expected to have a large impact on Smart
    Farming and involve the whole supply chain, particularly for rice production.
    The increasing amount and variety of data captured and obtained by these emerging
    technologies in IoT offer the rice smart farming strategy new abilities to predict
    changes and identify opportunities. The quality of data collected from sensors
    greatly influences the performance of the modelling processes using ML algorithms.
    These three elements (e.g., BD, ML and IoT) have been used tremendously to improve
    all areas of rice production processes in agriculture, which transform traditional
    rice farming practices into a new era of rice smart farming or rice precision
    agriculture. In this paper, we perform a survey of the latest research on intelligent
    data processing technology applied in agriculture, particularly in rice production.
    We describe the data captured and elaborate role of machine learning algorithms
    in paddy rice smart agriculture, by analyzing the applications of machine learning
    in various scenarios, smart irrigation for paddy rice, predicting paddy rice yield
    estimation, monitoring paddy rice growth, monitoring paddy rice disease, assessing
    quality of paddy rice and paddy rice sample classification. This paper also presents
    a framework that maps the activities defined in rice smart farming, data used
    in data modelling and machine learning algorithms used for each activity defined
    in the production and post-production phases of paddy rice. Based on the proposed
    mapping framework, our conclusion is that an efficient and effective integration
    of all these three technologies is very crucial that transform traditional rice
    cultivation practices into a new perspective of intelligence in rice precision
    agriculture. Finally, this paper also summarizes all the challenges and technological
    trends towards the exploitation of multiple sources in the era of big data in
    agriculture... (Show More) A Big Data-ML-Task applications framework has been

    global population of 7.8 billion (2020) persons is expected to reach 9.7 billion
    by 2050 [1]. It is expected that the world would require 70% more food than what
    available at the moment with less natural resources like land and water due to
    urbanization, soil erosion, climatic changes, water shortages and excessive use
    by livestock. It is estimated that there is about 33% wastage of agriculture production
    due to poor logistics and storage [2]–[4]. As result, the key for coping strategies
    in the contexts of climate change and food security is to implement precision
    agricultural or smart farming. Precision agriculture is a technology-enabled approach
    to farming management that observes, measures, and analyzes the needs of individual
    fields and crops [5]. Smart farming is defined as the application of information
    and data technologies for optimizing complex farming systems. It focuses on how
    the collected agriculture related information can be used in a smart way, rather
    than the storage of data, access to data and the application of these agriculture
    data. Big data and machine learning algorithms are two main important components
    in paddy rice smart farming. Big Data can be defined as a data that can be described
    using three key concepts: volume, velocity, and variety. Volume refers to size
    of the data, variety refers to the various types of data (e.g., text, numbers,
    images, videos and audios) and Velocity refers to the increasing speed at which
    big data is created (e.g., live stream data). Machine learning focuses on the
    development of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
    Applying smart farming technologies will definitely assist farmers in various
    tasks to increase crop productions. In order to narrow down the scope of this
    paper, we focus on paddy rice smart farming as rice is an increasingly important
    staple food in Asia Pacific region and other parts of the world. The changes over
    time in land use and soil salinity levels have significant impact on the production
    of rice yields [6]. In addition to that, unpredictable weather conditions and
    inefficient techniques to predict weather conditions are amongst the few factors
    that reduce rice yields production [7], [8]. For instance, most farmers in Myanmar
    face heavy rains during the rice growing season and that crop damage and yield
    losses due to heavy rains cause extensive losses among farmers [9]. As a result,
    the ability to predict weather or climate trends and environmental factors (e.g.,
    soil nutrient) is very important in enhancing paddy farmers’ productivity [7].
    The current practices, which heavily rely on fertilizers and pesticides to increase
    productivity are not supporting the sustainable rice yields production because
    these activities are not environmentally friendly farming systems [10]. In addition
    to that, the timing for rice yields harvesting also influences the production
    of rice yields as the best timing for paddy harvesting showed a linear relationship
    with grain loss [11]. As a result, monitoring the growth of paddy is very crucial
    to sustain rice yields production. Rice production in coastal areas is frequently
    affected by typhoons. The lack of ability to manage impacts from natural events
    and disasters that include contamination of water bodies, loss of harvest, and
    destruction of irrigation systems and other agricultural infrastructure is another
    shortcoming that requires attention [12], [13]. With smart farming, the application
    of data mining and analytical techniques designed so far for prediction, detection
    and development of appropriate disaster management strategy based on the collected
    data from disasters can be used to manage these impacts and consequently support
    agriculture or farming activities with more effectively and efficiently. Variation
    within farms and region based on resource endowments, location topography and
    farmers circumstances make it difficult to apply the same strategy in maximizing
    rice yields productivity. Towards the end of the twentieth century, precision
    agriculture began to be utilized that applies information technologies to capture
    and integrate data from multiple sources (e.g., farmers, sensors) in order to
    have a more robust strategy associated with crop management and thus can be used
    to maximize agriculture productivity [14]. Unsustainable rice yields production
    [6], inefficient techniques to predict weather conditions, lack of ability to
    manage calamities [7], [8], [12], variation within farms and region [14] and poor
    logistics and storage [2]–[4] are among the reasons why smart farming should be
    adopted to sustain and optimize rice yields productivity. In this paper, we conduct
    a systematic literature review (SLR) of the latest research on intelligent data
    processing technology involved in rice smart farming focusing on the rice production
    and post-production phases of the agriculture supply chain. We describe the main
    datasets or features extracted for data modelling. We then elaborate role of machine
    learning algorithms in smart agriculture, by analyzing the applications of machine
    learning in various scenarios in the rice production and post-production phases
    of the agriculture supply chain. This paper also presents a framework that maps
    the activities defined in rice smart farming, datasets or features used in data
    modelling and machine learning algorithms used to analyze these features for each
    activity defined in the early stage of agriculture supply chain. The remainder
    of this article is organized as follows. Section II provides the literature review
    of the most recent reviews conducted related to smart farming. Section 3 describes
    the existing frameworks related to agriculture supply chain. Section 4 provides
    an in-depth analysis of the type of big data used in rice smart farming agriculture
    focusing on the variety of sources used, the variety of machine learning algorithms
    used and finally the variety tasks involved in the rice production and post-production
    phases of smart farming. The research work presented in this section is classified
    based on the sources and types of data that are used, the types of tasks involve
    in smart farming and also the type of machine learning algorithms used to model
    these data. Section 5 presents a framework that maps the activities defined in
    smart farming, datasets or features used in data modelling and machine learning
    algorithms used to analyze these features for each activity defined in the early
    stage of agriculture supply chain. Finally, Section 6 concludes this paper and
    presents challenges and technological trends towards the exploitation of multiple
    sources in the era of big data in agriculture. SECTION II. Literature Review A
    survey has been conducted to look into the global coverage in terms of innovation
    related to smart farming and the usage of machine learning in smart farming. The
    survey was conducted by using two methods; looking at the trends of number of
    scholarly works over time related to Smart Farming, Machine Learning in Smart
    Agriculture, Artificial Intelligence in Smart Agriculture and Internet of Things
    in Smart Agriculture, and reviewing all review studies that were conducted on
    several elements of I4.0 and its applications in smart farming for improving the
    productivity. Firstly, the trends of number of scholarly works over time related
    to Smart Farming, Machine Learning in Smart Agriculture, Artificial Intelligence
    in Smart Agriculture and Internet of Things in Smart Agriculture, can be obtained
    by using the Lens website (https://www.lens.org). Lens provides open datasets
    of patent documents, scholarly research works and any inventions related to machine
    learning, artificial intelligence, internet of things and smart farming disclosed
    in patents [15]. The Lens serves global patent and scholarly knowledge as a public
    resource to make science- and technology-enabled problem solving more effective,
    efficient and inclusive. This knowledge may help show ways forward such as new
    or repurposed ideas and inventions, better strategies and targeted partnerships
    for collective action. Based on these four keywords used in searching for trends
    in smart farming research, the usage of Machine Learning (ML) in smart farming,
    the usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart farming and the usage of Internet
    of Things (IoT) in smart farming, Fig. 1 through Fig. 4 display the increasing
    trends of number of scholarly works over time related to these keywords. For instance,
    based on these Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, several scholarly works have
    been filed and recorded and the number of scholarly works filed has increased
    between the year of 2018 and 2019. FIGURE 1. The trends of scholarly works over
    time related to Smart Farming. Show All FIGURE 2. The trends of scholarly works
    over time related to Machine Learning in Smart Farming. Show All FIGURE 3. The
    trends of scholarly works over time related to Artificial Intelligence in Smart
    Farming. Show All FIGURE 4. The trends of scholarly works over time related to
    Internet of Things in Smart Farming. Show All Secondly, in the past, few review
    studies were conducted on several elements of I4.0 and its applications in smart
    farming for improving the productivity in agriculture sectors as mentioned in
    Table 1. These studies have focused on I4.0 applications in the smart farming
    covering specific aspects like Internet of Things, Cloud Computing and Big Data
    Analytics (Machine Learning). Table 1 shows several reviews that were conducted
    recently that are related to smart farming or precision agriculture. Several reviews
    conducted were focusing on the application of machine learning algorithms in smart
    farming [16], [17]. For instance, Sharma et al. investigated the current state
    of research on machine learning (ML) applications in Agriculture Supply Chain
    (ASC) that includes the application of ML in four different phases in ASC; pre-production,
    production, processing and distribution [16]. It was concluded that all three
    ML algorithms can be leveraged to develop a sustainable ASC. A Machine Learning-Agriculture
    Supply Chain performance framework was introduced in which the machine learning
    algorithms are mapped into all four different phases in ASC based on the type
    of data used. However, these data are not explained and categorized comprehensively.
    TABLE 1 Review Papers: Elements of I4.0 and its Applications in Smart Farming
    Mekonnen et al. conducted a review on the application of various machine learning
    methods in analyzing data captured from sensors within the agricultural ecosystem
    [17]. In this review, a limited number of machine learning algorithms is listed
    based on the data that are captured using different types of Wireless Sensor Networks
    (WSN) (e.g., ZigBee WSN, GSM and GPS WSN, LoRa WSN, Wifi and MQTT Sensor based
    with Raspberry pi and Arduino) and also remotely sensed data (multispectral or
    hyperspectral data) and vegetation indices. Based on the trend obtained from this
    review, there will be an increased use of more advanced techniques like distributed
    (or edge) deep learning. Several reviews also conducted focusing on the application
    of deep learning algorithms only in smart farming [18]–[21]. One of the findings
    from these reviews is that the deep learning algorithms are proven to be better
    in providing high accuracy results compared with other machine learning algorithms
    in terms of accuracy when applied to various agricultural problems, such as disease
    detection and identification, fruit or plants classification and fruit counting
    among other domains. The evolution of agriculture systems involves the adoption
    of incoming data from various sources [27] and also the application of big data
    applications in smart farming [26]. Together these big data technologies and the
    capability of machine learning algorithms in forecasting certain outcomes will
    cause major changes in the scope and organization of smart farming [16], [17],
    [26]. Lytos et al. conducted a survey paper that covers the state-of-the-art big
    data architectures and agriculture systems in order to bridge the knowledge gap
    between agriculture systems and exploitation of big data. However, in this review,
    the authors list out the name of the databases and features used in the agriculture
    systems only without outlining how these data are processed or analyzed. The quality
    and type of dataset collected from sensors greatly influence the performance of
    the forecasting algorithm in predicting the crop yields. For instance, in optimizing
    the performance of forecasting crop yields, Fabrizio Balducci et al. have investigated
    the performance of several machine learning algorithms based on different subsets
    of features extracted from the environmental sensors [29]. There are quite a number
    of reviews conducted related to Internet of Things (IoT) technologies [38]. The
    emergence of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies has also improved the performance
    of a real-time monitoring of the data related to smart farming [20]. IoT are mainly
    used in monitoring crop, soil and weather, forecasting disease and crop yields,
    controlling irrigation machinery and autonomous vehicles and robots [22]. Based
    on several reviews, it can be concluded that incorporating precision livestock
    farming technologies (Sensors), big data analytics, and the IoT in smart farming
    practices puts forth a possible solution to assist us to improve agriculture productivity
    and meet projected global agricultural product demands [23]–[25], [28]. The increasing
    amount and variety of data captured and obtained by these emerging technologies
    in IoT offer the smart farming strategy new abilities to predict changes and identify
    opportunities. However, to the best of our knowledge, no such studies are conducted
    to review comprehensively the present mapping of datasets or features and machine
    learning algorithms based on different types of tasks involved in the paddy rice
    production and post-production phases of the ASC. There are several related works
    conducted about the applications of machine learning on the paddy rice smart farming.
    Several researches have been conducted that apply machine learning algorithm (e.g.,
    Support Vector Machine (SVM) [46], [98], [127], Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
    [94], [95], and hybrid approaches [103], [124]) in paddy rice sample recognition
    and classification using high-resolution images. Remotely sensed, vegetation indices
    and climate data are commonly used to predict paddy rice yield estimation [34],
    [35], [48], [76], [77], [109] and to monitor paddy rice growth [63], [73], [84]
    using artificial neural networks and its variants and also linear regression approaches.
    In addition to that, hyperspectral and high-resolution images have been used to
    accurately and affectively monitor paddy rice disease [40], [41], [87], [88],
    [118] and assessing quality of paddy rice [93], [104], [105] by using deep learning
    algorithms. In this paper, we will present a framework that maps three elements
    which include a) Paddy rice production and post-production activities defined
    in the ASC, b) datasets or features related to agriculture components captured
    from sensors, and c) machine learning algorithms used to analyze these features
    for each activities defined in the early stage of ASC. This is done by Identifying
    the phases and tasks involved in the paddy rice smart farming that require intelligent
    data processing technologies. Describing the main datasets or features captured
    and used by intelligent data processing technologies in each task identified in
    the paddy rice smart farming. Elaborating the roles of machine learning technology
    in paddy rice smart agriculture, by analyzing the applications of machine learning
    in various tasks and phases in the paddy rice smart farming. SECTION III. Phases
    and Tasks in Paddy Rice Smart Farming This paper focuses on the smart farming
    technologies used in paddy growth and production. This section elaborates the
    selected phases and tasks involved in the paddy rice smart farming [16]. The applications
    of machine learning algorithms and smart technologies in the agriculture supply
    chain can be divided into 4 phases and include pre-production, production, post-production
    and finally distribution phases [16], [30], [31]. However, in this work, we focus
    on several tasks that require intelligent data processing technologies that can
    be fully utilized to improve the production of paddy rice. Thus, this review focuses
    on the rice production and post-production phases. In the rice production phase,
    several activities are conducted sequentially such as planting, managing water,
    monitoring soil fertility, managing weed and finally managing pests and diseases.
    Then, in the rice post-production phase, the activities can be divided into harvesting,
    drying, storage and milling and processing. Based on these phases and tasks, we
    will look into the features or datasets that are applied by machine learning algorithms
    in this rice production processes. The SLR framework used for presenting the review
    findings is presented in Fig. 5. Fig. 5 highlights two main categories which are
    the paddy growing activities and the smart farming activities associated with
    the paddy growing activities. The paddy growing activities can be divided into
    production and post-production phases. The first step in rice production phase
    is planting. Rice crops can either be direct seeded or transplanted. Next, ensuring
    the rice plant to get adequate water is very important since rice is extremely
    sensitive to water shortages. Managing good practices for smart paddy irrigation
    is very critical to maximize water efficiency and yield. Smart irrigation for
    paddy rice deals with maintaining a predetermined water height in paddy fields
    automatically based on the growth stages of the paddy rice [32], [33]. Managing
    weeds is crucial to reduce the amount of weed pressure in the field. Next, monitoring
    soil fertility is also very essential to optimize the growth of a rice plant.
    At the same time, timely and accurate diagnosis of paddy diseases and managing
    pests are highly required to reduce loses. Monitoring paddy rice disease involves
    activities such as detection and recognition of diseases from paddy plant leaf
    images [37], [39] or classifying, detecting, and predicting infestation patterns
    of the Brown Planthopper in rice paddies [40], [41]. Generally, monitoring the
    growth of paddy rice involves analyzing the growth of paddy rice based on climate
    data or remotely sensed data and vegetation indices. This also includes developing
    an approach for mapping rice-growing areas at field level using phenology-based
    rice crop classification or paddy growth stages classification [34]–[36]. Predicting
    paddy rice yield estimation involves tasks such as yield assessment of paddy fields
    using machine learning algorithms [42] or mapping rice planted area using the
    hyperspectral data or remotely sensed data and vegetation indices [43]. FIGURE
    5. Rice production and post-production phases in paddy rice smart farming. Show
    All In the rice post-production phase, paddy harvesting activities include reaping,
    stacking, handling, threshing, cleaning, and hauling. Harvesting paddy should
    be performed efficiently as the speed of paddy harvesting showed a linear relationship
    with grain loss [11]. When rice is harvested, it will contain up to 25% moisture.
    High moisture level during storage can lead to grain discoloration, encourage
    development of molds, and increase the likelihood of attack from pests. It can
    also decrease the germination rate of the rice seed. Assessing the quality of
    paddy rice can be performed by using any machine learning algorithms. Assessing
    the quality of paddy rice usually involves activities such as assessing the quality
    of the rice [44] or investigating the impact of climate change on paddy rice production
    [45]. Next, drying process will involve the process of drying paddy by using traditional
    or mechanical systems. It is important to dry rice grain as soon as possible after
    harvesting (ideally within 24 hours). After that, these dried rice grain will
    be stored to prevent grain loss caused by adverse weather, moisture, rodents,
    birds, insects and micro-organisms like fungi. Finally, the last activity in the
    post-production phase is the milling process which remove the husk and the bran
    layers, and produce an edible, white rice. Paddy rice sample recognition and classification
    can be applied to perform the milling process. In paddy rice sample recognition
    and classification, the main task is to separate and classify objects of rice
    sample based on color and texture features with the help of image processing and
    machine learning techniques [46], [47]. SECTION IV. Application of Big Data and
    Machine Learning in Rice Production Tasks A. Big Data Used in Rice Production
    Tasks Data that are commonly used in paddy rice smart farming can be categorized
    into sensor data, remotely sensed data and vegetation indices, drone based data
    and finally paddy rice leaf analysis data. Table 2 tabulates the types of data
    and features used in paddy rice smart farming according to the smart farming activities
    described in Fig. 5. TABLE 2 Types of Data and Features Used in Paddy Rice Smart
    Farming TABLE 3 Applications of Smart Technologies (e.g., Internet of Things (IoT))
    in Various Scenarios in the Paddy Rice Pre-Production and Production Phases of
    the ASC 1) Sensor Data Firstly, the typical types of sensor data captured that
    can be used in monitoring paddy rice growth or yield estimation of paddy rice
    are data related to meteorological. Meteorological data (or climate data) can
    be used to monitor paddy rice growth [45], [48] and disease [41]. For instance,
    Guruprasad et al. conducted a yield estimation modeling paddy crop at different
    spatial resolution (SR) levels based on weather and soil data as input features.
    These features include day and night temperature (min, max, mean), diffused irradiance,
    precipitation (cumulative), relative humidity, wind speed, rainfall, pH, soil
    moisture and temperature (0-40cm) [48]. It was observed that the disease incidence
    on paddy rice growth is also directly affected by the level of temperature, wetness
    duration [50], [51]. Paddy rice production is also affected by the level of precipitation.
    For instance, the paddy rice production was found to be affected by the decreasing
    post-monsoon precipitation as this time coincides with the sensitivity of the
    paddy fruiting and ripening stages [54]. Besides that, winds may also affect the
    growth and production of paddy rice plants as strong winds are very detrimental
    to the growth and production of rice plants, especially when they occur during
    the flowering and ripening phases of rice [49]. Rainfall was found to be the main
    climate driver of the paddy rice yield [111]. The suitable soil pH for rice cultivation
    is at pH 6.0 [52] or 6.25 [53]. Analyzing the nitrogen level of paddy rice can
    also be used to assess the quality of paddy rice [105]. 2) Remotely Sensed Data
    and Vegetation Indices Secondly, remote sensing data or remotely sensed data and
    vegetation indices can be used in different ways in estimating paddy yield, monitoring
    paddy growth and diseases. Many studies are based on the mapping of rice-growing
    are [35], [43] [57], mapping cropping patterns [57]–[59], mapping paddy vulnerability
    to flooding [58]. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) sensors
    have a total of 36 spectral bands and seven of them are related to vegetation
    and land surfaces that include several ranges [60]. Seven of the most used spectral
    bands includes Red (620–670 nm) - Band 1 Near Infrared One (NIR1) (841–875 nm)
    - Band 2 Blue (459–479 nm) - Band 3 Green (545–565 nm) - Band 4 Near Infrared
    Two (NIR2) (1230–1250 nm) - Band 5 Shortwave Infrared One (SWIR1) (1628–1652 nm)
    - Band 6 Shortwave Infrared Two (SWIR2) (2105–2155 nm) - Band 7 Based on these
    spectral bands, several measurements can be derived and computed such as Land
    Surface Water Index (LSWI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Normalized Difference
    Vegetation Index (NDVI), Modified Normalized Difference Water Index (MNDWI), Leaf
    Area Index (LAI) (see Table 2). LSWI is sensitive to the total amount of liquid
    water in vegetation and its soil background. LSWI was developed by considering
    two bands of the shortwave infrared (SWIR) and the NIR regions of the electromagnetic
    spectrum to compute the estimation of water content of the land surface [61].
    LSWI is computed based on Eq. 1; LSWI= ρNIR−ρSWIR1 ρNIR+ρSWIR1 (1) View Source
    where ρ NIR is the reflectance in the NIR, ρ SWIR1 is the reflectance in the Shortwave
    Infrared One. LSWI can be used to detect and classify paddy rice phenology in
    paddy fields with complex cropping patterns [35], [62]. It was also used to assess
    the damage of regional rainfed paddy rice after severe floods [44] and monitoring
    rice growth [63]. Liou and Sha found that the value of LSWI increases and becomes
    higher that NDVI and EVI [44]. EVI can be used to quantify vegetation greenness
    [64]. Son et al. have constructed a time-series EVI and LSWI data in order to
    perform the phenology-based rice crop classification [35]. EVI can be measured
    as follows; EVI=G× ρNIR−ρRed ρNIR+( C 1 ×ρred− C 2 ×ρBlue)+L (2) View Source where
    ρ NIR is the reflectance in the NIR, ρ Red is the reflectance in the red, ρ Blue
    is the reflectance in the blue, C1, C2, and L are coefficients and G is the gain
    factor. The coefficients adopted in the MODIS-EVI algorithm are; L=1 , C 1 =6
    , C 2 =7.5 , and G=2.5 . EVI is normally combined with other vegetation indices
    (e.g., NDVI, LSWI) to predict paddy rice yields’ estimation [35], [58] [59], [62],
    assess damage of regional rainfed paddy rice [44] and monitor rice growth [62],
    [63]. The results of applying MODIS-based paddy rice phenological detection algorithm
    in classifying paddy growth stages are found to be encouraging and can be used
    to monitor paddy rice agriculture at a larger scale [62], [63]. Indices that correlate
    with vegetation cover are also used in estimating paddy yield and monitoring paddy
    growth such as the NDVI, which is mostly used to predict paddy rice yields’ estimation
    [43], [57], [59], assessing damage of regional rainfed paddy rice [44] and monitoring
    rice growth [63]. NVDI is used to measure the level of greenness and biomass of
    vegetation. NDVI measurements are most often taken from satellites in orbit around
    the Earth. NDVI can be computed based on differences in the response patterns
    of vegetation in the red and NIR ranges as follows [65]; NDVI= ρNIR−ρRed ρNIR+ρRed
    (3) View Source where ρ NIR is the reflectance in the NIR and ρ Red is the reflectance
    in the red and this NDVI ranges between -1 (no vegetation) and +1 (green vegetation).
    Both the NDVI and EVI are most commonly used vegetation indices to monitor the
    health of vegetation on the fields [35], [43], [57], [59], [66]–[69]. However,
    some researchers have reported that EVI is often preferred than NDVI as EVI is
    more responsive to biophysical variables, such as LAI [35], [67]. For instance,
    EVI is more robust in capturing the difference in well-vegetated areas [67]. MNDWI
    is computed based on differences in the response patterns of vegetation in the
    green and SWIR1 ranges for the enhancement of open water features [70] and can
    be measured as follows; MNDWI= ρGreen−ρSWIR1 ρGreen+ρSWIR1 (4) View Source where
    ρ NIR is the reflectance in the NIR, ρ SWIR1 is the reflectance in the Shortwave
    Infrared One. The integration of NDVI and MNDWI from Sentinel-2A image has shown
    increased accuracy of predicting the paddy rice yield estimation [57]. LAI is
    a dimensionless quantity that characterizes plant canopies that typically can
    be defined as the ratio of one sided leaf area per unit ground area ( m 2 / m
    2 ) and can be considered as a measure of paddy crop growth and productivity since
    it characterizes plant canopy structure and gives an idea of the amount of biomass
    available in a field. LAI can be measured using a plant canopy analyzer [71].
    Some works have been conducted to estimate paddy rice LAI with a fixed point continuous
    observation of near infrared reflectance using a calibrated digital camera [71],
    [72]. Estimating paddy rice LAI can also be done using machine learning methods
    [69] and also statistical methods [73] based on hyperspectral data. The leaf area
    index (LAI) and plant nitrogen concentration (PNC) were also used to estimate
    the nitrogen nutritional index (NNI) in paddy rice [74]. Hyperspectral images
    (Red, Blue, Green and Near Infrared One) can also be used to predict paddy rice
    yield estimation [75]–[77], assess the quality of paddy rice [69], [71], [72],
    [78], [79] and monitor paddy rice disease [80], [81]. Another remotely sensed
    data that is widely used in smart farming called C-Band Synthetic Aperture Radar
    (SAR) data. C-Band SAR data can be obtained from the Sentinel-1A satellite which
    provides a collection of data in all-weather, day or night. C-Band SAR data has
    been used in a wide range of applications that include sea and land monitoring.
    For instance, C-Band SAR has been used in predicting paddy rice yield estimation
    [82], monitoring paddy rice growth [83] and monitoring paddy rice disease [40].
    3) Drone Based Data Next, drone based data include all imageries captured using
    the drone technology. The high resolution images captured using drone can be used
    to estimate the paddy rice yield [42], [84]–[86], monitor paddy rice disease [37],
    [39], [87]–[92], classify paddy rice samples [46], [47], [93]–[101] and also assess
    the quality of paddy rice [102]–[104]. For instance, a near real-time deep learning
    approach for detecting rice phenology has also been designed based on high resolutions
    images taken by using drones [86]. For instance, a SVM classifier can be used
    to perform segmentation and classification of paddy rice samples [46]. The prediction
    of nitrogen deficiency of rice crop can also be done to access the quality of
    the rice using deep learning methods [104]. B. Applications of Machine Learning
    Algorithms in Paddy Rice Smart Farming This section elaborates the roles of machine
    learning technology in paddy rice smart agriculture, by analyzing the applications
    of machine learning algorithms and smart technologies in various scenarios in
    the paddy rice production and post-production phases of the ASC. As mentioned
    earlier, intelligent data processing technologies can be applied in various scenarios
    in all the paddy rice production and post-production phases of the ASC and these
    tasks include smart irrigation for paddy rice, predicting paddy rice yield estimation,
    monitoring paddy rice growth, monitoring paddy rice disease, assessing quality
    of paddy rice, paddy rice sample recognition and classification. The state-of-the-art
    for the tasks involved in the smart paddy rice farming is illustrated in Fig.
    6. First, all the acquired data (Sensor, Remotely sensed data and vegetation indices,
    and drone based data) will be cleaned, fusioned or integrated. Then, the dimensionality
    of the data can be reduced using feature selection, construction, transformation
    and weighting processes [162]–[164]. Next, once the data are prepared, then they
    will be divided into training and testing data depending on the types of task
    (e.g., classification, regression or clustering) or machine learning algorithms
    (e.g., estimation, linear and non-linear methods) used to model the data. Finally,
    model evaluation and interpretation will be performed to extract knowledge that
    supports the tasks in the smart paddy rice farming (e.g., Paddy Yield Estimation,
    Monitoring Paddy Growth, Assessing the Quality of Paddy Rice, Determining Paddy
    Rice Classes and Monitoring Paddy Rice Diseases). FIGURE 6. State-of-the-art for
    the tasks involved in the smart paddy rice farming. Show All 1) Smart Irrigation
    System for Paddy Rice Automatic drip irrigation system requires a lesser amount
    of water to maintain a predetermined water height in paddy fields [32], [33] and
    this system can be controlled based on the captured climate data (e.g., temperature,
    humidity, light and rain) from sensors. Using a wireless sensor and actuator network
    (WSAN) to build a smart irrigation system for paddy fields can also conserve significant
    amount of water [106], [107]. Automatic irrigation system can cause a significant
    increase of rice production by making more arable land available for paddy rice
    plantation [33]. Besides that, smart sensors for climate and soil [36], [36],
    Radio-frequency identification (RFID), load Sensor and Global Positioning System
    (GPS) are also used in estimating paddy rice yield [113], [114]. Table 3 tabulates
    the applications of smart sensors (Internet of Things (IoT)) in various tasks
    involved in paddy rice smart farming. 2) Predicting Paddy Rice Yield Estimation
    Most researches model the paddy rice estimation based on the hyperspectral and
    climate data in predicting paddy rice yield estimation (see Table 4). These studies
    conducted using various types of remotely sensed data and vegetation indices to
    predict paddy rice yield estimation [34], [35], [57], [58], [67]. Thus, one of
    the issues is determining the best combination of data obtained from remotely
    sensed data and vegetation indices to improve the accuracy of predicting paddy
    rice yield estimation. For instance, the integration of NDVI and MNDWI from Sentinel-2A
    image with temporal backscatter increased the accuracy by 0.08 [57]. Combining
    hyperspectral data (e.g., NDVI and MNDWI) will also increase the accuracy of estimating
    the paddy rice yield by using Classification And Regression Trees (CART) [57].
    CART is one of the variants of Decision Tree (DT) classifiers that can be used
    for classification or regression predictive modeling problems [57], [66], [144].
    DT is one of important types of algorithm for supervised learning, particularly
    in predictive modeling [78], [81], [126]. DT are constructed via an algorithmic
    approach that optimizes the splitting of a data set based on different conditions
    of the data features. In addition to that, using multi-features fusion method
    can also improve the accuracy of predicting paddy rice yields using a deep learning
    approach [112]. TABLE 4 Applications of Machine Learning Algorithms in Predicting
    Paddy Rice Yield Estimation Partial Least Squares (PLS) algorithm can be found
    in many researches conducted to estimate the paddy rice yields [34], [35], [75].
    For instance, short wave infrared region was found to be very essential for estimating
    the paddy yield using PLS algorithm [34]. PLS was developed based on the principal
    component regression that can be used to build models that can predict more than
    one dependent variable [63], [69], [136]. PLS was also found to produce higher
    R2 of 0.984 compared to Principal Components Regression (PCR) in predicting paddy
    rice yield estimation [75]. PCR is based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
    that is used to analyze the multiple regression data that suffer from multicollinearity
    [132] (e.g., predicting paddy rice yield estimation [75]). Before any modelling
    can be performed, PCA can be used to extract features of the datasets [128]. PCA
    is a well-known technique used for reducing the dimensionality of the datasets
    [129]. This is done to increase the interpretability but at the same time minimizing
    information loss [130], [131]. A few variants of deep learning algorithms have
    also been used to predict paddy rice yield estimation based on NDVI [109], climate
    data [48], [110]–[112], [155] and hyperspectral data (Bands 1~4) [75]–[77] with
    higher accuracy results. These deep learning algorithms include Artificial Neural
    Network (ANN) [48], [77], [110], [111], Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [76],
    [109], [112], Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) [155]). For instance, neural network
    algorithms achieved better overall accuracy compared to Random Forest (RF) and
    Support Vector Machine (SVM) using either the hyperspectral or climate data [48],
    [109], [110]. Inspired by the way biological nervous systems, ANN is basically
    an information processing technique that works like the way human brain processes
    information [150]. An ordinary neural network may consist of hidden layers and
    weights while CNN has filters which collectively make up the convolution layers.
    CNN is most commonly applied to analyze images and it is a class of deep neural
    networks. CNN is suitable to be used for spatial data such as images. In contrast,
    RNN is suitable to be used for temporal data which is also called sequential data.
    Compared to ANN, RNN is able to learn time-series data since it has a recurrent
    connection on the hidden state and this looping constraint ensures that sequential
    information is captured in the input data [151], [155]. Although, deep learning
    algorithms are known to be very effective and robust to forecast yields paddy
    rice yield estimation, [76], [77], [109], [111], [155] they require a large amount
    of time-series data to improve the prediction performance [112]. RF requires two
    parameters namely the number of trees and the number of features to split the
    data set based on different conditions [143]. RF has been found to be effective
    in predicting paddy rice yield estimation and monitoring paddy rice growth [48],
    [82]. Several works related to applying SVM in paddy rice smart farming have been
    reviewed in this paper [48], [109]. However, they produced lower accuracies compared
    to deep learning algorithms. SVM is a supervised machine learning model that can
    be used for binary classification tasks [146]. The objective of the SVM is to
    find the optimum hyperplane in an N-dimensional space that can distinctly classifies
    the data points. Unsupervised learning algorithm can also be used to predict the
    paddy rice estimation using the hyperspectral data [58]. For instance, Iterative
    Self-Organizing (ISO) has been used to generate paddy cropping pattern to predict
    paddy rice yield estimation [58]. ISO is an unsupervised learning algorithm that
    can be used to generate rice cropping patterns [58]. The ISO algorithm is a modification
    of the k -means clustering algorithm. The merging and splitting of clusters are
    based on a predefined threshold by the user. If the difference of distance in
    multispectral feature space is less than the predefined threshold, the merging
    or splitting of clusters will be performed [153]. There are several optimization
    approaches that produce estimates of unknown variables or parameters based on
    a series of measurements observed over time, such as the Extended Kalman Filter
    (EKF), Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and Moving horizon estimation (MHE) [133],
    that can be used to predict paddy rice yield estimation. Moving Horizon Estimator
    with Pre-Estimation (MHE-PE) is an optimization-based estimator introduced and
    use an auxiliary estimator to describe the dynamics of the state over the horizon
    [134], [135]. MHE-PE is found to be more effective compared to MHE [68] for crop
    start date estimation in tropical area [68]. Some of the limitations found in
    these studies include the resolution limitations, topographic effects and limited
    and small size of time-series data that lead to estimation errors. For instance,
    the low fractional coverage of small-size rice paddies in the complex and hilly
    landscapes could also lower the probability of identification using the OTSU’s
    algorithm [108]. OTSU’s method is an image segmentation algorithm that segments
    a gray level image with only one modal distribution in gray level histogram [100],
    [148]. Stepwise classification (SW) is another classification approach that applies
    a strategy that combines two heterogeneous data sets in a novel way, and this
    can be used in estimating rice yields production [67]. Table 4 tabulates the applications
    of machine various learning algorithms found in some of works to predict paddy
    rice yield estimation. 3) Monitoring Paddy Rice Growth Monitoring the growth of
    paddy rice can be performed by mapping paddy rice and assessing the growth stages
    of the paddy rice. One of the issues or challenges in monitoring paddy rice growth
    using machine learning algorithms is to determine the optimum features combination.
    With optimum features combination, the overall accuracy of the classification
    results can be improved [115]. For instance, the optimum features combination
    can be achieved by using the robust adaptive spatial temporal fusion model (RASTFM)
    [116]. NDVI [63], [66], [69], [115], EVI [63] and Hyperspectral bands 1~4 [73],
    [78] are the most commonly used in monitoring the growth of paddy rice. The Multilayer
    Perceptron (MLP) [63], a class of feedforward ANN, and RF [69], [115] algorithms
    show better accuracies [69], [115] compared to PLS, SVM [63], [78], [83] and Support
    Vector Regression (SVR) [69] in performing the paddy growth stages classification.
    SVR is characterized by the use of kernels, sparse solution, and the original
    control of the margin and the number of support vectors [141]. SVR trains using
    a symmetrical loss function, which equally penalizes high and low misestimates
    and it has been proven to be an effective algorithm in estimating real-value [69].
    Least-squares support-vector machines (LS-SVM) is found to produce better results
    compared to Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and PLS, in estimating LAI of paddy
    rice from optimal hyperspectral bands [73]. LS-SVMs are least-squares versions
    of SVM which can be used for classification and regression analysis problems [73],
    [123], [140]. MLR is a statistical technique that uses several independent variables
    to predict the outcome of the dependent variable [34], [73], [111], [137]. Multiple
    regression is an extension of linear (OLS) regression that applies only one independent
    variable. Besides remotely sensed data, vegetation indices, climate and soil data
    obtained from smart sensors are also used in monitoring paddy rice growth [36],
    [36] (see Table 3). Table 5 tabulates the applications of machine various learning
    algorithms in monitoring paddy rice growth. TABLE 5 Applications of Machine Learning
    Algorithms in Monitoring Paddy Rice Growth 4) Monitoring Paddy Rice Disease The
    color of the paddy rice leaves will change when they are infected by any disease
    and these colored spots are created on leaves. For that reason, most of the researches
    used high-resolution images in monitoring the paddy rice disease [37], [39], [41],
    [87]–[92], [117]–[120] and hyperspectral images [80], [81] to detect and assess
    the paddy rice diseases. The ANN algorithm and its variants, CNN, are found to
    be very effective in classifying task for monitoring the paddy rice diseases [39]–[41],
    [81], [87], [88], [90], [118]. For instance, the ANN achieved better classification
    results compared to FC and SVM algorithms [39] and the calibrated CNN model still
    showed good classification ability in a small-scale sample set and it was selected
    as the best classification model compared to DT, k -NN and SVM [81]. However,
    CNN requires a large number of samples for training purposes [88], [112]. In fuzzy
    classification (FC) applications, once a set of classes has been defined, one
    can determine the degree of membership of every object x under consideration [149].
    Fuzzy classification allows object x to belong to two or more classes. k -Nearest
    Neigbour ( k -NN) algorithm is also very effective in detecting diseases from
    paddy plant leaf images and identifying Brown Planthopper in paddy field and other
    classification problems [37], [81], [92], [96], [117]. Given an unknown sample,
    k -NN finds k samples that are nearest to this unknown sample based on certain
    distance functions (e.g., Euclidean or Cosine distance methods) and take the average
    of the response variables from these k samples as the label (class) of the unknown
    samples [145]. k -NN can be used for paddy rice sample classification [59], [99],
    [103]. Compared to SVM, k -NN produces better accuracy in detecting and recognizing
    diseases from paddy plant leaf images [37]. Some combined approaches show promising
    results that involve deep learning approaches [40], [41] and SVM algorithms [40],
    [91]. For instance, a combination approach of two machine learning algorithms
    (e.g., CNN+SVM ) has been used to identify the cultivated paddy regions (e.g.,
    Using CNN), and to detect areas damaged (e.g., Using SVM) by Brown Planthopper
    attacks [40]. Other works include building a semantic framework that models an
    ontology related to rice plant knowledge and applying this framework to help farmers
    to identify rice diseases, receive early warnings of possible spreadable diseases,
    and receive treatments based on multiple observations [121]. Minimum Distance
    Classifier (MDC) achieved better accuracy compared to k -NN in classifying high-resolution
    images for monitoring paddy rice disease [117]. MDC classifies unknown sample
    data to classes which minimize the distance between this sample data and the class
    in multi-feature space [147]. One of the works reviewed has applied MDC to classify
    images in the task of monitoring and controlling rice diseases using Image processing
    techniques [117]. There are also researches conducted on developing expert systems
    using optimized fuzzy inference system (OFIS) [122] and forward chaining [89]
    for monitoring paddy rice disease. Table 6 tabulates the applications of machine
    various learning algorithms in monitoring paddy rice disease. TABLE 6 Applications
    of Machine Learning Algorithms in Monitoring Paddy Rice Disease 5) Assessing Quality
    of Paddy Rice The quality of paddy rice can be assessed using the hyperspectral
    data [74], [79], climate and soil data [105] and also high-resolution images of
    the paddy rice [93], [104], [123]. SVM and CNN algorithms are the two most commonly
    used machine learning algorithms for assessing the quality of paddy rice [79],
    [93], [104], [105], [123]. CNN is found to be more effective compared to SVM algorithm
    in assessing the quality of the paddy rice [93]. However, a combination of classical
    artificial neural networks and SVM also has been used to predict nitrogen deficiency
    of rice crop [104]. Fuzzy c-means (FCM) has also been used to assess the quality
    of the paddy rice. FCM is a method of clustering which allows one piece of data
    to belong to two or more clusters [74], [154]. Table 7 tabulates the applications
    of machine various learning algorithms in assessing quality of paddy rice. TABLE
    7 Applications of Machine Learning Algorithms in Assessing Quality of Paddy Rice
    6) Paddy Rice Sample Classification Machine learning algorithms are normally combined
    with computer vision techniques to perform paddy rice sample classification with
    more effectively. Applying computer vision and machine learning techniques to
    recognize and classify rice varieties is a method that can be used to increase
    the accuracy of classification process in real applications. Several studies have
    been conducted that apply and examine several morphological and textural features
    of rice seeds’ images to evaluate their efficacy in identification of rice varieties
    [97] and classification of paddy rice adulteration levels [96]. In most studies
    related to the application of machine learning algorithm for paddy rice sample
    classification, deep learning algorithms are found to be very effective in classifying
    rice samples [94]–[97], [99], [101], [124]. The classification of the paddy rice
    samples can be improved with PCA-based reduced features [96], [103], [124]. PCA
    can be combined with other classifiers to improve the accuracy of paddy rice sample
    classification [96], [103], [124] and also to perform qualitative analysis in
    monitoring paddy rice disease [80]. Deep learning algorithms (e.g., BPNN, CNN)
    produced better accuracy compared to SVM algorithm [46], [101] in classifying
    paddy rice samples [95], [96]. When the label or number of varieties are not available,
    an unsupervised learning algorithm, such as clustering algorithm, can also be
    used to cluster paddy rice samples. For instance, k -Means clustering algorithm
    provides clusters with considerable separability as measured using separability
    index measures [103] based on the PCA-based reduced features. In k -means clustering,
    n observations are partitioned into k clusters in which each observation is assigned
    to the nearest cluster centroid. The k -means clustering is also known as a method
    of vector quantization [152]. By using the k -means clustering method in paddy
    rice sample classification, the H channel data can provide clusters with considerable
    separability as measured using separability index measures [103]. k -means clustering
    also can be used as part of the approach to classify the annual cropping patterns
    of paddy crop based on k number of classes [59]. Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost)
    has been used to classify paddy rice samples. AdaBoost algorithm combines multiple
    weak classifiers to form a single strong classifier [91], [95], [142]. AdaBoost
    is also known as ensemble method as it consists of multiple weak classifiers.
    However, deep learning algorithms are found to be more superior than AdaBoost
    algorithm in classifying paddy rice samples [91], [95]. A multi-classifier cascade
    based rice spike detection method has also been proposed that consists of SVM,
    CNN and k -Means algorithm [99]. Other works include training machine learning
    algorithms to predict weight and size of rice kernels [125], application of machine
    learning algorithm in detecting adulterated admixtures of white rice based on
    mass spectrometry data [126] and classifying organic rice samples using original
    rice elements [127]. Table 8 tabulates the applications of machine various learning
    algorithms in paddy rice sample classification. TABLE 8 Applications of Machine
    Learning Algorithms in Paddy Rice Sample Classification SECTION V. Results and
    Conclusion Based on the reviews of several works in this paper, a new framework
    is proposed that maps three entities that include big data, machine learning and
    paddy rice smart farming tasks. In this review, the types of machine learning
    algorithms used are highly dependent on the availability of data. At the same
    time, the type of data required depends directly on the type of tasks stated in
    each production and post-production phases of paddy rice smart farming. These
    machine learning algorithms are used to perform the intelligent data processing
    that will assist farmers in various tasks mentioned in the production and post-production
    phases. Based on the findings summarized in the previous sections, machine learning
    algorithms and smart technologies can be used to improve the overall efficiency
    of the paddy rice production system. The potential benefits lead to an improvement
    in the return of investment (ROI) for all paddy rice production systems by minimizing
    the losses or costs involved in the production of paddy rice. As a result, we
    use these findings found in the literature to map these three components (e.g.,
    datasets, machine learning algorithms and tasks stated in the production of paddy
    rice) and develop a Big Data-ML-Task applications framework that can be used by
    the practitioners. The proposed framework shown in Fig. 7 has three main components,
    the types of datasets, types of ML algorithms, the types of tasks in paddy rice
    smart farming and paddy rice supply chain performance. FIGURE 7. Mapping of big
    data, machine learning and paddy rice smart farming tasks. Show All With smart
    irrigation system, the usage of water can be reduced and at the same time fully
    utilized to increase the paddy rice yield [32], [106], [107]. Automatic irrigation
    system also may cause a significant increase of rice production by making more
    arable land available for paddy rice plantation [33]. The task of estimating the
    yield of paddy rice precisely is very important for national food security and
    development evaluation. The development of an integrated aerial crop monitoring
    solution using an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) has motivated researchers to apply
    vegetation indices retrieved from hyperspectral images to estimate paddy rice
    yield [77]. Several studies have estimated the paddy rice yield based on time-series
    climate data [48], [110]–[112], [155]. Rainfall was found the main climate driver
    of the rice yield [111]. Other studies considered hyperspectral data to estimate
    the yield of paddy rice [34], [35], [57], [58], [67], [68], [75], [76], [108],
    [109]. Deep learning algorithms were found to be more effective compared to other
    machine learning algorithms for modeling paddy rice yield [48], [76], [77], [109]–[112],
    [155]. Maximum quality of paddy rice harvested can be obtained by using sensors
    to monitor humidity, temperature, pH, soil moisture and light intensity in real
    [113], [114]. Monitoring the growth of paddy rice is critical for understanding
    the growing status and yield estimation of paddy rice. For instance, the self-sufficient
    level (SSL) for paddy rice in Malaysia is only 70%. As the world population is
    increasing, intensifying paddy rice farming is more preferable over the expansion
    of agriculture land due to limited arable land [156]. Monitoring the growth of
    paddy rice is difficult for traditional farmers due to climate change, soil conditions,
    age of the farmers and time consumed to monitor the whole area. With remotely
    sensed data, creating paddy rice crop growth map is possible using the hyperspectral
    images [66] and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data [83], [115]. For example,
    the paddy rice growth based on rice growth parameters (e.g., rice height and biomass)
    can be monitored with the backscattering coefficient from RADARSAT-2 data [83].
    The paddy rice leaf chlorophyll contents can also be retrieved from the rice canopy
    hyperspectral imagery to analyze the paddy rice plant growth [63]. Leaf area index
    (LAI) is commonly used as a surrogate for productivity in precision agriculture
    (PA) and is widely used in plant growth [69], [73]. In short, the applications
    of machine learning algorithms have enabled us to timely and accurately monitor
    paddy rice planting area for national food security and management [115]. Using
    smart sensors to monitor soil pH, lux and temperature also provides insight in
    understanding the stages of paddy rice growth [36], [36]. Due to the lack of knowledge
    and awareness of suitable management to rectify rice plant leaf diseases, the
    rice production is being reduced in recent years [157]. The manual detection of
    plant diseases based on naked eye observation of experts is very time consuming,
    expensive and sometimes it produces an error when identifying the disease type
    [158]. Machine learning (ML) algorithm can be used to provide early warnings to
    anticipate rice blast and detect its presence, thus supporting the applications
    of biocidal chemical compounds or biological organisms used to kill parasitic
    fungi or their spores. Based on several studies reviewed in this paper, the applications
    of ML, in detecting the presence of rice blast, has also provided suitable solutions
    for preventive remedial actions targeting the mitigation of yield losses and the
    reduction of fungicide use [159]. This review will be beneficial for modelers,
    farmers and stakeholders, to guide them in model development and selection for
    the most suitable models for the effective paddy rice disease detection and forecasting.
    The identification of paddy diseases may also assist farmer in providing them
    the remedies based on the types of disease [160]. The quality of paddy rice production
    depends highly on the quality of soil properties. These soil properties include
    soils’ pH and moisture, nitrogen and organic carbon content of the soil. For instance,
    a CNN produced promising results in assessing the nitrogen deficiency of paddy
    rice crop [104]. These soil properties can be captured using sensors or retrieved
    from the hyperspectral images [74]. SVM and CNN are the two most common machine
    learning algorithms used in assessing the quality of paddy rice. Compared to SVM,
    CNN produced better assessment accuracy [93]. Besides soil properties [105], some
    studies have conducted the assessment of the paddy rice quality based on the high-resolution
    images of the paddy rice leaf [93], [104], [123] and the hyperspectral images
    of the paddy rice field [74], [79]. Improving the management and productivity
    of the paddy rice farming is important to strengthen the food security initiatives.
    Due to variation in economic value of different varieties of rice, rice quality
    identification is very important in the international and national rice market
    [97], [100], [101]. The quality of the rice is used to evaluate the milling process.
    Rice sample may consist of full rice, broken rice, damaged rice, paddy, stones
    and foreign objects. Image processing and machine learning techniques can be used
    to separate and classify objects of rice sample [46]. Other than hyperspectral
    images [98], most of the studies related to paddy rice sample classification use
    high-resolution images and apply machine learning techniques such as SVM [46],
    [96], [98]–[100], [127] and deep learning algorithms [94]–[98], [101], [124].
    Combining efficient feature extraction method (e.g., PCA) [103] with neural network
    algorithm (e.g., Back-propagation Neural Network (BPNN)) shows better accuracy
    results in paddy rice sample classification [96], [124] and also better clustering
    results for paddy rice grade identification [103]. Other image pre-processing
    such as histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) also affects the performance of
    the classifiers [94], [99]. Combining features in paddy rice sample classification
    also improves the classification accuracies [96]. Multi-classifier cascade can
    also be used to improve the performance of the paddy rice sample classification
    [99]. In order to get a good model, low bias and variance are required in order
    to have high accuracies or lower errors. An optimal balance of bias and variance
    would never overfit and underfit the model. Reducing variance of the final classifier
    model can be achieved by fitting multiple final models or using hybrid approaches
    [99], [103], [124] or increase the training size. In addition to that, example
    of low-bias machine learning algorithms include DT, k -NN and SVM. Based on the
    findings of this review, the performance of all these three machine learning algorithms
    are very competitive in predicting paddy rice yield estimation [109], monitoring
    paddy rice growth [78], [83], monitoring paddy rice disease [37], [40], [81],
    [91], [117], [119], [120], assessing quality of paddy rice [79], [104], [123]
    and paddy rice sample classification [46], [98], [99], [127]. SECTION VI. Conclusion
    This paper provides a structured overview of the recent applications of machine
    learning algorithms and smart devices for paddy rice smart farming. In addition
    to that, this paper has proposed a framework that maps big data, machine learning
    and paddy rice smart farming tasks. The review study reveals considerable benefits
    to the production of paddy rice that have applied the machine learning techniques
    and smart devices in the paddy rice smart farming. As with any research, here,
    we also summarize the following guidelines based on the findings obtained from
    this review for future works. First, there is a need to explore further the capability
    of ensemble models or hybrid models based on deep learning methods using multi-source
    data, as these have been shown to improve the performance of the base model. However,
    deep learning methods require large number of samples to come up with efficient
    models. For instance, in predicting paddy rice yield and monitoring paddy rice
    disease using the deep learning approach, a large amount of time-series data is
    required to improve the prediction performance [88], [112]. Since most of the
    studies conducted for paddy rice sample classification are based on image processing,
    the optimization of the classification accuracy (e.g., using hybrid or ensemble
    approach) is another issue that requires more explorations. For instance, more
    works on the variety of wavelet transforms for texture analysis and different
    classification techniques (decision tree, random forest) for paddy rice sample
    classification can be explored [96]. Second, a limited number of investigations
    conducted in the area of the application of machine learning algorithm based on
    multi-sources data as the findings from existing studies have shown that a more
    comprehensive understanding can be obtained by integrating multi-sources data
    or determining the optimum features combination. We can produce better modelling
    results comprehensively by analysing these complex relationships among multi-sources
    data or by finding the optimum features combination. For instance, using only
    spectral reflectance, shape and texture of paddy rice will not provide better
    results and additional ground truth data is required in order to classify and
    differentiate paddy rice accurately [161]. Using multi-features fusion (e.g.,
    combining Landsat and SAR Time Series Data) can also improve the accuracy of predicting
    paddy rice yield using a deep learning approach [112]. Limited works are found
    in exploring and combining multiple sources of data (e.g., Sensored data (climate
    and soil properties), Remotely sensed data, vegetation indices and drone-based
    data (e.g., high-resolution images)) to improve the modelling of data for smart
    irrigation for paddy rice, predicting paddy rice yield estimation, monitoring
    paddy rice growth, monitoring paddy rice disease, assessing quality of paddy rice,
    paddy rice sample classification. Finally, a more comprehensive analysis needs
    to be conducted to investigate the efficiency of processing software to perform
    image preprocessing for modelling. For example, Monitoring the growth of paddy
    rice based on spectral reflectance has limitations of the processing software
    and the complicated steps to process the images [66]. More researches need to
    be conducted to acquire high resolutions remotely sensed time series imagery data
    in both time and space through effective and efficient image segmentation process
    using data blending approaches [108]. Authors Figures References Citations Keywords

    \ information from wireless sensor networks for knowledge discovery and decision\
    \ making in rural environments.\nThe multiagent system has been built over the\
    \ cloud computing paradigm to provide better flexibility and higher scalability\
    \ for\nhandling both small- and large-scale projects. The development of wireless\
    \ sensor network technology has allowed for its extension\nand application to\
    \ the rural environment, where the lives of the people interacting with the environment\
    \ can be improved. The\nuse of “smart” technologies can also improve the efficiency\
    \ and effectiveness of rural systems. The proposed multiagent system\nallows us\

    \ Since water is a scarce natural resource that should not be wasted, a case study\
    \ was conducted\nin an agricultural environment to test the proposed system’s\
    \ performance in optimizing the irrigation system in corn crops. The\narchitecture\

    \ wireless sensor network deployed in the\ncrops. This way, the architecture can\
    \ learn about the needs of the crop and make efficient irrigation decisions. The\
    \ obtained results\nare very promising when compared to a traditional automatic\
    \ irrigation system.\n1. Introduction\nWireless sensor networks (WSNs) are used\
    \ for collecting the\ninformation needed by intelligent environments in urban\
    \ and\nrural construction, smart cities, home and building automa-\ntion, industrial\
    \ applications, or smart hospitals [1–6]. WSNs\nsupport current requirements related\
    \ to the deployment of\nnetworks; they cover communication needs and are flexible\n\
    in time, space, and autonomy; they do not require a fixed\nstructure [7–9]. Currently,\
    \ several wireless technologies are\navailable on the market such as ZigBee, Wi-Fi,\
    \ or Bluetooth;\nthey enable easier deployments than wired ones, avoiding the\n\
    need to wire buildings and decrease the costs and drawbacks\nof the setup phase.\
    \ The possibilities provided by WSNs allow\ndeveloping a wide range of applications,\
    \ such as energy\ncost control, monitoring of environmental data, security and\n\
    control of access to environments, and industrial and home\nautomation [10–13].\
    \ In this regard, telemonitoring (or sens-\ning) makes it possible to obtain information\
    \ about users and\ntheir environment. This allows offering the users customized\n\
    online services, considering the state of their environment.\nThe building automation\
    \ and control system market provides\nmany standards, protocols, and data distribution\
    \ systems,\nenabling different systems, like building automation systems,\nsecurity\
    \ systems, lighting systems, and others, to interact and\nintegrate with each\
    \ other [14, 15].\nHindawi\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nVolume\

    Wireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nThe development of WSN technology\
    \ has allowed extend-\ning its application to the rural setting where it can be\
    \ used to\nfacilitate the daily activities of farmers. People’s interaction\n\
    with the environment can be improved and the use of\n“smart” technologies can\
    \ also improve the efficiency and\neffectiveness of rural systems. Mobile computing,\
    \ grid com-\nputing, pervasive microsensing and actuation [16, 17], and\nrecent\
    \ advancements in wireless technologies may change\nour surrounding environment\
    \ in a way that we have not yet\nimagined. These emerging technologies can be\
    \ used to create\nsmart environments and improve the socioeconomic status\nof\
    \ rural areas. The different applications of WSNs in rural\nenvironments can include\
    \ e-services such as e-learning, e-\nacademics, e-business, e-medicine, and e-healthcare.\
    \ Those\napplications may facilitate an efficient connection between\nthe city\
    \ and remote rural areas.\nOther applications of WSNs to the rural setting aim\n\
    to prevent environmental degradation because of fires in\nfarming and forest areas.\
    \ Fires lead to pollution and to the loss\nof nutrients and soil microorganisms\
    \ [18, 19]. It also causes\nvegetation degradation as well as flora and fauna\
    \ diminution\nsince they disappear from the affected zone and are not\nreintegrated\
    \ in other areas. The application of WSNs not only\nin preventive but also in\
    \ postfire detection systems is of great\nbenefit. The use of sensors to detect\
    \ and monitor fire behavior\nhas allowed applying new technologies in this area.\
    \ Sensors\nused in such systems measure static and dynamic variables,\nlike humidity,\
    \ slope of the land, the type of fuel, the direction,\nthe speed of the wind,\
    \ smoke, etc. Thanks to that, they provide\nknowledge of how the fire spreads\
    \ and how to combat it\nefficiently.\nAnother area to which WSNs are applied within\
    \ the rural\ncontext is agriculture and therefore the food industry. Sensors\n\
    can be applied to measure parameters and gather information\non environmental\
    \ conditions affecting plant growth in areas\nthat are not as easily controllable\
    \ as those of a greenhouse.\nThey are important for weather monitoring and optimal\
    \ use\nof fertilizers in the field. Besides that, they can be used in\nspatial\
    \ data collection, precision irrigation, and fertigation\nas well as disease and\
    \ insect pest management. As for food\nindustry, the applications involve real\
    \ time temperature mea-\nsurement for thermal sterilization, irradiation, etc.\
    \ Bacterial\nconcentration in food products can also be sensed.\nAn important\
    \ feature of WSNs deployed in a rural setting\nis that they can collect heterogeneous\
    \ data from different\nenvironments. In this way, systems can learn about the\n\
    environment, making it possible to take adequate decisions\nand easing knowledge\
    \ discovery. The goal of this approach\nis to provide a smart environment able\
    \ to make decisions\nand efficiently manage resources. The process of collecting\n\
    heterogeneous information is related to the term “Big Data”\n[20], which deals\
    \ with the volume, variety, velocity, and\ncomplexity of data produced daily.\
    \ Big Data not only brings\ntogether large amounts of data; the paradigm also\
    \ makes it\npossible to process various data types. These data streams\ndemand\
    \ ever-greater processing speeds and yet their storage\nmust be economic. The\
    \ main goal of Big Data in research\nand technologies is to manage and transform\
    \ available real\ntime and historical data into knowledge and to make efficient\n\
    decisions based on organizational requirements and needs.\nIn the presented solution\
    \ this will be done with the data\nrecovered by the sensors. It will allow us\
    \ to optimize the use\nof the actuators in the system. Like the pivots in the\
    \ irrigation\nprocess, we will optimize the spent water knowing where to\nspend\
    \ it in the correct moment.\nReal Time Locating Systems (RTLS) are an example\
    \ of\nanother important application of WSNs [21, 22]. Although\nsystems like GPS\
    \ or the future Galileo perform well in\noutdoor localization, indoor localization\
    \ still needs further\ndevelopment, especially with respect to accuracy and the\n\
    use of low-cost and efficient infrastructures. Some of the\napplications of Real\
    \ Time Locating Systems include tracking\npeople, assets, and animals, access\
    \ control, wander pre-\nvention, warning and alert systems, controlling security\n\
    perimeter, and resources optimization. Companies need to\nuse some sort of monitoring\
    \ system to track their human and\ntechnical resources and, especially, to improve\
    \ their security,\nefficiency, and safety and reduce occupational hazards. User\n\
    identification is a key aspect for adequate services customiza-\ntion and environment\
    \ interaction. A good example of this is\nemergency situations where it is necessary\
    \ to locate people,\nfor example, in the case of forest fires or nuclear disasters.\
    \ To\nbe able to develop a platform that would integrate different\nsubsystems\
    \ for remote location and automation, it is first\nnecessary to create complex\
    \ and flexible applications.\nThe goal of this research, therefore, is to design\
    \ and\ndevelop a multiagent architecture aimed at gathering data\nand automating\
    \ rural environments for decision making and\nknowledge discovery on a cloud system.\
    \ This architecture,\nwhich is based on agent virtual organizations (VOs), will\n\
    give intelligence to the platform, real time response, and\nadaptation to the\
    \ needs of the application problem; and\nthe cloud will ensure that the platform\
    \ uses the required\nresources at all times. Recent tendencies have led to the\
    \ use\nof VOs, which can be thought of as a set of individuals and\ninstitutions\
    \ that need to coordinate resources and services\nacross institutional boundaries.\
    \ Thus, a VO is an open system\nformed by the grouping and collaboration of heterogeneous\n\
    entities. The most suitable technology for the development\nof these open systems\
    \ is Agent Technology, which makes\nit possible to form dynamic agent organizations.\
    \ Modelling\nopen multiagent organizations makes it possible to describe\nstructural\
    \ composition (i.e., roles, agent groups, interaction\npatterns, and role relationships)\
    \ and functional behaviors\n(i.e., agent tasks, plans, or services), and it can\
    \ incorpo-\nrate normative regulations for controlling agent behaviors,\ndynamic\
    \ entry/exit of components, and dynamic formation\nof agent groups [23, 24]. As\
    \ the development of open multi-\nagent systems is still a recent field in the\
    \ multiagent system\nparadigm, it is necessary to investigate new methods for\n\
    modelling open agent-based virtual organizations and inno-\nvative techniques\
    \ that will provide advanced organizational\nabilities to virtual organizations.\
    \ In that sense, the intelligence\nprovided by proposed architecture is based\
    \ on union of\nsupervised and unsupervised learning. On the one hand, we\nprovide\
    \ a subsystem able to learn from past experiences or\nalready classified data,\
    \ which guarantees the automation of\nthe system in decision making. On the other\
    \ hand, it is not\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n3\nalways possible\
    \ to collect labeled data as in the previous case.\nFor that reason, we have linked\
    \ the previous subsystem with\nanother of unsupervised learning. The latter will\
    \ allow us to\nfind groupings in data based on their distribution, on which\n\
    we can later classify or label the data based on the knowledge\nobtained from\
    \ the groupings found. The subsystem above has\nbeen used in this research to\
    \ recognise different crop areas\n(of different needs) focused on their features,\
    \ disclosed by\ndifferent sensors measuring environmental condition of the\ncrop.\
    \ All of the above allows us to use resources only when\nand where they are needed\
    \ as a means of optimizing resources\nin crops.\nFinally, this paper has been\
    \ divided into the following\nsections to reach the proposed aims: the Related\
    \ Work which\ndescribes the background and the works related to this\nresearch\
    \ as well as the main contribution of this research.\nThe Multiagent Architecture\
    \ Methodology describes the\nmethod used to develop the architecture, i.e., discretion\
    \ of\nthe different layers of the architecture and the multiagent\nsystem involved.\
    \ The case study section describes the features\nof the corn crop and pivot-based\
    \ irrigation system. The results\nreached in this section are given as the final\
    \ part. Conclusions\nand references are listed at the end of this document.\n\
    2. Related Work\nThe challenge of adapting Information and Communication\nTechnologies\
    \ (ICT) to the needs of the agrifood sector lies\nin the complexity of the problem\
    \ it faces: great diversity\nof products, fast deterioration of fresh products,\
    \ binding of\nagricultural production to weather conditions, existence of\ndiseases\
    \ or pests, limitations in the evaluation of the product\nquality by the final\
    \ consumer, distances between production\nand consumption areas, etc. To deal\
    \ with these aspects, an\nautomatic decision-making-oriented analysis is required\
    \ for\nlarge volumes of heterogeneous data collected from different\nsources [25–28].\n\
    The above cases exemplify the flow of products in the\nagrifood domain, which\
    \ move from the agricultural sector to\nthe food industry (agrifood logistics)\
    \ and finally are delivered\nto the consumer (food awareness). Precision agriculture\
    \ in\nprimary production [29, 30], tracking and tracing of food\nproducts along\
    \ their value chain [31], or identification of\nproduct characteristics through\
    \ labels and logos targeted at\nthe consumer [32] showed important initiatives\
    \ supporting\nthe needs imposed by the sector and the consumer.\nThe use of WSNs\
    \ in the cases listed above has contributed\nto the development of systems that\
    \ continually improve their\nperformance. This has been a reality, especially\
    \ in networks\nof radio frequency identification devices (RFID), which are\nclosely\
    \ linked to the organization of interenterprise agrifood\nprocesses, ranging from\
    \ the farm to the distribution com-\npany [33]. However, the process of selecting\
    \ and specifying\ntechnologies that improve business processes is becoming\nincreasingly\
    \ complex, due to the wide variety of existing\ndevices and the rapid developments\
    \ in this field.\nRFID technology is currently one of the most promising\ntechnologies\
    \ in self-identification and data capture (AIDC).\nThe main objective of RFID\
    \ systems is to collect data through\na transponder (tag) so that they can be\
    \ transmitted and\nreceived by a transceiver, all through a wireless communica-\n\
    tion channel. The possibility of accessing information without\nthe need for visual\
    \ contact with the tags is exploited in the\nidentification or location of assets\
    \ [33, 34]. Such capacity is\nrelevant in food tracking and tracing systems, through\
    \ the\nidentification of batches of individual products. In addition,\nthe continued\
    \ development of RFID is generating new use\ncases that go beyond the identification\
    \ functionality. To this\nend, RFID is integrated with other technologies, such\
    \ as\nsensor technology [35–37].\nThe advantage of RFID technology lies in the\
    \ fact that\nit is cheap enough to be incorporated into any physical\ndevice,\
    \ while providing bidirectional communication capac-\nities, allowing building\
    \ advanced organizational schemes,\nsuch as the Internet of Things (IoT, (ITU,\
    \ 2005)). RFID can\ncreate new business models on global device networks, where\n\
    each object is networked. Current RFID implementations\nshow great potential and\
    \ RFID may become a catalyst of\ntechnical evolution in the industrial sector\
    \ [38–40].\nIn general, agrofood data collection technology is char-\nacterized\
    \ by a wide variety of active devices in different\nparts/environments. The following\
    \ are the most common\nexamples in the majority of use cases [26]:\n(i) Data collection\
    \ on farms through the implementation\nof wireless sensor networks: they provide\
    \ information\non production indicators like precipitation, soil mois-\nture levels,\
    \ pesticide and fertilizer use, and more.\n(ii) Transport data capture: It includes\
    \ the location and\ninformation of the environment and data both inside\nand outside\
    \ the transport system, which allows us to\nknow the state of logistics.\n(iii)\
    \ Data capture of product quality indicators: the levels\nof humidity, oxygen,\
    \ nitrogen, and ethylene in the air\nact as indicators of the state of fruit and\
    \ vegetables,\nbeing relevant in storage and transport tasks.\n(iv) Data capture\
    \ from product packaging (logos and\nother) is to collect additional product information\
    \ on\ncloud.\nFocusing on the agricultural use case, small and medium\nsized farms\
    \ carry most of the weight of world production.\nEven though they are slower to\
    \ adopt IT solutions, due to\nlack of familiarity with technologies, belief that\
    \ the cost-\nbenefit ratio does not suit their needs or due to their lack of\n\
    knowledge they are not able to make use of the large amount\nof information that\
    \ these systems acquire [41]. Solutions\nto such problems may be found in precision\
    \ agriculture.\nFor example, the conferences of the International Society of\n\
    Precision Agriculture (ISPA, 2012) aim to collect information\nfor accounting\
    \ purposes and its subsequent automation. This\nimplies increased agricultural\
    \ automation and improvements\nin environmental technologies.\nIn this area, wireless\
    \ sensor network applications for\nirrigation facilities management based on radio\
    \ frequency\nidentification have been proposed in [42, 43]. Those applica-\ntions\
    \ were determined to be beneficial in the management of\nwater. This kind of systems\
    \ collect, analyse, and monitor data\n4\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n\
    from a net of sensors installed in the field in a feedback loop\nwhich activates\
    \ the control devices based on precalculated\nthreshold value, like in [44]. Some\
    \ other works develop\napplications to allow the user to interact with the system\n\
    and make dynamical thresholds [45, 46]. Other systems,\ninstead of just thresholds,\
    \ do use linear programming models\nto optimize the resources like in [47]. Here\
    \ the authors\ncombine the idea of “knapsack” problem with a linear\nprogramming\
    \ model proving satisfactory results. The novelty\nof our solution is that it\
    \ proposes a combination of supervised\nand unsupervised learning, where, according\
    \ to the nature\nof the data, clustering and/or machine learning methods\nare\
    \ used for task optimization in the use of resources,\nwhile improving the crop\
    \ quality. Nowadays, in WSN based\nsystems, two computational paradigms are arising:\
    \ edge and\nfog computing. Regarding farming and precision agriculture,\nin [48]\
    \ the edge computing paradigm has been used in order\nto make the data they use\
    \ more private. To obtain this, the IoT\nsensors (edges) preprocess and analyse\
    \ the private data and\nsend the results to a server, where the results to estimate\
    \ and\npredict the total harvest yield are gathered. In [49], the above\nparadigms\
    \ have been used to create a smart farm monitoring\nsystem. The works previously\
    \ exposed deployed WSN inside\na building, but our solution deploys it in open\
    \ fields. IoT\ndevices are in the open field, so it is difficult to use a computer\n\
    with enough computing power to process all this data in\na fog computing way.\
    \ Furthermore, if the devices are not\nlightweight and compute the data in an\
    \ edge manner, the\nenergy consumed would be greater and it would mean that it\n\
    is needed to spend resources considering the batteries. That is\nwhy, instead\
    \ of trying fog or edge computing paradigms, we\nmust use the cloud computing\
    \ one.\n3. Multiagent Architecture Methodology\nThe main goal of this research\
    \ consists in the design and\ndevelopment of a new and innovative multiagent architec-\n\
    ture based on virtual organizations, capable of managing\nthe information collected\
    \ by wireless sensor networks (e.g.,\nWi-Fi, Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPS, and GPRS)\
    \ for knowledge\ndiscovery and decision making in rural environments. The\nimplementation\
    \ of a prototype of this architecture has been\ndeveloped with Java (64-bits)\
    \ under the Java Agent Develop-\nment framework (JADE). The tests have been performed\
    \ on\na PC server model: PowerEdge R330, CPU: 4 CPUS x Intel\n\x02 Xeon \x02 CPU\
    \ E3-1220 v6 @ 3.00GHz, RAM: 31.83 GB, OS:\nVMware ESXi 6.5, and HDD: 1T.\nWireless\
    \ Sensor networks (WSNs) fall into the cate-\ngory of complex, distributed, interconnected\
    \ and rapidly\nchanging systems. Multiagent systems (MAS) have been\nidentified\
    \ as one of the most suitable artificial intelligence\nparadigms in the development\
    \ of WSNs, since MASs are\nrobust and autonomous in providing formalisms, algorithms,\n\
    and methodologies in satisfying the challenging needs of\nWSNs. Specifically,\
    \ MAS provide adaptiveness, decentralised\ncontrol, large scale, information uncertainty,\
    \ resource bound-\nedness, and physical distribution [23].\nThe proposed multiagent\
    \ platform will be built over the\ncloud computing paradigm to provide better\
    \ flexibility and\nhigher scalability for handling both, small- and large-scale\n\
    projects (e.g., individual homes, large hospitals, or even smart\ncities). Cloud\
    \ Computing can offer a very powerful, reli-\nable, predictable, and scalable\
    \ computing infrastructure for\nrunning multiagent systems by implementing agent-based\n\
    complex applications. These applications can rely on cloud\ncomputing infrastructures\
    \ to access and use vast amounts\nof processors and data. One key feature of software\
    \ agents\nis intelligence to solve complex problems. Such intelligence\ncan be\
    \ obtained through the collaboration of several agents\nrunning in a distributed\
    \ environment. The choice of cloud\ncomputing meets the requirements of MAS, providing\
    \ a\ndistributed environment and ensuring low runtimes and high\nperformance.\n\
    3.1. Multilayer and Multiagent Architecture. This subsection\ndescribes the multilayer\
    \ organization of the multiagent archi-\ntecture proposed in Figure 1. Each layer\
    \ shows an abstraction\nlevel by involving a different degree of gathering and\
    \ process-\ning information. The abstraction level implemented in each\nlayer\
    \ allows it to isolate itself from the responsibilities of its\nneighbouring layers.\
    \ This also makes it possible to decouple\nand reuse system components, giving\
    \ a greater adaptation to\nthe environment. Then, the responsibilities of each\
    \ layer can\nbe described as follows:\n(i) Layer 0: This layer is the physical\
    \ one, in which the\nnetwork of sensors and actuators of the system is\ndeployed.\
    \ Those devices can be based on different\ntechnologies and communication protocols,\
    \ Wi-Fi,\nBluetooth, ZigBee, GPS, GPRS, etc., depending on\nthe characteristics\
    \ of the terrain where the system is\ndeployed.\n(ii) Layer 1: This is the data\
    \ receiving layer, which contains\nthe agents responsible for capturing the information\n\
    from the sensors and routing them to the upper layers\nto transform them into\
    \ a common format defined in\nthe platform. This layer is also responsible for\
    \ routing\nthe orders obtained from the upper layers to the\nactuators.\n(iii)\
    \ Layer 2: This is the data transformation and storage\nlayer. In this layer,\
    \ the data are transformed to a\ndetermined format, depending on the purpose for\n\
    which they will be used. For example, data collected\nfrom sensors need to be\
    \ merged before they are\nanalysed in the upper layers or are requested by\nactuators\
    \ in the physical layer. This layer is also\nresponsible for storing the captured\
    \ data to create a\nhistory for further analysis.\n(iv) Layer 3 (data analysis\
    \ layer): This is the layer where\nknowledge is discovered through the agents\
    \ responsi-\nble for the analysis of the collected information. This\nlayer defines\
    \ agents in charge of performing com-\nputations and applying supervised and unsupervised\n\
    learning techniques. Therefore, this layer makes it\npossible to take decisions\
    \ based on the collected data,\ngiving the most important part of the intelligence\
    \ of\nthe system.\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n5\nCloud management\
    \ layer\nPERSISTENCE\nDEPLOYMENT\nCOMPUTATION\nLAYER 0: Physical layer implementing\
    \ the deployment of\nsensors based on different technologies, Namely, Wi-Fi,\n\
    Bluetooth, ZigBee, GPS, GPRS,...\nLAYER 1: Data receiving layer, agent virtual\
    \ organization\nresponsible for capturing data from sensors and sending\nthem\
    \ to be processed by other virtual organizations.\nLAYER 2: Data transformation\
    \ layer, agent virtual\norganization responsible for transforming data to\ndetermined\
    \ formats, compatible with the architecture.\nLAYER 3: Data analytics layer, agent\
    \ virtual organization of\nknowledge discovery from data gathered in LAYER 2.\

    \ processing data\nKnowledge discovery process and decision making\nLAYER 4: User\
    \ interface layer, agent virtual organization of\nuser interaction in charge of\
    \ performing the user requests.\nMultilayer and Cloud Computing Architecture\n\
    for Knowledge Discovery from Rural Environments\nFigure 1: Organizational representation\
    \ of the agent-based multilayer architecture proposed for knowledge discovery\
    \ from rural areas. The\narchitecture has been designed under the cloud computing\
    \ paradigm.\n(v) Layer 4: This is the user interface layer, which interacts\n\
    with and fulfils the requests of system users. The rest\nof the layers back up\
    \ this layer to provide services such\nas process and device monitoring, analysis\
    \ of stored\ndata, and information visualization.\n3.2. Architecture Multiagent\
    \ System. The proposed architec-\nture’s multiagent system (MAS) is developed\
    \ based on virtual\norganizations (VOs), which perform previously defined tasks\n\
    in the architecture layers. As shown in Figure 2, several\nlinked VOs and agents\
    \ govern the proposed multiagent\nsystem, performing different roles to meet their\
    \ individual\ngoals that contribute to reaching the common goal of the\nsystem.\
    \ Each VO consists of a set of agents with specific roles\nwithin the organization.\
    \ Agents perform their tasks/roles and\ncollaborate with other agents from the\
    \ VO to achieve the\nobjectives of the organization. In addition, the introduced\n\
    MAS responds to the needs of each layer given in Figure 1;\nit has also been adapted\
    \ to manage and/or optimize the water\nflow in automatic irrigation systems for\
    \ crops. Thus, the aim\nof applying the MAS illustrated in Figure 2 to crop irrigation\n\
    systems is to incorporate intelligence into the irrigation\nprocess, allowing\
    \ the minimisation of water consumption.\nBelow, the roles of the agents and of\
    \ MAS VOs are described:\n(i) Manager agent (MA): This agent acts as a mediator\n\
    between VOs and agents defined in the MAS, and it is\nresponsible for coordinating\
    \ the operations between\nthem. The MA is primarily responsible for the man-\n\
    agement of agents that are encompassed within it.\nTherefore, it allows for the\
    \ creation and management\nof the life cycle of an organization or agent.\n(ii)\
    \ Heterogeneous data supervisor agent (HDMA): This\nagent handles communication\
    \ between the DRVO\nand DTVO organizations. Thus, HDMA receives all\nheterogeneous\
    \ data (data from different sensors have\ndifferent formats) collected by the\
    \ DRVO organi-\nzation and sends them to a specific agent in the\n6\nWireless\

    \ system for the control of irrigation in rural areas, such as\ncrops.\nDTVO organization,\
    \ which will convert the received\ndata into an internal common format and store\n\
    them in the corresponding database for their later\nretrieval. HDMA is also responsible\
    \ for providing\ndata (through the MA agent), in an indicated format,\nfrom the\
    \ previous VOs to the rest of entities in the\nMAS.\n(iii) Irrigation manager\
    \ agent (IMA): This agent manages\nthe automatic irrigation system in crops. This\
    \ agent\nconverts the results given by the KDVO organi-\nzation into an action\
    \ that is to be performed by\nthe irrigation control device. To do this, each\
    \ data\nanalysis result from KDVO is encoded to a bit\nsequence, which is interpreted\
    \ as an action or set\nof actions that are to be performed by the coupled\nirrigation\
    \ system. Such actions may be to start or stop\nwatering, increase or decrease\
    \ the water flow for a\ndetermined area of the crop, irrigate only a specified\n\
    number of crop areas, etc. In addition, this agent can\ncommunicate the activities\
    \ the irrigation system is\nperforming at any time, i.e., the activity that is\
    \ being\nperformed.\n(iv) UIVO virtual organization: This organization inter-\n\
    acts with the system users through a system interface\n(agent IA) where the user\
    \ can make requests in\nrelation to the activities being performed on the\ncrop,\
    \ obtain or analyse information from historical\ndata stored on the database,\
    \ and monitor sensors of\nthe crop or of a crop area. For such purposes, MA\n\
    and DAA agents communicate with the remaining\nentities (through the manager agent)\
    \ of the MAS to\nperform the tasks requested by users. Meanwhile, the\nMA agent\
    \ (in UIVO) starts the monitoring process\nthrough the DRVO organization and the\
    \ manager\nand HDMA agents. Also, the DAA agent starts the\nprocess of intelligent\
    \ analysis of the historical data by\nrunning the manager and HDMA agents along\
    \ with\nthe KDVO and DTVO organizations.\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\n\
    7\n(v) DRVO virtual organization: This VO groups the\nagents responsible for gathering\
    \ sensor data and is\ncomposed of an agent set, called DCAs (data capture\nagents).\
    \ Each DCA agent captures data from a sensor\ntype, so each agent is designated\
    \ for obtaining data\nfrom a particular sensor type, so that each agent\nmanages\
    \ several sensors of the same type and each\nagent is specialised in one type\
    \ of sensor. In addition\nto information gathered on the environmental fac-\n\
    tors measured by sensors, information such as crop\nidentifier, sensor, and area\
    \ where the sensor is located\nare also included. Note that the proposed architecture\n\
    and MAS have been designed to manage more than\none crop at a time.\n(vi) DTVO\
    \ virtual organization: This VO groups the\nagents that transform data from one\
    \ format into\nanother. Since data obtained from sensors in crops\nare heterogeneous,\
    \ it is necessary to convert such data\nto a common format that can be used by\
    \ the MAS.\nBasically, it is about converting the captured data\ninto the internal\
    \ structure of the database where the\nMAS implements and achieves the inverse\
    \ operation\nto such a conversion (i.e., from the database to\nanother format)\
    \ when it is requested. DTVO is also in\ncharge of storing converted data in the\
    \ corresponding\ndatabase and running queries on them. Each data\nformat agent\
    \ in this VO is an expert in one or more\nconversions of data formats. Note that\
    \ each database\nassociated with these agents corresponds to a different\ncrop,\
    \ in case the system manages more than one crop.\nFinally, DTVO is important for\
    \ the MAS because\nof the great number of heterogeneous data gathered\nfrom sensors.\n\
    (vii) KDVO virtual organization: This VO provides the\nMAS with intelligence by\
    \ incorporating agents based\non supervised and unsupervised learning. Thus,\n\
    KDVO oversees the knowledge discovery process\nfrom historical data which are\
    \ obtained from the\nsensors deployed in crops and stored in their corre-\nsponding\
    \ database. This allows us to find patterns in\nthe data and predict their behaviors\
    \ under different\ncircumstances. KDVO consists of five related agents\nas explained\
    \ below:\n(i) KMA agent: This agent provides the infor-\nmation needed by the\
    \ rest of agents of the\norganization to perform their tasks, so that\nKMA is\
    \ the link between external entities and\nthe VO; moreover, it determines the\
    \ agents to\nused and who will collaborate to solve data\nanalysis requests. Thus,\
    \ not all the agents of\nthe organization are used in a data analysis\nprocess\
    \ and the selection of the agents to be\nused depends on the type of presented\
    \ problem.\nFinally, KMA is also responsible for formatting\nthe collected data\
    \ to a dataset that can be\ngiven as input to the remaining agents of the\nVO.\n\
    (ii) CA agent: This agent collaborates with the rest of\nagents of the VO by providing\
    \ complex compu-\ntations from the data. CA applies predetermined\nformulas (statistical\
    \ computation) to collected\ndata such as temperature, relative humidity, and\n\
    CO2, to figure out the needs of the crop. One\nof the aims pursued by the formulas\
    \ above is to\nreach a precision irrigation and fertigation, as\nwell as disease\
    \ and insect pest management. But\nCA is only a part of the whole learning process\n\
    that allows knowledge discovery.\n(iii) ULA agent: This is the unsupervised learning\n\
    agent, which implements algorithms to be run\non unlabeled datasets. ULA is useful\
    \ when data\nhave not been classified into different groups,\nfor which a decision\
    \ must be made. This agent\nincludes different clustering algorithms such as,\n\
    Agnes, Diana, and Eisen [50]. These algorithms\nare applied to group similar areas\
    \ based on\nvalues gathered from the sensors located in\ndifferent areas of the\
    \ crop and make decisions\naccordingly. Note that a given crop area is\nidentified\
    \ by the values reported by its sen-\nsors. Hence, each area defines several sensor\n\
    groups of the same type. This way, each area\nis represented by an n-tuple (a\
    \ vector), where\neach component has a mean environmental\nvalue computed from\
    \ sensors of the same type.\nThus, the clustering algorithms group vectors\nstanding\
    \ for the features of each area of the crop.\n(iv) MLA agent: This agent performs\
    \ machine learn-\ning strategies when data are labeled to find\npatterns. This\
    \ agent builds classifiers whose pre-\ndiction is used in decision making or converted\n\
    to an action carried out in the crop. The above\nmeans that the resources used\
    \ in crops are\noptimized. This agent develops a Support Vec-\ntor Machine (SVM),\
    \ Artificial Neural Network\n(ANN) and naive Bayes classifier [51].\n(v) CBR agent:\
    \ This agent performs case-based\nreasoning and similarly to the agent above it\
    \ is\nconvenient for situations where there is a set\nof cases and experience\
    \ in decision making to\nsolve a particular type of problems. Based on\npast experience,\
    \ CBR retrieves the most similar\ncase to the one to solve and adapt the solution\
    \ to\nsolve the new case. The new case and its solution\nare stored in the corresponding\
    \ knowledge base\nwhich will be used in the future to solve new\nproblems. For\
    \ the case that concerns us, a\ncase is represented as a value n-tuple being\n\
    environmental factor captured from sensors\nlocated in different areas of a crop.\
    \ A case-\nsolution means an action to be performed in\nthe crop like irrigation,\
    \ fertigation, and disease\nand insect pest management, among others. In\ngeneral,\
    \ a solution to a case means a decision\nmaking on the target rural area. Furthermore,\n\
    8\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nthe Euclidean distance is used\
    \ by default to\nrecover similar cases from knowledge base. Note\nthat the CBR\
    \ agent manages a knowledge base\nfor each crop, if needed.\nFinally, consider\
    \ that not all agents in this VO must be used in\na case study. Agents to be used\
    \ as well as their collaboration\nto solve a case study depend on the characteristics\
    \ imposed\nby the case study.\nA cloud system has been employed, as it allows\
    \ us to\napproach in real time, to adapt the response in real time\nand the context\
    \ of the case study, although edge computing\nmay be a more suitable way to optimize\
    \ processes, reducing\nlatencies, and consumption of less bandwidth [52]. However,\n\
    our system sends all data to the cloud at all times, immediately\naccessing the\
    \ results of the analysis and evaluation of the\nstatus of all these sensors and\
    \ devices. Note that although\nthe proposed architecture does not develop a complete\
    \ Big\nData system, some of the Big Data features are present in\nthe different\
    \ VOs. Features such as data capture in DRVO,\ndata storage with different formats\
    \ in DTVO, intelligent\ndata analysis through KDVO, and visualization and querying\n\
    in UIVO are key to define an architecture following the\nprinciples of Big Data\
    \ analytics. Thus, our proposal has\ndeveloped the basis to manage in the future,\
    \ volume, variety,\nand velocity in generated data.\n4. Case Study on Irrigation\
    \ in Corn Crops\nThis section details how the presented architecture adapts\n\
    to efficient management of agricultural environments. The\narchitecture adapts\
    \ to factors that change frequently (weather\nconditions) and have a critical\
    \ impact on the development\nof crops. Because the architecture is agent-based,\
    \ it has\nfeatures such as self-adaptation to dynamic environments,\nwhich allows\
    \ us to manage data from a variety of sources,\nextract knowledge, learn from\
    \ previous actions, and make\ndecisions within the context in which the system\
    \ is deployed.\nThe architecture monitors the factors that impact the crops’\n\
    watering needs; by controlling the irrigation system it covers\nthe hydrological\
    \ part and at the same time optimizes the use\nof water in crop irrigation.\n\
    4.1. Description of the Corn Crop. This subsection details\nthe scenario in which\
    \ the architecture based on virtual\nagent organizations has been implemented.\
    \ The architecture\nhas been deployed on an agricultural land of 40ha used\nfor\
    \ the cultivation of corn in the province of Salamanca,\nSpain (Table 1). This\
    \ allowed us to measure the architecture’s\neffectiveness in terms of adaptation\
    \ to the context, data\nmanagement, analysis, and optimization decisions in the\n\
    process of irrigating the crop. The surface of the crop was\ndivided into two\
    \ parts, one in which the corn will be\ntraditionally cultivated by irrigation\
    \ with pivot (control crop)\nwhile the other part involves irrigation with pivot\
    \ but the\nsystem will be managed through our platform (test crop).\nThe corn\
    \ crop is characterized by being a short-cycle crop\nand with a variable water\
    \ demand during the growth stage.\nThe crop surface was loose and aired at the\
    \ time of cultivation,\nTable 1: Geological characteristics of the corn crop in\
    \ the case study.\nCultivation area\nSize (ha)\n20\nSurface texture (0 - 30cm)\n\

    \ In the case study, the\nPioneer P0837 model of the Pioneer Hi-Bred-FAO 500 cycle\n\
    marketer was used. In Table 2, we can see the rest of the\ncharacteristics of\
    \ the crop.\nThe ideal temperature for the growth of the corn crop\nis between\
    \ 25 and 30∘C. It needs a lot of sunlight and in\nhumid climates its performance\
    \ is lower. For germination\ntaking place in the seed, the temperature must be\
    \ between 15\nand 20∘C. For the fructification stage, temperatures of 20 to\n\
    32∘C are needed. Temperatures below 8∘C and above 30∘C can\ncause serious problems\
    \ for the crop due to poor absorption of\nmineral nutrients and water.\n4.2. Description\
    \ of the Irrigation. The traditional method\nof watering crops was called flood\
    \ irrigation. Since a few\nyears, this method has been replaced by drip irrigation.\n\
    However, automotive irrigation has many advantages over\ndrip irrigation because\
    \ it is more efficient; it covers long\ndistances and adapts to the plot and above\
    \ all; it allows\nautomating the irrigation process. This case study uses a pivot\n\
    that has a circular displacement, so the distribution of water is\nvery uneven\
    \ along the side: little water is needed at the centre,\nbeing further away from\
    \ the centre leads to the requirement\nof more water as there are more square\
    \ meters to cover. The\ntowers are moved by small electric motors (0.5-1.5 HP)\
    \ at very\nslow and adjustable speed. While the machine is advancing,\nirrigation\
    \ is taking place. Then, the pivot used in the corn\nWireless Communications and\
    \ Mobile Computing\n9\n55m\n14m\nFigure 3: Structure of the pivot used in the\
    \ presented case study.\ncrop (see Figure 3) consists of 3 towers of 55 meters\
    \ and\nan overhang of 14 meters with a high-speed motor of 1.5HP\nat 86rpm at\
    \ 60Hz that moves at 2.3m/min. The end-gun is\nlocated at the tip of the overhang\
    \ with a section of 127, and\nthe sprinklers are rotor type, with a ground clearance\
    \ height\nof 4.40m. The system has a 52,000l sprinkler chart to cover\nthe needs\
    \ of a 20ha land.\nThe pivot irrigation system is automated by the IMA\nagent.\
    \ This agent makes decisions based on the information\ncollected from the WSN\
    \ and sends commands to the irri-\ngation control device. The deployed WSN allows\
    \ the agents\nfrom the DRVO VO to collect the data necessary to determine\nthe\
    \ amount of water the crop needs and to command the\npivot to move and irrigate.\
    \ WSN sensors collect temperature,\nhumidity, wind, height, or light hours temperature.\
    \ These\nparameters influence the water needs of maize and allow\nthe architecture\
    \ to adjust irrigation and in this way optimize\nwater consumption. When temperatures\
    \ are high, plants will\nabsorb more water from the soil, as perspiration increases.\n\
    The corn crop that is at sea level needs more water because the\nsoil in which\
    \ it grows is warmer than that of a crop growing\nat higher altitudes. Ambient\
    \ humidity provides the amount\nof actual water vapour contained in the air and\
    \ the amount\nof water vapour it would need to contain to saturate it at the\n\
    same temperature. Wind causes water to be lost or the land to\ndry faster.\nTo\
    \ control the above issues, the KDVO virtual organi-\nzation is in charge of finding\
    \ out how much water a crop\nloses through evapotranspiration, ETc. This amount\
    \ of water\nis defined as the crop’s water requirement and it must be\nsupplied.\
    \ The CA agent calculates the water lost by ETc evap-\notranspiration using the\
    \ climatic parameters (temperature,\nhumidity, wind, precipitation, and solar\
    \ radiation). To this\nend, the Penman Monteith [53] method was used in the\n\
    architecture to determine the evapotranspiration rate, ETo.\n\U0001D438\U0001D447\
    \U0001D450 = \U0001D438\U0001D447\U0001D45C ∗ \U0001D43E\U0001D450\n(1)\nwhere\
    \ \U0001D438\U0001D447\U0001D450 is the evapotranspiration of the test crop (in\n\
    mm/day), \U0001D438\U0001D447\U0001D45C is the evapotranspiration of the control\
    \ crop\n(in mm/day), and \U0001D43E\U0001D450 is the coefficient of the crop (in\
    \ the case\nof maize it is 0.40 in initial period, 1.15 in mid-season, and\n0.70\
    \ in total [54]).\n\U0001D438\U0001D447\U0001D45C = \U0001D43E\U0001D45D\U0001D438\

    \ control evapotranspiration (in mm/day),\nKp is the corduroy coefficient, and\
    \ \U0001D438\U0001D45D\U0001D44E\U0001D45B is the evaporation\nof Class A Pan\
    \ (in mm/day) [55]. In addition to the plant's\nwater requirements due to evapotranspiration\
    \ losses, it is\nnecessary to calculate the net water requirements of the\ncrop\
    \ (Nn). To optimize the water used in irrigation, the\nsystem must consider the\

    the water used by the pivot. However, not all rainfall is\nuseful; among other\
    \ factors losses are caused by excessive\ndryness, wind, or runoff. For this reason,\
    \ the architecture\nconsidered 75% of precipitation as effective precipitation\
    \ (Pe).\nWith effective precipitation, the system has estimated net\nrequirements\
    \ (Nn) for maize in mm/month. The architecture\ncalculated the amount of water\
    \ that the cultivated area (Nn)\nhas to receive in order to satisfy the needs\
    \ of the plants\nand have the maximum possible production, insofar as it\ndepends\
    \ on the water. In calculating net requirements, it was\nconsidered that the case\
    \ study uses a central pivot irrigation\nsystem, which has an efficiency ratio\
    \ of 85%. In Table 5 we can\nsee the needs of the corn cultivation.\nAs the pivot\
    \ used in the case study has 3 towers with a\nseparation of 55m each and an overhang\
    \ of end-gun (14m),\nthe last tower is located 165m from the central pivot. In\n\
    addition, the pivot moves at a speed of 1.6m/min, so it needs\nas much time as\
    \ follows.\nTime = 2\U0001D70F ∗ 165\n2.3\n= 450.52min = 27031.2\U0001D460\n=\
    \ 7ℎ 30min\n(9)\nIn a full turn, the pivot needs 7 hours and 30 minutes\napproximately\
    \ to water the 20ha. This allows for a sufficient\nnumber of irrigations per month\
    \ to cover for the needs\nof the crop (7). With the time required by the pivot,\
    \ the\nirrigation frequency of the pivot and the minimum flow rate\nare calculated.\
    \ To calculate the least flow rate feeding the\npivot, attention is paid to the\
    \ needs of the maize crop, the area\nunder cultivation, and the time available\
    \ for irrigation (value\nset at 18h), according to formula (5).\nThe pivot has\
    \ used 1002.06mm (1002.06l/m2-10020.6m3/\nha) over the time the corn crop was\
    \ cultivated, as shown in\nTable 6. These results were obtained with the traditional\
    \ pivot\nirrigation system.\nThe following are the changes brought about by the\n\
    architecture designed to achieve savings in the amount of\nwater used to irrigate\
    \ the crop. As shown in Figure 4, the\ngoal of optimizing the irrigation system\
    \ is to identify the\ncrop areas with greater and lesser irrigation needs; these\
    \ are\nidentified by the multiagent system (MAS) and the irrigation\nsystem supplies\
    \ water to these areas. Since each area is\ncharacterized by distinct features,\
    \ a set of different types of\nsensors is deployed in each one, in order to measure\
    \ different\nsoil, plant, and environmental parameters. Then, each area in\nthe\
    \ figure is identified by the MAS through a vector of values\ngiven by the sensors.\
    \ Once the feature values are obtained\nfor each area of the crop, the Agnes clustering\
    \ algorithm\n(Euclidean distance used as a metric in the data) is run by\nthe\
    \ MAS (KDVO virtual organization) to build similar area\nclusters. KDVO runs the\
    \ ULA agent by passing a dataset\nwith the feature of each area of the crop. The\
    \ ULA agent\nruns the Agnes clustering algorithm to identify different crop\n\
    subtypes; in this case, two subtypes of crops (irrigation and\nnonirrigation)\
    \ have been identified for all areas given in the\ninput dataset. Therefore, the\
    \ clustering algorithm will find\ntwo area groupings (clusters) with different\
    \ features: one\ngrouping may show that its areas need to be irrigated with\n\
    less or more water, whereas the other grouping can indicate\nthat they do not\
    \ require any irrigation. Then, once the areas\nhave been classified into two\
    \ groups (or more if needed),\nthis result is sent to the IMA agent through the\
    \ manager\nagent. The IMA agent encodes the result-clustering into a bit\nsequence\
    \ (a binary number), which associates each area of\nthe crop with its need for\
    \ irrigation. The IMA agent sends the\nbit sequence to the irrigation control\
    \ device, which interprets\nsuch a sequence as an order that becomes an irrigation\
    \ action\nfor the crop.\nThus, the goal of detecting similar area clusters is\
    \ to\nmanage and optimize the irrigation system. The MAS clusters\nsimilar areas\
    \ (in this case study, two types of area clusters) of\nthe crop to optimize the\
    \ water flow per area. In this case study,\nwe have selected two clusters, identifying\
    \ the areas that need\nmore or less water. Thus, the MAS builds a binary number\n\
    whose digits are related to each area. “1” means that the\ncorresponding area\
    \ needs irrigation while “0” means that no\nirrigation is necessary for that area.\
    \ Therefore, the irrigation\nsystem will just supply water (less or more water)\
    \ in areas with\nvalue “1” as shown in the irrigation system shown in Figure 4.\n\

    \ presented an architecture based on virtual\norganizations that allows localized\
    \ irrigation using a pivot.\nIt is an innovative approach that makes full use\
    \ of the\nadvantages of pivot irrigation (more economical choice)\nand the advantages\
    \ of localized irrigation (lower water con-\nsumption), eliminating the disadvantages\
    \ of pivot irrigation\n(higher water consumption vs. localized irrigation). The\
    \ use\nof a system of agents in this efficient water management\nproblem allowed\
    \ us to monitor the status of the corn crop\nand coordinate the pivot to irrigate\
    \ in localized areas releasing\nthe necessary amount of water. The hypothesis\
    \ proposed in\nthis study (that the consumption of water used for pivot\nirrigation\
    \ is similar to the amount of water required if\nthe localized irrigation method\
    \ is used) combines a series\nof needs (sensor data collection, fusion of information,\n\
    information processing, and decision making, among others)\nthat makes it necessary\
    \ to develop an architecture based\non an organization of virtual agents which\
    \ controls all the\nparameters that influence the irrigation decision (temper-\n\
    ature, humidity, wind, radiation, precipitation, soil salinity,\netc.) in a crop\
    \ by means of a WSN.\nAgent-based virtual organizations use data from the\nsensor\
    \ network deployed in the area of the case study crop.\nThe results showed that\
    \ the use of a VO MAS system was\nessential for optimizing the water used in crop\
    \ irrigation. The\npossibility of programming the pivot to irrigate allows the\n\
    VO MAS to send the architecture’s orders to the irrigation\nsystem, with the aim\
    \ of optimizing the amount of water used\nand the frequency of irrigation according\
    \ to the climatic\n12\nWireless Communications and Mobile Computing\nTable 7:\

    \ From the results of the case study, we can\nsee that the performance of the\
    \ system allowed obtaining a\nreduction of 12.68% with respect to the crop area\
    \ that was\nmade by pivot but was not controlled by the VO MAS. Since\nthe percentage\
    \ was higher than 11%, we can deduce that\nthe MAS VOI achieves similar saving\
    \ to localized irrigation.\nHowever, MAS VOI does not entail the disadvantages\
    \ that\nlocalized irrigation does, for example, the difficulties in\nhaving to\
    \ deploy a distribution network in each harvest, the\ndifficulties when using\
    \ machinery on the surface of the crop,\nand the complication of deploying it\
    \ in large areas.\nFinally, automotive irrigation was used thanks to the\npossibility\
    \ of automating irrigation. It was even possible to\nirrigate only certain areas\
    \ of the crop surface if the architec-\nture decided so, according to the collected\
    \ data. Although\nlocalized irrigation consumes 11% less than automotive irri-\n\
    gation according to the literature, the fact that automotive\nirrigation was managed\
    \ by the architecture allowed us to\nobtain a higher optimization percentage.\
    \ Complementing\nthe above, we want to stress that, due to the ability of the\n\
    proposed architecture and its multiagent system to adapt and\nbe extensible, it\
    \ can be applied to other types of crops and\nwith a different geometry.\nData\

    TAUSIFA JAN SALEEM∗AND MOHAMMAD AHSAN CHISHTI†

    Abstract.

    The plethora of sensors deployed in Internet of Things (IoT) environments generate
    unprecedented volumes of

    data, thereby creating a data deluge. Data collected from these sensors can be
    used to comprehend, examine and control intricate

    environments around us, facilitating greater intelligence, smarter decision-making,
    and better performance. The key challenge here

    is how to mine out proﬁcient information from such immense data.

    Copious solutions have been put forth to obtain valuable

    inferences and insights, however, these solutions are still in their developing
    stages. Moreover, conventional procedures do not

    address the surging analytical demands of IoT systems. Motivated to resolve this
    concern, this work investigates the key enablers

    for performing desired data analytics in IoT applications. A comprehensive survey
    on the identiﬁed key enablers including their

    role in IoT data analytics, use-cases in which they have been applied and the
    performance results of the use-cases is presented.

    Furthermore, open research challenges and future research opportunities are also
    discussed. This article can be used as a basis to

    foster advanced research in the arena of IoT data analytics.

    Key words: Internet of things, Big Data, Data Analytics, Data Mining, Machine

    1. Introduction. IoT is regarded as the vital research paradigm in the current
    epoch. It has dramatically

    revolutionized every facet of our lives. This technology is characterized by enormous
    amounts of smart devices

    that cooperate seamlessly with each other by means of a global network infrastructure,
    thereby facilitating

    a wide number of pervasive and ubiquitous applications spanning diverse ﬁelds
    [1].

    It is an ecosystem of

    smart devices, i.e., devices that possess sensing and processing eﬃcacies and
    can comprehend and respond to

    their surroundings via sensors and actuators. The blend of diverse technological
    advancements like near ﬁeld

    communication, Radio Frequency Identiﬁcation (RFID), real-time localization, embedded
    systems, and the

    networking expedite the conversion of day to day entities into smart entities
    [2]. These entities are incorporated

    impeccably into a web like framework so that they can communicate with one another
    and with other cyber

    agents so as to accomplish goal-oriented tasks [3]. IoT enables sensors and objects
    to interact coherently within

    smart environs and facilitates information transfer in a suitable manner. The
    continuum of devices in IoT are

    connected via several diverse access networks and communication solutions equipped
    with technologies such as

    RFID, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN), Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, ZigBee, GSM etc. [4]. Over
    30 billion [5] devices

    ranging from smart phones, to vehicles are prophesied to be linked to the Internet
    by 2020. The large number of

    sensors deployed in IoT environments continuously generate unprecedented volumes
    of structured, unstructured

    and semi-structured data (Big Data), that cant be handled by conventional processing,
    storage and analytical

    systems [6]. Data generated from IoT is diﬀerent from traditional data in following
    ways [7]: (i) data is generated

    continuously at high speed, (ii) Apart from structured data, data may be of semi-structured
    or unstructured

    nature as well, (iii) data sources are diverse and fully distributed, and (iv)
    integration of multi-modal data

    becomes complex.

    The fundamental objective of IoT is to augment the standard of living. Nevertheless,
    this vision is based

    on being able to eﬃciently process, analyze, and comprehend the data generated
    by IoT devices [8]. Hence,

    analyzing IoT data in order to divulge trends, concealed patterns, hidden correlations,
    inferences, and action-

    able insights is crucial for dispensing elite services to IoT users. In this regard,
    investigating the technological

    advancements that can assist in analyzing unstructured and semi-structured data
    apart from structured data, in-

    tegrating the data from heterogeneous data sources, performing real-time analytics
    in delay critical applications

    as well as in optimizing the process of data analytics becomes indispensable.

    1.1. Related Surveys. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the ﬁrst of this
    kind that investigates

    the key enablers for IoT data analytics and surveys their role in the IoT use-cases.
    There are few research works

    in the literature that have surveyed data analytics in IoT applications, however,
    the focus of those research

    works is diﬀerent from the prime concern of this article. The main focus of this
    article is on the key enablers for

    IoT data analytics, the use-cases in which they have been applied, their purpose
    in those use-cases, the datasets

    that have been used, and the performance results of the use-cases.

    In [9], Siow et al. have reviewed the applications of IoT data analytics across
    diﬀerent domains. Moreover,

    the article proposes taxonomy for IoT data analytics in order to guide future
    research in the ﬁeld. The focus

    of the paper is the enabling infrastructure for IoT data analytics that includes
    data generation, data collection,

    data aggregation and integration, storage technologies etc. However, the article
    lacks the detailed survey on the

    enablers like data mining techniques, machine learning techniques, dimensionality
    reduction techniques, time

    series forecasting, etc.

    The work in [10] by Ahmed et al.

    investigated the latest developments in big data analytics for IoT

    applications. Moreover, the opportunities created from the amalgam of big data
    analytics and IoT were also

    identiﬁed. Several research challenges in IoT data analytics were also discussed.
    However, the article lacks the

    comprehensive survey of the IoT use cases and the analytics techniques used.

    1.2. Contribution and Structure of Paper. This work provides a delineation of
    the present state-of-

    the-art in the realm of data analytics in IoT. More precisely, it:

    • investigates the key enablers for IoT data analytics

    • surveys the role of identiﬁed key enablers in IoT data analytics

    • identiﬁes the challenges that the research community still has to face in this
    arena.

    The rest of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 an introduction of
    IoT data analytics is provided.

    Section 3 presents the purpose of data analytics in IoT applications. Section
    4 discusses the key enablers for

    IoT data analytics in detail. Furthermore, the role of the key enablers in IoT
    data analytics is surveyed in this

    section. Section 5 highlights the challenges faced by IoT data analytics. Moreover,
    future research opportunities

    in the arena of IoT data analytics are also provided in this section. Section
    6 presents the concluding remarks.

    2. IoT Data Analytics. With the brisk advancements in sensing, communicating,
    analytic and actuating

    technologies, the vision of intelligent recognition, real-time observation, monitoring,
    and management is turning

    into reality [11,12]. The surfeit of sensors deployed in IoT environments generate
    masses of structured, unstruc-

    tured and semi-structured data, including health care data, logistic data, astronomical
    data, environmental

    data, etc. [13]. Data collected from these sensors can be utilized to comprehend,
    examine and control intricate

    environments around us, facilitating greater intelligence, smarter decision making,
    and better performance. The

    enormous amounts of heterogeneous and diverse data generated by millions of IoT
    devices (monitoring certain

    phenomenon) make traditional information processing solutions obsolete. This is
    because traditional informa-

    tion processing systems cannot handle such volume of data [14]. IoT data analytics
    refers to the analysis of

    every fragment of data generated from IoT devices at right time in order to extract
    intelligent insights [15]. It is

    receiving a wide range of attention from researchers and practitioners, as extracting
    intelligent insights from IoT

    data is a tricky task and demands a great deal of attention. The question of how
    to collect, aggregate, and an-

    alyze the data generated from IoT environs has become an important impediment
    that requires urgent solution

    [16, 17]. Data Mining and Machine learning may help in creating smarter IoT by
    extracting unseen patterns,

    hidden correlations, trends, inferences, and actionable insights, facilitating
    greater intelligence, smarter decision

    making, enhancing performance, automation, productivity, and accuracy. However,
    the unprecedented rise in

    the magnitude and intricacy of data pose novel challenges to these domains [18,
    19]. Moreover, it is crucial to

    formulate appropriate techniques for dealing with noisy, inaccurate, uncertain
    and real-time data. Furthermore,

    in several settings, it is indispensable to merge historical data with the current
    sensor data so as to draw out

    eﬀective insights [20].

    Most of the IoT devices continuously emanate massive volumes of time series data
    and such data are

    ephemeral in nature, thereby demanding real-time action. Consequently, apart from
    Big IoT data analytics,

    IoT demands one more category of data analytics, i.e., real-time analytics, to
    support time stringent appli-

    cations. Examples include self-driving cars, elder posture recognition, surveillance
    systems etc. Hence, the

    aforementioned applications demand fast data analytics with minimal delay. In
    such applications, transferring

    data to cloud for analysis is not feasible. The ﬁnest remedy for such time stringent
    IoT applications is to

    bring analytics closer to IoT data source in order to remove needless delays.
    However, bringing analytics closer

    to IoT data source puts forth a new set of challenges, including limitation of
    power, storage and computing

    resources [21].

    Fig. 3.1. Purpose of Data Analytics in IoT applications

    IoT data analytics can be categorized into three groups, descriptive analytics,
    predictive analytics and

    prescriptive analytics [10]. Descriptive analytics delineates what has occurred
    and what is going on. It assists

    in perceiving novel business challenges and opportunities by utilizing data aggregation
    and data mining tech-

    niques. Descriptive analytics use-cases include energy consumption [22], urban
    designing [23], etc. Predictive

    analytics describes what will happen and why. It envisages future conditions and
    states precisely with the aid

    of statistical models and prediction techniques. Predictive analytics use-cases
    include disease prediction [24],

    predicting energy usage [25], machine failure prediction [26], anomaly prediction
    [27], etc. Prescriptive analytics

    characterizes what to do and why it needs to be done. It employs decision support
    systems to explore diverse

    possibilities and provides recommendations for decision-making using optimization
    and simulation algorithms.

    Prescriptive analytics use-cases include failure risk management in industrial
    IoT [28], clinical process design

    and optimization in healthcare [29], etc.

    3. Purpose of Data Analytics in IoT Applications. IoT has brought colossal value
    to our lives by

    facilitating the growth of a myriad of business-speciﬁc and user-oriented applications
    in diﬀerent sectors. These

    applications have triumphed in providing massive beneﬁts to the users. Data analytics
    has a remarkable part

    in the development and success of IoT applications. It is used to extract meaningful
    inferences from IoT data

    and these inferences are generally in the form of intelligent control decisions,
    patterns, and statistics that assist

    IoT applications in powerful decision-making. Hence, utilization of data analytics
    in IoT applications bring

    immense beneﬁts including better services, improved productivity, automation,
    and smarter decision-making.

    Fig 3.1 presents the purpose of data analytics in IoT applications. Following
    presents a brief discussion on the

    IoT applications and the role played by data analytics in these applications.

    3.1. Smart Home. A smart home is an important development of IoT in which the
    dwellings are embodied

    with intelligence to provide smart services like user comfort, healthcare, security,
    remote monitoring and control

    of devices, energy conservation, etc. [30]. Smart homes provide a better standard
    of living by incorporating

    automation in the device access, control, and monitoring. The purpose of data
    analytics in smart home is

    to render intelligence in order to produce an interactive environment by utilizing
    foundational services like

    physiological and psychological state detection, image recognition, voice recognition
    etc. Analytics of smart

    home data help in tracking daily activities of the inhabitants, monitoring elderly
    behavior, optimization of

    energy consumption, ensuring security, health monitoring, etc.

    3.2. Smart Healthcare. Increase in the number of long-term illness cases and regularly
    aging population

    is putting a consequential burden on nowadays healthcare organizations. Consequently,
    there is a dire need to

    alleviate the stress on healthcare organizations whilst continuing to dispense
    exorbitant healthcare services to

    patients. IoT has been recognized as a prospective panacea to reduce the stress
    on healthcare organizations,

    thereby transforming healthcare into smart healthcare [31]. The purpose of data
    analytics in smart healthcare

    is to provide intelligence in order to ensure remote health monitoring, assist
    in early disease diagnostics, make

    novel ﬁndings in disease trends, etc. by utilizing foundational services like
    physiological and psychological state

    detection, image recognition, voice recognition, etc.

    3.3. Smart Industry. with the brisk advancement in communication, computing and
    manufacturing tech-

    nologies, production in industrial organizations is being shifted from digital
    to intelligent [32]. Smart Industry

    is a smart manufacturing system which integrates production and services together
    to meet the industrial re-

    quirements. The data generated from smart industry typically consist of data pertinent
    to machine logs and

    manufacturing processes.

    Analytics of such data results in services like condition monitoring of machines,

    fault detection and analysis, machine health management, production optimization,
    ﬂexible manufacturing, etc.

    [32,33].

    3.4. Smart Transportation. This system aims to exploit sturdy and leading sensing,
    computational

    and communication technologies in order to facilitate smart recognition, tracking,
    and monitoring of vehicles

    [4]. These technologies will capacitate vehicle-to-vehicle communication in a
    meticulous way without human

    arbitration.

    Moreover, incorporating IoT in transportation systems will provide smart services
    like traﬃc

    congestion management, route optimization, safe driving, etc. Furthermore, real-time
    information about the

    availability of parking slots, weather condition, road condition, engine health,
    equipment maintenance will also

    be provided [34].

    3.5. Smart Grid. Smart Grid is another consequential advancement of IoT for administering
    and dis-

    seminating electricity between suppliers and consumers in order to ameliorate
    eﬃciency, safety, reliability with

    real-time tracking and control [4]. Integrating IoT with electrical systems will
    facilitate services like optimization

    of power system performance, fault detection and analysis, security, reduction
    in operational and maintenance

    costs [35]. Sensors deployed in smart Grid continuously emanate data pertinent
    to control loops and security

    and the data generated demands fast analytics in order to optimize power consumption,
    predict future power

    supply needs, detect anomalies, etc.

    3.6. Smart Agriculture. Factors like increasing population and dwindling of cultivable
    land as a result

    of urbanization, demand extraction of the most out of available resources. Smart
    agriculture is a novel approach

    of accomplishing farming tasks by mitigating human endeavor and by eﬃcient utilization
    of farming resources.

    Smart agriculture employs advanced sensing, communication, computing and actuating
    technologies in order

    to facilitate services like climate control based on harvesting requisites, growth
    in productivity, automatic

    irrigation system monitoring, crop disease detection and prevention, soil monitoring,
    livestock monitoring, etc.

    [36]. Sensors deployed in Smart agriculture generate data pertinent to moisture
    content of soil, diameter of

    the trunk of plants, climatic conditions, humidity conditions, etc. and the generated
    data demand real-time

    analytics in order to facilitate aforementioned services.

    3.7. Smart Government. Governments can attain a number of beneﬁts from the amalgam
    of IoT and

    data analytics. Almost, all the tasks pertaining to government administration
    demand accurate analysis and

    prediction. Incorporating IoT and data analytics in the government functionalities
    will lead to better quality

    increase political trust,

    environmental monitoring, prediction and assessment of natural disasters, assessment
    of public demands, etc.

    [37].

    3.8. Smart Education. IoT and data analytics contribute to the competence of education
    systems to

    a greater extent by enabling services like eﬃcient online learning, teaching-learning
    optimization, classroom

    occupancy monitoring, content recommendation, learner behavior monitoring etc
    [38,39]. Moreover, Integrating

    IoT with education systems helps in motivating students, identifying weak and
    struggling students, learners

    progress assessment, and hence makes learning process eﬃcient.

    4. Key Enablers for IoT Data Analytics. From the discussion on IoT data analytics
    presented in

    section 2, it is apparent that recognizing and extracting the hidden information
    from IoT data is a pressing

    chore that surpasses the potential of conventional information processing and
    analyzing strategies. However,

    recent advancements in computational intelligence, data mining, and machine learning
    approaches are paving

    way for requisite data analytics in IoT. Fig 4.1 presents the key enablers for
    IoT data analytics. In the following

    subsections, we present an elucidation of these techniques in the realm of data
    analytics.

    4.1. Data Mining Techniques. Data mining is utilized to discover concealed patterns
    and information

    from the data generated by IoT devices. The main objective of the data mining
    procedure is to reveal implicit

    knowledge from the data and mutate it into a valuable shape. Data mining techniques
    are of three types:

    classiﬁcation, clustering and association rule mining.

    Classiﬁcation is a supervised learning procedure that uses a set of labeled data
    for training purposes to

    categorize data items into pre-deﬁned classes [4]. The prime goal of utilizing
    classiﬁcation in IoT is to predict a

    class for every instance of input data (unlabelled data). The set of labeled data
    is utilized for training to build

    the classiﬁcation model while as unlabelled data is classiﬁed by the classiﬁcation
    model. The objective of classi-

    ﬁcation is to develop a classiﬁer that learns the distribution of patterns in
    the set of labeled data. Classiﬁcation

    has been used in numerous IoT use-cases including real-time ECG monitoring [40],
    twitter sentiment analysis

    [41], ebola virus outbreak control [42], real-time monitoring of breast cancer
    patients [43], automatic people

    counter in stores [44], real-time fall detection system for elderly people [45],
    defect detection in machines [46],

    612

    T. J. Saleem, M. A. Chishti

    cardiac arrest prediction [47], video surveillance [48], rice disease monitor
    and control [49], real-time condition

    monitoring of electric machines [50], etc.

    Clustering is an unsupervised learning procedure that groups data items with similar
    characteristics together

    into the same cluster [18]. In other words, data items in the same cluster have
    identical traits and data items in

    diﬀerent clusters have highly disparate traits. Examples of IoT use-cases that
    utilized clustering include activity

    recognition [51], heart disease survival prediction [52], electricity load prediction
    [53], behaviour visualization

    of Sybil attacker [54], Type 2 diabetes monitoring [55], wormhole attack detection
    [56], weather data analysis

    [57], safe driving [58], gesture recognition [59], etc.

    Association rule mining includes recognition of frequently occurring attribute-value
    relationships. It assists

    in the creation of more qualitative information for eﬀective decision-making [18].
    Association rule mining focuses

    on discovering all the frequently occurring associations from a set of data items.
    It has been used in diverse

    IoT use-cases including data mining in medical applications [60], human activity
    recognition [61], extraction of

    usage patterns of devices [62], etc.

    Table 4.1 presents the purpose of data mining in the IoT use-cases mentioned in
    this sub-section.

    4.2. Machine Learning Techniques. Machine learning oﬀers the ability to systems
    to automatically

    learn and improve from experience without demanding the obligation of adhering
    to static program directions.

    Machines learning approaches craft an eﬀective correlation among input data instances
    and the output actions

    and are competent of accomplishing forecasting and decision-making tasks in IoT
    applications [20].

    These

    approaches are generally divided into three categories: supervised, unsupervised
    and reinforcement learning.

    Supervised learning techniques model dependencies and associations between the
    target prediction outcome

    and the input attributes so that outputs for upcoming data instances are forecasted
    depending on the associations

    it learned from the dataset [63,64].

    Techniques in this category include Linear Regression, Decision tree,

    Random Forests, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine
    (SVM) and Artiﬁcial

    Neural Network (ANN).

    Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that is used to forecast a real-valued
    output from the cor-

    relations learned from the training data. Linear regression presumes a linear
    correlation between the input

    predictors and the target output. Example of IoT use-case that utilized linear
    regression is energy consumption

    prediction in digital manufacturing systems [65].

    Decision tree follows a greedy strategy to classify data items by arranging them
    based on attribute values.

    Example of IoT use case that utilized decision tree is activity and movement recognition
    [66].

    Random Forest is a supervised learning technique in which a myriad of decision
    trees are trained on diﬀerent

    subsets of training set chosen randomly. Example of IoT use-case that utilized
    random forest is diagnosis and

    prediction of diseases [67].

    Naive Bayes is a supervised learning technique for performing multi-class classiﬁcation.

    It uses Bayes

    theorem for determining the probability of a class given a data item. Example
    of IoT use-case that utilized

    naive bayes is device problem detection [68].

    KNN is a supervised learning technique in which outputs for new data instances
    are predicted by exploring K

    identical data instances in the dataset and taking the mode of their output values
    as the predicted output for the

    new data instance. Example of IoT use-case that utilized KNN is appliance recognition
    in power management

    systems [69].

    SVM, a supervised learning technique is based on the concept of augmenting the
    margin, i.e., each of the

    two sides of a hyperplane that splits the linearly separable input variable space
    into two classes. Example of

    IoT use-case that implemented SVM is indoor acoustic surveillance [70].

    Artiﬁcial Neuron is the elementary computational unit in an ANN. It accepts one
    or more inputs and

    performs their weighted sum, which is then passed as an input to a non-linear
    function called as activation

    function. Example of IoT use-case that implemented ANN is intelligent intrusion
    detection [71].

    Unsupervised learning applies techniques on the input data instances to mine useful
    information, detect

    patterns and group the data instances so that valuable insights are obtained [63,72].
    These techniques include

    K-Means Clustering, Apriori and FP Growth.

    K-Means clustering is an unsupervised learning technique that is utilized in scenarios
    with unlabeled data.

    The objective of this algorithm is to group data items into a K number of clusters.

    Apriori is an extensively used algorithm for association rule mining. It is used
    for recognizing frequently

    occurring attribute-value relationships in the dataset. Example of IoT use-case
    that utilized apriori is human

    sequential movement prediction [74].

    Another procedure for association rule mining is FP Growth. Apriori utilizes a
    breadth-ﬁrst search approach

    to determine the set of frequently occurring data items and hence is quite expensive
    in terms of memory usage.

    While as FP Growth algorithm utilizes a depth-ﬁrst search approach. Example of
    IoT use-case that utilized FP

    Growth is early diagnosis of liver cancer [75], etc.

    Reinforcement learning algorithms learn incessantly from the experience of the
    environment in an iterative

    manner until they inspect the full range of feasible states [63, 76] e.g., Q-Learning.

    Q-learning is a reinforcement learning algorithm that is based on value instead
    of policy. It is an easy method

    for agents to comprehend how to proceed eﬃciently in controlled environments.
    It operates by continuously

    advancing its evaluation measures of the quality of speciﬁc actions at speciﬁc
    states. Example of IoT use-case

    that utilized reinforcement learning is predictive analytics in smart cities [77].

    Table 4.2 presents the purpose of machine learning in the IoT use-cases mentioned
    in this sub-section.

    4.3. Advanced Machine Learning Techniques. Apart from traditional machine learning
    approaches,

    various advanced learning approaches like deep learning, incremental learning,
    and transfer learning are also used

    to dig out valuable knowledge from IoT data. Deep learning is appropriate for
    modeling complex behaviours of

    Data Analytics in the Internet of Things: A Survey

    615

    diverse data sets and transfer learning is mostly useful for scenarios with limited
    data sets while as incremental

    learning means real-time learning. It is appropriate for the scenarios where data
    arrive over time in a sequential

    fashion.

    Deep learning is a representation learning approach that utilizes a hierarchical
    learning process to mine rep-

    resentations from data by making use of several hidden layers with non-linear
    transformations [78]. It oﬀers an

    exemplary solution for various classiﬁcation and recognition tasks as it encapsulates
    various levels of abstraction.

    It is appropriate for modeling complex behaviours of diverse datasets. Deep learning
    consists of diverse archi-

    tectures including Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM), Deep Belief Network (DBN),
    Convolutional Neural

    Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long Short Term Memory (LSTM),
    Auto-Encoder (AE)

    etc. RBM and DBN capture high-level representations of input data in an unsupervised
    manner. CNN works

    exceptionally well with image data. RNN and LSTM are utilized for time series
    forecasting. AEs are utilized

    for dimensionality reduction of high dimensional data. Deep learning models have
    been utilized in numerous

    IoT use-cases including transportation analysis [79], localization [80], air quality
    prediction [81], human activity

    detection [82], malware detection [83], traﬃc sign detection [84], crop recognition
    [85], fault diagnosis [86], plant

    classiﬁcation [87], pose detection [88], etc.

    Incremental learning means real-time learning. It is appropriate for the scenarios
    where data arrive over

    time in a sequential fashion [20, 89]. By means of their sequential treatment,
    these learning settings oﬀer an

    elegant inferencing scheme for processing big data. To make upcoming learning
    and data analytics eﬀective and

    beneﬁcial, data-rigorous use cases demand that the learning algorithms should
    have the ability of performing

    incremental learning so that knowledge base is built over time [90]. Examples
    of IoT use-cases that utilized

    incremental learning include ﬁre detection [91], self learning [92], outlier detection
    [93], etc.

    Transfer learning is mostly useful for scenarios with limited datasets. It is
    a machine learning approach in

    which the learning parameters of a modeled predictive task are exploited to improve
    generalization in a diﬀerent

    but related problem with limited data [94, 95, 96]. Transfer learning ensures
    better performance by saving time

    while modeling a predictive problem. Given the massive resource requirements of
    deep learning models on large

    and challenging datasets, transfer learning is admired in deep learning. Transfer
    learning involves the following

    steps:

    1. Select a related source task: A related predictive modeling problem with ample
    amount of data is

    chosen.

    2. Develop a model for the chosen source task.

    3. The model developed for the source task is then used as a starting point for
    developing a model on the

    actual task.

    4. Tune model.

    Examples of IoT use-cases that harnessed transfer learning include human activity
    recognition [97], micro-

    scopic image classiﬁcation [98], acceleration of neural network model execution
    [99], etc.

    Table 4.3 presents the purpose of advanced machine learning techniques in the
    IoT use-cases mentioned in

    this sub-section.

    4.4. Dimensionality Reduction Techniques. Data pre-processing is a vital step
    for eﬀectual machine

    learning and data mining. Most machine learning, time series forecasting, and
    data mining techniques may

    not be eﬀective for high dimensional data. Dimensionality means the number of
    attributes in the input data

    instances of a dataset. When the number of attributes in the input data instances
    is very huge as opposed to

    the number of instances in the dataset, certain algorithms struggle to train eﬀective
    and eﬃcient models. This

    anomaly is known as the Curse of Dimensionality [100]. To combat this curse of
    Dimensionality phenomenon,

    data downsizing techniques have been designed. These techniques are broadly classiﬁed
    into two types: Feature

    Selection and Feature Extraction.

    Feature extraction techniques create a new, smaller set of features that are able
    to capture most of the

    useful information [101]. These techniques consist of Principal Component Analysis
    (PCA), Linear Discriminant

    Analysis (LDA), and AEs.

    PCA generates linear combination of the original attributes.

    The new attributes formed are arranged

    according to their explained variance. Examples of IoT use-cases that utilized
    PCA include include soil moisture

    retrieval [102], face recognition [103], intrusion detection [104], structural
    health monitoring [105], network

    anomaly detection [106], machine health management [107], etc.

    LDA also generates linear combinations of original attributes. However, contrary
    to PCA, LDA doesn’t

    maximize the explained variance.

    Rather, it augments the separability between classes.

    Examples of IoT

    use-cases that implemented LDA include ECG classiﬁcation [108], event prediction
    [109], irrigation system

    surveillance [110], online activity recognition [111], intrusion detection [112],
    etc.

    AEs are neural networks that are trained to regenerate their original inputs.
    The idea is to structure the

    hidden layer to have lesser neurons than the input/output layers. With the result,
    the hidden layer learns to

    build a smaller representation of the input. Examples of IoT use-cases that utilized
    AEs include human activity

    recognition [113], privacy preservation in sensor data analytics [114], prediction
    performance improvement in

    sensor and wearable systems [115], botnet traﬃc detection [116], fault diagnosis
    [117], etc.

    Feature selection techniques ﬁlter irrelevant or redundant features from the dataset.

    These techniques

    include Genetic Algorithms. Genetic Algorithm accomplishes supervised feature
    selection. It eﬃciently selects

    features from high dimensional data sets where exhaustive search is not feasible.
    Examples of IoT use-cases that

    have utilized genetic algorithm include intrusion detection [118], medical image
    feature extraction and selection

    [119], pattern recognition [120], building energy optimization [121], gait analysis
    [122], etc.

    Table 4.4 presents the purpose of dimensionality reduction techniques in IoT use-cases
    mentioned in this

    sub-section.

    4.5. Time Series Forecasting. Most of the data produced by IoT devices are time-indexed
    [123]. And

    analyzing such data to extract relevant features, predict future instances, and
    to explore the relationship between

    multiple data streams is the main aim of time series modeling [124,125]. Time
    series data exhibit the property

    of autocorrelation i.e., the current value in the time series is correlated with
    the past values. In linear models,

    the current value depends linearly on the past observations while as in nonlinear
    models, the current value

    is a nonlinear function of past values.

    If the properties of a stochastic process ﬂuctuate with time, it is

    hard to forecast the future values from its observed time series, this phenomenon
    is known as non-stationarity.

    Time series modeling techniques include Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average
    (ARIMA), Hidden Markov

    Model (HMM) and Recurrent Neural Network (RNN).

    ARIMA is an extension of Auto-Regressive Moving Average [126]. Both of these techniques
    are used to

    forecast future instances in the series. However, ARMA cannot be applied in scenarios
    where data exhibit

    non-stationarity. In order to combat this problem, ARIMA was proposed. Since ARIMA
    is inherently linear,

    it is not able to model complex data patterns as opposed to approaches like HMM
    and RNN. ARIMA has

    been applied in various IoT use-cases including failure prediction in machines
    [127], weather forecasting [128],

    occupancy prediction in smart buildings [129], load prediction [130], building
    energy consumption forecasting

    [131], etc.

    HMM is eminent for its competence in modeling short-term dependencies between
    adjoining observations.

    However, it is not suitable for scenarios with long-term dependencies [132]. Examples
    of IoT use-cases that have

    employed HMM include anomaly detection [133], physical activity recognition [134],
    traﬃc control management

    [135], health monitoring [136], prediction of user mobility [137], detection of
    sitting posture activities [138], etc.

    RNN and its variants are highly eﬀective in modeling sequences with complex structures
    because of the

    following reasons:

    • They can extract patterns in time series data with long time lags.

    • They are Robust to noise and can perform prediction in the presence of missing
    values.

    • They are inherently non-linear which makes them suitable for modeling complex
    data patterns.

    • They provide support for multi-variate and multi-step forecasting.

    RNN suﬀers from vanishing/exploding gradient problem [139] due to which its performance
    gets degraded

    signiﬁcantly while modeling long input sequences. To overcome this problem Long
    Short-Term Memory (LSTM),

    a variant of RNN was designed, that works exceptionally well for long input sequences.
    Examples of IoT use-cases

    that have used RNN include activity recognition based on multi-sensor data [140],
    network traﬃc classiﬁcation

    [141], real-time deterministic control [142], weather forecasting [143], etc.

    Table 4.5 provides the purpose of time series forecasting techniques in the IoT
    use-cases mentioned in this

    sub-section.

    4.6. Computing Platforms. Cloud computing [144,145,146] and Fog computing [20]
    are two important

    models for managing the enormous volume of data produced from IoT environs. With
    the brisk growth of

    the IoT, the traditional cloud computing is facing stern issues, like undesirable
    network latency, and spectral

    ineﬃciency which does not make it suitable for scenarios requiring minimal latency,
    real-time treatment, and

    mobility support. Determined to resolve these issues, new paradigm transfers the
    functioning of cloud computing

    With the result network

    congestion is reduced and decision-making becomes fast. However, these fog devices
    generally do not have

    adequate storage and computational resources. Table 4.6 provides the comparison
    of these computing platforms.

    Examples of IoT use-cases that utilized cloud computing as the computing platform
    include industrial IoT

    big learning [148], hybrid systems for smart agriculture [149], disease diagnosis
    [150], disease prevention in

    precision agriculture [151], temperature control systems [152] etc.

    Examples of IoT use-cases that harnessed fog computing as the computing platform
    include preventive

    healthcare and assisted living in smart ambient [153], video surveillance [154],
    asset provisioning for crowd

    sensing applications in IoT [155], crime assistance [156], data analytics in smart
    cities using big data [157], etc.

    [155] proposed a fog based computing scheme known as Mist computing that provides
    cost-eﬀective resource

    provisioning for IoT crowd sensing applications.

    Apart from cloud computing and fog computing, another emerging computing paradigm
    known as crowd

    computing can be utilized for managing the data produced by IoT systems. In crowd
    computing, IoT devices

    deployed close to each other and with related interests can share computing and
    power resources so as to optimize

    the performance of the IoT systems [158]. Crowd computing has got a massive potential
    in IoT applications.

    frameworks that

    can be utilized for analyzing humongous volumes of data produced from IoT environments.
    Applying the right

    data analytical framework is fundamental for the successful development of an
    IoT application. Depending on

    the analytical requirements of IoT application, data analytics can be performed
    either in Cloud or near the IoT

    data source (Fog nodes). Table 4.7 summarizes big data analytical frameworks.

    4.8. Software Deﬁned Networking. Software Deﬁned Networking (SDN) is a novel technology
    that

    simpliﬁes network administration by segregating the control plane from the data
    plane, thereby centralizing

    the network intelligence [174]. It enables virtualization within the network and
    enhances networking capability.

    SDN fulﬁls following fundamental requisites of IoT applications:

    4.8.1. Network Management. Network management is a vital consideration in IoT
    for supervising

    the tremendous number of devices and the massive volume of data produced by them
    [175].

    SDN enables

    programmatically eﬃcient control mechanism and hides the complexities of network
    management from end

    users. It optimizes network management functionalities such as eﬃcient utilization
    of bandwidth, minimization

    of latency and load balancing.

    4.8.2. Eﬃcient resource utilization. Eﬃcient resource utilization is fundamental
    for improving the

    performance of the network [175]. SDN relieves the simpler edge devices from accomplishing
    the multifaceted

    networking tasks and utilizes the available resources eﬃciently [174].

    4.8.3. Energy Management. Massive number of data centers are deployed to process
    the humongous

    magnitude of data sensed by IoT devices. Consequently, large quantity of energy
    is utilized to power these data

    centers. SDN plays an important role in optimizing the energy usage as it maps
    the traﬃc eﬃciently to the

    suitable servers and switches oﬀ the other unnecessary devices in the data center
    [175].

    4.8.4. Security and Privacy. The utilization of ﬂow-rule-based traﬃc forwarding
    concept in SDN facil-

    itates secure control of ﬂows between the various devices in the network, which
    in turn improves the security

    and privacy of the data generated by IoT devices [175].

    SDN has been applied in numerous IoT use-cases including eﬃcient traﬃc management
    for emergency

    situations [176], intrusion detection [177], service delivery [178], traﬃc congestion
    avoidance [179], dynamic

    distribution of IoT analytics and eﬀective utilization of network resources [180],
    low latency anomaly detection

    in smart city [181], etc.

    5. Vision and Open Challenges. Data analytics has brought considerable beneﬁts
    to IoT applications.

    However, in order to leverage the full potential of data analytics in IoT applications,
    following major challenges

    need to be addressed:

    5.1. Data Pre-processing. In data pre-processing, noisy data are smoothened, ambiguities
    in the data

    are removed, and missing values are ﬁlled, thus making it suitable for further
    processing.

    Because of the

    622

    T. J. Saleem, M. A. Chishti

    constrained nature of IoT sensors and intermittent loss of connectivity, the massive
    scale of IoT data contains

    more irregularities and uncertainties, thereby complicating data pre-processing.
    Moreover, IoT data may contain

    missing and incomplete values that lead to poor data quality. Ensuring completeness
    in IoT data is vital for

    its data quality. Eﬃcient pre-processing techniques that can remove irregularities
    and uncertainties in the data

    and make it suitable for further processing should be researched.

    5.2. Data compression and redundancy reduction. Not all the data generated from
    IoT environments

    are useful. Also, there exists a high level of redundancy in IoT data. The closely
    deployed sensor nodes in IoT

    tend to capture similar information that leads to redundancy in IoT data. Redundant
    data not only lead to

    energy wastage but also dissipate the storage space. Moreover, it also aﬀects
    the feature extraction process.

    Hence, removing redundancy in IoT data and ensuring its uniqueness is crucial
    for its data quality. Eﬀective

    data compression and redundancy reduction techniques need to be employed so as
    to alleviate the burden of

    storage and analytics in such systems.

    5.3. Data Integration. How to integrate and analyze heterogeneous data arriving
    from distributed and

    diverse sources so that a uniﬁed view of these diverse data formats is created
    is an impediment to IoT data

    analytics.

    Deep learning is quite eﬀective in analyzing heterogeneous data.

    However, the severe resource

    requirements of deep learning algorithm limit its use in IoT applications. Hence,
    investigating the ways that

    will reduce the computational requirements of deep learning models becomes crucial.
    However, this should be

    done while preserving the accuracy of deep learning models.

    5.4. Visualization. Data visualization aims to make data more meaningful for further
    analysis and inter-

    pretation. However, inappropriate data visualization will diminish the signiﬁcance
    of the original data and may

    even thwart eﬃcient data analysis. Orchestrating visualization in IoT data is
    complex because of its massive

    scale. Moreover, visualization in case of highly heterogeneous and diverse IoT
    environments is a challenging task.

    Given the importance of appropriate data visualization, devising visualization
    techniques that are well-suited

    for the representation of highly complex IoT data becomes crucial.

    5.5. Expandability and scalability. The sharply growing IoT data bring in the
    challenges of expand-

    ability and scalability for the IoT analytical systems. Analytical paradigms that
    are proﬁcient enough to deal

    with progressively growing complex datasets are highly required. Running analytical
    techniques on distributed

    systems with parallel processing is the potential solution for this problem.

    5.6. Energy management. With the exponential growth of IoT data, transmission,
    storage, processing

    and analysis of such enormous data will certainly dissipate more energy.

    Energy consumption control and

    management solutions should be designed for such systems.

    5.7. Security and Privacy. Data generated from IoT environs are susceptible to
    external intervention.

    Hence, Authentication, authorization, and encryption techniques should be utilized
    to ensure security of IoT

    systems. However, conventional data protection solutions are not applicable to
    the IoT data because of its

    massive scale and highly diverse nature. To this purpose, design of novel Security
    and Privacy solutions for

    such systems becomes inevitable.

    6. Conclusion. Ample volumes of data have been generated since the previous decade
    with the escalation

    in the number of smart devices. Analyzing this voluminous magnitude of data so
    as to explore novel knowledge,

    forecast potential insights and to formulate management decisions is a vital procedure
    that makes IoT a laudable

    technology for enhancing the standard of our lives. The prime requisite for most
    of the IoT applications is an

    intelligent analytical mechanism that can carry out tasks like classiﬁcation,
    clustering, association rule mining,

    or time series analysis. However, conventional analytical procedures do not tackle
    the surging analytical needs

    of IoT systems. To this purpose, this paper identiﬁes the key enablers for IoT
    data analytics and surveys their

    role in data analytics. Furthermore, several challenges faced by IoT data analytics
    were identiﬁed so as to

    stimulate research directions in this arena. At last, it is worthwhile to state
    that data analytics has brought

    immense beneﬁts to IoT applications, however, a number of challenges still remain
    unaddressed, the list of

    which has been discussed. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the ﬁrst
    of this kind and we hope that

    this survey will be beneﬁcial for the researchers in the ﬁeld of Data Analytics
    to understand the key enablers

    and lead them to the direction of possible future research in this ﬁeld.

    A REVIEW ON THE ROLE OF MACHINE LEARNING IN AGRICULTURE

    SYAMASUDHA VEERAGANDHAM∗AND H SANTHI†

    Abstract. Machine learning is a promising domain which is widely used now a days
    in the field of agriculture. The availability

    of manpower for agriculture is not enough and skill full farmers are less. Understanding
    the situation of the crop is not that

    much easy to detect and prevent the diseases in the crop. It is also widely employed
    in various agricultural fields such as topsoil

    management, yield management, water management, disease management and climate
    conditions. The machine learning models

    facilitate very fast and optimal decisions. The model of machine learning involves
    with training and testing to predict the accuracy

    of the result.

    The use of machine learning in agriculture helps to increase the productivity
    and better management on soil

    classification, disease detection, species management, water management, yield
    prediction, crop quality and weed detection. This

    article aims at providing detailed information on various machine learning approaches
    proposed in the past five years by emphasizing

    the advantage and disadvantages. It also compares different machine learning algorithms
    used in the modern agricultural field.

    Key words: Machine Learning, Agriculture, Data Analysis, Training Methods and
    Sensors.

    1. Introduction. Now a days, agriculture is the major source in all over the world,
    it plays a vital role in

    the global economy. Many of the research projects and funding projects are continuously
    implement with the

    latest technologies. Increasing the yield of the crop, automating the work done
    for the crop, minimizing the

    manpower, reducing the disease ratio by detecting on initial stages with existing
    matched patterns and finally

    harvesting with machinery in minimum time [1]. Machine learning in agriculture
    implemented with different

    crops from sowing to harvesting using many techniques from different technologies
    like big data, artificial

    intelligence, drones and data mining. Using these technologies, for mapping with
    existing data to identify and

    fix the solution of frequent problems. And defining the machine with related scenario
    based on the weather

    conditions and the moisture position using sensors detectors.

    Agriculture in normal processing with manpower may have many problems with less
    expertise for knowing

    the crop complete processing, disease identification, appropriate pesticides usage
    on initial stages instead of

    spreading on whole crop, huge manpower utilization from sowing to harvesting of
    the crop. There may be many

    consequences to know everything about the crop and all types of crop manually,
    without having any experience.

    So, the new people working on the crop have diﬀiculties in knowing everything.
    Mainly the cost of the crop

    is very high because of utilizing everything on manpower. Even now a days many
    machineries are using in

    cultivating crops in agriculture and also manpower is needed to form sowing to
    harvesting, but many crop

    automation is not possible because of the crops depends on environment conditions
    and soil management [1].

    The Machine learning algorithms are processed on deep learning and artificial
    intelligence algorithms based

    implementations. Train the system with deep learning and automated with artificial
    intelligence combination

    mechanism. Using machine learning in agriculture trained the system with deep
    learning mechanism inbuilt with

    sensors intermediate for collecting and processing the data. Once the current
    status data is processed by the

    sensor then the machine understands the process of deep learning and also mapping
    with artificial intelligence.

    Machine learning in agriculture mainly depends on the existing dataset mapping
    with new data set processed

    by the sensor. Deep learning in agriculture also is a trend nowadays. Using the
    latest technologies on image

    processing with data analysis of existing models which matches with the results
    and its excellent outcome.

    These days we can overcome many problems and challenges on different agriculture
    fields and food production

    using deep learning mechanism. Deep learning used on different crop fields with
    natural language processing,

    speech recognition with learning, sensors to detect temperature on soil based
    on the crop and weather condition

    from sowing to harvesting of the crop [2].

    The usage of machine learning helps farmers to collect the information and data
    by using it in agriculture

    with the aid of information technology to make the best decisions on high output
    from the farms [3]. Machine

    learning algorithms can be used for many applications in agriculture; like crop
    suggestions based on the pest

    detection in plants, soil fertility, weed detection, yield cultivation of crops
    and plant disease detection based

    on the disease identification on early stages will recovery the plant so that
    automatically increase the crop. It

    is very important to minimize the utilization of pesticides as considering food
    quality and health measures of

    the people. Apart from monitoring environmental conditions on a farm, intelligent
    agriculture must analyse

    understand how weather circumstances cause environmental changes at the farm and
    how long-term crop

    cultivation brings about soil erosion or changes in the soil structure. Through
    minimizing water management

    we can save the water instead of wastage and use the same water for another crop.
    Monitoring a farm using

    machine learning can prevent low productivity of crops [4]. Using crop management
    improves the yield of the

    crop can take care from sowing to harvesting.

    2. Literature survey. In agriculture, using machine learning indicates using many
    crops. A previous

    study [5] explains the harvesting in date fruit orchard using robotics and Deep
    Learning mechanism. There are

    two pre-learning CNN mechanisms; namely, AlexNet and VGG-16. To construct a study
    machine imaginative

    and prescient system, also based on the high-quality image dataset of 5 data types
    for all maturity stages. The

    suggested method accomplish extremely good classification based on the diﬀicult
    dataset with matching ration.

    The high-quality pixel images data sets are used in future to improve mapping
    of different date fruit orchards.

    In another study [6] conducted on the graphical representation of modelling, primarily
    with the references of

    sparse linear additive and proposed processes to discover a sparse in part linear
    additive shape on development

    of directed open-chain graphical representation. The study updates the outcomes
    as a case study the use of

    variable dataset accumulated on the runtime of the plant manufacturing and also
    proposed view is tremendous

    for discovering strengthened variable or fixed based on temporary with proper
    output graph. They proposed

    a method regarding the energy-eﬀicient improvement management. Anyhow, the new
    approach that the team

    invented predicted to be applicable for various surveys which are primarily based
    on the statistical methods.

    Here, they mainly focused on the classification of normal additive samples, but
    their scheme can be without

    diﬀiculty, moved further with elaboration and naturally through involving arbitrary
    link models. Here they

    assumed the hill mountaineering approach for getting associated best results inside
    the fixed period.

    Machine learning is famous with its ability to achieve maximum on many domain-based
    technologies.

    Machine learning can be regarded the top-rated analytic tool for fog computing
    applications. Instead of modern

    day’s achievements, machine learning purposes and literature also plays a major
    role.

    The latest research

    gap defines fog computing.

    The research achievement of machine learning in three elements are resource

    management, accuracy and security. Machine learning is implementing mainly on
    resource management instead

    of accuracy and security in fog computing. Machine learning include cloud computing
    in one of the layers. Even

    many problems and challenges have been open-ended with these combinations. Even
    most of the challenging

    problems regarding safety measures used in cloud computing. Supervised learning
    in fog computing is one

    of the famous machine learning assignment. In the healthcare domain most of the
    applications have utilized

    machine learning and also many open challenges and issues are there in fog computing
    in machine learning [7].

    A prior study [8] has planned a correct and strong algorithm for a new mechanism
    to critically find the

    growth of cucumber using robotic harvesting automated process in agriculture.
    This algorithm is a different

    sort of implementations and mining methodologies of existing data to gain of cucumber
    field with extraordinary

    components. This mechanism combines vector elements with image pixels match to
    get the starting stage itself

    on next level onwards. Many outcomes of the yield were taken as the feedback as
    input for modelling and testing

    the final algorithm. This algorithm outcome of the application is more eﬀicient
    for harvesting the cucumber.

    Deep Learning resolves many diseases from detecting with proper data set and using
    pesticides with minimal

    quantity for curing the plants of the crop [9].

    Another study [10] explains crop prediction, implementing

    many techniques including artificial neural networks. Based on the artificial
    intelligence finding the soil state

    depending on the weather condition with maximizing the yield of the crop. Later,
    a study [11] referred around

    40 research papers defined as a survey on all the aspects of machine learning
    in agriculture. The reference papers

    appeared in standard journals with high cited papers and many are the reputed
    papers with implemented on

    all over the world on machine learning in agriculture. Machine learning in agriculture
    using sensor data on the

    agricultural field using artificial intelligence with high suggestions from sowing
    to harvesting.

    3. Machine Learning In Agriculture. The latest trend in agriculture using machine
    learning are im-

    plementing smart farming with latest techniques. Many recent mechanisms are using
    for farming to find soil

    moisture based on the type of crop with water management, disease detection and
    selection of pesticide with

    existing patterns, crop management. Machine learning consists of five major components
    as shown in Figure

    3.1. These five major components are 1). Collecting data from the farm 2). Stored
    data 3). Data pre-processing

    4). Train the model and 5). Performance metrics.

    Fig. 3.1. General process of machine learning

    3.1. Collecting data from the farm. Most of the researchers used different sensors
    such as temperature

    sensor, passive Infrared sensor, ultraviolet sensor, pH sensor, soil moisture
    sensor, humidity sensor, gas sensor,

    barometric Pressure, hyperspectral camera, multispectral camera, DSLR camera,
    NPK sensor, obstacle sensor,

    acoustic sensor, water level sensor, water quality Sensor, GPS sensor and MooMonitor
    sensor to collect the data

    about the soil fertility, yield of crops, climate condition, pest detection in
    plants, weed detection, identifying

    diseases, etc. This data gives more accurate results, but it is cost-oriented,
    time-consuming and also more

    diﬀicult to collect. A study [12] developed a robot with different sensors and
    it is collected various environmental

    factors that effects on soil such as soil temperature, pH value in soil, the intensity
    of sunlight, soil moisture,

    humidity etc. to grow a plant. Later, another study [13] proposed and designed
    an optical transducer to measure

    soil nutrients such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium, and these nutrients
    are called primary nutrients.

    Soil nutrient not only depends on primary nutrients and also having macronutrients
    and micronutrients [14].

    Generally, the soil fertility and environmental factors both are interrelated.

    Another study [15] developed a smart irrigation system for agriculture by using
    temperature, humidity

    and UV sensors. Soil fertility, types of crop and climate condition are the essential
    parameters for designing a

    smart irrigation system. So, while collecting soil nutrients, also collect environmental
    factors and type of crop,

    it will generate more accurate results for decisions from the data analysis. Hyperspectral
    Image of different

    crops by using hyperspectral cameras for crop classification have used in another
    study [16]. Later a study

    [17] has used the acoustic sensor for detecting insect’s pests in the underground.
    This sensor is mostly useful

    for detecting insects in underground crops like carrot, potato, groundnuts, onion,
    taro, turmeric, garlic, etc.

    A research collected [18] 83,260 and 16,652 colour images format as JPEG from
    wheat planting of Shandong

    586

    Syamasudha Veeragandham and H. Santhi

    Province, China, to train and test a model respectively for winter wheat leaf
    diseases by using Canon EOS 80D

    camera.

    3.2. Standard data repositories. The main benefit of the existing data is the
    researcher doesn’t want to

    spend money on collecting data. This data takes less time and also easy to collect,
    but it gives the less accurate

    results [19].

    This data is especially available in various websites.

    The researchers can download from the

    websites and performs the data analysis. The forms of data include images, tables,
    text, graphics, audios and

    videos. The following industries are mainly providing datasets for analysing the
    data by using machine learning

    algorithms in agriculture. UCI, MIT, Kaggle, University of Arkansas, Live tree,
    China Agro. and Econ. Data,

    Open Government Data, OpenAg, GitHub, Data. world, Knoema, USDA-ARS, V2 Plant
    Seedlings Dataset,

    Food and agriculture data, Pesticide Use in Agriculture and Soil Resources Development
    Institute are providing

    data to the data analysis.

    A study [20] used soil related data of upazila of Khulna district in Bangladesh
    for soil classification and

    crop suggestion, collected data from soil resources development institute, bangladesh.
    Another study [21] are

    collected from 3010 images of rice plants with diseases from the high-standard
    rice experimental field of the

    hunan rice research institute in China to detect the rice plant diseases. Another
    study [18] collected eight

    categories of 16652 images from Shandong Province, China to identify 8 different
    diseases from the wheat

    winter crops. And another study [22] collected 1070 real-time mango tree leaves
    images from shri mata vaishno

    devi university in the district of Katra located in Jammu and kashmir, India to
    identify the fungal disease

    named as anthracnose. This method is less expensive, easier to collect and cost-effective
    but the error rate is

    high and not suitable for all areas.

    3.3. Data pre-processing. The major issues in real-time data are inconsistent,
    duplication, noise and

    missing values. This type of dataset is very critical for analysing the process
    and increases the error rate.

    Data pre-processing performs on the raw data for further processing to enhance
    the quality of the data. Data

    pre-processing is major crucial step in machine learning to improve eﬀiciency
    while data processing.

    Pre-

    processing can removing the noise, inserts the missing values, the appropriate
    data range, and extracting the

    functionality etc. A study [21] used Two-Dimensional Filter Mask Combined with
    Weighted Multistage Median

    Filter (2DFM-AMMF) to remove the noise from the rice plant images. Majority of
    image related works are

    used segmentation and feature enhancement to improve the quality in data. Another
    study [23] removed salt

    and pepper noise by using Gaussian Median and Gaussian filter respectively to
    enhance the image quality to

    the 4-different crops and 2-weeds namely Paragrass and Nutsedge are chosen for
    classification. And another

    study [24] used Principle Component Analysis to remove the dimensionality and
    multicollinearity problems for

    water supply forecasting in the US West.

    3.4. Train the model by using machine learning algorithms. Machine Learning algorithms
    are

    classified into two types; Supervised Learning and Unsupervised learning.

    The use of machine learning in

    agriculture helps to a). Soil classification b). Disease Detection c). Species
    management d). Water Management

    e). Yield Prediction f). Crop Quality g). Weed Detection.

    3.4.1. Soil classification. Soil is classified based on its strength and property,
    it can be helps to grow

    the crop. Former uses the soil classification system for predicting the soil behaviour.
    Based on the chemical

    and physical properties of the layers of soil, soil can be classified and named.
    Soil classification can be used

    to identify the best crops and type of fertilizer based on the type of soil. Climate
    changes also plays a major

    role in soil management with water management.

    Using machine learning techniques, suggests associated

    procedures, moisture techniques concerning the temperature. A study[20] used Machine
    learning algorithms

    such as Gaussian kernel-based Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbour
    (k-NN), and Bagged

    Trees are used for soil classification, but proposed Gaussian kernel-based Support
    Vector Machines (SVM)

    based method performs better than the k-Nearest Neighbour (k-NN), and Bagged Trees.

    3.4.2. Disease Detection. Disease mainly depends on the weather and climatic conditions,
    soil charac-

    teristics and plant strength. Detection of disease based on climatic conditions
    and viral diseases are broadly

    pest and managing of disease utilization simultaneously. Disease detection also
    compares with a dataset as

    per the weather conditions and age of the plant. A study [21] compared two machine
    learning algorithms

    A Review on the Role of Machine Learning in Agriculture

    587

    such as combination of Fuzzy C-means and K-mean clustering(FCM-KM) + faster Region
    Convolutional Neu-

    ral Network(R-CNN) and faster Region Convolutional Neural Network(R-CNN) for detecting
    the rice plant

    disease such as rice blast, bacterial blight and sheath blight, but proposed combined
    of Fuzzy C-means and

    K-mean clustering(FCM-KM) + faster Region Convolutional Neural Network(R-CNN)
    performs better than

    the faster Region Convolutional Neural Network(R-CNN). This method is not suitable
    for large scale rice plant

    disease detection. A another study [3] compared 5-different machine learning algorithms
    such as Support Vector

    Machines (SVM), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Fuzzy
    and Conventional

    Neural Networks (CNN) for identification of different diseases in different crops.
    Among these 5-machine learn-

    ing algorithms, Conventional Neural Network classification is given more accurate
    results and also suitable for

    more crops. And another study [18] used Machine Learning algorithm such as Matrix-based
    Convolutional

    Neural Network (M-bCNN) for winter wheat leaf diseases by classifying 8 different
    leaf diseases such as normal

    leaf, mechanical damage leaf, powdery mildew, cochliobolus heterostrophus, bacterial
    leaf streak, bacterial leaf

    blight, leaf rust and stripe rust.

    3.4.3. Species management. Species Breeding: The selection of species is an important
    mechanism,

    based on the soil along with region weather conditions and water associated vitamins
    with good taste. Using

    deep learning procedures existing patterns, data sets are mapped for solving the
    many challenges instead of

    assumptions. A study [25] used Cascaded Support Vector Machine algorithm for classifying
    9-different sunflower

    seeds.

    Species Recognition: Manual selection of plants can be based on the leaves colour,
    age and shape of the

    plant. The selection of plant will be the first step of the crop and the roots
    of the plant concerning the age and

    veins colour on the leaves. A study [26] used 3- different classifiers like Color-Shape-Texture,
    Pixel and SIFT

    based to classify 5 categories of species like Flowers, Fruit, Leaf, LeafScan
    and Stem. A another study [16] used

    combination of Feature Band Set (FBS) and Object Oriented Classification (OOC)
    to classify different crops

    using Hyperspectral Images.

    3.4.4. Water Management. Water management plays a major role in every crop. Using
    a machine

    learning mechanism we can eﬀiciently use the water so that excess water will be
    used for another crop. Based

    on the crop and soil type we can provide the water daily, weekly and monthly.
    A study [27] used soil temperature,

    moisture and pH sensors to find the soil water content level in automatic water
    dripping system for agriculture.

    The main benefit of an automatic irrigation system is to correct water usage,
    power and time saving but it

    consumes more money from farmers.

    3.4.5. Yield Prediction. Every crop we suppose to concentrate as per yield prediction.
    Yield prediction

    defines mainly mapping of yield, demand based on the crop outcome and evaluation.
    The yield prediction can

    be defined from the earlier dataset and what type of latest technologies available
    and applicable on all the ways

    based on the current crop, climatic and financial situations for improving the
    yield. A study [28] used Tensor

    Flow with Convolutional Neural Networks and Linear Regression for estimating the
    yield from Sorghum field.

    3.4.6. Crop Quality. Crop quality is the way to finalize the crop outcome in the
    form of financial. Based

    on the final quantity of yield, minimal wastage and the quality of the crop after
    harvesting can be detected. As

    per these parameters, we can define the crop quality and also compare with the
    dataset. A study [29] connected

    different sensors to the drone to monitor the crop quality. This drone can monitor
    the crop, gives alert to the

    farmer when any issues identify on the crop.

    3.4.7. Weed Detection. Weed detection is the main problem on every crop, based
    on this the final yield

    defines. It is a very important threat on the crop that effects on the yield.
    Concerning the age of the plant and

    the weed, the stage needs to detect. Once we minimize the weed then only the yield
    will be good otherwise the

    fertilizers and the pesticides also not working on the crop. The work of the weed
    is to eat the whole energy of

    the soil. So the crop quantity will be by default minimum. Machine learning has
    many mechanisms to detect

    the type of weed on every crop and intimate. A study [30] used to Support Vector
    Machine and Conventional

    Neural Network for detecting Broad-leaf weed detection in the pasture from the
    images. Another study [23]

    used SVM, ANN and CNN for classifying the 4- different crops and 2- different
    weeds, but CNN gives better

    results compared with the remaining methods.

    3.5. Performance metrics. The best method is decided by using the accuracy. The
    method which has

    the highest accuracy is the best. The more accurate models can give the better
    decisions as an outcome. The

    following Table 3.1 shows different machine learning algorithms used in agriculture
    and with its accuracy.

    4. Conclusion. Machine learning is widely used in modern agriculture.

    In addition to the Machine

    learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence and robotics using much more
    for minimizing the manpower and

    manual mistakes and almost everything needs to do automation form sowing to harvesting
    the crops. Using

    the latest technologies and mechanisms for minimizing the manual mistakes for
    detecting the type of crop

    to pesticides selection concerning the dataset mapped. The use of machine learning
    in agriculture helps in

    the different sub areas like soil classification, disease detection, species management,
    water management, yield

    prediction, crop quality and weed detection processing also implanting with machine
    learning. In this paper our

    focus is to provide detailed survey about how various machine learning algorithms
    were used in different fields

    of modern agriculture. This paper provides a detailed comprehensive comparative
    analysis of various machine

    learning algorithms.

    \ is the main source of economic growth in many\nWest African countries. In recent\
    \ years, conventional agriculture has undergone a remarkable\nevolution and digital\
    \ technologies are widely used for different purposes. While the world is rapidly\n\
    using advanced digital technologies to grow their agriculture, Africa seems to\
    \ be lagging behind,\nespecially West Africa. To know how to contribute effectively,\
    \ it is important to know what is\nbeing performed about this issue. The objective\
    \ of this study is to examine the state of digital\nagriculture in ﬁve countries,\
    \ namely, Benin, Burkina Faso, Côte d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria. The\nstudy consisted\
    \ of an analysis of the scientiﬁc contributions of these countries and the cases\
    \ of actual\ndeployment. This is carried out by means of a bibliometric study\
    \ based on data collected from the\nWeb of Science and a comparative review of\
    \ the technologies used in the target countries using data\nfrom several sources,\
    \ such as IEEE, Scopus, Science Direct, Google Scholar, etc. The bibliometric\n\
    analysis based on 3249 publications revealed that research interests have increased\
    \ signiﬁcantly since\n2014. Climate change, machine learning (ML), and adoption\
    \ have been the hottest topics of discussion\nand most of the organizations working\
    \ on the topic are academic bodies. Moreover, a considerable\namount of the scientiﬁc\
    \ input was obtained from Nigeria, which is the most populous of the ﬁve\ncountries\
    \ considered. The survey on digital farming showed that publications in Nigeria\
    \ that address\ndeployment cases were focused on the internet of things (IoT),\
    \ wireless sensor networks, blockchain,\nand artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) technologies.\
    \ In Ghana, practical cases of blockchain, AI, and big data\ndeployment were observed,\
    \ while Burkina Faso focused on IoT and AI. In Côte d’Ivoire and Benin,\nthe deployment\
    \ cases generally focused on AI.\nKeywords: technologies; innovations; agriculture;\

    Digital agriculture is a kind of agriculture, which exploits modern technologies\
    \ to\ngain sustainable development in agriculture ﬁelds, such as crop production,\
    \ soil moni-\ntoring, livestock production and management, and ﬁsheries. The agriculture\
    \ sector is a\ndevelopment sector contributing to a large part of developing countries’\
    \ gross domestic\nproduct (GDP). Following the statistical predictions highlighted\
    \ in [1], the worldwide\npopulation will reach 8 billion by 2023 and nearly 10\
    \ billion by 2050. Therefore, the digital\ntransformation of agriculture is unavoidable\
    \ to meet food security requirements faced by\nworldwide countries in general\
    \ and emerging countries in particular.\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1067. https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture13051067\n\
    https://www.mdpi.com/journal/agriculture\nAgriculture 2023, 13, 1067\n2 of 15\n\
    Many technologies are used in numeric agriculture. We can quote the internet of\
    \ things\n(IoT), geographical information system (GIS), big data, artiﬁcial intelligence,\
    \ wireless sensor\nnetworks (WSNs), and blockchain. All of these technologies\
    \ have a speciﬁc and useful\napplication in digital agriculture. Furthermore,\
    \ they are sometimes jointly used to solve\nmany problems that analogue agriculture\
    \ induces. A considerable amount of research has\npreviously been performed on\
    \ these technologies [2]. While some researches discuss real\napplication cases\
    \ of some technologies, others present a bibliometric analysis of one or two\n\
    technologies in Africa. To the best of our knowledge, a gap in the scientiﬁc literature\
    \ exists\nregarding a review of technologies used in digital agriculture in West\
    \ African countries.\nWhat is the scientiﬁc research contribution of each of these\
    \ countries?\nWhich institutions have carried out the most work on the subject?\n\
    What are the most reliable sources to ﬁnd the right information on the subject?\n\
    What is really being carried out in terms of digital agriculture deployment in\
    \ each country?\nTo answer these questions, this paper presents a bibliometric\
    \ study of digital tech-\nnologies in agriculture and a literature review on these\
    \ technologies to help researchers,\ngovernment members, and farmers in the growing\
    \ sector. To achieve this work, related\nworks are ﬁrst presented on bibliometric\
    \ study and technology inventory, followed by the\nmethodology adopted to perform\
    \ this work. Then, the bibliometric study presentation and\nthe technologies’\
    \ review are presented. Thereafter, the main contribution of this work, and\n\
    the discussions and conclusions ﬁnalize the paper.\n2. Materials and Methods\n\
    2.1. Bibliometric Survey on Digital Agriculture\nIn the literature, many research\
    \ papers have addressed bibliometric studies focusing\non digital innovations\
    \ and technologies in agriculture [3]. In [4], the authors developed a\nliterature\
    \ review on the relationship between the IoT and agriculture from 2012 to 2019.\n\
    Through this study, they have shown the growing interest in the IoT for agriculture-related\n\
    applications. A literature review is also carried out to show the contribution\
    \ of the IoT to\nfood production [5]. In ref. [6], a literature review was conducted\
    \ on artiﬁcial intelligence\nand agriculture. To explore research on technology\
    \ adoption in agriculture and understand\nthe determinants of technology adoption\
    \ using models, such as the technology acceptance\nmodel, a bibliometric analysis\
    \ was conducted [7]. Annas et al. [8] conducted a literature\nreview on digital\
    \ innovation, data analysis, and resilience chain. In [9], Alireza Abdollahi\n\
    et al. carried out a literature review on sensor networks in agriculture from\
    \ 2020 to 2021.\nIn [10], through a systematic review, research contributions\
    \ on digitalization and big data\nin agriculture were explored, and in [11], research\
    \ on UAV and precision agriculture was\nassessed. However, today, digital technologies,\
    \ such as blockchain have demonstrated\ntheir ability to create visibility and\
    \ transparency across the supply chain through the\ndigitally distributed ledger,\
    \ smart contracts, and multilayered protection against ﬁnancial\nthreats [12,13].\
    \ While big data analytics is found to be useful in enhancing data processing\n\
    capacity, and thereby, responding to disruptive events [14,15]. Moreover, while\
    \ literature\nreviews have shown the contribution of IoT, it is difﬁcult to state\
    \ concretely, when talking\nabout digital agriculture, which technologies are\
    \ most used in the publications and how\nand where they are most used. Amongst\
    \ the important research, it is noted that very little\nliterature has carried\
    \ out a systematic comparative review of the contribution of different\ndigital\
    \ technologies in the ﬁeld. Therefore, this study ﬁrst relies on bibliometric\
    \ analysis as\nan ideal method to examine the current knowledge base underpinning\
    \ digital agriculture\nin the ﬁve target countries.\n2.2. Survey on Technologies\
    \ Used in Digital Agriculture\nIn 2019, the application of precision agriculture\
    \ has been investigated [16]. Precision\nagriculture deﬁnes a management strategy\
    \ that gathers, processes, and analyzes temporal,\nspatial, and individual data\
    \ and associates it with other data to support management\ndecisions according\
    \ to the estimated variability for improved resource use efﬁciency, pro-\nAgriculture\

    \ of agricultural production [17]. It exploits\nsensors and software to ensure\
    \ that the crops receive exactly what they need to optimize\nproductivity and\
    \ sustainability. In this work, IoT and WSN applications were highlighted.\nThe\
    \ focus is on wireless communication technologies, sensors, and wireless nodes\
    \ used to\nassess the environmental behavior, the platforms used to obtain spectral\
    \ images of crops,\nthe common vegetation indices used to analyze spectral images,\
    \ and applications of WSN\nin agriculture were highlighted. The main farming parameters\
    \ used in precision agriculture\ndevelopment are crops, i.e., soil nutrients,\
    \ the soil’s water level, wind speed, the intensity\nof sunlight, temperature,\
    \ humidity, and chlorophyll content. As precision agriculture (PA)\naims to generate\
    \ excess yield by enhancing the resources, such as fertilizers, water, and\npesticides,\
    \ it allows farmers to have an exact measure of resources for healthy crops. The\n\
    main lesson learned from this study is that IoT sensors and WSN technologies are\
    \ mainly\nused for PA. Generating the prescription map requires not only the vegetation\
    \ indices, but\nalso the soil properties and meteorological comportment.\nDuring\
    \ the same year (2019), IoT-based systems in agriculture and farming were\nreviewed\
    \ by presenting IoT software and hardware used in digital agriculture applications,\n\
    such as farming system monitoring, as well as greenhouse and precision agriculture\
    \ [18].\nThe authors of this paper describe the technical information existing\
    \ in an IoT system. The\nmain functions of wireless sensor nodes are sensing capability,\
    \ data processing capability,\ndata storage capacity, unlicensed radio-frequency\
    \ band communication capability, low\npower consumption, small size, and low cost.\
    \ The hardware part mainly contains sensors,\ndata acquisition units (DAQ units),\
    \ data processing units (DPUs), communication unit, and\npower supply unit. The\
    \ software part mainly includes the operating system, drivers for\nsensors and\
    \ actuators, and data networking stack.\nFurthermore, discussions have been carried\
    \ out on communication technologies, such\nas ZigBee, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi by\
    \ presenting their advantages and limitations. Finally,\nthe main challenges faced\
    \ by developing nations were discussed. We can quote the non-\nspreading of internet\
    \ access available throughout the country, the non-literacy of farmers\nin these\
    \ countries, and the threat of theft, damage, and vandalization of IoT devices.\
    \ All of\nthese challenges have slowed down the digital agriculture progress in\
    \ these countries.\nIn 2020, a literature review was performed on machine learning\
    \ techniques applied\nduring data processing in wireless sensor network-based\
    \ PA [19]. In particular, ML model\nfeatures have been investigated in many papers\
    \ for yield prediction, decision support for\nirrigation, and crop quality. Indeed,\
    \ farms, including IoT, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),\nand other technologies,\
    \ induce millions of data production on the ground daily. These\ndata should be\
    \ analyzed by farmers with the help of artiﬁcial intelligence for making better\n\
    decisions on forecasting and ensuring reliable management of sensors. In this\
    \ work, the\nvarious ML algorithms were presented in two categories, such as supervised\
    \ learning and\nunsupervised learning. The focus was on supervised learning as\
    \ an unsupervised learning\nalgorithm is used on exploratory applications where\
    \ there is no speciﬁc set goal or the\ninformation the data consists of is not\
    \ clear, whereas supervised learning exploits a known\nset of labelled data to\
    \ train a model to forecast the target variable for out of sample data.\nRegression\
    \ algorithms, such as decision trees, ensemble learning, Bayesian models, and\n\
    artiﬁcial neural networks (ANNs) are the most developed algorithms. These algorithms\n\
    are mainly used to predict temperature and humidity in a greenhouse environment,\
    \ to\npredict the type of crop to be grown using sensor data from soil pH, temperature,\
    \ and\nhumidity, and to anticipate crop dysfunction proactively; the farmer is\
    \ then notiﬁed with a\npossible remedy through smartphone, to analyze the sensor\
    \ data for forecasting suitable\ntemperature, humidity, and soil moisture of crops\
    \ in the future, to forecast and detect\npest/disease precisely using historical\
    \ and real-time sensor data.\nIn 2021, the industrial revolution was compared\
    \ to the agriculture revolution from tra-\nditional industry to modern industry\
    \ and traditional agriculture to modern agriculture [20].\nThe roadmap relative\
    \ to this comparison is presented in Figure 1, which indicates that\nindustry\
    \ and agriculture progress from mechanization to intelligence.\nAgriculture 2023,\

    \ agricultural progress is induced by industry progress. A literature re-\nview\
    \ was performed on the key enabling technologies, such as IoT, robotics, big data,\
    \ IA, \nand blockchain, which revolutionized digital agriculture. The focus was\
    \ on smart farming \napplications and the research challenges relative to them.\
    \ As many of them are used with \nthe agricultural production chain, these authors\
    \ discussed the relationship between the \ntechnologies’ application to digital\
    \ agriculture development. \nAs previously discussed, IoT collects and relays\
    \ data-to-data analytics and deep \nlearning for in-depth processing and analysis.\
    \ These authors investigated the literature \nreview on digital agriculture. They\
    \ mainly focused their research on IoT, big data, and \ndeep learning techniques\
    \ [22]. Application ﬁelds of each technology are studied. The data \ncollected\

    \ learning algorithms are \nhighlighted where deep learning is deﬁned as an important\
    \ branch of machine learning, \nwhich is trained on data sets and can detect patterns\
    \ and anomalies in data generated by \nsmart sensors. Moreover, big data technology\
    \ cannot be solely used in digital agriculture. \nIts exploitation requires important\
    \ data collection and assists farmers in being informed \nand making correct decisions\
    \ about farming practices and management. Challenges af-\nfecting the adoption\
    \ of these technologies are also studied, such as concerns about privacy \nand\
    \ trust, proﬁtability issues, lack of skills, cost challenges, lack of broadband\
    \ infrastruc-\nture, and technical challenges. In 2022, an investigation has been\
    \ carried out on digital \ntechnologies and services used to increase agriculture\
    \ productivity and sustainability in \nTanzania [23]. The digital technology varies\
    \ from simple mobile and web-based applica-\ntions, mostly for smallholders to\
    \ complex autonomous, information, and cyber-physical \nsystems used by large-scale\
    \ farmers. The main results from the literature review showed \nthat sustainable\
    \ development requires digital precision technologies. Adopting and man-\naging\
    \ technologies by small-scale farmers diﬀers from those of large-scale farmers.\

    \ and\ntechnical challenges. In 2022, an investigation has been carried out on\
    \ digital technologies\nand services used to increase agriculture productivity\
    \ and sustainability in Tanzania [23].\nThe digital technology varies from simple\
    \ mobile and web-based applications, mostly for\nsmallholders to complex autonomous,\
    \ information, and cyber-physical systems used by\nlarge-scale farmers. The main\
    \ results from the literature review showed that sustainable\ndevelopment requires\
    \ digital precision technologies. Adopting and managing technologies\nby small-scale\
    \ farmers differs from those of large-scale farmers. Moreover, the authors\nidentiﬁed\
    \ the digital solutions proposed in Tanzania for digital agriculture and the problems\n\
    farmers face with different services that slow down the development of digital\
    \ agriculture\nin this country.\nIn the same year, a systematic review was conducted\
    \ on IoT and WSN for sustainable\nsmallholder agriculture [24]. Indeed, smallholder\
    \ farms can be deﬁned as family-run,\nsmall farms that are often fragmented into\
    \ disjoint plots, are nature-dependent and have\nlimited operational budget, limited\
    \ information access and technology support, and often\ndisplay low production\
    \ levels. The main gaps in the utilization of these technologies,\nin this case,\
    \ have been highlighted, such as the problem of the literacy rate of farmers,\n\
    Agriculture 2023, 13, 1067\n5 of 15\nthe non-accessibility to information systems,\
    \ and the requirement of human presence to\nperform all activities. Most smallholder\
    \ farms usually practice farming based on natural\nbiophysical conditions for\
    \ crop growth, such as rain, and apply a mix of crop growing and\nlivestock breeding.\
    \ Nowadays, IoT and WSN technologies are used to increase productivity\nby assuming\
    \ the efﬁcient use of natural resources, such as water and sun, and monitoring\n\
    real-time crops and breeding health. Four areas constitute the application ﬁeld\
    \ of IoT\nand WSN in smallholder agriculture: Precision agriculture, weather monitoring\
    \ (WM),\npest and animal infestation monitoring (PAIM), and livestock management\
    \ (LM). This\nwork investigated the rate application of these technologies in\
    \ each ﬁeld. It has been\ndemonstrated that PA is the ﬁeld which records 60% of\
    \ publications, PAIM 16%, WM 1%,\nand LM 10%.\nFurthermore, the different sensor\
    \ types exploited in the works are studied and show\nthat the four main environment\
    \ properties are the most checked. There are soil moisture,\nhumidity, air, and\
    \ soil temperature. The additional parameters, such as light, motion, soil\nacidity,\
    \ air pressure, wind speed and direction, CO2 and solar radiation are also exploited.\n\
    The data collected by sensors are processed and analyzed using simple computation,\n\
    statistics, and machine learning. In this section, related work about a bibliometric\
    \ study\non digital agriculture and a survey on digital technologies are highlighted.\
    \ While some\npapers present two technologies, others present three technologies.\
    \ Moreover, we have\nnot identiﬁed papers that present a survey of many technologies\
    \ in conjunction with and\nrelated to many West African countries. The following\
    \ section shows the methodology\nused in this paper.\n2.3. Methodology\nTo contribute\
    \ to digital inclusion in agriculture in West Africa, particularly in Benin,\n\
    Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Ghana, and Nigeria, we assessed the current state\
    \ of innovation\nin each of these countries. We chose these countries since they\
    \ are involved in the AGRIDI\nproject (project for accelerating inclusive green\
    \ growth through agri-based innovation in\nWest Africa), an important project\
    \ for growing innovation of digital agriculture in West\nAfrica. For this purpose,\
    \ we adopted a mixed methodological approach. The primary\nobjective of this study\
    \ is to assess the status of countries and knowledge of digital agricul-\nture\
    \ research in West Africa. This type of analysis can be carried out through a\
    \ systematic\nanalytical technique that identiﬁes the most inﬂuential researchers,\
    \ their afﬁliations, the\nkeywords they choose and, most importantly, how academic\
    \ work relates to each other.\nThe bibliometric approach is appropriate for assessing\
    \ the current status of a particular\ndiscipline using different indicators, such\
    \ as highly cited publications, researchers, journals,\nacademic institutions,\
    \ and countries [25].\nFirst, we reviewed the related work on review studies on\
    \ digital agriculture. Second,\nthrough a quantitative approach based on bibliometric\
    \ data analysis, we identiﬁed key\nresearch, authors, and their relationship,\
    \ covering all publications related to a given topic\nor ﬁeld. All scientiﬁc contributions\
    \ to digital agriculture in West Africa were reviewed\nusing this search string.\
    \ The bibliometric search was performed on the Web of Science, and\nthe bibliometric\

    \ and MDPI. Published papers\nduring the last 5 years were selected from the bibliometric\
    \ study to perform a comparative\nanalysis of technologies used in the target\
    \ countries. In total, 468 scientiﬁc documents\nwere retrieved. First, ﬁltering\
    \ was performed to exclude articles based on title, the origin\nof the study,\
    \ and whether the innovation/technology is used in agriculture. A second\nﬁltering\
    \ was performed by reading the abstracts, keywords, and conclusions. In total,\
    \ after\nsorting, thirty papers dealing with practical cases of digital farming\
    \ deployment in the ﬁve\ncountries concerned allowed us to present the actual\
    \ state of evolution of the countries with\nregard to digital farming. Based on\

    \ reviewed for the target\ncountries. This selection is obtained using papers\
    \ recently published during the last 5 years\nand has shown that Nigeria has registered\
    \ many publications on this topic (mainly in IoT\nand wireless sensor networks,\
    \ blockchain, and AI). It is followed by Ghana, which has\nalso been published.\
    \ We can remember the following as a case study of the use of digital\ntechnologies\
    \ in West Africa.\nIn Benin, AI is used for crop production to predict soil properties.\
    \ AI is used for\nthe production of bananas, dry beans, cassava, rice, maize,\
    \ and seed cotton production\nin Burkina. It is used to predict weather data and\
    \ chemical data. Moreover, IoT sensors\nare used for ﬁsh species production, bananas,\
    \ and papayas production. They are used for\nmeteorological parameters sensing,\
    \ water pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and soil\nmoisture sensing. In Cote\
    \ d’Ivoire, AI monitors riverine water and increases sugarcane\nproduction. In\
    \ addition, this technology is used to manage and analyze weather data,\nchemical\
    \ data, the blockchain, AI, and big data. On the other hand, when Burkina Faso\
    \ and\nCote d’Ivoire published on IoT and AI, respectively, Cote d’Ivoire publications\
    \ were rainfall\ndata, temperature data, and sugarcane yields. In Ghana, AI manages\
    \ soil water storage\nin landscapes and crop yield prediction. Big data is mainly\
    \ used to collect data quality\nownership and accessibility. Blockchain handles\
    \ coca food and drug supply chains for\ntransparency, traceability, enhancement,\
    \ and mitigation of unethical activities. In Nigeria,\nAI is used for livestock\
    \ and crop management, water and soil management, and breeding.\nBlockchain is\
    \ used to create digital trust between agriculture stakeholders. IoT sensor\n\
    networks are used for livestock monitoring, remote control sensing, precision\

    \ note that while many\npapers discussed one of the emerging technologies for\
    \ digital agriculture in one or two\ncountries [28], other papers discussed two\
    \ technologies for digital agriculture in one\ncountry [44]. No paper has presented\
    \ a survey on all emerging technologies in digital\nagriculture. Furthermore,\
    \ no bibliometric study has been performed on digital agriculture\nin the ﬁve\
    \ countries. This work constitutes the basis for the researcher that would like\
    \ to\nperform research on a speciﬁc technology used in digital agriculture.\n\
    Agriculture 2023, 13, 1067\n12 of 15\n3.3. Lessons Learned\nThe analysis of the\
    \ status of digital agriculture across the ﬁve countries provides in-\nsights\
    \ into each country’s efforts in digital agriculture. There are many ongoing initiatives\n\
    in these countries to develop the sector. Most of the systematic analyses are\
    \ useful for only\none analysis: Bibliometric. However, in our research, we have\
    \ not only carried out biblio-\nmetric analysis, but also surveyed practical cases\
    \ of deployment in the countries considered.\nAs in [4], this study highlighted\
    \ the importance of research in IoT and machine learning.\nHowever, in contrast\
    \ to the developing countries presented in [54], technologies, such as\nblockchain\
    \ are not yet well developed in Africa. However, in line with the development\n\
    in [7], technology adoption is a topic of interest in the ﬁve countries considered.\n\
    The in-depth studies carried out after the literature review showed that by using\n\
    IoT-based solutions in agricultural production, many problems speciﬁc to the realities\
    \ of\nWest Africa can be solved, such as livestock theft and water pollution.\
    \ IoT, sensor networks,\nand artiﬁcial intelligence are exploited to develop intelligent\
    \ systems for crop and livestock\nfarm monitoring and to improve animal and plant\
    \ health care. The explosion of data\nscience and big data offers impressive tools\
    \ and models for predictive analysis. The wealth\nof data from agriculture and\
    \ its analysis can be harnessed to improve farming practices in\norder to increase\
    \ crop yields and reduce input costs. Machine learning implements very\nhigh-accuracy\
    \ models to make predictions on several aspects and prevent environmental\nhazards\
    \ and promote precision agriculture. The application of blockchain technology\n\
    makes the food supply chain more efﬁcient by tracking all transactions. These\
    \ innovations\nhave been proven and demonstrated by practical cases speciﬁc to\
    \ the realities of West\nAfrica in the literature. However, it must be noted that\
    \ in West African countries, despite\nthe potential of technologies and their\
    \ ability to boost the ﬁeld of agriculture, even though\nin real situations, the\
    \ technologies have had to prove themselves, agriculture remains more\ntraditional\
    \ than digital. Practical agricultural solutions are not popularized and deployed\n\
    in large-scale situations.\n4. Conclusions\nThis study was conducted to assess\
    \ the level of adoption of digital technologies in ﬁve\nWest African countries,\
    \ namely, Benin, Ghana, Burkina-Faso, Nigeria, and Côte d’Ivoire,\nwithin the\
    \ framework of the AGRIDI project. It consisted of a bibliometric analysis and\n\
    a systematic review of digital technologies in these countries. Then, a description\
    \ of the\ntechnologies adopted in these countries was presented. The study revealed\
    \ that digital tech-\nnologies used in agriculture include blockchain, the IoT,\
    \ big data, machine learning/deep\nlearning methods, etc. Nigeria is the most\
    \ advanced of the ﬁve countries in adopting digital\nagriculture technologies,\
    \ followed by Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire. Benin and Burkina Faso\nare ranked as countries\
    \ with minor use of digital technologies. While AI and big data are\nthe most\
    \ used technologies in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana, IoT and WSN are the most used\
    \ in\nNigeria. Applications of agriculture developed in the literature are related\
    \ to crops pro-\nduction (bananas, sugarcane, dry beans, cassava, rice, maize,\
    \ and seed cotton) monitoring,\nriverine water monitoring, livestock’s farm monitoring,\
    \ ﬁsh production monitoring, forest\nﬁre monitoring, food supply chains and drug\
    \ supply chains management, and tracking\ndroughts. This study highlights not\
    \ only the level of progress in digital agriculture in ﬁve\ncountries, but also\
    \ the key organizations working in the ﬁeld and the terms frequently\nused. This\
    \ work constitutes a reference for researchers interested in working in the sector\n\
    and a tool to help in seeking an improvement in digital agriculture. Further work\
    \ should\nbe carried out in West African countries on the digitalization of agriculture.\
    \ In the per-\nspective of this work, we will extend the study to other African\
    \ countries and not only\nstudy the technology, but also the strategies and policies\
    \ that are developed to promote the\ndevelopment of agriculture in Africa.\nAgriculture\

    Sensor Networks (WSN) in smart agriculture applications was analyzed. The main
    focus of the paper is on the power consumption of the various WSN components,
    on the both levels, physical and functional. The analysis, from the energy efficiency
    aspect, includes a comparative review and discussion of the most commonly used
    protocols on the physical, data link and network layers. The analysis outcome

    Sensor NetworksSmart agriculture 1. Introduction Since the great potential of
    IoT (Internet of things) in all aspects of the modern life has been widely recognized,
    sensors, wireless networks and software applications have become an important
    and valuable asset of modern agricultural infrastructure. Based on collected data,
    powerful analytical tools are able to provide information about optimal agro-technical
    measures necessary for ensuring optimal conditions of production and quality.
    Such an analysis of data, combined with inputs from other sources, can anticipate
    any danger that may occur, provide various insights and answers on what happened
    as well as recommendations on actions to be undertaken. In this paper, we provide
    a broader integrated view on energy consumption mechanisms in WSNs (Wireless Sensor
    Networks). We believe, it is beneficial for researchers and all those who are
    interested in practical implementation of WSNs, to know the major challenges and
    potential options in pursuit of energy efficiency improvement. Moreover, we cover
    the recent progress and provide an overview of the main communication stack protocols,
    primarily from energy efficiency perspective. Though, other network performance
    aspects as delay, overhead, throughput etc. are also taken into consideration.
    Contribution of this paper can be summarized as follows: (i) A detailed overview
    of the energy consumption in a WSN, along with identification of the main energy
    consumers on the both physical and functional level of a sensor node. (ii) A discussion
    and comparison of technical details of the widely used energy saving mechanisms
    built into the various protocols across the communication stack layers of a WSN.
    (iii) A simulation of the WSN operation by using the Cooja simulator, with a detailed
    analysis of the average power consumption and the average duty cycle for all the
    network nodes. (iv) An analysis of some additional elements important for design
    and implementation of an energy efficient WSN in smart agriculture applications.
    The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In Section 2 is presented architecture
    of a typical sensor node and an appropriate power consumption analysis. In Section
    3, a discussion and comparative analysis of the media access protocols in terms
    of the energy efficiency is provided. In Section 4, a detailed comparative analysis
    of the energy efficient routing protocols is presented. Section 5 contains simulation
    of a WSN operation in a smart agriculture application and discussion of the simulation
    outcomes from the energy efficiency point of view. Section 6 contains a discussion
    about some additional factors and their impact on design of an energy efficient
    WSN in a smart agriculture context. Section 7, summarizes the conclusions. 2.
    Sensor nodes Sensor nodes represent the sensing layer of a WSN. They typically
    continuously sense targeted physical parameters in a real-time manner. In the
    same way, they monitor working status and location of the equipment. As a result
    of sensing, sensor nodes periodically, or upon certain predefined events, generate
    information in the form of electrical signals. These signals are further processed
    and prepared for wireless transmission through the network to the sink node or
    base station, which is a central processing and controlling unit in a WSN. What
    is an event definition and how frequently readings of the monitored parameters
    are taken depends on the specific requirements of each agriculture application.
    Clearly, it is managed by application layer a WSN. In a practical realization,
    such as the one depicted in Fig. 1, a typical sensor node consists of a board
    that includes microcontroller, radio transceiver with antenna for communication
    with neighboring nodes, power supply, interfaces for programming and debugging,
    internal memory as well as external flash memory for storing sensor readings.
    On top of this, it includes a variety of typical sensors which are sometimes built
    in a separate module called sensor module. Some of them are used in agriculture
    applications, as such are sensors for air temperature and humidity, soil moisture,
    leaf wetness, atmospheric pressure, solar radiation, dendrometers, the soil temperature
    etc. Most of the sensor nodes run their own operating system developed for small
    form-factor, low-power embedded devices, such as for example TinyOS, Contiki,
    etc. They provide inter-processor communication with the radio and other components
    in the system, control power consumption, control attached sensor devices, and
    provide support for network messaging and other protocol functions (Selmic and
    Phoha, 2016). Download : Download high-res image (143KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 1. Blok diagram of a high-performance WSN node Imote2. Each of these
    logical and physical components needs energy to operate. Sensor nodes are typically
    powered by batteries with a limited lifetime and despite the fact that in the
    most cases the batteries are rechargeable, the problem of energy consumption in
    WSNs stays high on the researcher’s open topics agenda. Basically, the essence
    of problem with batteries lies in their lifetime and its potential impact on the
    both node’s and the entire WSN lifetime. Namely, by definition a sensor node’s
    lifetime is defined as the node’s operating time without the need for any external
    intervention, like battery replacement. A WSN lifetime can be defined as the lifetime
    of the shortest living critical node in the network (Nandini Mukherjee, 2016).
    However, depending on the network design, i.e. its resilience and robustness,
    as well as concrete agriculture application features, it can be defined as the
    lifetime of sink or some other main node in a WSN, which is – as already mentioned
    – in direct correlation with the batteries lifetime. Another potential problem
    is related to impact of batteries lifetime on node’s performance. Namely, when
    going toward the end of the battery lifetime, the nodes start degrading their
    performances, but do not necessarily stop working. They can support only some
    of their build-in functionalities (the radio can send, but not receive) or deliver
    faulty results – the sensors. Therefore, efficient power management in the sensor
    nodes is a critical factor for the network’s lifetime. In order to prolong a WSN
    lifetime, it is of crucial importance to reduce the energy consumption of the
    nodes as much as possible. How much energy a sensor node would need when running
    in a certain period of time depends mainly on the functionalities embedded in
    it. As reported in Forster (2016), the most power consuming ones are RF transceiver
    and flash memory components. Based on experimental results, a similar conclusion
    is reported in (Raghunathan et al., 2002). Moreover, the experimental results
    have shown that local computation or data processing consumes significantly less
    energy, the order being one thousandth of that required for transmitting single
    bit of data (Raghunathan et al., 2002); (Nandini Mukherjee, 2016). As an illustration,
    in Table 1 is given the nominal power consumption of a Tmote Sky sensor node (advanticsys.com).
    Though, the energy consumption of the sensing subsystems may be generally considered
    to be negligible, compared to other sensor node components, some particular types
    may end up requiring more energy. This could be the case, for example, with sensing
    modules that contains the atmospheric pressure sensor MPX4115A. Namely, due to
    its relatively large consumption compared to the other sensors, there is a recommendation
    this sensor to be powered independent from the other sensors on the Agriculture
    2.0 Board (libelium.com). Table 1. Nominal power consumption of Tmote Sky nodes.

    in WSN 3.1. The principles of energy efficiency in MAC protocols As already said,
    a major power consuming component of a sensor node is the radio. On the other
    hand, the radio is controlled by a MAC (Medium Access Control) protocol. Therefore,
    an efficient MAC protocol might increases the lifetime of a sensor network to
    a great extent and vice versa. In addition, the MAC protocol controls how the
    nodes share the wireless medium. Looking at the Table 1, it could be noted that
    sleep mode of a sensor node, as expected, is the least power consuming mode. This
    fact defines one of the three key criteria for designing a good Media Access Protocol
    (MAC): (i) maximize the throughput, (ii) minimize delay and (iii) save the energy.
    Additionally, in the case of WSNs, it needs to be able to switch off devices so
    nodes do not waste any valuable energy. On the other hand, there is another interesting
    fact, although not so intuitive and obvious. Namely, it says that node spends
    more energy listening the channel than while sending (Forster, 2016, Chand et
    al., 2015). Therefore, the time that node spends in listening mode needs to be
    minimized as much as possible. This is the fourth main design criteria for energy
    efficient medium access protocols. The above mentioned four criteria can be also
    expressed through the following four goals: (i) minimize collision, (ii) minimize
    overhearing, (iii) minimize idle listening and (iv) minimize overhead. Clearly,
    it is not realistic to expect that any solution could meet all four criteria to
    the same great extent. Some trade of is inevitable. However, the energy saving
    aspect of each of these four goals is significant and it is something we will
    briefly elaborate and discuss here: • The collision avoidance is supposed to work
    by shutting down the nodes around the sender and receiver. By minimizing collision
    the MAC protocol avoids resending packets, which saves the energy that would be
    spent on resending the packets. • By minimizing overhearing, a MAC protocol saves
    the energy in a way that minimizes the number of packets received by the nodes
    which are not the ultimate destination of these packages. Namely, these packets
    cause additional energy consumption by keeping the nodes in the receive instead
    of the sleep mode. The standard approach is adding a header with the destination
    address. • The idle listening refers to the mode when a node is just listening
    and nothing happens. Since the energy consumption is about the same in the listening
    and receive mode, it is clear that such a mode need to be minimized as much as
    possible. • The overhead refers to transmitted bits not carrying any user useful
    information. These bits are so called redundant bits, embedded in packets. Since
    for each bit when sent or received some valuable energy is spent, it is clear
    that this kind of energy spent need to be minimized. 3.2. The energy saving mechanisms
    in MAC protocols and its deployment in smart agriculture One of the simplest,
    yet efficient MAC protocols is Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocol (Forster,
    2016). It operates in the way that time is divided into rounds and rounds are
    divided into slots. Each node is then given sending control over one slot. The
    number of slots depends on the number of nodes in the network. The length of one
    slot and thus the length of a round depend on the technology used and on the expected
    length of the packets. In Nesa Sudha et al. (2011), a TDMA based MAC protocol
    was used to collect environmental data such as soil moisture and temperature of
    an irrigation system. In Raju Bhowmik and Ajita Pathak are presented simulation
    results of an energy efficient WSN with a TDMA based MAC protocol used for the
    greenhouse temperature monitoring. Equally simple, yet more efficient and powerful
    is Carrier Sense Media Access (CSMA) MAC protocol. Sender first listens on the
    shared channel and if it is free, it tries to send. Since the primary source of
    energy waste in these protocols is idle listening, in order to greatly save energy,
    so called duty cycling is widely adopted in WSNs. More precisely, it became a
    fundamental mechanism of the CSMA class of MAC protocols. In this technique, each
    node alternates between active and sleep states. Two nodes can communicate only
    when they are both active. In synchronous MAC protocols, neighboring nodes are
    synchronized to wake up at the same time. Therefore, the communication is facilitated
    and the focus is on the delay reduction and throughput improvement. Asynchronous
    MAC protocols, on the other hand, focus on how to efficiently establish communication
    between two nodes that have different active/sleep schedules (Huang et al.). Some
    of the most known duty cycling MAC protocols of this class are Sensor-MAC (S-MAC),
    Timeout-MAC (T-MAC) and Berkeley-MAC (B-MAC) also known as Low Power Listening
    (LPL). In (López et al., 2011) is proposed a WSN for monitoring horticultural
    crops that are distributed among small plots scattered at distances of up to 10 km
    from one another. The technology used for the practical implementation of the
    architecture is based on the B-MAC protocol for assuring a high degree of sensor
    node power autonomy. Nowadays, BoX-MAC (Moss and Levis, 2008) is considered the
    de-facto standard, although A-MAC (Dutta et al., 2010) is considered the best
    algorithm ever. BoX-MAC is not as complex as A-MAC. It is simple to understand
    and use, as well as it is already embedded in the most of the WSN operating systems.
    When it comes to the hardware level, IEEE 802.15.4 (IEEE, 2014) is a technical
    standard which defines the operation of Low-Rate Wireless Personal Area Networks
    (LR-WPANs) – part of the ZigBee standard. However, it does not offer any energy
    saving or sleeping options. ZigBee is a protocol stack with embedded CSMA collision
    avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol. It is widely used in practical implementations of
    the low-power, low data rate, and close proximity WSNs in the agriculture applications.
    An application in cultivating the potato crop by using a WSN based on the CSMA/CA
    is studied in (Sherine, 2013). In (Sahota et al., 2011) is proposed a new MAC
    protocol for which authors have reported improvement of 65% in energy efficiency
    compared to S-MAC protocol for the same level of throughput. 4. Energy efficient
    routing protocols in WSNs 4.1. The main requirements A routing protocol is an
    algorithm, which defines how exactly to route a packet from the source node to
    the destination. It uses one or more metrics, such as geographic location, number
    of hops, delivery delay etc. to evaluate the network conditions and to decide
    what to do. The main WSN routing protocol requirements are: • Energy efficiency:
    A routing protocol need to be able to cope with node sleep and to have as little
    as possible discovery and route management related overhead. • Flexibility: A
    protocol must be able to cope with nodes entering or exiting the network (e.g.,
    dead nodes or new nodes) and with changing link conditions (Forster, 2016). Routing
    highly depends on the MAC and link layer protocols. It is very sensitive to link
    quality – the more stable links are, the better the routing protocol works. 4.2.
    Geographic energy-aware routing protocols There are a couple of routing schemes
    based on geographic locations that are energy-aware and attempt to conserve energy.
    Geographic Adaptive Fidelity (GAF) routing is one of them. It combines the concepts
    of geographic location-based routing and hierarchical routing. GAF is able to
    substantially increase network lifetime (Xu et al., 2001). Geographic and energy
    aware routing (GEAR) uses an energy-aware metric in estimating the cost function
    to balance energy consumption that leads to an energy-efficient network (Yu et
    al., 2001). The wireless sensor network employing Hierarchical power-aware routing
    (HPAR) (Li et al., 2001) is assumed to be divided into zones that comprise sensor
    nodes in geographic proximity. Each zone decides on the hierarchical routing used
    for its data across other zones. The routing path is chosen in the way that total
    remaining power of all the nodes in the path is the maximum over all minimum of
    the remaining power. This path is called the max–min path. Another algorithm proposed
    in Li et al. (2001), the zone-based routing, finds a global path across zones
    based upon the max–min zPmin algorithm. Zone level power estimates are used for
    routing a message. A global controller manages the zones. Zone-based routing is
    able to drastically reduce the running time to find a route. Also within each
    zone the local routing path is computed in such a way that it does not decrease
    the overall power level of the zone. 4.3. Clustering based energy efficient routing
    protocols The work in (Pramanik et al., 2014) presents an analysis and comparison
    of a number of energy-efficient routing protocols. Low Energy Adaptive Clustering
    Hierarchy (LEACH) is a routing protocol in which not all sensor nodes have to
    send data to the base station or the sink. This saves power consumption since
    data from sensor nodes are sent only to respective cluster-heads. Thus, cluster-heads
    consume more energy than other nodes. Hence, the role of a cluster-head is rotated
    among the nodes in a cluster. The feature of selecting cluster-heads and reselecting
    them at regular intervals saves energy. Another important feature adopted by a
    non-cluster-head node is sending data only during its scheduled transmission slot
    and then turning its radio off – going into sleep mode. All these features help
    conserve energy and increase network lifetime. The PEGASIS, power-efficient gathering
    in sensor information systems (Lindsey and Raghavendra, 2002), is a near-optimal
    protocol. Though PEGASIS does not have any clustering overhead, it has to manage
    topology dynamically. This is because a sensor node must know the energy status
    of its neighbors and route its data accordingly. However, PEGASIS scores over
    LEACH in the way that it eliminates dynamic cluster formation, limits transmissions
    to the base station, and introduces data aggregation. The PEGASIS distributes
    energy load among the nodes and thus increase the lifetime and quality of the
    network. The TEEN (threshold-sensitive energy-efficient sensor network) protocol
    has certain features in common with LEACH, for example, rotation of cluster-heads.
    Energy conservation results from clustering. The setting of different threshold
    levels in TEEN also saves power because the transmission of data depends on threshold
    levels. The APTEEN (adaptive periodic threshold-sensitive energy-efficient sensor
    network) protocol is an improvement over TEEN. Both APTEEN and LEACH follow TDMA
    schedules and hence their radios are turned off when not in use and this also
    saves energy. Simulation experiments of TEEN and APTEEN show that both outperform
    LEACH. TEEN, however, gives best performance among these three. The APTEEN performance
    level is somewhere between those of LEACH and TEEN with respect to energy dissipation
    and network lifetime (Nandini Mukherjee, 2016). There are many routing techniques
    that are designed with the aim of optimizing or even minimizing energy consumption
    of the sensor nodes. A protocol called Equalized Cluster Head Election Routing
    Protocol (ECHERP), which pursues energy conservation through balanced clustering,
    is proposed in (Nikolidakis et al., 2013). Capitalizing on it, a scheme based
    on the collaboration of an integrated system for automated irrigation management
    has been proposed in (Nikolidakis et al., 2015). It models the network as a linear
    system and, using the Gaussian elimination algorithm, calculates the combinations
    of nodes that can be chosen as cluster heads in order to extend the network lifetime.
    4.4. Routing protocols exploiting data aggregation In smart agriculture and environment
    monitoring applications sensing data from neighboring nodes are usually spatially
    correlated (Gao et al., 2010). Therefore, data aggregation has been naturally
    considered as an essential tool to integrate such data to reduce redundancy and
    minimize the number of transmissions, resulting in lowered energy consumption
    (Krishnamachari et al., 2002). There are studies that combine data aggregation
    with other techniques to save energy, e.g. with cluster-based routing (Heinzelman
    et al., Oct. 2002), channel assignment (Yen and Lin, 2009) and power scheduling
    (Eun et al., Sept. 2006). Virtual grid architecture (VGA) routing (Al-Karaki et
    al., 2004) builds clusters. Each cluster has a cluster head and data aggregation
    is performed at the both local (cluster) and global level. It uses a various algorithms
    for optimal selection of the local and global aggregation points. Some of them
    maximizing network lifetime are integer linear programming (ILP), genetics algorithm-based
    heuristics, k-means heuristic, greedy heuristic and clustering-based aggregation
    heuristic (CBAH) (Al-Karaki and Kamal, 2004). Simulation results show that CBAH
    outperforms LEACH and PEGASIS with respect to network lifetime. At the same time,
    it also achieves acceptable latency without sacrificing quality (Nandini Mukherjee,
    2016). 5. The simulation In order to illustrate the significance of the duty cycle
    mechanism in WSNs, from the energy saving perspective, we have simulated a WSN
    operation by using the Contiki’s Cooja simulator, which is one of the most popular
    open source platforms used for WSN simulations. The simulated WSN consists of
    11 Tmote Sky’s CC2420 ultra low power IEEE 802.15.4 compliant wireless sensor
    modules and operates in a strong multipath fading channel environment. The network
    diagram including the arrangement of the nodes and 10 m background greed is shown
    in Fig. 2. As a routing protocol is used the RPL (IPv6 based Routing Protocol
    for Low power and Lossy Networks). The air temperature sensors of the green colored
    nodes are continuously sensing and sending the information to the yellow colored
    sink node, positioned in the center of the covered area. It is assumed that the
    sink node is powered by an ideal power source delivering a constant voltage of
    3 V and an unlimited amount of current. Within the simulation scenario, we have
    measured the average energy consumption and the radio activity duty cycle periods
    of the sensor nodes during the network simulation runtime. Moreover, we have run
    the simulation for two popular asynchronous MAC protocols available in ContikiOS
    that aim at energy saving, CX-MAC and ContikiMAC, and compared their results,
    whereas all the other elements of the network and operating conditions remain
    identical. Download : Download high-res image (120KB) Download : Download full-size
    image Fig. 2. The diagram of the simulated network with 10 m background greed.
    As it could be seen in the Fig. 3, in the case of the ContikiMAC protocol, the
    average radio duty cycle per node is around 0.9%, which results in a tremendous
    energy saving, while in the case of the CX-MAC protocol it is around 6%. Therefore,
    from the energy saving perspective, we could say that the ContikiMAC protocol
    provides better results than the CX-MAC protocol. Though, it is important to highlight
    that in the case of no duty cycle mechanism implemented, as we have discussed
    in the Section 3, the active period of the sensor nodes would be around 100%,
    which means that their radio components would be permanently on during the network
    runtime, which would result in a huge waste of the energy. Download : Download

    in the Fig. 7. The focus of this paper is on the first three phases, i.e. the
    environment input and requirements, analysis and planning, and design phases.
    We are not going to discuss the rest of the implementation life cycle phases,
    since they are predominantly subjects of the project management and related methodologies.
    Moreover, the project management tools that facilitate project development and
    implementation are usually available within an integrated development environment
    that comes with the wireless microcontroller modules. On the other hand, the construction
    phase is realized by usage of the wireless microcontroller modules compliant with
    a number of wireless communication standards and protocols. These modules are

    Fig. 7. A block diagram of the WSN implementation life cycle. Since our focus
    is on the first three phases, next to each of them are highlighted details that
    should be carefully analyzed within that particular phase. Thus, next to the block
    representing the environment input and requirements phase are listed some of the
    key inputs and environment related details that need to be included into the requirements
    document. Then, next to the block representing the analysis and planning phase
    are listed factors which must be thoroughly analyzed and objectively estimated.
    Output of this phase is crucial for making the right choices on important topics
    concerning the network design. Hence, the most interesting is the design phase,
    where actually all features and attributes of the future WSN are determined, such
    as the Radio frequency (RF) range, network topology, network clustering, node
    density, power distribution across nodes, applied medium access and routing protocols,
    error controlling schemes, modulation and demodulation schemes, encoding and decoding
    methods etc. Apart from the protocols and mechanisms we have discussed within
    the previous sections of this paper, as stated above, in the rest of this section
    we are going to discuss some additional elements impacting design of the energy
    efficient WSN in the smart agriculture applications. Although, the most of these
    elements have a multiple impact on the solution design, we will focus on those
    impacts that are more significant. The environment characteristics of the agriculture
    fields might significantly shape the multipath fading channel model, which consequently
    impacts the link reliability. The Bit Error Rate (BER) is a good indicator of
    the link reliability. It is directly proportional to the both received signal-to-noise
    ratio (SNR) (Es/N0) and the output transmitter power level Pout. Therefore, a
    reliable data communication in WSN can be provided either by increasing the output
    transmit power (Pout) or by using a suitable error control scheme. Since a sensor
    node has limited power resources an optimal error control strategy has to be applied
    in the WSN. In general, there are two types of such schemes: Forward Error Correction
    (FEC) and Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ). The usefulness of ARQ schemes in multi-hop
    sensor networks is limited due to additional retransmission energy cost and overhead.
    On the other hand, additional processing power that goes into encoding and decoding
    in FEC schemes is something that must be taken into account. In Nandi (2011),
    based on the simulation results it is observed that WSN energy efficiency degrades
    and the energy requirement increases significantly in presence of Rayleigh fading.
    Clearly, this observation is valid in general, i.e. for all types of the fading
    channels. The simulation results have also revealed that FEC schemes provide higher
    energy efficiency compared to ARQ schemes under same network conditions and packet
    size. Moreover, it is observed that required energy in FEC schemes decreases with
    increase in the packet length, while in ARQ schemes required energy increases
    with increase in the packet length. In accordance with all the above stated, another
    option in improving the link reliability, i.e. reducing the BER, might be shortening
    the distance between the nodes. Namely, a targeted SNR could be achieved either
    by increasing the output transmitter power for a given distance between the nodes
    or vice versa, by shortening the distance between the nodes for the same given
    output transmitter power. This option and error control scheme are mutually complementary
    and might be applied together. Shortening the distance between the network nodes
    impacts the node density in a WSN, i.e. the total number of nodes for a given
    size of the area to be covered. An example of calculating the number of sensor
    nodes required for precise potato farming, for a given size, shape and environment
    characteristics of the field is given in (Sherine, 2013). Another important topic
    impacting WSN design, closely connected with the previous one, is moving of the
    sensor nodes. Namely, it has been proven in the theory of wireless communications
    that moving nodes are exposed to an enhanced fading severity which is positively
    correlated with the velocity of the nodes. The network topology is also to a certain
    extent conditioned by the above discussed environment characteristics, and a number
    of other factors such as locations and number of the sensor, the RF module range,
    the type of the information sent to the base station, estimated volume of the
    traffic etc. There are three main types of network topology: star, mesh and star-mesh
    hybrid topology. The star topology takes advantage of the low power consumption.
    The advantage of the mesh topology is that if a sensor node fails, communication
    is possible via other nodes that are within the communication range, while the
    major disadvantage is that this topology uses more power due to redundant data
    transmission. The star-mesh topology combines the advantages of the both types.
    As a rule, nodes at the edge of the network are usually low-energy nodes, while
    nodes at the heart of the mesh have higher power since they typically forward
    messages between large numbers of nodes and serve as gateway nodes. In some cases
    it is recommended to organize nodes of the WSN in clusters. That could be the
    case of a large area, with large number of sensor nodes, especially when the area
    consists of several scattered parcels. In such cases, the sensor nodes would be
    organized into clusters and a clustering algorithm is needed to address the energy
    efficiency and load balancing of the WSN. Some of them we have discussed in Section
    4. Within the analysis phase, it should be also investigated are there in a relatively
    close proximity, e.g. on the neighboring parcels, already deployed WSNs. This
    is important due to possible interferences that might come from the neighboring
    WSNs. The interferences would further increase BER, cause higher power consumption
    of the nodes, and therefore additionally degrade the WSN energy efficiency. Along
    with worsened energy efficiency, the interferences negatively impact other network
    parameters important for its normal operation, such as delay, throughput etc.
    This information is valuable when deciding on many parameters, such as transmission
    band, i.e. the frequency range to be used for the signal transmission, distribution
    of the transmission power per nodes, the network node density, selection of the
    FEC scheme etc. The similar conclusions are valid in the case of high-voltage
    lines which also might impact negatively, on a very similar way, the future WSN.
    7. Conclusion In this paper we have performed a comprehensive analysis of WSNs
    from the energy efficiency point of view. Additionally, we have simulated a WSN
    in a smart agriculture application. The outcome of the both of these confirmed
    that the radio components of the network nodes while an active mode are the main
    power consumers in WSNs. The rest of the physical components of a sensor node
    are characterized by a significantly lower consumption. Additionally, it is confirmed
    that the main mechanism for reducing the consumption in the network nodes is the
    duty cycle mechanism. By simulating two different duty cycle mechanisms available
    within the Cooja simulator in the considered scenario, we came to the fact that
    ContikiMAC performs better then the CX-MAC and is able to reduce the time the
    radio is spending in active mode to around 0.9% of total operation time, which
    is around six times less than in the case of the CX-MAC protocol. That results
    in a tremendous energy savings in the simulated WSN. The other factors which have
    to be taken into consideration during the design and deployment of a WSN in the
    smart agriculture applications are also analyzed as well as their mechanisms of
    influence on the power consumption as a final consequence. In future designs of
    WSN one should consider artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic systems in
    order to improve control strategies of WSN (Mohammadhassani et al., 2014, Sedghi

    2023, 2023080451. https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202308.0451.v1 Abstract The
    global agricultural sector is increasingly pressured to adopt sustainable practices
    and reduce its environmental impact. In this context, greenhouses play a crucial
    role in enabling year-round crop production, ensuring food security, and minimizing
    reliance on traditional open-field farming. However, the energy consumption associated
    with greenhouse operations poses a significant challenge to achieving sustainability
    goals. As a result, there is a growing emphasis on transitioning greenhouses towards
    near-zero energy consumption. Near-zero energy consumption in greenhouses refers
    to the ambitious objective of minimizing energy usage to the greatest extent possible
    while maintaining optimal growing conditions for crops. This goal encompasses
    reducing energy consumption for heating, cooling, lighting, and other operational
    needs, as well as exploring renewable energy sources to power greenhouse operations.
    This review article offers a comprehensive overview of greenhouse energy consumption,
    with the main goal of analyzing the present situation, identifying key challenges,
    exploring potential opportunities, and proposing future perspectives for decreasing
    energy usage in greenhouse environments. As the focus on sustainable agricultural
    practices grows, the need to reduce energy consumption in greenhouses becomes
    increasingly important. The review critically examines current technological models
    and strategies applied in smart greenhouse applications, as well as the monitoring
    of microclimatic conditions inside the greenhouse, encompassing factors such as
    temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, soil quality, and crop cultivation. Moreover,
    it aims to present existing literature that investigates the advancement of greenhouses
    toward achieving significant reductions in energy consumption. Keywords Smart

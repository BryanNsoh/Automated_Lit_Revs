    Publisher: IEEE Conference Location: Vellore, India SECTION 1. Introduction At
    present, water use is growing at more than twice the rate of population increases.
    Due to the shortage of water resources, we need water saving irrigation technology
    for agriculture. Irrigation is a scientific process to supplying water to the
    agriculture land that is being cultivated. The dry regions having very little
    amount of water and that has to be utilized very efficiently. In conventional
    water irrigation system is wasting the water and drip irrigation systems use 20-30%
    less water than conventional watering methods. Therefore, the conventional method
    can be replaced by drip irrigation technology [1]. A new idea for saving each
    drops of water by the way to test the soil conditions before supplying water to
    the crop fields. This mechanism will reduce the workload of the cultivator and
    help maintain suitable soil conditions for the better crop production [2]. Hence
    the technology advancement is possible to design systems that eradicate the direct
    involvement of the cultivator with respect to irrigation of their fields. For
    the sustainable use of water resources, the rainwater is generally stored in a
    rainwater tank and it is used for irrigation or directed to recharge groundwater.
    Firstly the rainwater is used for agriculture in rainy seasons and the well or
    bore well water is used for other times. The crop growth rate (CGR) can also monitored
    using the IR transmitter and receiver system. The whole sensor network has analyzed
    by the microcontroller and sends the sensors information to irrigation control
    centre (ICC) through Zigbee technology. Zigbee technology has low cost, low power
    consumption and wireless communication which could replace the wired connections
    in the traditional system. In ICC, the entire drip irrigation is controlled by
    the electromagnetic actuators. The ICC has two technologies one is global system
    for mobile communication and secondary one is the ARM controller. This GSM facility
    serves as an important part for controlling the drip irrigation which sending
    the results to the cultivator using SMS to a mobile device [3], [4]. Then the
    user controls the entire agriculture irrigation system through SMS. The controller
    works as a central core for operation of the automated process which is initiated
    by the sensor networks. Based on the crop field conditions the ARM controller
    used in ICC is activates the drip irrigation system and their respective valves
    [2]. SECTION II. System Architecture In the automated system, the human factor
    is reduced by a microcontroller which is specially programmed to monitor any parameter
    changes in sensors. The function of microcontroller depends on the data of sensors
    from crop field units and the corrections are made by control devices in the irrigation
    system until the desired performance to be attained. This automatic system can
    also be stopped in case of rain, cyclone and crop cutting time, etc by the cultivator
    through SMS. Fig.1. Remote monitoring and closed loop irrigation system Show All
    The remote monitoring and closed loop irrigation system is shown in Fig. 1 which
    consisted of three components: a remote sensor node, a system control module called
    ICC, and a GSM mobile device. The amount of water required for a crop varies in
    various growth stages, different in soils and climate changes. The sensor node
    is placed in each crop field which is continuously collect soil parameters and
    crop growth. The sensor node consists of soil moisture sensor, humidity sensor,
    temperature sensor, IR transceiver, Zigbee transceiver and microcontroller. The
    value of air humidity is important for the correct growth of plants and high air
    temperature leads to affect the crop yields. High soil moisture will produce high
    evaporation and reduced the nutrient uptake. The soil parameters and crop growth
    status are collected by microcontroller and send these data to irrigation control
    centre through Zigbee wireless serial communication technology. In irrigation
    control centre (ICC), the soil parameters, crop growth status, cultivator''s control
    information from GSM are analyzed by the microcontroller. The ICC consists of
    motor driver unit, solenoid values with driver, LCD module, Zigbee transceiver,
    GSM module and microcontroller. The sensor measurements are transmitted to ICC
    by sensor node and are received through Zigbee transceiver. The electric solenoid
    irrigation valves should be installed at the closest point possible to outlet
    of pump set, that is, the location where you tap in for the irrigation system.
    ICC turns on the pump according to soil parameters. The valves are operated by
    12V driver circuit by the controller which integrates all the environmental information
    through suitable control algorithms. The gateway allows the activation of automated
    irrigation when the threshold values of soil moisture, air temperature and humidity
    are reached. The system provides the details about the agriculture farm to cultivator
    though SMS by GSM and the same information are display on LCD screen. The cultivator
    can also sends the control command to ICC through SMS, after processing displayed
    it on the LCD screen. SECTION III. System Components A. Software Portion The choice
    of a programming language for microcontrollers normally the C language, and most
    commercially available microcontrollers have C language compilers for the development
    of their programs. The closed loop irrigation system [5] is developed by the MPLAB
    compiler and KEIL μVISION4 Compiler. The MPLAB compiler consists of an integrated
    development environment for the windows operating system and supports the entire
    line of PIC microcontrollers [6]. The new KEIL μVISION4 by ARM IDE is to enhance
    developer''s productivity, user friendly, faster, flexible window management system,
    efficient program development and support for multiple monitors. PROTEUS allows
    designing for circuit simulation. It has a range of simulator models for popular
    micro-controllers and is possible to simulate complete micro-controller systems.
    The first task of the program is to transmit field parameters to ICC via Zigbee
    protocol. The PIC microcontroller in sensor node has pickup all the sensors information
    one by one and stored it in memory. This information is send to ICC through Zigbee
    wireless transmission. Second, the ARM microcontroller in ICC receives the data
    package transmitted by sensor node. These soil moisture, air humidity and temperature
    data are processed by the algorithm that compared with the threshold value that
    already stored in memory. Then it activates the irrigation pumps and respective
    solenoid values. Finally, these sensor node data and a crop growth status are
    transmitted at each predefined time to a user mobile device through SMS via the
    GSM in real time. Whenever the cultivator needs the information about the crop
    field, they can give the missed call to ICC''s GSM module [7]. The crop fields
    data are also send to LCD Screen. B. Hardware Portion Smart senor node is implements
    four types of measurements via sensors which are soil moisture, air humidity,
    air temperature and crop growth. The Soil Moisture Sensor is used to measure the
    volumetric water content of soil [8], [9], [10]. The SM150 measures volumetric
    soil moisture content with 3% accuracy. The output dc voltage range of the sensor
    is 0V to 1.5V. The temperature sensor AD594 is capable of measuring −55 to +125
    degrees centigrade. The AD594 has a positive and negative source input. In order
    to receive 0 to +125 degrees centigrade, the negative input pin has to be grounded.
    The AD594 gives a linear DC output voltage in the range of 0V to 1.25V. The soil
    humidity is measured according to the principle of electric resistance. The humidity
    sensor module SY-HS-220 converts the relative humidity to the output voltage.
    The storage humidity is within 95%RH and standard output is 1.9mV at 25 degree
    and 60%RH. The IR transmitter and receiver pair can be easily made using 555 Timer,
    IR LED and TSOP1738 IR Receiver. The four set of IR transmitter and receiver are
    used to measure the four stages of crop growth. The microcontroller used in sensor
    node system is PIC18F4550 which is 8-bit microcontroller from PIC18 family. It
    is based on 16-bit instruction set architecture and it consists of 32 KB flash
    memory, 2 KB SRAM and 256 Bytes EEPROM. It has five I/O ports (PORTA, PORTB, PORTC,
    PORTD and PORTE). PORTB and PORTD have 8 pins to transmit/receive 8-bit I/O data.
    It can work on different internal and external clock sources range of frequency
    from 31 KHZ to 48 MHZ. The PIC18F4550 has four timers units, ADC, with enhanced
    communication protocols like USART, SPI I2C and USB. The LPC2148 micro-controller
    is used in ICC which is 32/16 bit ARM7TDMI-S CPU core. They have real-time emulation
    and micro-controller with embedded high speed flash memory of 512 KB. It has USB
    2.0 full speed device, multiple UARTS, SPI, SSP to I 2 Cs . Various 32-bit timers,
    dual 10-bit ADC(s), single 10-bit DAC, PWM channels and 45 fast GPIO lines with
    up to nine edge or level sensitive external interrupt pins, tiny size and low
    power consumption make these microcontrollers particularly suitable for industrial
    control and medical systems. GSM module SIM900 engine works on frequencies EGSM
    900 MHZ, DCS 1800 MHZ and PCS 1900 MHZ. This GSM modem is coming with RS232 interface,
    which allows to directly connecting with microcontroller through only two wires
    (TX, RX). This modem can be used to sending SMS, data and read SMS through simple
    AT commands. CC2500 Zigbee RF Module is a transceiver module which provides easy
    to use RF communication at 2.4 GHZ. It can be used to transmit and receive data
    at 9600 baud rates from any standard CMOS/TTL source and works in half duplex
    mode [11]. Solenoid valve is an electromechanical valve. The valve can be controlled
    by an electric current through a solenoid operates at 12V/500mA, in the case of
    a two-port valve the flow is switched off or on. SECTION IV. Experimental Study
    The output of temperature sensor (AD594) is connected with the analog input of
    PIC microcontroller. The calculation of temperature in degree Celsius is expressed
    as, T( ∘ C)=(( ADC value ∗ 5V)/1023 ) ∗ 100 View Source . The predicting growth
    stage is based on the Development Index Model (DVI), which is used throughout
    field to estimate the growth stage by means of daily temperature (DT). DVI= ∑
    planting date est date 100 A (1− e −B( T i −C))) View Source Where Ti is the DT
    (°C) on the ith day after cropping, and A, B, C are determined by the plant variety
    and the region. The solution of equation represents the speed with the crop grows,
    determined by the DT. In day-by-day to calculate the DVI value which represents
    the growth stage. The DVI value is 0 at planting, and parameters A, B, C are determined
    in order to set DVI value =100 on the day of heading. The table I shows the air
    temperature, soil temperature, relative humidity and soil moisture from day-1
    to day-12 [12]. Fig. 2 shows the relationship between air and soil temperature
    from day-l to day-12. It is clear that the soil temperature varies higher than
    the air temperature [13]. Fig. 3 shows the relationship between relative humidity
    and soil moisture in (%). The upper and lower limits of water storage in the soil
    reservoir and relative humidity have been determined in the crop field. Fig. 2.

    valve unit is energized. The level of soil water content goes above 30%, the motor
    will be turned off and respective valve unit is de-energized. SECTION V. Conclusion
    The remote monitoring and closed loop irrigation system has been developed and
    successfully implemented in the agriculture farm. The real time information is
    gathering from senor node about the crop field which is transmitted wirelessly
    through Zigbee. The sensor values are passed into the controller and it controls
    the water resources utilization effectively. The GSM interface is helpful for
    the cultivator to receive notifications of the events occurring in the field and
    growth rate of crop. The current values of all parameters are also updated on
    LCD display. Using this system, one can save manpower, water and power consumption
    is reduced by 20% and 30% when compared to existing method. In future, other important
    soil parameters namely soil pH , soil electrical conductivity will also be incorporated
    in the system. The system will investigate leakage in pipe network, filters blockage
    in head control, and distribution of fertilizer in time. The project will allow
    for improving the efficiency of the irrigation process. ACKNOWLEDGMENT I would
